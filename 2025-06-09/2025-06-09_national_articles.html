                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd. Tensions in Los Angeles escalated Sunday as thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to President Donald Trump's extraordinary deployment of the National Guard, blocking off a major freeway and setting self-driving cars on fire as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd. President Donald Trump told reporters as he prepared to board Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey, Sunday that there were “violent people” in Los Angeles “and they're not gonna get away with it.” National Guard troops were seen in Los Angeles early Sunday on orders from President Donald Trump in response to clashes in recent days between federal immigration authorities and protesters seeking to block them from carrying out deportations. Members of the National Guard faced off with protesters in Los Angeles on Sunday, and tear gas was fired at a growing crowd that gathered outside a federal complex hours after the federal troops arrived in the city on President Donald Trump's orders.

EDS NOTE: OBSCENITY A flash bomb explodes on the 101 Freeway near the metropolitan detention center of downtown Los Angeles, Sunday, June 8, 2025, following last night's immigration raid protest. ▶ Follow live updates on the protests in Los Angeles “We don't take lightly to the president abusing his authority and unlawfully mobilizing California National Guard troops” state Attorney General Rob Bonta told reporters. He planned to seek a court order declaring that Trump's use of the Guard was unlawful and ask for a restraining order to halt the deployment. The streets of the sprawling city of 4 million people were quiet Monday morning, but the smell of smoke hung in the air downtown, one day after crowds blocked off a major freeway and set self-driving cars on fire as police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades. Bonta accused Trump of fanning protesters' anger with his announcement of the deployment, which was followed Sunday by clashes with law enforcement in downtown Los Angeles. While much of the city was spared from any violence, clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places. It could take days to clear the debris from burned cars and to clean off or paint over graffiti sprayed on City Hall and other buildings near the detention facility. Later, at a White House event, he added that state leaders “were afraid to do anything.” U.S. officials said about 1,000 National Guard members were in the city under federal orders by midday Monday. Many protesters dispersed as evening fell and police declared an unlawful assembly, a precursor to officers moving in and arresting those who refuse to leave. Some of those who stayed threw objects at police from behind a makeshift barrier. Others hurled chunks of concrete, rocks, electric scooters and fireworks at California Highway Patrol officers and their vehicles parked on the closed southbound 101 Freeway. Officers ran under an overpass to take cover at one point. Writing on his social media platform, Truth Social, the president accused Newsom and the city's mayor, Karen Bass, of lying by saying Guard troops were not necessary. Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said officers were “overwhelmed” by the remaining protesters. He said they included regular agitators who show up at demonstrations to cause trouble. The governor, who was was in Los Angeles meeting with local law enforcement and officials, also told protesters that they were playing into Trump's plans and would face arrest for violence or property destruction. Don't give him the excuse he's looking for.” The deployment appeared to be the first time in decades that a state's National Guard was activated without a request from its governor, a significant escalation against those who have sought to hinder the administration's mass deportation efforts. McDonnell pushed back against claims by the Trump administration that the LAPD had failed to help federal authorities when protests broke out Friday after a series of immigration raids. Newsom, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that California authorities had the situation under control. He mocked Trump for posting a congratulatory message to the Guard on social media before troops had even arrived in Los Angeles, and he told MSNBC that Trump never floated deploying the Guard during a Friday phone call. “It's a bald-faced lie for Newsom to claim there was no problem in Los Angeles before President Trump got involved,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement. National Guard troops stood shoulder to shoulder Sunday morning in LA, carrying long guns and riot shields as protesters shouted “shame” and “go home.” After some demonstrators closely approached the Guard members, another set of uniformed officers advanced on the group, shooting smoke-filled canisters into the street. Minutes later, the Los Angeles Police Department fired rounds of crowd-control munitions to disperse the protesters, who they said were assembled unlawfully. Nearby, at least four self-driving Waymo cars were set on fire, sending large plumes of black smoke into the sky and exploding intermittently. By evening, police had shut down several blocks of downtown Los Angeles. Flash-bang grenades echoed out every few seconds into the evening. The next day, they were staging at a Department of Homeland Security office near another Home Depot in Paramount, which drew out protesters who suspected another raid. Federal authorities later said there was no enforcement activity at that Home Depot. Many more were arrested while protesting, including a prominent union leader who was accused of impeding law enforcement. The last time the National Guard was activated without a governor's permission was in 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson sent troops to protect a civil rights march in Alabama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. In San Francisco, officers arrested and later released about 155 people for refusing orders to disperse, said officer Paulina Henderson with the city's police department. Many protesters left the scene, but some remained while others moved to another area where they vandalized buildings and a police vehicle.</p>

Correspondent Rich Edson details Dems' response to Trump deploying the National Guard and 'Outnumbered' co-host Kayleigh McEnany weighs in on the escalation. Dozens of protesters have been arrested following a weekend of violence across Los Angeles as tensions hit a boiling point over immigration raids throughout the city. On Sunday, law enforcement officials from multiple agencies arrested 41 protesters as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations spiraled out of control. Of the nearly four-dozen arrests, 21 were made by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), 19 by California Highway Patrol and one by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. The charges include failure to disperse, assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, looting and arson, an LAPD spokesperson told Fox News Digital. Of the most violent alleged offenses, one individual was arrested for attempted murder with a Molotov cocktail, Fox News Digital has learned. On Saturday, the LAPD arrested 10 individuals for failing to disperse. The agency did not make any arrests Friday, according to officials. The arrests come as the sanctuary city is bracing for the possibility of more violence as anti-ICE protesters clash with local, state and federal law enforcement. The protests kicked off on Friday after federal agents swept through the city's garment district in search of undocumented immigrants, sparking outrage throughout the community. Law enforcement officers during a protest in Paramount, California. "We made a great decision in sending the National Guard to deal with the violent, instigated riots in California," Trump wrote on Truth Social Monday morning. "If we had not done so, Los Angeles would have been completely obliterated." Tensions escalated on the third day of protests as agitators moved throughout the city, setting self-driving cars on fire and blocking off major highways. National Guard troops took to the streets Sunday morning to guard the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles. The LAPD began firing off rounds of crowd-control munitions in an effort to disperse the protesters, who then advanced onto the 101 Freeway and proceeded to block traffic until state police cleared the roadway by late afternoon. Additionally, demonstrators set at least four self-driving electric vehicles on fire, resulting in large explosions being heard throughout the chaos along with intermittent flash bangs going off periodically. By Sunday night, local police had issued an unlawful assembly order, effectively shutting down the area throughout downtown Los Angeles. "Demonstrators have marched to the LA Live area and are blocking all lanes of traffic on Figueroa and 11th St," the LAPD posted to X. "An UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY has been declared for the Downtown Los Angeles area. You are to leave the area immediately." Trump's move to send in the U.S. military has drawn criticism from local and national politicians, with Democratic California Gov. "This is about authoritarian tendencies," Newsom said in a statement. He's threatening to go after judges he disagrees with, cut off funding to institutions of higher learning, he's rewriting history and censoring historical facts." LAPD officers on horseback clash with protesters after a series of immigration raids on June 8, 2025, in Los Angeles. Newsom arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday evening to meet with state officials and oversee the response to the anti-ICE demonstrations. ICE said in a Saturday post on X that the agency had arrested 118 illegal immigrants throughout Los Angeles, including five alleged gang members. "Why do Governor Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass care more about violent murderers and sex offenders than they do about protecting their own citizens?" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for Homeland Security's public affairs, said in a statement. "These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets. Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer." Representatives for Bass' administration did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Fox News Digital's Audrey Conklin contributed to this report.

Border czar Tom Homan joins 'Fox & Friends' to respond to California Democrats' pushback on President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard. California will sue the Trump administration over its decision to activate National Guard soldiers in Los Angeles County over the weekend, the state's Democratic leaders announced on Monday. California Attorney General Rob Bonta claimed in a statement that President Donald Trump abused his authority by invoking a provision of Title 10 that allows the president to mobilize the National Guard if an invasion or rebellion is underway. "President Trump's order calling federalized National Guard troops into Los Angeles – over the objections of the governor and local law enforcement – is unnecessary and counterproductive," Bonta said. Gavin Newsom said Monday that Trump caused the bulk of the rioting because he unnecessarily deployed the military to protect ICE personnel and federal buildings. Bonta added that there was "no invasion" and "no rebellion" in California, a claim that comes as protests against immigration raids devolved into riots in parts of sprawling Los Angeles County over the weekend. "The president is trying to manufacture chaos and crisis on the ground for his own political ends," Bonta said. National Guard soldiers are deployed around downtown Los Angeles, Sunday, June 8, 2025. Gavin Newsom said in statements Monday that Trump caused the bulk of the rioting because he unnecessarily deployed the military to protect ICE personnel and federal buildings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump arrives on Air Force One at Hagerstown Regional Airport, in Hagerstown, Md., on his was to Camp David, Md., Sunday, June 8, 2025. It's another way they get a leg up on less affluent peers, who may receive nothing at all — or even be expected to support their families. But what if all children — regardless of their family's circumstances — could get a financial boost when they turn 18? That's the idea behind a House GOP proposal backed by President Donald Trump. If the money is used for other purposes, it'll be taxed at a higher rate. It builds on the concept of “ baby bonds,” which two states — California and Connecticut — and the District of Columbia have introduced as a way to reduce gaps between wealthy people and poor people. Rep. Blake Moore, a Republican from Utah, spearheaded the effort to get the initiative into a massive House spending bill. In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, he said wealth inequality has soured many people on capitalism. “We know that America's economic engine is working, but not everyone feels connected to its value and the ways it can benefit them,” Moore wrote. “If we can demonstrate to our next generation the benefits of investing and financial health, we can put them on a path toward prosperity.” The bill would require at least one parent to produce a Social Security number with work authorizations, meaning the U.S. citizen children born to some categories of immigrants would be excluded from the benefit. But unlike other baby bond programs, which generally target disadvantaged groups, this one would be available to families of all incomes. “When little baby is born they're gonna start off with a thousand dollars and if we do a good job of investing their money — we're going to go with one of the investing guidelines, who the hell knows if they're any good — but they have a chance to be very rich,” Trump said at a rally last week in Pittsburgh. He envisioned a program that would be universal but would give children from poor families a larger endowment than their wealthier peers, in an attempt to level the playing field. Hamilton added that $1,000 — even with interest — would not be enough to make a significant difference for a child living in poverty. “The rise and fall of nations occurs when you have a wealth gap that grows, when you have people who lose faith in the system,” Gerstner said. The proposal comes as Congressional Republicans and Trump face backlash for proposed cuts to programs that poor families with children rely on, including food assistance and Medicaid. Even some who back the idea of baby bonds are skeptical, noting Trump wants to cut higher education grants and programs that aid young people on the cusp of adulthood — the same age group Trump Accounts are supposed to help. Young adults who grew up in poverty often struggle with covering basics like rent and transportation — expenses that Trump Accounts could not be tapped to cover, said Eve Valdez, an advocate for youth in foster care in southern California. Accounts for newborn children that cannot be accessed for 18 years mean little to families struggling to meet basic needs today, said Shimica Gaskins of End Child Poverty California. “Having children have health care, having their families have access to SNAP and food are what we really need ... the country focused on,” Gaskins said.

Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin sounded off on a Biden-appointed federal judge who could decide Wednesday morning that a plane carrying illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes to South Sudan has to return. The Trump administration on Friday announced it had returned Kilmar Abrego Garcia – a Salvadoran migrant and alleged MS-13 member – to the U.S., months after he was deported to El Salvador in what officials later acknowledged was an administrative error. It is unclear whether Abrego Garcia's return signals a shift in policy or is merely a one-off. Still, the case has sparked fresh questions about the administration's willingness to comply with other court orders requiring the return of deported migrants – whether individuals or entire classes – or mandating that certain individuals remain in U.S. custody long enough to challenge their removals to so-called "third countries." It also undercut the Trump administration's assertion earlier this year that it is powerless to order El Salvador to return a prisoner or facilitate the return of migrants sent to El Salvador – something judges have attempted somewhat unsuccessfully to square in various court proceedings this year. Here is what to know about those cases so far. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Attorney General Pam Bondi listen as President Donald Trump meets with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office on Apr. 14 to discuss issues including the detention of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Daniel Lozano-Camargo, previously referred to in court documents as "Cristian," is a 20-year-old Venezuelan immigrant deported in March under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law invoked by Trump to quickly remove hundreds of immigrants and send them to El Salvador to be detained in the country's maximum-security CECOT prison. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled in April that his deportation violated a settlement agreement that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stuck last year with a group of young asylum seekers, including Lozano-Camargo, who had entered the country as an unaccompanied child and later sought asylum. Under that agreement, DHS agreed not to deport the immigrants until their asylum cases were fully adjudicated in court, which she said had not happened in Lozano-Camargo's case prior to his removal. In ordering his return to the U.S., she stressed that her ruling had nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request in question – a nod to the two apparent low-level drug offenses he had racked up prior to his removal – but simply his ability to have his asylum request adjudicated in court under the agreement with DHS. DHS officials told the court last week in a status update that Lozano-Camargo remains held at CECOT. The immigrant, referred to in court documents only as "O.C.G.," was deported to Mexico in March without due process and despite his stated fears of persecution in the country, according to U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy, who ordered his return. had previously been held for ransom and raped in Mexico but was not afforded the chance to assert those fears prior to his removal – a right afforded to him by U.S. and international law. ICE officials told the court earlier this month that they were working to secure his return. told Fox News he had been returned to the U.S. on Wednesday via commercial flight. had not been detained in Mexico after he was deported, which could have eased some of the hurdles for the administration in returning him. The Trump administration relented for the first time last week and complied with a federal judge's order to return a deported migrant removed from the U.S. based on erroneous information. Murphy ordered the Trump administration to keep in U.S. custody a group of six immigrants who were deported to South Sudan without due process or notice until they have the opportunity to conduct so-called "reasonable fear interviews," or a chance to explain to U.S. officials any fear of persecution or torture, should they be released into South Sudanese custody. Currently, all six individuals remain detained at a U.S. military base in Djibouti – the only U.S. military base currently operational in all of Africa – and where ICE officials tasked with keeping them in custody cited recent health risks, including from malaria exposure, searing heat, nearby burn pits as well as the "imminent danger" of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen. In response, Murphy reiterated earlier this month that the individuals need not remain in South Sudan and that the U.S. is free to move them to another location, including back to the U.S., to more safely carry out these proceedings. Judge James Boasberg, chief judge of the US District Court for the District of Columbia, attends a panel discussion at the annual ABA Spring Antitrust Meeting in Washington, D.C. (AFP/Getty Images) U.S. District Judge James Boasberg last week ordered the Trump administration to provide all non-citizens deported from the U.S. to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador to be afforded the opportunity to seek habeas relief in court and challenge their alleged gang status – the latest in a heated fight centered on Trump's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport certain migrants. Boasberg reiterated in the 69-page ruling that due process includes providing migrants deported to CECOT prior notice of removal, as well as so-called habeas protections, or the right to challenge their removals in court. He gave the Trump administration until Wednesday to submit to the court plans for how it will go about providing the habeas relief to plaintiffs held at CECOT. "Defendants plainly deprived these individuals of their right to seek habeas relief before their summary removal from the United States — a right that need not itself be vindicated through a habeas petition," Boasberg said in his order. The order is almost certain to spark fierce backlash from the Trump administration, which has previously railed against Boasberg's earlier rulings and the temporary restraining order handed down in March.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new proclamation, which Trump signed on Wednesday, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa. It does not revoke visas previously issued to people from countries on the list. President Donald Trump's new ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement. It started when Tom Homan, the border czar, warned that anyone, including public officials, would be arrested if they obstructed federal immigration enforcement. “No one's above the law,” he said on Fox & Friends, although he added that “there was no discussion” about arresting Newsom. The California governor responded in an interview with MSNBC. Let's just get it over with, tough guy,” Newsom said. “Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing. It's a reference to the much-delayed high-speed rail project, which predates Newsom's tenure. In a post on his social media site, Trump said the city would have been “completely obliterated” otherwise. Protests over the president's immigration crackdown spared much of Los Angeles from violence. Weekend clashes swept through several downtown blocks and a handful of other places. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass should thank him. He accused them of being untruthful for saying Guard troops weren't necessary. He wants to install two large flag poles, one on either side of the White House. When he stepped off Marine One, he walked to a bulldozer that was positioned on the South Lawn to dig a foundation for the pole. The project is expected to be completed in about two months, or during the first half of August, a White House official said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to comment publicly about intended changes to the property. Trump said months ago that he planned to pave over the lawn in the Rose Garden because it's always wet and inconveniences women in high heels The lawsuit, which is also over plans to return seized devices, was announced Monday. The states argue that returning the triggers, which make semiautomatic rifles fire more rapidly, would violate federal law, pose a threat to residents and law enforcement and worsen gun violence. It resolves a series of cases over the aftermarket trigger the government had previously argued qualify as machine guns under federal law, saying they're essentially illegal machine gun conversion devices because constant finger pressure on the triggers will keep a rifle firing essentially like an automatic weapon. “I have always supported Trump, @realDonaldTrump, through thick and thin. However, this is unacceptable and inhumane,” said Ileana Garcia, a Florida state senator who in 2016 founded the group Latinas for Trump and was hired to direct Latino outreach. “I understand the importance of deporting criminal aliens, but what we are witnessing are arbitrary measures to hunt down people who are complying with their immigration hearings — in many cases, with credible fear of persecution claims — all driven by a Miller-like desire to satisfy a self-fabricated deportation goal.” Garcia was referring to Stephen Miller, a key architect of Trump's immigration crackdown. Garcia also said “this is not what we voted for.” However, Trump promised voters he would conduct the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to expel millions of immigrants in the country illegally. As President Trump builds a crypto empire — including hosting a private dinner with top investors at his golf club — Democrats have united in condemning what they call blatant corruption from the White House. But divisions have opened over the bill, with many demanding it prevent the Republican president and his family from directly profiting from cryptocurrency. “I'm all on board with the idea of regulating crypto,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. “But at this moment, when cryptocurrency is being so clearly used by Donald Trump to facilitate his corruption, I don't think you can close your eyes to that when you're legislating.” Appearing on CNBC this morning, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said it was a “very significant, sticking point” because China, which controls the processing of critical minerals, has been “slow rolling” in sending the materials to U.S. over licensing requirements. “It could potentially disrupt production for, you know, some U.S. companies that rely on those things,” Hassett said. High-level U.S. and Chinese officials are meeting today in London for their latest round of trade talks. Newsom, a Democrat, told MSNBC he plans to file suit Monday against the Trump administration to roll back the Guard deployment, which he called “an illegal act, an immoral act, an unconstitutional act.” Trump has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal troops when there is ”a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” “We're going to test that theory with a lawsuit tomorrow,” Newsom said Sunday night. Security precautions are already being put in place ahead of this Saturday's military parade. Workers were assembling black metal barriers near the White House on Monday morning. More information on preparations will be announced in the afternoon during a briefing with local and federal officials. Trump has been pushing for a nuclear agreement with Iran, while Netanyahu is wary of the diplomatic effort. ABC News has suspended correspondent Terry Moran for calling Trump administration deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller a “world class hater” in a since-deleted social media post. Moran's post was swiftly condemned by administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance. ABC News, in a statement, said it “stands for objectivity and impartiality in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others.” The network said Moran was suspended pending further evaluation. This morning, Trump is traveling back to the White House from Camp David. “ARREST THE PEOPLE IN FACE MASKS, NOW!” Trump wrote at 12:19 a.m. “Don't let these thugs get away with this. “This thing has gotten out of control,” McDonell said Sunday. “We have great cops in Southern California here that work together all the time,” he said. But he added that “looking at the violence tonight, I think we gotta make a reassessment.” High-level delegations from the U.S. and China are meeting in London on Monday to try and shore up a fragile truce in a trade dispute that's roiled the global economy. A Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng was due to hold talks with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at a U.K. government building. The talks, which are expected to last at least a day, follow negotiations in Geneva last month that brought a temporary respite in the trade war. ▶ Read more about trade talks between the U.S. and China Scores of National Institutes of Health scientists have gone public to assail deep program cuts and upheaval at their agency under the Trump administration. On Monday, more than 90 current employees sent their leader a letter entitled the Bethesda Declaration. By signing their names, the NIH employees gave up the veil of anonymity common in Washington — and put their jobs at risk. Their declaration was endorsed anonymously by 250 other NIH researchers and staff. Altogether, employees from all 27 NIH institutes and centers registered their dismay with the agency's direction. ▶ Read more about dissent at the National Institutes of Health Trump is not backing off his battle with Elon Musk, saying Saturday that he has no desire to repair their relationship and warning that his former ally and campaign benefactor could face “serious consequences” if he tries to help Democrats in upcoming elections. Trump told NBC's Kristen Welker in a phone interview that he has no plans to make up with Musk. Asked specifically if he thought his relationship with the mega-billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX is over, Trump responded, “I would assume so, yeah.” Johnson took clear sides Sunday in Trump's breakup with mega-billionaire Elon Musk, saying Musk's criticism of the GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill will not derail the measure, and he downplayed Musk's influence over the GOP-controlled Congress. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., wraps up a news conference on President Donald Trump's bill of tax breaks and spending cuts, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, June 4, 2025. “I didn't go out to craft a piece of legislation to please the richest man in the world,” Johnson said on ABC's “This Week.” Musk called it an “abomination” that would add to U.S. debts and threaten economic stability. His criticism sparked an angry social media back-and-forth with Trump, who told reporters over the weekend that he has no desire to repair his relationship with Musk. Early in Trump's first term, he issued an executive order banning travel to the U.S. by citizens of seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. Since returning to the White House, Trump has launched a campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him. In a video posted on social media, Trump tied the new ban to a terrorist attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. Trump's new ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens from 12 mainly African and Middle Eastern countries took effect Monday amid rising tension over the president's escalating campaign of immigration enforcement. The new proclamation, which Trump signed last week, applies to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. It also imposes heightened restrictions on people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela who are outside the U.S. and don't hold a valid visa. However, unless an applicant meets narrow criteria for an exemption to the ban, his or her application will be rejected starting Monday.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A judge on Monday dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, a major development in the ongoing civil litigation between former co-stars Lively and Baldoni. In January, Baldoni sued Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds, alleging that the Hollywood couple sought to “destroy” him and his career, after hijacking his film, “It Ends With Us.” “As we have said from day one, this ‘$400 million' lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it,” the statement added. Motions to dismiss Baldoni's claims by Lively, Reynolds and their publicist, Leslie Sloane, were all granted. Baldoni had sued the publication for $250 million for libel, claiming that the newspaper published an article “rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and omissions” that relied on Lively's “self-serving narrative.” The judge ruled that Baldoni can file an amended complaint on the allegations of tortious interference with contract, relating to Reynolds and Lively, and breach of implied covenant, relating to Lively, by June 23, if they choose to do so. The ongoing saga between Lively and Baldoni erupted in December 2024, when Lively first filed a civil rights complaint, claiming that she was sexually harassed by Baldoni during production of the film and then was retaliated against for speaking up about her alleged mistreatment. Lively eventually escalated her civil rights complaint, officially filing a lawsuit against Baldoni. She alleged that after being sexually harassed with inappropriate comments and behavior on set, Baldoni's team then orchestrated a smear campaign against her to ruin her reputation in the public sphere. Lively's complaint contained hundreds of text messages between Baldoni and his crisis PR team, including one text that read they could “bury” her. The New York Times was the first to report – in an article titled “‘We Can Bury Anyone': Inside a Hollywood Smear Machine” – that Lively had filed a complaint with Civil Rights Department about Baldoni's alleged conduct on set of “It End With Us” and after production. Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath, Wayfarer co-founder Steve Sarowitz, and members from Baldoni's PR and crisis management team were all cited as plaintiffs on the suit against the Times. He cited a piece of California legislation that came in response to the #MeToo movement. As their legal fight unfolded, Baldoni's team published a website containing texts and an alleged timeline relating to Lively's claims. The website, a separate leaked voice note that Baldoni sent to Lively and several public statements made by Baldoni's lawyer were the subject of several court hearings in recent months. Rumors of their fractured professional relationship began percolating during the film's 2024 press tour.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Friday, the Supreme Court handed down a brief order permitting the Department of Government Efficiency, the enigmatic White House entity that billionaire Elon Musk previously ran, to access a wide range of sensitive information kept by the Social Security Administration — including many individuals' bank account numbers and medical records. Realistically, it was always likely that the Trump administration would eventually prevail in this case. These sorts of internal management decisions typically are not subject to judicial review. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissenting opinion primarily focuses on her concerns over the rapidity with which the Court hears Trump cases, and she argues that her Republican colleagues appear to have abandoned an important limit on the Court's authority (or, at least, that they've done so when the Trump administration asks them to prematurely get involved with a case). Prior to the first Trump administration, the Court rarely granted requests for shadow docket relief — indeed, lawyers were so discouraged from seeking shadow docket decisions that both the Bush and Obama administrations only requested it about once every other year. But there are supposed to be rules governing when the Supreme Court may allow a litigant to bypass the normal appeals process and seek an immediate decision blocking a lower court's order. Among other things, as Jackson writes in her dissent, the government is supposed to show “that it will actually suffer concrete or irreparable harm from having to comply with the District Court's order” before it can obtain a Supreme Court decision blocking that order. Jackson is becoming increasingly vocal about her belief that the Court should return to its prior shadow docket policy. She argues, in both her AFSCME dissent and in a similar dissent she handed down a week earlier, that her Republican colleagues have abandoned this “irreparable harm” requirement. Moreover, the evidence laid out in Jackson's opinions suggests that her Court is applying one set of shadow docket rules to Democratic administrations and another, more favorable set of rules, to Republicans. Prior to the first Trump administration, when a lower court ruled against someone, its order would typically remain in effect while the case was being appealed. As the Supreme Court explained in Nken v. Holder (2009), it is not enough for a party that lost in a lower court to show that it is likely to prevail on appeal when it asks a higher court to temporarily block that lower court's decision. One reason for this “irreparably injured” requirement is that appeals courts are typically far less familiar with the details of a case than the trial court that initially decided it, especially when a party seeks emergency relief on something like the Supreme Court's shadow docket. So, if appeals courts are too eager to block lower court decisions before they fully consider the case on appeal, they are likely to hand down many wrongly decided orders. That said, Nken recognized that it is unfair to make a litigant wait for a higher court to step in if they need immediate, time-sensitive relief to prevent them from being injured in a way that cannot be fixed by a later court decision. But the Supreme Court's shadow docket orders rarely even mention this irreparable harm requirement, and even when they do mention it, they typically don't explain how the Court analyzed this question. The Court's decision in Doe, which allowed Trump to strip half-a-million immigrants of their ability to live in the United States, does not mention Nken at all. So it is possible that one of the Court's six Republicans disagreed with the Court's order but chose not to make that disagreement public.) Some justices have implicitly argued that Nken should be overruled — or, at least, that it should be modified to permit shadow docket relief in some cases where there is no irreparable harm. Concurring in Labrador v. Poe (2024), Justice Brett Kavanaugh claimed that, in many shadow docket cases, “this Court has little choice but to decide the emergency application by assessing likelihood of success on the merits.” Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined that opinion. So Kavanaugh and Barrett, at least, have explicitly stated that there are some cases where shadow docket relief will be granted solely based on which party is likely to prevail once the case is fully litigated. But, if you look at the Court's past behavior, it seems that the main factor determining whether Nken should be abandoned is whether the party seeking shadow docket relief is a Democrat or a Republican. In her Doe dissent, Jackson flags several cases where her Court “denied similar stay requests from federal agencies.” The primary difference between these cases and the Doe and AFSCME cases appears to be that Joe Biden was president when the Court denied these stays. In Biden v. Texas (2022), for example, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that a Trump-appointed district judge was wrong when he ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a Trump immigration policy that required many asylum-seekers to remain on the Mexican side of the US-Mexico border while awaiting a hearing. But it did so after leaving that Trump judge's order in place for more than 10 months. Similarly, in United States v. Texas (2023) the Supreme Court ultimately concluded that a Trump judge didn't even have jurisdiction to hear a case, where the judge cut off the Biden administration's authority to set enforcement priorities for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE). But the Court left that judge's order in place for nearly an entire year while the case was pending on appeal. Maybe there is a nonpartisan explanation for why the Court treated Biden differently than Trump. Perhaps there were legally sound, politically neutral arguments for why Nken shouldn't apply in Doe or AFSCME. Or maybe the Republican justices have a good argument for why irreparable harm does exist in those cases — even though the Trump administration didn't even bother to argue that it exists in the AFSCME case. But, if such an explanation exists, the Republican justices did not explain what it is. Instead, they've chosen to sit silently while Jackson levies some very serious charges against them — all while presenting evidence that strongly suggests her colleagues are rooting their shadow docket decisions in partisanship and not the law. Trump shut down the agency that protects civil servants from illegal firings. Ames v. Ohio was an easy case, even if it touched upon contentious issues. Trump may kick half a million immigrants, from nations with unstable or authoritarian regimes, out of the US.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United Natural Foods, Inc., one America's largest publicly traded health food wholesalers and the primary food distributor for Whole Foods, has taken some of its systems offline after a massive cyberattack. “We have identified unauthorized activity in our systems and have proactively taken some systems offline while we investigate,” the company said in a statement to CNN. UNFI has also contacted law enforcement for assistance and it's “assessing the unauthorized activity” and is working to its restore systems following the cyberattack. In a regulatory filing Monday, UNFI said it became aware of an incident in its information technology systems on June 5, which is causing “temporary disruptions to the company's business operations.” The company makes private label, fresh and its own branded products and ships them to more than 30,000 grocery stores, including Whole Foods. The Amazon-owned company didn't immediately respond to comment about how it's being affected. On social media, some Whole Foods customers reported they saw empty shelves. A post on Reddit shows an empty refrigerator with a sign reading the store is “experiencing a temporary out of stock issue for some products.” Another post shows smaller-than-usual deliveries to stores. UNFI signed a new distribution agreement with Whole Foods last year, extending the partnership through 2032. UNFI (UNFI) said that it's “working closely” with its suppliers and clients to to “minimize disruption as much as possible.” Shares fell more than 9% in early trading.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Updated at 10:26 a.m. on June 9, 2025  Since winning President Donald Trump's nomination to serve as the director of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya—a health economist and prominent COVID contrarian who advocated for reopening society in the early months of the pandemic—has pledged himself to a culture of dissent. “Dissent is the very essence of science,” Bhattacharya said at his confirmation hearing in March. More than 300 officials, from across all of the NIH's 27 institutes and centers, have signed and sent a letter to Bhattacharya that condemns the changes that have thrown the agency into chaos in recent months—and calls on their director to reverse some of the most damaging shifts. Since January, the agency has been forced by Trump officials to fire thousands of its workers and rescind or withhold funding from thousands of research projects. The allusion in the NIH letter, officials told me, isn't meant glibly: “We hoped he might see himself in us as we were putting those concerns forward,” Jenna Norton, a program director at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and one of the letter's organizers, told me. None of the NIH officials I spoke with for this story could recall another time in their agency's history when staff have spoken out so publicly against a director. But none of them could recall, either, ever seeing the NIH so aggressively jolted away from its core mission. “It was time enough for us to speak out,” Sarah Kobrin, a branch chief at the National Cancer Institute, who has signed her name to the letter, told me. The agency spends most of its nearly $48 billion budget powering science: It is the world's single-largest public funder of biomedical research. But since January, the NIH has canceled thousands of grants—originally awarded on the basis of merit—for political reasons: supporting DEI programming, having ties to universities that the administration has accused of anti-Semitism, sending resources to research initiatives in other countries, advancing scientific fields that Trump officials have deemed wasteful. But one official at the agency, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of professional repercussions, told me that staff there now spend nearly as much time terminating grants as awarding them. And the few prominent projects that the agency has since been directed to fund appear either to be geared toward confirming the administration's biases on specific health conditions, or to benefit NIH leaders. NIH officials have tried to voice their concerns in other ways. At internal meetings, leaders of the agency's institutes and centers have questioned major grant-making policy shifts. Current and former NIH staffers have been holding weekly vigils in Bethesda, commemorating, in the words of the organizers, “the lives and knowledge lost through NIH cuts.” (Attendees are encouraged to wear black.) By formalizing their objections and signing their names to them, officials told me, they hope that Bhattacharya will finally feel compelled to respond. (To add to the public pressure, Jeremy Berg, who led the NIH's National Institute of General Medical Sciences until 2011, is also organizing a public letter of support for the Bethesda Declaration, in partnership with Stand Up for Science, which has organized rallies in support of research.) Scientists elsewhere at HHS, which oversees the NIH, have become unusually public in defying political leadership, too. Last month, after Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—in a bizarre departure from precedent—announced on social media that he was sidestepping his own agency, the CDC, and purging COVID shots from the childhood-immunization schedule, CDC officials chose to retain the vaccines in their recommendations, under the condition of shared decision making with a health-care provider. Many signers of the Bethesda letter are hopeful that Bhattacharya, “as a scientist, has some of the same values as us,” Benjamin Feldman, a staff scientist at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, told me. Perhaps, with his academic credentials and commitment to evidence, he'll be willing to aid in the pushback against the administration's overall attacks on science, and defend the agency's ability to power research. But other officials I spoke with weren't so optimistic. Many at the NIH now feel they work in a “culture of fear,” Norton said. At one point, Norton said, after she fought for a program focused on researcher diversity, some members of NIH leadership came to her office and cautioned her that they didn't want to see her on the next list of mass firings. (In conversations with me, all of the named officials I spoke with emphasized that they were speaking in their personal capacity, and not for the NIH.) HHS officials have pressured agency leadership to defy court orders, as I've reported; mass cullings of grants have been overseen by DOGE. He echoed, instead, the Trump talking point that “sex is a very cleanly defined variable,” and argued that gender shouldn't be included as “a routine question in order to make an ideological point.” The officials I spoke with had few clear plans for what to do if their letter goes unheeded by leadership. Inside the agency, most see few levers left to pull. When dozens of staffers stood and left the auditorium in protest, prompting applause that interrupted Bhattacharya, he simply smiled. “It's nice to have free speech,” he said, before carrying right on.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A major Los Angeles suburb revoked its contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement due to public backlash to federal agents seeking to carry out the Trump administration's deportation agenda by detaining illegal immigrants. Officials in Glendale, California, announced the decision to abruptly cancel its ICE detainee holding contract late Sunday evening as riots over ICE activity rocked Los Angeles, leading President Donald Trump to send in the National Guard. City officials said they were canceling the contract, which allows federal authorities to hold suspected illegal immigrants in local jails, after it had been in place for nearly 20 years. It is rooted in what this City stands for—public safety, local accountability, and trust.” “Moving forward, the facility will continue to serve local law enforcement needs without participation in federal detention efforts.” Glendale City Manager Roubik Golanian made the decision due to “evaluation of legal, operational, and community considerations,” per the press release. Some families may face greater difficulty visiting family members held by ICE, and access to legal counsel for detainees may be more limited, the city, which is the fourth-largest in Los Angeles County, said. Violent protests broke out in Los Angeles over the weekend as ICE worked to remove illegal immigrants in the area. Democrats have decried ICE's activity in the Golden State, while condemning the Trump administration's efforts this weekend to target demonstrators as unduly harsh. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have blamed Trump for the protests. Republicans have denied that ICE is to blame and rejected claims that the Trump administration's response to the riots has been unnecessarily heavy-handed. “We watched this kind of scene five, six years ago, when there was a takeover in the northwest, around Seattle and Portland, when we watched all that happen, and local law enforcement was being challenged over and over again,” Lankford said. “This is an American city, and to be able to have an American city where we have people literally flying Mexican flags and saying, ‘You cannot arrest us,' cannot be allowed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Department of Education is paying more than $7 million a month to employees it has forced to go on leave, according to analysis from the American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, the union that represents department employees. Roughly 1,300 people were laid off and hundreds more took voluntary “buyouts.” The firings were part of President Donald Trump's larger plan to dismantle the Department of Education and promise to deliver efficiencies through cuts across government. Related article Trump urges Supreme Court to allow mass layoffs at Education Department However, following a May federal court decision blocking White House plans to shut down the agency, the workers were reinstated and placed on “administrative leave” — meaning they are employed but not allowed to work — as lawsuits continue. This means salary payments will now continue past Monday, while employees remain in what many describe as “administrative purgatory,” racking up further costs for the department. According to AFGE Local 252, which analyzed over 900 salaries of affected employees, the true cost to the Department of Education is well over $7 million a month as the figure does not include employee benefits or managers' pay. The cuts were billed as a drive for government savings. When announcing the layoffs in March, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said they reflected the agency's “commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are directed where they matter most: to students, parents, and teachers.” Critics point out that it has instead generated wasteful costs with no returns when employees continue getting paid for not working. Meanwhile, numerous employees on administrative leave who are members of Local 252 told CNN they feel embarrassed collecting a paycheck. After her termination in March, Ariel Shepetovskiy, a Department of Education lawyer, lost access to computer systems and email accounts needed to do her work. Now on administrative leave, “it feels like garbage to receive pay in exchange for doing nothing,” Shepetovskiy said. Robert Jason Cottrell, a data coordinator with the department, also expressed frustration — wanting, but unable — to work. CNN has asked the Department of Education for comment. Related article ‘It's just devastating': Federal workers grapple with canceled health insurance, bungled benefits after Trump's layoff chaos Dozens of government agencies are involved in lawsuits challenging White House directives cutting their workforce, with workers similarly placed on administrative leave and unable to work across Washington. Several employees given the offer told CNN they had cases pending before the Merit Systems Protection Board, or MSPB, a government office that civil servants can use to appeal personnel disputes. Settlement offers reviewed by CNN would pay for these employees through September if they drop their cases and quit. Smith, who was laid off in March, said she has heard from over a dozen employees who were approached with these offers in the past two weeks. “I am not giving up that option,” she said. “So many of us are just holding on because we know how important this work is.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Among all the lurid details and allegations that have surfaced in Sean “Diddy” Combs's trial on federal charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, one potential aspect of the music mogul's relationships has flown under the radar. What we haven't heard on the witness stand is a concept crucial to understanding intimate partner violence and how individual incidents can form a pattern of abuse over time. That pattern, described by sociologists as “coercive control,” may have played a major role in Diddy's relationships — but it won't play a major role in the trial. Generally speaking, “coercive control” is a pattern of controlling behavior, manipulation, and emotional abuse over time. It is criminalized in the UK, and seven states have passed laws that say coercive control is a form of domestic violence, though how they're applied varies by state. US courts have been slow to adopt the concept, and Judge Arun Subramanian, overseeing Combs's trial in New York City's federal district court, blocked the prosecution's expert on domestic violence, or intimate partner violence (IPV), from testifying specifically about coercive control. That leaves the prosecution and all witnesses walking a very interesting line in their presentation of the evidence against Combs, who has pleaded not guilty. Typically described in the US legal code as being compelled, forced, or threatened to act in a specific way, it's a crucial pillar of several of the legal charges being brought against Combs. Additionally, if the jury can't hear testimony about the impact of long-term abuse and toxic environments on survivors over time, will they be able to understand why so many of the people testifying against Combs now spent years, even decades, working for him and/or entertaining positive relationships with him? The case serves as a reminder that, despite having been known to IPV prevention researchers for decades, “coercive control” is still a little-known term to the public. While it's an important concept for expanding how we think about intimate partner abuse beyond acts of physical violence, some experts say its highly murky legal status is warranted. That ambiguity, however, makes it hard to talk about ways an alleged abuser might exert control over survivors that aren't always obvious. Many of those methods have surfaced in the Combs trial. That gives us a major opportunity to understand what coercive control is — and the ways in which it's being tried and tested in court. “There is no single word to describe the full range of controlling behavior,” Schechter and her co-author Ann Jones wrote in their 1993 book When Love Goes Wrong in a section indexed as “coercive control.” Contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-7233 (or text BEGIN to 88788). While still in wide use in courtrooms as a legal defense, the concept has long been a source of debate, with many experts framing it as part of general PTSD or using the gender-neutral phrase “battering and its effects” instead. Legal advocates have argued for decades for a better descriptor, one that emphasizes nonphysical forms of abuse as well as physical abuse. Enter “coercive control.” Experts like Schechter and the late Evan Stark have helped mainstream the phrase as an alternative concept, one that more clearly acknowledges the ways abusive partners often use nonviolent abusive tactics, such as emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation, threats, and unpredictable behavior, to influence and control their situations. Research has shown that coercive control is present in up to 58 percent of relationships where IPV occurs, and even nonviolent coercive control engenders PTSD, depression, and ongoing fear in survivors. Understanding that such patterns exist helps us understand intimate partner violence, especially in answering questions like “why didn't the victim just leave?” when “just leaving” is not so simple. Combs is charged with two counts of sex trafficking, two counts of transporting people across state lines for sex work, and one count of “racketeering conspiracy,” which is a broader charge than racketeering itself and merely requires the guilty party to have agreed to participate in any of a litany of crimes that fall under the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization ACT, commonly known as RICO laws. In this case, those alleged crimes include forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, sex trafficking, and obstruction of justice — all acts that witnesses have testified to having seen Diddy commit or experienced themselves while with him. In all three charges, the legal concept of coercion plays a major role. It's part of the criteria that must be met to prove illegal sex trafficking: Per the federal statute under which Combs is charged, any use of “force, threats of force, fraud, [or] coercion” to induce people to engage in sex work violates the law. Similar wording and logic apply to the transportation charge. The prosecution's domestic violence expert, clinical and forensic psychologist Dawn Hughes, was able to discuss elements of IPV on the witness stand, such as trauma bonding and reasons why survivors stay with their abusers — but she was prohibited from discussing how long-term coercive control can impact them and their reasoning. “There's so much physical violence in this case, and I think it's easy to extrapolate how fear of physical violence could coerce somebody into making choices,” Courtney Cross, who runs a law clinic for abuse and IPV survivors at the University of Nevada Las Vegas, told me. “But coercive control itself as a dynamic is way less about the physical violence and so much more about that web of nonphysical tactics of abuse.” Since testimony in the case kicked off May 12, we've already heard plenty of evidence pointing to physical coercion or the threat of it. Ventura testified over several days on the witness stand that during their 11-year relationship, Combs frequently physically assaulted her, threatened her with violence, and dangled the possibility of leaking filmed sex footage of her to the public (which might be considered “revenge porn” or a form of image-based abuse). Bryana Bongolan, a friend of Ventura's, testified that Combs once threatened her in Ventura's 17th-story apartment by hoisting her to the balcony ledge. What's perhaps even more striking, however, is the bigger picture that emerges from all of this witness testimony: an environment, in both Combs's working relationships and his intimate ones, of fear, paranoia, and unpredictable outbursts of temper. (The boyfriend was musician Kid Cudi, whose Porsche Combs is also accused of firebombing.) Another former staffer, testifying under the pseudonym Mia, recounted being pressured to reside mainly with Combs at his residences, where she said she was then not permitted to lock her bedroom door or leave the property. At one point, she alleged on the stand, Combs began a pattern of intermittently sexually assaulting her over the eight years she worked for him. But what's left unexplained is the mental and emotional anguish that a pattern of coercive control creates. All of these moments arguably create a pattern of abuse and manipulation by Combs — the hallmarks of coercive control that the witnesses seem to have lived with and experienced, even if they can't refer to it by name in the courtroom. It was named in part for Jennifer Magnano, a mother of three who was shot and killed in 2007 by her estranged husband. The Connecticut law now defines coercive control and increases protections for people experiencing it while ensuring they don't have to testify in person before someone they are being protected against. Yet even with these stiffer types of legal protections in place, problems abound. Additionally, just as abusers often use DARVO tactics (in which an abuser paints themselves as the wronged party using a strategy of “deny, attack, and reverse victim and offender”) to get authorities on their sides, coercive control patterns can be used against survivors in similar ways. Abuse victims can and often do react to their abusers with self-defense, or reactive violence. Cross has argued against passing laws criminalizing coercive control in favor of expanding resources to empower survivors who are trying to escape abusive situations. And most of all, what we need is money. “People are trying really hard to meet this massive demand, but there aren't nearly enough supportive resources for anybody, including DV survivors, especially the most marginal DV survivors,” she said. One thing that makes coercive control particularly complicated, Cross said, “is that to recognize and respond to it, we have to see it in ourselves” — and culturally, many of the traits that often comprise an abusive personality begin as highly lauded attributes, such as confidence, forcefulness, or invulnerability. Cross pointed out that while coercive control isn't under discussion on the witness stand, it is on full display throughout the Diddy trial itself. “It may not be fraud, extortion, and bribery per se, but the emotional and psychological abuse amounts to a pretty similar outcome on an interpersonal level.” While this context may not be made explicit in court, it's hard to ignore the similarities — and harder to ignore the possibility that this approach to relationships may have helped Combs hide in plain sight all along. Getting hot for the summer isn't cutting it anymore. How millennials are freaking out about being halfway to death, when everyone's broke and already in therapy. Your brain isn't what it used to be.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rioters in Los Angeles, objecting to the efforts to deport illegal immigrants in the United States, have plagued the city with violence for three days, including assaulting law enforcement officers and federal agency officials, setting Waymo vehicles on fire, and other criminal acts. The destruction and violence have led President Donald Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles “to address the lawlessness that has been allowed to fester.” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the National Guard deployment on his X account and warned that if the violence continues, Marines stationed at Camp Pendleton, California, were on high alert and would also be deployed. It was a decision that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo agreed with and called “common sense.” He spoke about the decision in a Sunday segment on Fox News Live. “We do all remember the summer of '20 where this got out of hand, where local law enforcement and governors just let the flames burn,” Pompeo said. “If we don't support the folks who are doing the important work of securing our southern border, making sure everyone who is here is here lawfully, and then keeping people and property protected and safe, we'll end up in a very bad place again,” Pompeo said. “And that is not good for the United States of America.” Democratic politicians in California, particularly Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), were heavily critical of the deportation efforts. “As mayor of a proud city of immigrants, who contribute to our society in so many ways, I am deeply angered by what has taken place,” Bass said. “Continued chaotic federal sweeps, across California, to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel,” Newsom said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom (D-CA) responded to Tom Homan‘s warning on Sunday that obstructing immigration enforcement would lead to an arrest of “anybody,” telling the White House “border czar” to come arrest him. Let's just get it over with, tough guy. I don't give a damn,” Newsom told NBC News on Sunday night. The California governor defended the illegal immigrant population of Los Angeles, which was targeted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a wave of raids late last week, spurring violent protests across the city. Newsom said Homan needs to leave alone the “poor people just trying to live their lives” and insisted that the state needs to “push back” against the Trump administration, which has sought to control the law enforcement response to the protests. “These guys need to grow up,” the California governor said. And I'm sorry to be so clear, but that kind of bloviating is exhausting. Newsom has been critical of the Trump administration's move to deploy the National Guard to the area, which he sees as unnecessary given the state's resources. On Sunday, he said President Donald Trump has “manufactured a crisis and is inflaming conditions” as the protests continue into the night. Earlier on Sunday, he requested that the administration revoke its deployment order, deeming it “unlawful.”</p>
