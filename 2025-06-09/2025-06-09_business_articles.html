                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he is "retiring" all 17 members of a crucial government panel of vaccine advisors. "A clean sweep is needed to re-establish public confidence in vaccine science," Kennedy said in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal on Monday. Kennedy is removing all members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The group reviews vaccine data and makes recommendations that determine who is eligible for shots and whether insurers should cover them, among other efforts. ACIP members are independent medical and public experts who make recommendations based on rigorous scientific review and evidence. The CDC director has to sign off on those recommendations for them to become official policy. He said Monday HHS will put "the restoration of public trust above any pro- or antivaccine agenda." Kennedy added some of the members on the committee were last-minute appointees of the Biden administration and noted that, without ousting advisors from the current group, the Trump administration would not have been able to appoint a majority of new members until 2028. Kennedy claimed that the panel has been "plagued with persistent conflicts of interest and has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine." But all HHS agencies and their advisory panels have had rigorous policies for conflicts of interest, and there have been no related issues for years. All members of federal vaccine advisory committees are already required to comply with regulations around disclosing potential conflicts of interest. The announcement comes a week after pediatric infectious disease expert Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos resigned as co-leader of ACIP due to the belief she is "no longer able to help the most vulnerable members" of the U.S. population. But health policy experts previously told CNBC that a shake-up of the advisory committee could produce politicized recommendations that highlight the harms rather than the benefits of shots. Those recommendations could also create greater distrust in the CDC and Trump administration among scientists and public health experts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved Merck's shot designed to protect infants from respiratory syncytial virus during their first season of the virus, bringing to market a rival to a similar treatment from Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Merck said in a release that it expects orders for the shot to begin in July, with shipments delivered before the virus starts to spread widely. The approval gives doctors a new option for tackling the virus, which causes thousands of deaths among older Americans and hundreds of deaths among infants each year. Complications from RSV are the leading cause of hospitalization among newborns. "We are committed to ensuring availability of [Enflonsia] in the U.S. before the start of the upcoming RSV season to help reduce the significant burden of this widespread seasonal infection on families and health care systems," Dr. Dean Li, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a release. Merck's shot will compete against a similar blockbuster treatment from Sanofi and AstraZeneca called Beyfortus, which was in short supply nationwide during the 2023 RSV season due to unprecedented demand. But each targets a different part of the virus, making it difficult to compare them directly. Merck's shot can be administered to infants regardless of their weight, which the company said may offer convenience in terms of dosing. Meanwhile, the recommended dosage of Beyfortus is based on an infant's body weight. Sanofi on Monday revealed an aggressive effort to increase supply of Beyfortus, including a plan to begin shipping the shot early in the third quarter. Vaccines for RSV are also available in the U.S. from companies such as Pfizer, GSK and Moderna. Recently, the FDA paused testing of RSV shots in young children while it evaluates safety concerns. All of the companies in the market are waiting for a meeting of outside vaccine advisors to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from June 25 to 27, when they will form recommendations for RSV shots and other immunizations. In the mid- to late-stage trial on Enflonsia, the shot reduced RSV-related hospitalizations by more than 84% and decreased hospitalizations due to lower respiratory infections by 90% compared with a placebo among infants through five months. The shot also reduced lower respiratory infections that required medical attention by more than 60% compared with a placebo through five months. RSV is a common cause of lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sports entertainment, equipment and apparel stock Topgolf Callaway Brands surged on Monday after a high-profile corporate director bought shares in the company. Shares rose 11%, hitting their highest level since May 13. The moves comes after board member Adebayo Ogunlesi purchased about $2.5 million worth of shares last week, disclosed in a securities filing on Friday. Purchases by corporate executives and directors can sometimes be seen as a vote of confidence in the company, and this purchase comes from an insider with the type of resume that Wall Street likes. Ogunlesi is a founding partner and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners, which was acquired by BlackRock last year in a $12 billion deal. Ogunlesi now serves on BlackRock's board after that deal, and he also joined the OpenAI board in January. The purchase by Ogunlesi comes after a difficult period for Topgolf Callaway. Shares are down 9% in 2025, and more than 50% over the past year. Overall, the stock has delivered a negative return since Callaway first announced its acquisition of Topgolf in October 2020. This is Ogunlesi's first purchase of Topgolf Callaway stock since June 2023, according to VerityData. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

The AI Race:

Lovable's technology allows people without any programming knowledge to build apps and websites.

Lovable, an AI startup that streamlines software development, is in talks for a large funding round that would make it one of Europe's biggest artificial intelligence newcomers.

The Swedish startup has held discussions with US investors to raise at least $100 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion or higher, according to people familiar with the matter. The talks are early and the terms could change, said the people, who asked not to be named because the information is private.</p>

Vehicles at a Tesla store in Vallejo, California.

As Elon Musk's fortune plunged by $36 billion last week and Tesla Inc.'s stock suffered a brutal drubbing, his most ardent backers rushed in to buy the dip — with leverage.

Investors poured $651 million into the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares (ticker TSLL), marking the largest weekly inflow since the fund's 2022 debut, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The biggest chunks came in on Thursday and Friday. </p>

Pump.fun's decision to raise $1 billion is sparking concern that a token sale by the most popular platform for creating memecoins risks siphoning demand away from the hundreds of coins issued daily through the website. 

The platform, which is based on the Solana blockchain, is still in the early stages of the token offering, according to a person familiar with the plans who asked not to be named discussing private company information, Bloomberg News reported Tuesday. Alon Cohen, co-founder of Pump.fun, didn't respond to requests for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Discovery stock jumped on Monday after the HBO and CNN owner announced plans to split into two separate companies. The Streaming & Studios company will include Warner Bros. Television, Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, HBO, and HBO Max, as well as their legendary film and television libraries. WBD stock jumped almost 13% as the market opened to just above $11 before dipping slightly. Both will continue in their present roles until the separation takes effect next year. Last week investors resoundingly rejected the CEO's proposed pay package, which would have given him a 4% raise. WBD's revenue has declined 10% in the past year, and its debt rating was recently downgraded. Zaslav said in a statement on Monday that operating as two distinct companies would give WBD's brands the "sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today's evolving media landscape." Wiedenfels said Global Networks would work with distribution partners to "create value for both linear and streaming viewers globally while maximizing our network assets and driving free cash flow." The split plan comes after Comcast said late last year it planned to spin off some NBCUniversal channels, including MSNBC, CNBC, USA, Oxygen, E!, Syfy, and the Golf Channel. NBC, Bravo, and the streaming service Peacock will remain under NBCUniversal, Comcast president Mike Cavanagh told NBCU employees in a memo viewed by Business Insider. The "SpinCo" plan would take about a year and permit growth in NBCUniversal's remaining assets, he wrote.</p>

Walmart Inc.'s credit cards will once again be issued by Synchrony Financial as the world's largest retailer makes a renewed push into financial services. 

OnePay, a financial technology firm backed by Walmart, picked Synchrony to issue both a co-branded card that can be used outside Walmart as well as a private-label card that will be available just for purchases at the retailer. OnePay will begin offering the cards in the US later this year.</p>

The chances that a rival oil company will take over BP Plc are slim right now, even as peers have been running the numbers, because of the firm's size and complexity, said bankers from Moelis & Co. 

“We can't identify anybody in the US that would be a buyer,” Moelis Chairman and Global Head of Energy and Clean Technology Stephen Trauber said in an interview in London on Monday. “We don't really see any others globally that are buyers that view the assets as must-have.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wood was speaking to investor Steven Bartlett on his podcast "The Diary Of A CEO" when Bartlett asked for her top stock pick. The full interview with Wood aired on YouTube last week. It is a convergence among three of our major platforms. "And it's not stopping with robotaxis, there's a story beyond that with humanoid robots, and our $2,600 number has nothing for humanoid robots. We just thought it'd be an investment, period," she added. In June 2024, Wood's investment management firm, Ark Invest, issued a price target of $2,600 for Tesla. Wood told Bloomberg during an interview in March that she still stands by her target and expects Tesla's stock to hit $2,600 in five years. Wood told Bartlett that Musk's work with Tesla's Optimus robots would generate productivity gains for the company and create a new source of revenue. Musk said in an interview with CNBC last month that he expects Tesla to make a million Optimus robots every year by 2030. Musk was a prominent backer and supporter of Trump's campaign. Musk's involvement with the White House DOGE office sparked protests and boycotts against Tesla. Musk said in a Tesla earnings call in May that he would be scaling down his involvement with DOGE to focus on Tesla. Last week, Musk's relationship with Trump seemingly broke down after he criticized the president's "big beautiful bill." Musk also agreed with an X post that called for Trump's impeachment, before deleting it. Trump later threatened to cancel the government's contracts with Musk's businesses, saying it would be the "easiest way to save money in our Budget." Tesla's stock fell by 14% on Thursday amid the spat between Musk and Trump. Wood said in a video posted to Ark Invest's YouTube channel on Friday that Musk's quarrel with Trump was an attempt to decouple himself from the Trump administration. "One of the hypotheses out there is that what has happened was partly — not entirely — orchestrated," Wood said. "Clearly, there has been some brand damage to Tesla, which he readily admits, and I think he's trying to disengage from the government and being associated with one party or the other," she continued.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sandy Cacchione, a 41-year-old Swiss woman raising her daughter in Koh Samui, Thailand. She is also the founder of mate.travel, a destination-focused travel and events platform. It has been edited for length and clarity. I was on vacation from my hometown of Basel, Switzerland, while he had stopped on the island to complete his divemaster training during a yearlong trip around the world. After dating long-distance for a year and a half, we decided to move to Koh Tao to work at the diving center where we had first met. It's an island in the Gulf of Thailand, just a ferry ride from Koh Samui. He became a diving instructor, while I started off as an underwater videographer and eventually became an instructor myself. It's a perfect mix of the laid-back island lifestyle we love and all the amenities we need. I gave birth to my daughter in 2020, who is now five years old and enrolled in an international kindergarten on the island. It's a Montessori-inspired school that follows the English curriculum. In Switzerland, the school day usually starts around 8 a.m., so kids need to get up much earlier. In the afternoon, students typically return home for lunch. When I was visiting a friend in Switzerland, her two kids didn't have the same lunchtime. As a mother, I probably would've felt pressured to enroll my daughter in something. While there are extracurricular activities for kids in Samui, there is no pressure to sign them up. Nobody will say, "Oh, your kid's not doing ballet?" Social media here is more about traveling and breaking free from a conventional lifestyle. Even in my daughter's school, the kids get exposed to so many different cultures and learn to be more accepting of others from a young age. People living in Samui tend to be more open-minded. Most of the people I've met have already lived in other countries before; this is rarely their first stop. When my daughter sees videos of other children playing at a park on YouTube or from friends back in Europe, and she says, "Mommy, can we go to the park?" There are indoor play spaces but hardly any well-maintained outdoor playgrounds or parks like the ones I've seen back in Switzerland. I've found that if you don't want to do an activity, it's difficult to just go somewhere and meet other families. Walking here isn't easy — it's hot, there aren't many sidewalks, and there's no public transportation like buses or subways. The roads can be dangerous, so I'd never want my child riding a motorbike here. There's so much space almost everywhere, and she can run around. Even in restaurants, you never feel shushed. There is no road noise, and we have a nice view of the valley and a little bit of the ocean. It's very quiet and slow, even in the mornings. If I'm 10 minutes late dropping my daughter off, it's not a problem. Even as a mother, I'm not stressed.</p>
