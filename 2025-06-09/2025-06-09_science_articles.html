                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In 1966, archaeologists discovered a Roman building measuring over 7,000 square feet. Archaeologists only scratched the surface—quite literally—in 1966 when they examined what is now known to be one of the grandest Roman-era villas ever discovered in central France. “We are not talking about a simple country residence,” the team wrote in a translated statement, “but the core of a vast agricultural estate managed by a family belonging to the political or economic elite of the region.” These sites often feature sophisticated architecture with materials such as marble, mosaics, and frescoes. “It is rare to find a pars urbana [residential area] so developed and excavated so extensively,” the team wrote. Initial findings suggest two stages of construction, although the team hasn't ruled out a third possible phase, which could coincide with the growth of the ancient of Auxerre (near which this villa was built).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As cases of chronic kidney disease emerge in outdoor laborers around the world, scientists are finding that repeated damage from prolonged extreme heat seems to be a leading factor to kidney failure This disease mainly affects young men who work in sugarcane plantations, although children and women have also been affected. For years, Oscar has greeted dawn with the rhythmic swing of his machete as he chops sugar cane in fields near his home in El Salvador. Beginning in the late 1990s, a mysterious epidemic of chronic kidney disease began emerging in Bajo Lempa, a region on the Pacific coast of El Salvador where Tierra Blanca is located. The disease, which researchers have dubbed chronic kidney disease of unknown cause (CKDu), often affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. Many are agricultural workers or labourers without other known risk factors for kidney disease. Roughly 17% of men in Bajo Lempa live with kidney failure. Although the epidemic of this perplexing kidney disease was first recognized in this region, more than half a dozen hotspots have since appeared elsewhere in Central America and around the world. Hard data on the number of people with CKDu globally have yet to be tallied. However, occupational-medicine specialist Emmanuel Jarquín says that tens of thousands of people have probably died from the disease, and the number continues to grow. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. In 2007, Jarquín founded the Agency for Development and Agricultural Health (AGDYSA), a scientific research organization based in San Salvador that aims to protect agricultural workers from kidney disease and other work-related conditions. Elsewhere, CKDu shows up among other labourers, including rice farmers, construction workers and miners. Many researchers expect the effects of climate change to increase the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, which is already a growing health concern globally. In May, the governing body of the World Health Organization adopted a resolution to recognize kidney disease as a major cause of death and disability and to strengthen disease-prevention efforts. More than two decades ago, when otherwise healthy young men in Bajo Lempa began to grow fatigued and anaemic, they chalked it up to long hours of intense and exhausting work. Sugar-cane cutters are “marathon workers,” says Fabiano Amorim, a physiologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. Taking time off to rest wasn't an option. So the workers swallowed ibuprofen and got back to their machetes. But for many, the fatigue worsened until they could no longer get out of bed. When they arrived, the men learnt that their kidneys had failed. Their bodies could no longer filter certain types of toxin, such as uric acid, from the blood or eliminate excess water. Without dialysis to clean and filter the blood, death is inevitable. When the men arrived at Rosales National Hospital, nephrologist Ricardo Leiva and his then-trainee Ramón García-Trabanino were puzzled about why these seemingly healthy young men's kidneys had abruptly crashed. The textbooks that both physicians had pored over in medical school taught them that kidney failure was usually the result of untreated diabetes and high blood pressure or certain rare autoimmune and genetic conditions. The men from Bajo Lempa had none of these. “They were so young … I had no answers,” says García-Trabanino, who now helps to run a private dialysis clinic in San Salvador. “And I didn't get home until after it was dark.” When Leiva, García-Trabanino and a team of researchers published the first account of the mysterious kidney disease in a public-health journal in 2002, the condition seemed like a local kidney anomaly — what biologists call an endemic nephropathy. In Chichigalpa, Nicaragua, contracted workers diagnosed with chronic kidney disease of nontraditional causes (CKDnT) load the days cutting of sugarcane onto a truck in 2016. “Nobody believed us that we were seeing a new form” of chronic kidney disease, says Marvin Gonzalez Quiroz, a physician and epidemiologist from Nicaragua, who is now at the University of Texas at San Antonio. “Nobody believed the prevalence that we were reporting.” Other research documented similar problems in Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, India and Sri Lanka. None of the early studies could pin down a cause, but several leading hypotheses have emerged, including exposure to pesticides and heavy metals, as well as pathogens, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chronic heat stress. Still, epidemiological and animal studies point to heat stress as an important factor. When our bodies heat up, blood vessels in the limbs and extremities dilate in a process called vasodilation, shunting blood away from major organs and to the surface of the skin, allowing heat to dissipate. A fan or breeze amplifies this cooling; high humidity makes the process less effective, says Vecellio. This often happens while water is lost through sweating, forcing the kidneys to kick into overdrive to preserve the body's fluid balance. The entire heat response is a finely tuned physiological symphony that leaves little room for error, says Catharina Giudice, an emergency-medicine physician at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. They have a very intense metabolic demand, so small changes in blood flow tend to be more harmful,” she says. People working in construction and agriculture don't just get hot from being outside in the Sun — they also generate heat through physical labour. Sweating a lot can leave them dangerously dehydrated at the end of a workday, even if they drink water as usual, says Giudice. Except in the most severe cases, researchers thought that the kidneys could quickly bounce back from heat stress with no long-term damage. The emergence of CKDu instead hints that small, repeated injuries — even those that don't result in a hospital visit — can build up over time. Compounded and amplified by other exposures, these small insults can lead to end-stage kidney failure, says Giudice. “Then you progress to a state where the cells can't recover fully.” The problem, says Zachary Schlader, a physiologist at Indiana University Bloomington, is working out how to detect this damage before kidney function drops drastically. Typical tests spot a problem only when there are elevated levels of a waste product called creatinine in the blood and protein in the urine. Nearly ten years ago, Schlader decided to look for molecular distress signals that could be early indicators of declines in kidney function. In one study of sugar-cane cutters in Nicaragua, Schlader and his colleagues found that markers of tubule injury changed as blood creatinine increased throughout the harvest season. Importantly, he says, there are biomarkers that can be measured easily, and can be detected before more commonly used markers of kidney injury, such as creatinine. “Heat stress causes systemic inflammation, and CKDu is likely some combination of what's happening within the kidneys and what's happening systemically.” Research by Schlader's team and others has shown that kidney damage can accumulate much more quickly than anyone thought. They have good kidney function, and then bang, they have stage-four kidney disease and will need dialysis soon,” says Madeleine Scammell, an environmental-health scientist at Boston University in Massachusetts, who studies CKDu. Laura Sánchez-Lozada, a physiologist at the National Institute of Cardiology Ignacio Chávez in Mexico City, studies how other factors, such as drinking fructose-sweetened beverages and using anti-inflammatory medications, such as ibuprofen, can accelerate kidney damage in CKDu. Many agricultural workers in Central America lack access to adequate amounts of safe drinking water when working and instead turn to sports drinks and sodas for rehydration. But large amounts of fructose can trigger an inflammatory response as kidney cells work to metabolize the sugar. When Sánchez-Lozada and her colleagues gave rats fructose-containing beverages rather than plain water for rehydration, the rats experienced greater dehydration and increased kidney injury. Providing safe, plain drinking water and lower-sugar electrolyte drinks for heat-stressed workers will be key to preventing further damage, Sánchez-Lozada says. Meanwhile, researchers are investigating other contributing factors for CKDu. In Bajo Lempa, scientists proposed early on that pesticides and naturally occurring heavy metals could be culprits, and these factors are still under investigation. Further research on CKDu in Sri Lanka, a hotspot studied for nearly two decades, links exposure to pesticides — such as glyphosate — to an increased risk of kidney disease. Epidemiologists in Nepal have found high levels of kidney failure in men who have worked overseas in Malaysia and the Middle East, where they are often hired for manual labour at construction sites and oil fields, exposing them to extreme heat and potential toxins. Other scientists are investigating where else CKDu might exist. In the second half of this year, Strasma and her colleagues at Duke will begin screening farmers and other workers in Kenya to look for cases there. It has long been known that heat can kill, but deaths were thought to be rare or, more recently, tied to extreme temperature events. “There's all this good research on the maximum amount of heat that humans can take,” says Vecellio. “But heat kills well before we get to these thresholds.” The combined effects of exertion, dehydration and humidity alongside age, body size, acclimation to the local climate and other physiological differences mean that any individual's threshold might be lower. And intense heat can be particularly problematic in places where night-time temperatures don't get low enough to offer relief. There are more hints that long-term exposure to excessive heat can increase people's risk of, or even cause, disease, Vecellio says. A small dialysis unit operates in the Bajo Lempa town of San Pedro, but demand is so high that people who do get a dialysis spot can attend only two days per week (three times per week is considered standard). At any given time, the hospital might have 5 spots available per 1,000 people who need dialysis, Jarquín says. The people waiting for treatment can't get a place until someone receiving dialysis has died. Some individuals whose kidneys are struggling but have not yet failed can benefit from controlling their blood pressure and diabetes that might occur alongside CKDu, as well as making dietary changes and seeking alternate employment if possible. García-Trabanino — who sees people from Bajo Lempa at a private haemodialysis centre in San Salvador — says that with blood pressure medications, improved nutrition and hydration, some people have staved off progression to kidney failure for more than two decades. Together with local non-profit organizations, Jarquín is working to provide regular health tests for community members. Although the tests don't look for CKDu-specific biomarkers, they can still catch declining kidney function before dialysis is required. It was the results of one of these tests that brought Oscar to the AGDYSA clinic in Tierra Blanca for further consultation with Jarquín. Sitting in the waiting room, Oscar's wife murmured reassurances as she caressed his knuckles with her thumb. Would they need to sell their few cows, pigs and chickens to keep a roof over their heads and pay for his dialysis? Jarquín told Oscar that although he had kidney disease, it was mild. It's a matter of life and death, said Jarquín. This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on June 4, 2025.

Mechanical forces can cause plasma membrane damage2, but it is not known whether there are large molecules that regulate plasma membrane integrity under mechanical strain. Here we constructed a 384-well cellular stretch system that delivers precise, reproducible strain to cultured cells. Using the system, we screened 10,843 siRNAs targeting 2,726 multi-pass transmembrane proteins for strain-induced membrane permeability changes. We demonstrate that NINJ1 is a critical regulator for mechanical strain-induced plasma membrane rupture (PMR), without the need of stimulating any cell death programs. Our work establishes that NINJ1 functions as a bona fide determinant of membrane biomechanical properties. Our study also suggests that PMR across tissues of distinct mechanical microenvironments is subjected to fine tuning by differences in NINJ1 expression and external forces.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study led by Keck Medicine of USC researchers may have uncovered an effective combination therapy for glioblastoma, a brain tumor diagnosis with few available effective treatments. The study finds that using Tumor Treating Fields therapy (TTFields), which delivers targeted waves of electric fields directly into tumors to stop their growth and signal the body's immune system to attack cancerous tumor cells, may extend survival among patients with glioblastoma, when combined with immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (temozolomide). TTFields disrupt tumor growth using low-intensity, alternating electric fields that push and pull key structures inside tumor cells in continually shifting directions, making it difficult for the cells to multiply. Preventing tumor growth gives patients a better chance of successfully fighting the cancer. When used to treat glioblastoma, TTFields are delivered through a set of mesh electrodes that are strategically positioned on the scalp, generating fields at a precise frequency and intensity focused on the tumor. Patients wear the electrodes for approximately 18 hours a day. TTFields are often combined with chemotherapy in cancer treatment. However, even with aggressive treatment, the prognosis for glioblastoma remains poor. Immunotherapy, while successful in many other cancer types, has also not proved effective for glioblastoma when used on its own. Pembrolizumab, the immunotherapy used in this study, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), which enhances the body's natural ability to fight cancers by improving T cells' ability to identify and attack cancer cells. Sometimes, this barrier even blocks T cells and other therapies that could help kill brain tumors. This immunosuppressive environment inside and around the glioblastoma is what makes common cancer therapies like pembrolizumab and chemotherapy significantly less effective in treating it. Tran theorized the best way to get around this issue was to start an immune reaction directly inside the tumor itself, an approach known as in situ immunization, using TTFields. This study demonstrates that combining TTFields with immunotherapy triggers a potent immune response within the tumor -- one that ICIs can then amplify to bolster the body's own defense against cancer. And just like in team sports, the best defense is a good offense," said Tran, who is also a member of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. The study analyzed data from 2-THE-TOP, a Phase 2 clinical trial, which enrolled 31 newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients who had completed chemoradiation therapy. Of those, 26 received TTFields combined with both chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Seven of these 26 patients had inoperable tumors due to their locations -- an especially high-risk subgroup with the worst prognosis and few treatment options. The number and duration of treatments were determined by patients' response to treatment. Moreover, those with large, inoperable tumors lived approximately 13 months longer and showed much stronger immune activation compared to patients who underwent surgical removal of their tumors. "Further studies are needed to determine the optimal role of surgery in this setting, but these findings may offer hope, particularly for glioblastoma patients who do not have surgery as an option," said Tran. Tran, who has been researching TTFields for more than a decade, serves as the chair of the steering committee for this trial. This Phase 3 trial, currently open at 28 sites across the United States, Europe and Israel, aims to enroll over 740 patients through April 2029, including those with gross total resection, partial resection or biopsy-only tumors to assess the extent of how surgically removing tumors influences immune response.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A small region of the brain, known as the ventral tegmental area (VTA), plays a key role in how we process rewards. It produces dopamine, a neuromodulator that helps predict future rewards based on contextual cues. This discovery, made possible by a machine learning algorithm, highlights the value of combining artificial intelligence with neuroscience. In a recent study, Alexandre Pouget's team, in collaboration with Naoshige Uchida of Harvard University and Paul Masset of McGill University, shows that the VTA's coding is even more sophisticated than previously thought. "Rather than predicting a weighted sum of future rewards, the VTA predicts their temporal evolution. In other words, each gain is represented separately, with the precise moment at which it is expected," explains the UNIGE researcher, who led this work. This diversity is what allows the encoding of reward timing. This much finer representation gives the learning system great flexibility, allowing it to adapt to maximise immediate or delayed rewards, depending on the individual's goals and priorities." These findings stem from a fruitful dialogue between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Alexandre Pouget developed a purely mathematical algorithm that incorporates the timing of reward processing. Meanwhile, the Harvard researchers gathered extensive neurophysiological data on VTA activity in animals experiencing rewards. "They then applied our algorithm to their data and found that the results matched perfectly with their empirical findings." While the brain inspires AI and machine learning techniques, these results demonstrate that algorithms can also serve as powerful tools to reveal our neurophysiological mechanisms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Understanding the famously complex Inter-universal Teichmüller Theory could solve mathematics' greatest problems. It's likely that you won't understand any of the mathematics in this article, but you'd be in good company—most mathematicians don't understand it, either. That's because we're talking about the famously difficult Inter-universal Teichmüller Theory (IUT), first proposed across 2,000 pages in 2012 by Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki and vigorously debated in the 13 years since: is it a revolutionary way of understanding mathematics or a complete waste of time? According to mathematics expert Kato Fumimot, speaking to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the theory is almost an otherworldly creation. “If he were to give a speech in front of a large group of Earthlings, surely no one would understand what he is saying, and no matter how many times he repeats it, there would be no progress.” According to some estimates, only two dozen or so mathematicians in the world can even begin to understand this mysterious language. However, it seems that a promising new mathematician may have recently been added to their number. Zhou Zhongpeng isn't a learned professor or noted mathematician, but a former doctoral student turned tech worker—one that happens to be obsessed with learning IUT. Zhou promptly quit his tech job and began working with Fesenko. Formulated in 1637 and named after French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, the theorem states that no three positive integers (a, b, and c) can satisfy the equation an + bn = cn where “n” is greater than two. Zhou's work could solve such a theorem in fewer steps and also prove useful for other mathematical enigmas. For now, IUT remains a mostly an “alien language.” And because so many of the theory's adherents live in Japan, New Scientist says that, effectively, the proof is only true in that country. Only time will tell whether that claim spreads to eventually envelop the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New Doubts about Milky Way–Andromeda Collision, Explanation of 2023 Marine Heat Wave and Worms That Build Towers The Milky Way's big crash with Andromeda might not be a sure thing. Let's kick off the week with a quick roundup of some science news you may have missed. You've probably heard that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is doomed to collide with the neighboring Andromeda galaxy sometime around 5 billion years from now. But according to new research, maybe we shouldn't count on this multigalactic merger deal going through. In a study published last Monday in Nature Astronomy, researchers who analyzed data from the European Space Agency's Gaia space telescope and NASA's Hubble say the event is more of a coin flip than a given: the team's 100,000 computer simulations suggest there's just about a 50–50 chance of the two galaxies colliding within the next 10 billion years or so.

In other space news, scientists are buzzing about a tiny star that punches way above its weight. But in a study published last Wednesday in Nature Astronomy, researchers say they've spotted the signature of a giant planet orbiting the little guy. The planet, called TOI-6894b, is described as a low-density gas giant—it is a little bigger than Saturn, but only has around half as much mass. Astronomers say the presence of a gas giant around such a small star is so surprising that it challenges the most widely accepted theory of planet formation. That theory, called core accretion, suggests that giant planets are born when their solid cores get massive enough to start pulling in lots of gas. Smaller stars generally lack enough gas and dust in their protoplanetary discs to allow for such a process, but this red dwarf ended up with a gas giant anyhow. Because red dwarf stars are super common in our galaxy, this could mean gas giants are more plentiful than we thought. A study published last Wednesday in Nature aimed to explain why. While climate change, of course, played a role, the new study pinpoints some other factors that made water temperatures particularly hot that summer. For starters, in June and July of that year, the winds over the North Atlantic were weaker than at any other period on record, which meant less churning to mix sun-warmed surface waters. The researchers also note that it's possible a reduction in sulphur emissions led to fewer clouds in some areas, so more sunlight hit the water. But the scientists were quick to add that weak wind was the primary driver—and that climate change is likely to make things worse. Reducing pollution from the atmosphere, generally speaking, remains a great thing to do. In a news release, the study's lead author noted that if we don't cut down our fossil fuel emissions, extreme marine heat waves like the one we saw in 2023 will only get more common and more intense. And that's bad news for everyone: warm water releases heat into the atmosphere, contributing to heat waves and severe rainstorms. And higher water temperatures are tied to increases in coral bleaching as well. But another study, published last Thursday in Frontiers in Marine Science, offers some hope for ailing coral—not from bleaching but from a disease that can be just as devastating to a reef. Stony coral tissue loss disease, or SCTLD, was first identified off the coast of Florida just over a decade ago and has now been spotted on reefs throughout the Caribbean. SCTLD quickly destroys a coral's soft tissue, with some species dying within weeks of symptoms appearing. It's not clear exactly what causes SCTLD, but it seems likely that bacteria at least play a part because treating affected corals with an antibiotic paste has been shown to help them survive. This new study reports on the promising results of treating coral with probiotics instead. Corals have microbiomes just like we do, and a boost of good bacteria seems to help keep them healthy. In 2020 the scientists took their experiment into the ocean, applying a solution of seawater and probiotics to a Florida reef impacted by SCTLD and using weighted plastic bags to create a sort of in-ocean aquarium that kept the treatment from floating away. More research is needed to see how this treatment might impact coral in other regions, but probiotics could prove to be an important tool for fighting this devastating disease. We'll wrap up today's episode with something fun, if maybe also a little bit creepy: an act of “collective hitchhiking” featuring a living tower of worms. Nematodes are tiny worms that you probably don't spend much time thinking about, but they're actually the most abundant animals on Earth, making up an estimated four fifths of all animal life on our planet. According to a study published last Thursday in Current Biology, these creatures might sometimes use their vast numbers to make up for their miniscule size. Individual nematodes will sometimes stand on their tails and wave around to try to hitch a ride on a passing animal. Scientists have long suspected that they can also link together to form multi-worm “towers” to increase their height, but this had only ever been observed in a lab setting. In the new study scientists describe seeing some of these waving worm towers inside decaying apples and pears found in the dirt of orchards. Further observations proved that, far from a chaotic pile of worms, these structures reflect the kind of superorganism behavior we see in slime molds and fire ants. So the next time you're struggling with a group project at school or work, just remind yourself that even nematodes can figure out how to work together.

Developing robotic hands that adapt to real-world dynamics remains a fundamental challenge in robotics and machine intelligence. Despite notable advances in replicating human-hand kinematics and control algorithms, robotic systems still struggle to match human capabilities in dynamic environments, primarily due to inadequate tactile feedback. To bridge this gap, we present F-TAC Hand, a biomimetic hand featuring high-resolution tactile sensing (0.1-mm spatial resolution) across 70% of its surface area. Through optimized hand design, we overcome traditional challenges in integrating high-resolution tactile sensors while preserving the full range of motion. The hand, powered by our generative algorithm that synthesizes human-like hand configurations, demonstrates robust grasping capabilities in dynamic real-world conditions. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates that this tactile-embodied system significantly outperforms non-tactile-informed alternatives in complex manipulation tasks (P < 0.0001). These results provide empirical evidence for the critical role of rich tactile embodiment in developing advanced robotic intelligence, offering promising perspectives on the relationship between physical sensing capabilities and intelligent behaviour. Precise sensory–motor control in real-world scenarios is fundamental to machine intelligence and embodied artificial intelligence (AI)1,2. A hallmark challenge in this field is the control of dextrous robotic hands3. Despite advances in mechatronic systems and sophisticated finger designs that enable enhanced dexterity4, the limited availability of rich sensory feedback fundamentally restricts their ability to adapt during dynamic interactions5,6. Understanding and addressing this sensory limitation is crucial for deploying robotic hands in real-world scenarios that demand nuanced control and rapid adaptation. The robotics community has long recognized this challenge, approaching it through increasingly sophisticated hardware and control strategies. On the hardware front, researchers have developed intricate mechanical designs that closely mimic human-hand kinematics7,8,9,10,11, primarily relying on proprioceptive sensing for joint-level feedback. These hardware advances, often combined with visual perception, have enabled various control paradigms: from planning-based methods that execute precise finger gaiting12,13 to learning-based approaches that develop control policies through training14,15,16 and recently to large language models that provide high-level task reasoning17. However, a fundamental limitation persists: without the direct sensation of local contacts—crucial information for both modelling and control—these systems fail to handle unexpected physical interactions5. The solution may lie in understanding human hand control, which achieves remarkable precise control through a sophisticated tactile perception system. This biological system comprises two key elements: a dense array of tactile sensors embedded throughout the skin18,19,20 and specialized neural processing in the primary somatosensory cortex that rapidly interprets and integrates this massive sensory input20,21,22. This combination enables humans to instantly detect and respond to subtle contact changes during manipulation, a capability that current robotic systems have yet to replicate. Drawing direct inspiration from this biological architecture, we present F-TAC Hand (Full-Hand Tactile-Embedded Biomimetic Hand), a system that bridges the sensory gap in robotic manipulation. The core innovation lies in its comprehensive tactile sensing capability, featuring high-resolution coverage (0.1-mm spatial resolution) across 70% of the hand surface. This is achieved through the effective integration of 17 vision-based tactile sensors in six optimized configurations, where sensor covers serve dual purposes as both sensing elements and structural components. The hand maintains full human-like dexterity, demonstrated by its high Kapandji score23 and ability to perform all 33 human grasp types24. Complementing this hardware, we developed a generative algorithm that produces human-like hand configurations, creating a rich knowledge base for object interaction. The integration enables closed-loop tactile-informed control that processes high-dimensional contact data for precise, adaptive manipulation. To rigorously validate F-TAC Hand's capabilities, we focused on multi-object grasping—a task that epitomizes the challenges of dextrous manipulation5,25. While single-object manipulation has been successfully addressed by one-degree-of-freedom (1-DoF) parallel grippers26,27,28, simultaneous manipulation of multiple objects presents two distinct challenges: it requires both precise contact detection across the entire hand and strategic motion adjustments to prevent object collisions. Through comprehensive tactile sensing, F-TAC Hand directly addresses these challenges. Extensive evaluation across 600 real-world trials demonstrates significant performance improvements over non-tactile alternatives (P < 0.0001), particularly in scenarios involving real-world execution noise and dynamic object interactions. Our work advances the field through two primary contributions: a practical demonstration that full-hand tactile sensing can be achieved without compromising hand motion capabilities, and comprehensive empirical validation of its benefits. By solving the technical challenges that previously restricted tactile sensing to simple grippers, this research enables unprecedented investigations into sophisticated tactile-embodied intelligence6. More broadly, our results provide concrete evidence for the critical role of rich sensory feedback in intelligent behaviour, suggesting promising directions for developing embodied AI systems beyond purely computational approaches29,30. F-TAC Hand advances the state of dextrous robotic hands through its comprehensive tactile sensing capabilities while maintaining a full range of motion. The hand achieves human-like tactile coverage, with sensing elements extending across 70% of the palmar surface at a density of 10,000 taxels (the pixels in camera CMOS) cm−2 (Fig. 1), notably surpassing current commercial solutions such as Shadow Hand, which provides only five-point feedback over less than 20% of its surface11 (comparison with other tactile arrays is available in Supplementary Section 1). This extensive coverage is achieved through an array of vision-based tactile sensors in multiple configurations (see exploded view in Extended Data Fig. 1a and physical dimensions in Supplementary Section 1), featuring specially designed covers that align with the hand's phalanges and palm to minimize mechanical redundancy while replicating the natural kinematic structure of the human hand (Fig. Each of the five fingers incorporates three DoFs, contributing to the hand's total 15-DoF configuration that enables human-like dexterity. A specialized electronic module enables large-scale sensor reading acquisition while minimizing space, weight and cabling requirements (Extended Data Fig. The hand's dimensions mirror those of an adult human hand, measuring 194 mm from wrist to middle fingertip (Fig. 2a), and its modular design architecture allows for easy adaptation to different physical dimensions while maintaining functionality. F-TAC Hand is a dextrous robotic hand featuring a high-density tactile sensing array that matches human capabilities, as benchmarked against physiological data from ref. Detailed illustrations of the sensor construction and assembly process are provided in Fig. Similarly to its biological counterpart, it leverages sophisticated tactile feedback to accomplish complex manipulation tasks, such as precise in-hand object pose arrangement, enabling simultaneous and stable grasping of multiple items, a capability highlighted as challenging but crucial in ref. a, The seamless integration of 17 vision-based sensors in six configurations, maintaining 15 DoFs—three per finger—and adult hand dimensions. Each sensor includes a streamlined camera module for efficient tactile data acquisition in confined space. b, F-TAC Hand demonstrates its strength by holding a 2.5-kg dumbbell; each phalanx contributes to a total grasping force of 10.3 N. c, Schematic representation of a finger, with Kn, θn and F denoting joint stiffness, rotation angle and cable force, respectively. Offsets in rotation due to cable and joint alignment are also shown. d, Top-down-view comparison of F-TAC Hand and human finger flexion. e, Despite the numerous sensors, F-TAC Hand retains its mobility, as evidenced by a successful Kapandji test23, where the thumb fingertip sequentially touches specific points on the hand as numbered in the figure. PP, proximal phalanx; MP, middle phalanx; DIP, distal interphalangeal; PIP, proximal interphalangeal; MCP, metacarpophalangeal. Building upon its extensive tactile sensing coverage, F-TAC Hand also achieves comprehensive motion capabilities that match state-of-the-art dextrous hands9,10,11. The hand implements full mobility using just five slim cables (Extended Data Fig. Each cable controls the flexion and extension of a finger (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e), working in concert with stiffness-tuned springs at each joint (Fig. 2c) to replicate the coordinated yet semi-independent movements characteristic of human hands31 (Fig. An additional degree of actuation enables thumb opposition, expanding the hand's motion versatility (Extended Data Fig. The hand's dexterity is demonstrated through two evaluations: the Kapandji test23, completing all ten designated thumb-to-hand contact points shown in Fig. 2e, and the successful execution of all 33 human grasp types (Fig. Empowered by its smart design, the workspace of F-TAC Hand enables it to perform all 33 human grasping types, as documented in ref. The hand's tactile sensing system utilizes the photometric stereo principle32,33, converting light intensity variations into surface gradient information (Fig. Contact surface geometry is reconstructed through a two-stage process. First, an array of encoder–decoder neural networks (Fig. 4b) maps physics-based relationships between surface gradients and intensity variations for each sensor. Next, a Poisson solver generates high-fidelity surface geometries, visualized as normal maps (Fig. The detailed sensor characteristics are available in Supplementary Section 1. a–d, Raw tactile sensor readings from the configuration shown in Fig. 1a (a) are processed by neural networks (b) to reconstruct contact site geometries (c), visualized as normal maps. The neural networks, trained on simulated data (d) generated by a physics-based image formation model, enable efficient and precise mapping of extensive raw data to geometric information at the contact interface. e,f, When grasping an object (e), F-TAC Hand captures detailed contact information through its advanced tactileer sensing capabilities (f). g, This rich tactile feedback enables F-TAC Hand to accurately perceive and interpret object characteristics, as demonstrated by its precise estimation of in-hand object poses. The unprecedented scale of F-TAC Hand's tactile sensing system required development of efficient calibration solutions. We addressed this through a physics-based image formation model (detailed in Supplementary Sections 2 and 3) that generates synthetic readings of elastomer deformations during contacts (Fig. This approach enables efficient neural network training (Fig. The integration of fine-grained tactile sensing with robust motion capabilities enables F-TAC Hand to effectively grasp diverse objects, including challenging cases such as crystal balls (Fig. 4e), while simultaneously capturing detailed contact information (Fig. These sensory data enable accurate object pose estimation during manipulation (Fig. Additional demonstrations are provided in Supplementary Video. Through this combination of dense tactile arrays and advanced motor capabilities, F-TAC Hand achieves unprecedented biomimetic fidelity, advancing both robotic manipulation capabilities and our understanding of human manual dexterity. While F-TAC Hand's high articulation enables sophisticated manipulation, it presents unique challenges in grasp planning. The increased number of DoFs makes traditional mechanical equation-based methods computationally intractable34. Learning-based alternatives35, though avoiding complex analytical solutions, require extensive training data that are both costly to collect and potentially biased by human demonstration preferences—a particular challenge for highly articulated dextrous hands. We model the robotic grasp generation of rigid objects as sampling hand poses from a Gibbs distribution conditioned on object geometry. Each grasp is associated with an energy value derived from force closure criteria, which evaluates how well the grasp can resist external forces. Lower energy values indicate better grasping capability; see ‘Probabilistic formulation for grasp generation' in Methods and Supplementary Section 4 for details. Due to the hand's high number of DoFs and the non-convex nature of the problem36, we sample grasps from random initializations and apply a modified Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm to reduce energy and escape local minima, converging to low-energy, high-quality grasps; see ‘Exploration algorithm for complex energy landscape' in Methods for details. We validated the approach using a diverse test set of 23 objects, including spheres, cylinders, cuboids and irregular shapes (Fig. By executing the algorithm from various initializations, F-TAC Hand's biomimetic kinematics (Extended Data Fig. 2) and varied object geometries result in diverse grasping poses (Supplementary Video). a, A total of 23 objects, varying in dimensions and geometrical complexity, are chosen to assess the efficacy of the grasp generation method. b–d, The landscape of possible grasps is depicted as a disconnectivity graph, generated using the ADELM algorithm. e, For the pliers, the diversity in grasp strategies mirrors its common usage in daily human activities. f, This diversity in grasping strategies is maintained even when the object possesses complex geometric features. g, Comprehensive categorization of the generated grasps for all 23 objects, on the basis of human grasp types adopted from ref. The resulting grasping poses are analysed through the Attraction–Diffusion Energy Landscape Mapping (ADELM) algorithm37 to visualize the complex energy landscape defined in equation (2), as shown in Fig. In this visualization, circles represent local minima (areas of low energy), where each local minimum contains at least one feasible grasp. The circle's size indicates how many similar grasps exist within that local minimum. The vertical connecting bars between circles represent energy barriers between different local minima, where shorter bars indicate easier transitions between grasping poses, while longer bars signify transitions that are more difficult to achieve. Direct comparisons between generated grasps and human demonstrations (Fig. This approach maintains its effectiveness even for challenging cases such as pliers and adversarial objects38 (Fig. 5e,f), with comprehensive energy landscapes presented in Extended Data Fig. To quantitatively assess the human-like diversity of our approach, we analysed 1,800 generated grasps according to the taxonomy of ref. 24, categorizing them into 19 common grasp types (Supplementary Section 5). 5g) demonstrates comprehensive coverage across the human grasp repertoire, from frequent strategies such as power sphere and precision sphere to specialized configurations such as distal type and palmar grasps. Further analysis using contact maps39 reveals natural clustering patterns that align with human grasp classifications. By applying dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis and visualization via t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (Extended Data Fig. 4), we observe distinct groupings of power and precision grasps, with intermediate grasps appropriately positioned near the boundary defined by a radial-basis-function-kernel support vector classifier. This distribution mirrors human grasp categorization patterns, where intermediate grasps share characteristics of both primary types (computational details in Supplementary Section 6). The demonstrated ability to generate diverse, human-like hand configurations provides F-TAC Hand with both optimal and near-optimal control strategies. This algorithmic foundation, working in concert with the low-level controller, enables enhanced dexterity and adaptability in real-world manipulation scenarios. The integration of advanced tactile sensing with diverse grasping strategies enables F-TAC Hand to implement a closed-loop sensory–motor feedback mechanism, allowing real-time adaptation to environmental changes. The implementation details are illustrated in Extended Data Fig. We demonstrate F-TAC Hand's capabilities through multi-object grasping5, a critical benchmark for hand dexterity that surpasses the limitations of 1-DoF parallel grippers. This challenging task demands precise contact detection and strategic adjustments to avoid collisions—capabilities that remain elusive for current AI systems5. While recent advances13,25 show promise, managing the stochastic nature of real-world objects, especially those with complex geometries, remains challenging. F-TAC Hand overcomes these limitations through precise contact-point identification (Fig. b, Despite execution noise, F-TAC Hand can optimize object transport through multi-object grasping. c, Real-world disturbances significantly increase second-grasp collision rates (inset: collision detection point in red), highlighting the necessity of tactile monitoring. d, Tactile-informed adaptation significantly improves second-grasp success rates. Plots c and d show 60 independent technical replicates (blue dots), each representing a unique object combination tested across 10 trials. Shaded areas (orange in c, green in d) show kernel-density estimations of data distribution. The identical P values (2.1 × 10−17) displayed in the two panels derive from one-sided paired t-tests (t(59) = 11.8) comparing perfect versus real-world execution (c) and with versus without tactile-informed adaptation (d). No adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. To evaluate real-world performance, we mounted F-TAC Hand on a Kinova Gen3 robotic arm for multi-object transport tasks (Fig. The goal is to grasp as many objects as possible in one go to maximize transportation efficiency. While optimal strategies exist under ideal conditions (red route in Fig. 6b), real-world variables—such as imperfect robot positioning and object perception—require adaptive motor control. The other coloured routes in Fig. 6b illustrate actual scenarios where F-TAC Hand encountered wrong object positions but leveraged its comprehensive tactile sensing capabilities (Fig. 4g) to assess situations and dynamically switch to alternative strategies that accommodate available space, even if theoretically suboptimal. Additional demonstrations of adaptive behaviours, including responses to finger impairments and ball size adaptation, are shown in Extended Data Fig. We quantified the impact of tactile sensing through extensive experiments involving 60 object combinations across 600 real-world trials. Initial grasps were programmed from a disembodied AI perspective, using theoretically optimal strategies without considering environmental dynamics. Each combination underwent ten real-world trials, with tactile feedback assessing in-hand object positions and potential collision risks. Collision detection involves two steps: using tactile information to estimate the grasped object's pose as shown in Fig. The observed collision rate in real-world execution (M = 0.465, s.d. = 0.306) differed significantly from theoretical predictions (M = 0.000, s.d. = 0.000), highlighting the substantial gap between simulation and reality, t(59) = 11.8, P = 2.1 × 10−17 (Fig. F-TAC Hand's adaptive capabilities become particularly evident when comparing tactile-informed versus non-tactile-informed control. Upon detecting collision risks, the system rapidly (~100 ms) switches to alternative strategies that might be suboptimal in theory but practical in reality. In scenarios with potential collisions, the non-tactile-informed approach inevitably fails, while the tactile-informed approach maintains productivity through adaptive replanning. The tactile-informed approach achieved perfect adaptation (M = 1.000, s.d. = 0.000) compared with significantly lower success rates without tactile feedback (M = 0.535, s.d. Notably, in collision-free scenarios, the two approaches demonstrate comparable execution times, with tactile-informed collision checking adding only ~1 s of processing time, indicating that tactile sensing provides critical robustness with minimal computational overhead during normal operations. The detailed method and the logic chain are available in ‘Context-sensitive motor controls' in Methods. F-TAC Hand represents a substantial advance in robotic sensory–motor integration, achieving unprecedented integration of comprehensive tactile sensing with human-like dexterity. Its high-density tactile coverage (70% of palmar surface, 10,000 taxels cm−2) substantially exceeds current robotic hand capabilities. This exceptional sensing is achieved through the effective integration of vision-based tactile sensors, physics-based calibration methods and specialized electronics—all while maintaining full motion capabilities. Recent advances in tactile sensing33,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48 have primarily focused on parallel grippers. While these sensor-equipped grippers demonstrate enhanced capabilities in specific tasks—such as cable following26, surface following27 and articulated object manipulation28—their low-DoF mechanical structure fundamentally limits their dexterity for complex manipulation. In contrast, F-TAC Hand's integration of comprehensive tactile feedback with high articulation enables more sophisticated manipulation, as demonstrated by its successful multi-object grasping under uncertain conditions. The closed-loop sensory–motor feedback enables context-sensitive adaptations, significantly improving performance in dynamic real-world scenarios. This combination of sensing and adaptability is essential for practical robotics applications requiring safe and efficient environmental interaction. The design philosophy behind F-TAC Hand emphasizes replicability, aiming to catalyse broader research in tactile-enabled manipulation. Its achievement of human-like capabilities opens possibilities in prosthetics, teleoperation, collaborative robotics and human–robot interaction. The hardware's compact, modular architecture facilitates efficient data acquisition and calibration while being adaptable to various robotic platforms. The training-free stochastic optimization approach for grasp generation remains platform independent, enabling rapid deployment across different hand designs (Extended Data Fig. While our current implementation assumes known object geometry, this was a deliberate scope decision to focus on tactile-informed adaptive control rather than geometry reconstruction. Pre-grasping geometry acquisition could be readily integrated using existing vision techniques49,50, and real-time reconstruction during manipulation represents a promising direction for future work. This combination of diverse grasping capabilities and environmental adaptability makes F-TAC Hand particularly suited for complex manipulation tasks. Beyond technical achievements, our results suggest that practical AI requires tight integration between sensory processing and strategic adaptation. The demonstrated importance of comprehensive tactile feedback in achieving human-like dexterity aligns with cognitive and neuroscientific perspectives that emphasize the essential role of physical interaction in intelligence51,52,53,54. The tactile sensor design for F-TAC Hand's distal phalanx (Extended Data Fig. 1a) addresses key challenges in miniaturization and integration. A custom camera module using a single flexible flat cable for both power and data transmission resolves traditional cabling constraints. The sensor housing's U-shaped clevis and tang structure enables the interconnection necessary for anthropomorphic articulation. Contact detection relies on analysing elastomer surface deformation through reflected light intensity. To achieve uniform illumination in the confined phalanx space, we developed a specialized Lambertian membrane. This membrane combines an air-brushed spherical aluminium film (mill-resistant matte oil with 1-μm spherical aluminium powder) with a clear silicone base (Smooth-On Solaris parts A&B, 1:1 ratio). The illumination system comprises surface-mounted Lumileds LUXEON 2835 Color Line light-emitting diodes (red, green, blue and white) arranged around an acrylic support, enhanced by light-diffuser films. An OV2640 image sensor with a 160° wide-angle lens provides colour-compatible imaging, while 7-mm × 7-mm × 4-mm heat sinks ensure thermal stability. The complete sensing system architecture (Extended Data Fig. 1b) integrates these components with a custom control module. The module interfaces with cameras through digital video ports, maintaining 240-px × 240-px image buffers. Spatial resolution of 0.1 mm per pixel is achieved, verified through known-object calibration. An expanded Serial Peripheral Interface bus coordinates sequential camera captures, with USB connectivity for PC data transmission and U2D2 protocol for servo control. The tactile components are integrated into anatomically scaled phalanx covers matching adult hand dimensions. This modular, single-cable design overcomes traditional challenges in implementing high-resolution, extensive tactile sensing in robotic hands. F-TAC Hand's structure (Extended Data Fig. 1c) integrates 17 compact vision-based sensors in six configurations to achieve human-hand proportions. The four fingers—index, middle, ring and little—share a common architecture (Extended Data Fig. 1d) with three serial revolute joints: metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal, each offering 0–90° range. These joints utilize aluminium shafts supported by deep-groove ball bearings, with screw-bushing fixation and torsion springs maintaining a 0° rest position. The thumb design (Extended Data Fig. 1e) features an additional carpometacarpal joint DoF, enabling 90° motion range with a 45° offset from its proximal interphalangeal joint axis. The two-part palm base facilitates assembly and houses compact tactile sensors, with the upper region incorporating dual cameras in a single sensor for enhanced perception (Extended Data Fig. Finger actuation employs a cable-driven mechanism, with a single cable routed along both sides of each finger's phalanxes, converging at the palm base. Torsion springs facilitate a return to rest position upon cable relaxation. Each finger is powered by a DYNAMIXEL XC330X-T288-T servo motor. For experimental validation, F-TAC Hand mounts onto a 7-DoF Kinova Gen3 manipulator. The generation of grasp configurations for multifingered robotic hands presents notable challenges, particularly when maximizing dextrous capabilities. Instead of relying on data-driven approaches that demand extensive annotated datasets, we formulate grasp generation as a Gibbs distribution sampling problem: where H = (T, q) represents the hand's pose and joint configurations, O denotes the target object, E(H, O) defines the grasping energy function and Z is the intractable normalizing constant. The hand's surface geometry S(H) is computed through forward kinematics. To assess the quality of the grasp, we use force closure criteria to define Egrasp(H, O): where x = {xi} represents frictional contact points on S(H), and FC(x, O) assesses force closure formation on the object. Ephy enforces physical constraints by penalizing hand–object penetration and joint limit violations: where \({d}_{O}^{{\rm{SDF}}}(v)\) defines the signed distance function from point v to object O, and \([{q}_{j}^{\min },{q}_{j}^{\max }]\) specifies joint limits for each of the J joints. This probabilistic formulation enables scalable generation of diverse, effective grasp configurations. The nonlinearity of hand kinematics and contact-point selection creates a complex energy landscape for E, making naive gradient-based sampling prone to suboptimal local minima. We address this through a modified Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm that alternates between contact-point sampling and gradient-based pose optimization. The algorithm initializes with random hand pose H and contact points x ⊂ S(H). Each iteration stochastically chooses between updating the hand pose via Langevin dynamics or replacing a contact point with a uniform sample from the hand surface. Updates undergo Metropolis–Hastings acceptance criteria, favouring lower-energy configurations. This combination of stochastic updates enables escape from local minima, while Metropolis acceptance guides sampling toward low-energy configurations. An algorithm efficiency analysis is detailed in Supplementary Section 7. 7 demonstrates adaptive control in a four-ball transport scenario, where ball repositories are weighted and combined by volume. Initially, at t1, F-TAC Hand plans to grasp a golf ball and softball using its little finger and remaining digits. To illustrate the control mechanism, we introduce a manual perturbation during golf-ball acquisition, causing F-TAC Hand to secure the golf ball with its index finger at t2. Through comprehensive tactile sensing, F-TAC Hand detects the situation and adapts by executing an alternative approach—grasping a yoga ball using its thumb, index and middle fingers. While this solution was initially considered suboptimal, it demonstrates the system's capacity for real-time adaptation to unexpected conditions.

We examine the grasp relationships among six example objects (pawn, vase, multimeter, board eraser, coffee bottle, and Coke can) using a large disconnectivity graph. This landscape comprises 79 basins, each categorized into one of three grasp types (Power, Intermediate, Precision) based on the majority of grasps it contains. Within each basin, similar grasp strategies are observed across different objects, as illustrated in (a)-(f). Visualization of grasp samples with t-SNE reveals that most Power grasps and Precision grasps are clustered separately, with Intermediate grasps lying in between. This map indicates a strong alignment between the generated results and human definitions of grasp types.

It adjusts for in-hand position variations due to perturbations, dynamically adapting its second-stage strategy to prevent collisions and maximize efficiency (Light gray in the grasping repository indicates that grasping strategies are rendered infeasible at the current time).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Werner syndrome (WS), a rare genetic disorder that causes accelerated aging. This debilitating condition, which affects approximately nine per million people in Japan, lacks effective treatment options. Interestingly, a recent study from the Bohr lab (Nat Commun, 2019 Nov 21;10(1):5284) showed that patients with WS model systems and patients had decreased levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a biomolecule crucial for cellular energy production, DNA repair, and various metabolic processes. While direct NAD+ supplementation isn't feasible in mammals, using its precursor -- nicotinamide riboside (NR) from Niagen Bioscience -- has shown promising results in animal studies, extending lifespan and protecting against age-related decline. In human clinical trials, NR has also demonstrated benefits against chronic inflammation, metabolic disorders, and muscle weakness across various populations. However, the effects of NR in WS remained largely unexplored -- until now. In a recent study, a research team led by Associate Professor Masaya Koshizaka from the Center for Preventive Medical Sciences, Chiba University/Department of Diabetes, Metabolism and Endocrinology, Chiba University Hospital, Japan, conducted the world's first rigorous clinical trial of NR in patients with WS. This groundbreaking work involved a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of NR supplementation. Researchers tracked NAD+ blood levels, skin ulcer size, arterial stiffness, and kidney function. NR supplementation significantly increased NAD+ levels in patient blood compared to placebo. Importantly, NR improved arterial stiffness (a marker of cardiovascular disease risk), reduced the skin ulcer area, and appeared to slow the progression of kidney dysfunction -- all without any serious side effects. This suggests that NR may help protect kidney function, addressing another serious complication of WS. Dr. Yasmeen Nkrumah-Elie, Global Director of Niagen Bioscience's External Research Program called CERP, commented, "this study represents a significant step forward in understanding how NAD+ restoration with NR may help address the underlying biology of WS. By supporting cardiovascular, skin, and kidney health, NR shows potential to improve the quality of life for patients with this devastating condition. The results are particularly significant given that untreatable skin ulcers affect well over 70% of patients with WS, often leading to amputation, while cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of early mortality in this population. Though larger studies are needed to extend these findings, this pioneering research offers new hope for patients with WS who have long lacked effective treatment options. Beyond its immediate implications for this rare condition, the study also provides valuable insights into the biology of aging and potential interventions to address age-related decline more broadly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A damaging earthquake in Croatia had an unexpected bright side—revealing hidden Roman-era secrets. According to Brittanica, an odeum is a small concert hall, typically constructed as a theater for both musicians and orators to perform. Archaeologists called in to investigate the discovery uncovered three parallel semi-circular rows of stone blocks to hold an audience (all roughly 65 feet across), space for an orchestra, and the theater's podium (stage). At some point, a “monumental building with buttresses” was built over the theater, although archaeologists said more research is needed to understand what that building was designed for. While the northern Croatia city is now known as Sisak, it was once Roman Siscia, and was most prominent in the late third century, according to Atlas Obscura. Not much of the original Siscia still remains, save for a piece of a defensive wall outside the Sisak Cathedral. This newly-discovered Roman odeum has now become a prominent piece of the city's history, and will be a part of its future for many years to come.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, shifting tectonic plates -- these are all signs that our planet is alive. But what is revealed deep inside the Earth surprises laymen and scientists alike: Almost 3000 kilometers below the Earth's surface, solid rock is flowing that is neither liquid, like lava, nor brittle like solid rock. For over 50 years, researchers have been puzzling over a strange zone deep inside the Earth -- the so-called D" layer, around 2700 kilometers beneath our feet. Earthquake waves suddenly behave differently there: their speed jumps as if they were traveling through a different material. What exactly happens at that layer of the mantle has been unclear for a long time, until now. In 2004, Murakami, who has been a professor at ETH Zurich since 2017, discovered that perovskite, the main mineral of the Earth's lower mantle, transforms into a new mineral near the D" layer under extreme pressure and very high temperatures -- so-called "post-perovskite." But that was not the full story. In 2007, Murakami and colleagues found new evidence that the phase change of perovskite alone is not enough to accelerate earthquake waves. In an unusual laboratory experiment at ETH Zurich, Murakami has now proven that post-perovskite crystals align themselves in the identical direction under enormous pressure and extreme temperatures. The big question is: what makes these crystals line up? Researchers have long suspected that this movement -- a kind of convection like boiling water -- must exist but have never been able to prove it directly. A new chapter in Earth research begins Murakami and his colleagues have now also demonstrated experimentally that mantle convection of solid rock is present at the boundary between the core and the Earth's mantle, i.e. that solid -- not liquid -- rock flows slowly but steadily at this depth. With this knowledge, researchers can now begin to map the currents in the Earth's deepest interior and thus visualize the invisible motor that drives volcanoes, tectonic plates, and perhaps even the Earth's magnetic field.
