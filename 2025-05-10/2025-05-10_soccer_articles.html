The Norwegian had a hugely disappointing return to action as City failed to break down their ultra-stubborn hosts in a shock 0-0 stalemate

This should have been an ideal stage for Erling Haaland to demonstrate his power and sharpness ahead of the FA Cup final after six weeks out injured. Instead, it was a worrying performance from the Norwegian hitman and his Manchester City team-mates as they were held to a 0-0 draw by Southampton, who managed to avoid going down as the joint-worst team in Premier League history.

City bossed possession but the relegated Saints simply would not budge and put up a defensive wall which would not fall whatever City threw at it. The draw took Southampton on to 12 points for the season, edging ahead of Derby County's worst-ever tally of 11 and ensuring they will not join the Rams in the unwanted record books.

A victory would have all but secured City's place in the top five and Champions League qualification and although it remains likely, they did not need any more doubt to creep in, particularly one week before the FA Cup final against Crystal Palace.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Juventus director Cristiano Giuntoli dropped the biggest hint yet that Dusan Vlahovic could leave this summer, but confirms Igor Tudor will at least stay during the Club World Cup. You can follow all the build-up and action as it happens from today's three Serie A games on the Liveblog. It is an incredibly tight battle for that precious fourth place, as Juventus go into this weekend level in fourth place on 63 points with Lazio and Roma, while Bologna, Fiorentina and Milan are right behind this trio. “Clearly, the Champions League would help a great deal, both financially and in terms of prestige.” Vlahovic is on the bench today after shaking off an injury, but the director of sport was asked if there is any news on the Serbian striker's future and Giuntoli dropped the biggest hint yet that they could be parting ways. “We have a very good rapport with the player and his agent. If Vlahovic is to be sold, then the Premier League is likely to be his next destination, with Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea among the clubs interested. “These are young and fertile players who showed they can adapt to different coaches, so we hope to continue along this path and achieve our objective of Champions League qualification,” noted Giuntoli. “Tudor had a strong impact, we want to continue with him, but we can decide throughout the Club World Cup along with him whether or not to continue together.” Your email address will not be published.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The U.S. men's national team failed its first competitive test of the Mauricio Pochettino era in rather embarrassing fashion, losing to Panama 1-0 in a CONCACAF Nations League semifinal here at a half-empty SoFi Stadium. The Americans played timidly, unimaginatively and laboriously for 90 scoreless minutes. They were booed off the field at halftime. They looked uninspired, even with a home-soil World Cup on the horizon. They seemed destined for extra time against a team they were heavily favored to beat — and one that, based solely on talent, they should have beaten. [You could win $25K in the Women's Bracket Mayhem contest. Panama prevailed, and jumped for joy at midfield as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and the rest of the USMNT's golden generation trudged out of sight, into Sunday's third-place match. Panama will face Mexico, which beat Canada 2-0 in Thursday's late game, in the final on Sunday. They played just as they had toward the tail end of the Gregg Berhalter era. Berhalter was fired following the Copa América, largely because the U.S. lost to Panama 2-1 after playing most of a group-stage match with 10 men. His mandate was to revive a plateauing program. But in his first true elimination game, with 11 men, the U.S. suffered a familiar fate. Under head coach Thomas Christiansen, Los Canaleros are now 4-1 against the U.S. in competitive games. They frustrated the USMNT yet again on Thursday, and earned a famous result. And they gave Pochettino, and players, and fans a lot to chew on at the start of this last full calendar year before a landmark World Cup. "We didn't show aggression with the ball" — nor without it. "The first half was really painful to see," Pochettino said. They played with none of “the grit, the desire, the nastiness” that McKennie said Pochettino has been trying to instill, and as a result, they have relinquished their grip on regional supremacy; they flunked one of only two competitions that they'll have between now and June 2026; and they got this critical phase of World Cup preparations off to a downright dreadful start.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>German legend Lothar Matthaus has shared a blunt verdict on Inter Miami's chances in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. A total of 32 clubs from different parts of the globe will compete in the Club World Cup, slated to be hosted in the United States in June-July. Inter Miami has been pooled in Group A, alongside FC Porto, Al Ahly, and Palmeiras. “Inter Miami will make a run, but I don't think they can go to the final because the European teams and some teams from South America are stronger and better than the teams from Major League Soccer," Matthaus said, as per the Miami Herald. He, however, remains hopeful about Messi making an impression at the Club World Cup. “It's not too much pressure because Messi has had pressure all his life: World Cup finals, Copa America, national team games, club games, Champions League finals, El Clásico in Spain between Real Madrid and Barcelona. He knows what pressure means," Matthaus added. The former Bayern Munich star further referred to the competitiveness of the global event featuring European giants like Real Madrid, Manchester City, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, and Inter Milan. “This is a tournament where you can win a very important title: best club in the world. They'll be playing with their best first XI, they will give their best to win the title," he explained. “He is an idol for most kids. He's 11 years old, and I sometimes follow his football games. And when they have training sessions, you see a lot of Messi shirts. Inter Miami were recently knocked out of the CONCACAF Champions by Vancouver Whitecaps, who won the two-leg semi-finals on a 5-1 aggregate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former FIFA World Cup final referee Urs Meier feels that Szymon Marciniak was “perfect” in the Champions League clash semifinal second leg between Inter Milan and Barcelona. The former referee gave his analysis of several key decisions in that match on German broadcaster RAN, via FCInterNews. The Blaugranas have not hid their fury with Szymon Marciniak's decisions. From coach Hansi Flick, to midfielder Pedri, who insisted that “UEFA must investigate” the Polish referee, Barcelona have complained relentlessly of having been hard done by. Meanwhile, Spanish media has further inflamed this sense of injustice. However, former referee Urs Meier does not see any reason for these protests. Firstly, former referee Meier analyzed Inter's first half penalty. Szymon Marciniak pointed to the spot after advice from VAR to look at a challenge by Pau Cubarsi on Lautaro Martinez on his monitor. “You can see that Martinez put his leg in the right position. And Marciniak did well to make clear that it was actually just outside the area.” “I would have probably made the same decision as Marciniak,” he added. Meier insisted that “the entire process was perfect.” There was also one moment where Inter were very frustrated with Marciniak. Nicolo Barella found himself running through on Barcelona's goal, one-on-one with Wojcjech Szczesny – but Marciniak blew his whistle to end the period. “I think he'd let the match go on too long in extra time,” said former referee Meier. “And then he wasn't as focused with his final whistle.” “Then, and Inter player embraced the referee and said in a friendly gesture: ‘Yes, this can happen to you as well. Meier said that “I thought it was a good little gesture.” “But obviously, it was an unfortunate time for the whistle from Marciniak.” “That was probably the worst moment from him,” said Meier. “He needs to work on that, it wasn't good.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lot of money will be up for grabs when MLS side LAFC and Mexico's Club América battle for the final spot in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. After FIFA disqualified Liga MX side Club Léon from the tournament, it set up a one-match playoff to be hosted in May at LAFC's BMO Stadium. Club Léon's hopes of remaining in the Club World Cup were dashed when the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected their appeal and turned aside Costa Rica's LD Alajuelense, upholding FIFA's previous decision. Each group stage win is worth an additional $2 million in prize money. A club can also claim more if they advance several rounds in the tournament. The playoff winner will slot into Group D, where Léon was initially drawn, and take on England's Chelsea, Brazil's Flamengo and Tunisia's ES Tunis. Club Léon's disqualification resulted due to its ownership by Grupo Pachuca, the same ownership group that owns and operates CF Pachuca, another Liga MX team that has qualified for the tournament. The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, the first to include 32 teams, will kick off in Miami at Hard Rock Stadium on June 14, before finishing with a final at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on July 13.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A FIFA Club World Cup spot is on the line for MLS side LAFC and Liga MX's Club América this spring. FIFA shared initial plans earlier in the year, but the one-game playoff became official this week after the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld Mexico's Club Léon's disqualification. LAFC and Club América will clash on May 31 at LAFC's BMO Stadium, sources confirmed to Sports Illustrated. Club Léon, where former Real Madrid star James Rodriguez plays, is owned by Grupo Pachuca. The same ownership group oversees CF Pachuca, another club that has already qualified for the Club World Cup. Due to multi-club ownership rules, FIFA would not allow both teams in the tournament. The court case lasted over five months in Lausanne, Switzerland, before the court announced its decision to uphold FIFA's initial punishment. While the two other American teams would play in their home markets, the winner of the LAFC-América playoff would travel around the United States, taking on Chelsea in Atlanta, Esperance of Tunisia in Nashville and Flamengo of Brazil in Orlando.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA Club World Cup is set to start in a little over a month, and one of Chelsea's opponents in the group stage will be Brazilian giants Flamengo. Currently managed by former Chelsea left back Filipe Luís, who finished his playing career there and then guided the team to a third place finish last season, they have recently been linked with a couple high profile signings ahead of the tournament. As we learned earlier, FIFA's rules will allow not only for an earlier transfer window ahead of the Club World Cup, but could in essence also allow teams to loan in players for just the duration of the monthlong cash-grab in the States. And one of those players for Flamengo just might be João Félix, currently on loan at AC Milan. But the sudden spurt of speculation from earlier this week has been talked down significantly by more recent reports out of Brazil, with Globo claiming that Félix's salary, and supposed interest from other European clubs, will prevent any actual talks from taking place. So, as amusing as it would be to play against Félix on June 20 in Philadelphia, this probably won't be happening. However, there might be a familiar face among their number after all — though not David Luiz, who left the club in January — with Flamengo pushing hard to sign Jorginho from Arsenal. This one seems a lot more likely to happen, provided the timings with our Champions League-winner's contract (technically it ends only at the end of June) and personal commitments (i.e. wedding plans) work out in their favor. Flamengo are interested in signing Joao Felix in time for the Club World Cup in a potential move that could see him come up against #CFC in the tournament.Talks with player side are exploratory. Chelsea would consider sanctioning a loan on the right terms. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Please enter a valid email and try again.
