"We don't our AI buddy saying some shit that would come back and monetarily harm Google".And yes, the representatives of companies are censored.

There are places we need uncensored AIs, but in no way, shape, or form is Google required to provide you with one of them. Someone will probably do that for medical and police transcription. Google would be fully justified, I believe, in having a disclaimer that said "gemini will not provide answers on certain topics because they will cause Google bad PR." They're saying they won't provide certain answers because putting certain ideas to words harms the world and Google doesn't want to harm the world. AI autocorrect doesn't want you to type "fuck" or "cunt" and will suggest all manner of similar sounding words, and there's a reason for that. People want censorship, because they want their computers to be decent.That said, the 4chan LLM was pretty funny for a while if you ignore the blatant -isms, but I can't think of a legitimate use case for it beyond shitposting.

The big question is, how do you train LLMs that are useful to both humans and services while not embarrassing the company that trained them?LLMs are pretty good at translating - but if they don't like what they're reading, they simply won't tell you what it says. I have to admit that's a little bit funny.Right now, if you want to build a service and expect any sort of predictability and stability, I think you have to go with some solution that lets you run open-weights models. Technically the same goes for the big closed LLM services too, but when all of them fail your tests, what will you do?

Then there's a variability of LLMs as they get trained. The randomness that gets injected is what makes it somewhat decent. An LLM could at one point output a document filled with banana emoji and still be functioning otherwise correctly if you hit the right quirk in the weights file.Reusing general purpose LLMs for healthcare has got to be some of the most utterly idiotic, as well as dystopian, ideas. One day Google's filters will let one bleed into the other and the lack of care from these healthcare platforms will cause some pretty horific problems as a result.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>You would think the administration that launched the Department of Government Efficiency (despite how ineffective it has been) would be a big fan of improved efficacy in all areas. But Donald Trump keeps trying to kill any law that sets efficiency requirements for water and energy usage. His latest effort came Friday, when he signed a presidential memorandum calling the Department of Energy to “consider using all lawful authority to rescind” or weaken water and energy standards and signed measures to end Biden-era energy efficiency regulations. Per the Department of Energy, those standards reduced the energy usage of water heaters by 13% and saved consumers a cumulative $3.1 billion and saved commercial facilities $4.6 billion on utility bills from cooler and freezer usage. As for the memorandum, it'll push the DOE to look for any “water pressure or related energy efficiency laws” that it believes should be eliminated, with the standard being that the government shouldn't “impose or enforce regulations that make taxpayers' lives worse.” That's a pretty squishy guidance, but it's clear in the eyes of the administration that additional water pressure is more important than cutting back on energy bills. It takes particular aim at energy-efficient washing machines, which the administration claims cost “at least $100 more” than less efficient models, and dishwashers, which it claims that new regulations make cleaning cycles take twice as long as they did for pre-standards models. Trump has been on something of a roll when it comes to energy and water usage, which probably shouldn't come as much of a surprise from a guy who seems to be obsessed with shower water pressure and toilet flushes. Earlier this week, he also announced that the EnergyStar program, which certifies energy-efficient appliances and saves consumers $450 per year on average, will be shuttered.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. A dangerous viral trend has been going around TikTok where kids try to make their Chromebooks start smoking by putting foreign metallic objects in their ports. These items include pins, paperclips, staples, and scissors, among others, which are all readily available around the classroom. According to Ars Technica, many school districts have quickly taken action, with those in Colorado, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington sending written warnings to parents about the risky challenge. There have been multiple reports of students trying the challenge, which sometimes results in their laptop smoking or catching fire. And because there's a high risk of explosion with damaged lithium batteries, these incidents resulted in classroom evacuations, class cancellations, and, in some cases, deployment of firefighters or other first responders. This isn't the first time a dangerous viral trend has started circulating on popular social media. We've seen several “challenges” in the previous years, including the Kia Challenge, which showed how easy it was to steal certain Kia and Hyundai model years and led to a rise in car thefts just for clout on TikTok. There was also the Blackout Challenge, where kids would strangle themselves on live video until they passed out, which, unfortunately, has led to several accidental deaths. Promoting a safe and positive experience is TikTok's top priority.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For much of the 20th century, winter brought an annual ritual to Princeton, New Jersey. Lake Carnegie froze solid, and skaters flocked to its glossy surface. These days, the ice is rarely thick enough to support anybody wearing skates, since Princeton's winters have warmed about 4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1970. It's a lost tradition that Grace Liu linked to the warming climate as an undergrad at Princeton University in 2020, interviewing longtime residents and digging through newspaper archives to create a record of the lake's ice conditions. “People definitely noticed that they were able to get out onto the lake less,” said Liu, who's now a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. “However, they didn't necessarily connect this trend to climate change.” That question sparked her study, recently published in the journal Nature Human Behavior, that came to a striking conclusion: Boiling down data into a binary — a stark this or that — can help break through apathy about climate change. One showed winter temperatures of a fictional town gradually rising over time, while the other presented the same warming trend in a black-or-white manner: The lake either froze in any given year, or it didn't. People who saw the second chart perceived climate change as causing more abrupt changes. Both charts represent the same amount of winter warming, just presented differently. “We are literally showing them the same trend, just in different formats.” “Psychology effects are sometimes fickle,” said Dubey, who's researched cognitive science for a decade. “This is one of the cleanest effects we've ever seen.” The findings suggest that if scientists want to increase public urgency around climate change, they should highlight clear, concrete shifts instead of slow-moving trends. The idea is that if you put a frog in boiling water, it'll immediately jump out. Previous research has found that as the climate warms, people adjust their sense of what seems normal based on weather from the past two to eight years, a phenomenon known as “shifting baselines.” Many scientists have held out hope that governments would finally act to cut fossil fuel emissions when a particularly devastating hurricane, heat wave, or flood made the effects of climate change undeniable. Last year, weather-related disasters caused more than $180 billion in damages in the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Yet climate change still hasn't cracked into the ranks of what Americans say they're most concerned about. “Tragedies will keep on escalating in the background, but it's not happening fast enough for us to think, ‘OK, this is it. But Dubey thinks that if people see compelling visuals more often, it could help keep the problem of climate change from fading out of their minds. Dubey's study shows that there's a cognitive reason why binary data resonates with people: It creates a mental illusion that the situation has changed suddenly, when it has actually changed gradually. The importance of using data visualizations to get an idea across is often overlooked, according to Jennifer Marlon, a senior research scientist at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. “We know that [data visuals] can be powerful tools for communication, but they often miss their mark, partly because most scientists aren't trained, despite the availability of many excellent resources,” Marlon said in an email. She said that binary visuals could be used to convey the urgency of addressing climate change, though using them tends to mean losing complexity and richness from the data. The study's findings don't just apply to freezing lakes — global temperatures can be communicated in more stark ways. The popular “climate stripes” visual developed by Ed Hawkins, a professor at the University of Reading in the U.K., illustrates temperature changes with vertical bands of lines, where blue indicates cold years and red indicates warm ones. “Our study explains why the climate stripes is actually so popular and resonates with people,” Dubey said.

Roborock's “Q” series has particularly been well-praised for its value for money, and the latest Roborock Q8 Max carries on this tradition. Amazon is now offering this great version at its all-time lowest price of just $259, which is a massive 57% discount from its initial price tag of $599. It's a great opportunity, and this is one of our favorite models. Now, almost all new Roborock vacuums are sold above $1,000 which makes this Q8 Max an even better deal. It is capable of effortlessly scooping up dust, crumbs and even tough pet hair on carpets and hardwood floors with equal ease. The Q8 Max also has Roborock's groundbreaking DuoRoller brush mechanism-two rubber rollers that rotate in opposite directions to pick up more dirt and prevent hair from becoming tangled as often by 20%. But the Roborock Q8 Max is not just a vacuum: It mops and vacuums in one, complete with a 350ml water tank and 30 adjustable water flow levels to tackle everything from loose dust to embedded dirt. The mop part is merely removable so that you can switch between modes or use them sequentially on each other for a deeper clean. Roborock is also very popular for its PreciSense LiDAR technology: it maps your home accurately and quickly getting familiarized with the layout and adapting cleaning routes for optimal efficiency. The Q8 Max also uses advanced obstacle avoidance, sensing and avoiding chairs, cables, and even toys that would send less advanced robots stumbling. You can set no-go zones and virtual walls through the Roborock app so you have complete control over where and how it cleans. The Roborock app itself is simple to use and feature-packed: You can schedule cleanings, customize settings, monitor the robot's progress in real time, and even view a 3D map of your home. Voice control is also supported through Alexa, Google Home, and Siri. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Gigabyte has added pressurized thermal pads to M.2 slots for SSDs on its latest Aorus Stealth Ice motherboards (via Uniko's Hardware) to maximize heat dissipation of high-end SSDs. The motherboard maker claims that its pressurized thermal pad may reduce SSD temperature by 12 degrees Celsius, though it admits that the effect depends on multiple factors. Thermals often constrain the performance of high-end SSDs in an M.2 form-factor, as both the controller and memory packages tend to heat up under high loads. Most high-end drives come with a pre-installed heat spreader, and many high-end motherboards come with their thermal solutions for SSDs. Gigabyte's EZ-Flex solution, introduced on its B850 Aorus Stealth Ice motherboard, addresses these shortcomings by combining pressurized thermal pads with a spring-loaded, flexible backplate. This setup adapts to the thickness of both single- and double-sided M.2 SSDs, maintaining uniform pressure and ensuring better thermal contact on both sides of the drive. As a result, SSD temperatures can be reduced by up to 12°C, helping to prevent thermal throttling and sustain high performance during intensive workloads. Gigabyte's EZ-Flex design not only improves thermal performance and enhances compatibility with both single- and double-sided SSDs, but it also ensures more consistent mechanical pressure for better stability and reduces the risk of installation errors due to its adaptive fit. In addition, lowering temperatures helps extend the lifespan of SSD components. It minimizes performance throttling under sustained workloads, making it especially beneficial for users handling large data transfers or demanding applications.

The Stream Deck Neo is impressively beginner-friendly, but its unique aspects — the infobar and touch buttons — can barely be customized. Stream Decks — or other customizable macro pads / controllers, such as the Loupedeck Live S — are incredibly powerful tools, if you take the time and effort to set them up for your specific needs. Elgato is trying to make the introduction to stream decks simpler and less intimidating with its Stream Deck Neo — the stream deck part of its budget-friendly, plug-'n-play, sustainably-packaged Neo line of streaming gear. The Stream Deck neo is a small, customizable stream deck with eight tactile LCD keys, an info bar, and two touch-sensitive buttons for scrolling through pages of said LCD keys. That's not exactly what I'd call budget, but it does make it the second-cheapest stream deck you can pick up, after the $60 Stream Deck Mini. One thing that always makes a Stream Deck more versatile is a mix of input types — tactile buttons, touch buttons, knobs, dials, swipes, etc. But while the Stream Deck Neo does have both tactile and touch-sensitive buttons, the touch-sensitive buttons are, confusingly, not customizable — they're for scrolling through pages of LCD keys, and that's it. The Stream Deck Neo is impressively beginner-friendly for a stream deck (thanks mostly to Elgato's effort to make it so, not the hardware itself, however), and it is a good entry-level option. It features a built-in stand with two positions. The Neo is one of the smaller stream decks you can get, measuring 4.2 inches (107mm) wide by 3.1 inches (78mm) deep, and Elgato lists it as being 1 inch (26mm) high, but that's only when it's lying flat. The Neo's built-in stand is convenient — it folds up flat and would make a great little travel accessory for someone who needs the functionality of a stream deck when they're traveling. The Neo is a bit sleeker-looking than other stream decks, not just because it's white — but it is white, designed to fit in with the rest of Elgato's budget-friendly streaming line of peripherals, which include the Elgato Wave Neo microphone we reviewed a couple of months ago. The Neo has a slightly concave face and rounded corners, and while it's not actually much thinner than other stream decks (the MK.2 is one inch thick without its stand — the same as the Neo when it's folded flat), these little details make it look smaller and sleeker. (To be fair, the stream deck lineup has mostly been blocky black plastic, so almost anything looks smaller and sleeker.) The Neo comes with a protective plastic cover on the bottom; at first I thought this was because the Neo had a microsuction pad to help it stick to your desk, like the Razer Stream Controller X, but it appears to be normal, non-microsuction anti-slip material. (Plus, the non-microsuction bottom meant that I could at least move it around easily.) The Stream Deck Neo has eight LCD keys: each of which measures approximately 0.5 x 0.5 inches (12.7 x 12.7mm) and is highly customizable depending on what you're doing at any given moment. The keys are tactile and made of glossy, clear plastic. They feel like the LCD keys on other stream decks we've tested — tactile, yes, but a little mushy. Underneath the LCD keys, there's a small info bar (248 x 58 pixels) that displays the date and time, which is flanked by two touch-sensitive "buttons" for scrolling through pages of LCD keys. The info bar is slightly customizable — you can either have it display the date/time, or you can have it display a page indicator, but that's it (there are, however, several different date/time and page indicator designs to choose from). The LCD keys can also show real-time stats or updates, such as the weather, your current CPU usage, an audio meter, how many Twitch followers you have, etc. Elgato might just have the most robust stream deck ecosystem and marketplace at the moment — the Neo integrates with all of Elgato's other products, which include webcams, capture cards, mics, and lights, while Elgato's marketplace offers plugins for social/streaming platforms (Twitch, YouTube, Discord, OBS, Streamlabs, etc. Of course, sorting through Elgato's marketplace to find the plugins and controllers you need for your specific workflow takes some time — and Elgato's Neo line is designed to be as plug-'n-play as possible. The buttons include a "Tutorials" folder, which takes you various stream deck setup videos. In addition to plugins and hardware/software integrations, the Elgato marketplace also features a number of resources, including pre-made profiles for different types of creators, as well as for specific programs and games. Elgato has uploaded several Neo-specific profiles (e..g "Play," "Work," "Stream," "Control Neo," etc), for a more curated plug-'n-play experience — I'm not sure a stream deck can really be plug-'n-play, but Elgato has definitely gone out of its way to make the Stream Deck Neo as beginner-friendly as possible. He assigned the eight keys to web tools and apps he opens every day, including Google Drive, Gmail, our editorial calendar, Photoshop Elements and Slack. The Stream Deck Neo is surprisingly accessible — Elgato has gone out of its way to try to demonstrate just how useful a stream deck can be, no matter what you're doing on your PC, but you'll still need to spend some time customizing and getting to know the Neo if you're serious about using it. As for your other options: the Stream Deck Mini has dropped from its original $100 price to $60, but it only has six keys — two of which will need to act as navigation keys if you have more than one "page" of buttons. The Stream Deck MK.2 has 15 tactile LCD keys and that's it — no info bar or touch buttons. But the Neo's info bar and touch buttons are largely uncustomizable (though, I suppose, this could be changed with a firmware update), so they don't really count. The Stream Deck Neo is a pretty good option for an entry-level stream deck / macro pad, but it would be a much better option if the info bar and touch buttons were customizable.

The G.Skill Trident Z5 CK DDR5-8800 C42 may not suit everyone, but if you're a performance enthusiast who enjoys showcasing your love for bleeding-edge technology, this memory kit meets all the requirements. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. It's incredible how a chip so minuscule as the clock driver (CKD) can make such a massive difference in obtaining higher frequencies on DDR5 memory. Thanks to the CKD, memory vendors have climbed the frequency ladder, and it won't be long before we eventually hit that DDR5-10000 milestone. In the meantime, G.Skill already has a DDR5-8800 memory kit on the market, and while it isn't as jaw-dropping as the DDR5-9600 one, it has up its sleeves; it's still a high-speed memory kit by today's standards. The Trident Z5 CK features a black, glossy, mirror-like finish that readily attracts dust and fingerprints, but that won't be much of a consideration after installation and cleaning. G.Skill offers both regular and RGB versions of the Trident Z5 CK memory. Only black is available, but we're not complaining, as the memory modules look stunning in piano black. All Trident Z5 CK memory modules are equipped with a black PCB. This 48GB memory kit comprises two 24GB modules designed with a single-rank configuration. It features eight SK hynix H5CGD8MGBDX021 (M-die) ICs arranged in a single-sided layout, each with a capacity of 3GB. It is important to note that AMD's current 800-series platform does not fully support CUDIMMs. Tailored for Intel's Core Ultra 200S processors (codenamed Arrow Lake) and the latest 800-series platform, the Trident Z5 CK memory modules default to DDR5-6400, the native data rate supported by Arrow Lake. This kit is designed specifically for Intel chips, so it only features XMP 3.0. The primary profile is optimized for rated DDR5-8800 at 42-55-55-104 timings with 1.45V DRAM voltage. In contrast, the backup profile caters to DDR5-6400 at 32-39-39-102 timings, operating with a 1.35V DRAM voltage. See our PC Memory 101 feature and How to Shop for RAM story for more timings and frequency considerations. The MSI GeForce RTX 4080 16GB Gaming X Trio addresses the more graphics-intensive workloads, ensuring that our gaming RAM benchmarks do not have a graphics bottleneck. TeamGroup's A440 Lite PCIe 4.0 SSD balances performance and storage capacity, with 2TB of high-speed storage up to 7,400 MB/s for our Windows 11 24H2 installation, benchmarking software, and games. Meanwhile, the Corsair RM1000x Shift ATX 3.0 power supply delivers a reliable and ample power source to our test systems, directly feeding the GeForce RTX 4080 with a native 16-pin (12VHPWR) power cable. Finally, the Streacom BC1 open-air test bench accommodates all of our hardware. Regarding gaming, G.Skill's memory kit performed comparably to Corsair's DDR5-8400 C40. Regrettably, DDR5-8800 exceeds the limitations of our Ryzen 9 9900X sample. The integrated memory controller (IMC) of the 12-core Zen 5 processor cannot accommodate memory of this speed. Consequently, our system would not post with DDR5-8800 memory. Unfortunately, AMD's existing platform doesn't fully leverage CUDIMMs' potential. Although we had better luck with the Ryzen 7 9700X sample, our system remained unstable and frequently encountered BSOD errors. SK hynix M-die ICs can occasionally be a little stubborn with tight timings. There might be a bit more leeway on the memory modules, but that would involve running the memory above 1.5V, and we generally suggest avoiding that for long-term use. Unfortunately, one significant limitation lies outside G.Skill's control. Intel's Core Ultra 200S is currently the only consumer chip to support CUDIMMs and has the highest possibility of playing nice with this memory kit, leaving AMD fans out in the cold. However, that doesn't mean you can't use this memory kit on an AMD platform; the DIMMs can run in bypass mode. Naturally, the G.Skill Trident Z5 CK DDR5-8800 C42 comes with a hefty price tag of $319.99, likely more than most regular users would consider spending on RAM. The CUDIMMs came out recently, leading to an early adopter premium similar to the initial launch of DDR5. Therefore, we don't anticipate a drop in the price of G.Skill's memory kit anytime soon. If you're determined to get DDR5-8800 memory with a 48GB capacity, the G.Skill Trident Z5 CK DDR5-8800 C42 is an excellent choice that you shouldn't overlook.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, WhatsApp scored a major victory against NSO Group when a jury ordered the infamous spyware maker to pay more than $167 million in damages to the Meta-owned company. The ruling concluded a legal battle spanning more than five years, which started in October 2019 when WhatsApp accused NSO Group of hacking more than 1,400 of its users by taking advantage of a vulnerability in the chat app's audio-calling functionality. The verdict came after a week-long jury trial that featured several testimonies, including NSO Group's CEO Yaron Shohat and WhatsApp employees who responded and investigated the incident. The lawyer explained that NSO Group had built what it called the “WhatsApp Installation Server,” a special machine designed to send malicious messages across WhatsApp's infrastructure mimicking real messages. NSO Group's research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli testified that “any zero-click solution whatsoever is a significant milestone for Pegasus.” Contact Us Do you have more information about NSO Group, or other spyware companies? For years, NSO Group has claimed that its spyware cannot be used against American phone numbers, meaning any cell number that starts with the +1 country code. The FBI reportedly chose not to deploy Pegasus following its test. The fact that NSO Group's headquarters are openly advertised is somewhat interesting on its own. Other companies that develop spyware or zero-days like the Barcelona-based Variston, which shuttered in February, was located in a co-working space while claiming on its official website to be located somewhere else.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use numbers to describe almost every conceivable thing in the universe. But there is one number that surpasses all others for the enormous impact it will have on every living thing on Earth over the next few thousand years. This is a measure (known in scientific terms as the mole fraction) of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, in parts per million. Dave Keeling maintained this record, known as the Keeling Curve, using a running hodgepodge of short-term grants until 2005, at which point geochemist Ralph Keeling, a professor at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, coauthor of this piece and Dave's son, assumed its stewardship. Endeavors of this nature—highly precise measurements of a trace gas over many decades—require three basic inputs: knowledge, people, and money. NOAA provides support for our program both through an annual grant and through invaluable “in-kind” support, such as staffers taking samples for us, maintaining buildings in remote areas where sampling occurs, and running the Mauna Loa Observatory. Monthly average carbon dioxide concentration at Mauna Loa (top panel) and annual financial support for the Scripps CO2 program (bottom panel), adjusted for inflation to US dollars in 2007. The Trump administration has made clear it wishes to gut NOAA's research enterprise, which is at the center of climate research globally. Already, we've seen large-scale firings and rejections of research proposals. If successful, this loss will be a nightmare scenario for climate science, not just in the United States, but the world. Against this ominous backdrop, a small group of scientists is scrambling to preserve the ability to know how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere. NOAA maintains a global backbone of measurements of carbon dioxide and other gases, not just at Mauna Loa, but at more than 50 stations around the world. Other countries also contribute, but their efforts are almost all focused regionally, leaving the big picture to just a few programs that are global in scope. Such networks provide critical information on how fast carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are building up in the air from fossil-fuel burning and other processes. They provide information on how much carbon dioxide is being removed from the atmosphere by the oceans and by land plants. These observational networks are the factual basis upon which all efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change are based. NOAA and Scripps play another key role in the atmospheric measurement community. Such differences may seem small, but they are consequential in the realm of climate research, and they can be calculated only because a lot of work has gone into calibration. Hundreds of groups can measure carbon dioxide using various off-the-shelf analyzers, but these analyzers first need to be calibrated using compressed air that has a known amount of carbon dioxide in it. Scripps assumed the lead role for preparing tanks filled with known amounts of carbon dioxide and dispensing them to the community until 1995, at which point NOAA took over. If the current administration has its way, the climate change research community could soon be fully adrift, unable to know with sufficient accuracy how quickly carbon dioxide levels are rising. Even in the best of times, long-term observations can be very fragile. It is difficult to convince funding agencies to put money into long-term observations because, by definition, they are continuations; they have been done before. (Dave Keeling records in his autobiography, Rewards and Penalties of Monitoring the Earth, that at one point a National Science Foundation program manager demanded that, to maintain funding, he generate two discoveries per year from his record of carbon dioxide levels.) Another vulnerability stems from the fact that the community of researchers making sustained measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide probably numbers less than 30. Graduate students interested in learning to conduct this arcane work are a rare commodity. This scientific pursuit isn't for everyone. Perversely, while the Keeling Curve has attained iconic global importance, this actually can hinder, rather than help the funding situation. Environmental programs tend to be organized by geographic domain and discipline—the National Water Quality Program of the US Geological Survey, NSF's Arctic Observing Network, and the US Forest Service, for instance. Amid these focused efforts, the big picture can be lost. As the climate change field has evolved, we have found it increasingly difficult to find sponsors who accept responsibility for measuring vital signs of the Earth as a whole. This was a massive, remarkable effort, led by the United States and including 67 countries, with the goal (simply put) of measuring every physical attribute possible on the Earth in one year. It led to numerous, important scientific discoveries and the establishment of many measurement programs worldwide. It established the South Pole station, for instance, a home for vital climate research that is still going today. This sense of endeavor continued into the 1970s, when then president Richard Nixon—a conservative Republican—established NOAA to better understand the world's oceans and atmosphere. Our colleagues at NOAA are living day to day, not sure if tomorrow will be their last on the job.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. What's the best way to share it with someone else? Previously, this has been quite a technical challenge—you'll notice even screenshots get blocked by Netflix's anti-piracy technology. But there's now an official feature built right into the Netflix app for saving and sharing as many clips as you like. It's called Moments, and you can find it in the Netflix app for Android and iOS, though not on the web or any other devices. Moments was added at the end of 2024, six months before Netflix announced that it will soon begin rolling out a major overhaul of its user interface. So while you may have to wait a few weeks to see the new Netflix features—like “responsive” recommendations and TikTok-style vertical videos—you can start sharing with Moments now. You'll see a Moments button in the lower-left corner. Tap the button and you get taken to the Moments screen that shows thumbnails of previous clips you've saved for this particular film or show. The clip will actually start a few seconds back from where you currently are, so a little bit of trial and error might be required to get it spot on. Tap on any previously saved clip to view it, or tap the relevant trash can icon to delete a clip. It's important to note that these aren't self-contained video shorts—they're basically just playback points within movies and shows. When you view one, the film or episode continues from that point. All your clips are synced between your mobile devices, so you can revisit them or share them from multiple phones and tablets. From inside the Android or iOS app, you're also able to open the My Netflix tab to access your saved Moments across every film and show.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Earlier this year, a new study indicated that the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa with type 2 diabetes rose from 4 million in 1980 to 23.6 million in 2021, with projections suggesting that these cases will more than double to 54.9 million by 2045, driven, as in many other parts of the world, by rapid lifestyle changes including shifting diets and declining physical activity. It's a problem that needs urgent attention, but it could also provide an opportunity to better understand this deadly disease and even lead to more effective—and inclusive—treatments. Segun Fatumo, a genetics professor at Queen Mary University of London who is currently leading studies of type 2 diabetes in Uganda and Malawi, says many of these patients are drug naïve, meaning their disease progression has yet to be altered by medication. “This gives researchers a rare window into the natural history of the disease—how it develops, progresses, and responds to different environmental and genetic factors,” he says. “It's like being able to study a book from the first chapter, rather than jumping in halfway through.” “Because human populations have lived in Africa the longest, they've had more time to accumulate genetic diversity, and this diversity is a scientific gold mine,” says Fatumo. Research in sub-Saharan African populations has already challenged some basic understandings regarding the biology of type 2 diabetes. In 2019, a major genetics study of more than 5,000 type 2 diabetes patients in Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya pointed to a particular gene called ZRANB3 as being associated with the disease. The study indicates that some individuals carry variants of ZRANB3 which mean that they either produce fewer insulin-producing beta cells or struggle to maintain an adequate number of these cells, making them less responsive to surges in blood sugar. The gene may therefore represent a potential new drug target, says Tinashe Chikowore, a researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School who is also leading studies of type 2 diabetes patients in the region. “We now need to find out just how many diabetics carry this African-specific mutation, both in sub-Saharan African populations and those of African ancestry around the world,” he says. African men also appear to be particularly at risk of the disease. Earlier this year, the Lancet Global Health medical journal published a study of more than 6,500 middle-aged adults from four sub-Saharan African countries which found that, after family history, simply being male was one of the biggest predictors of type 2 diabetes risk. The latter theory arises from research carried out in East Africa, which found that some men develop type 2 diabetes despite having a healthy weight. An ongoing study led by Uganda's Medical Research Council, in partnership with UK researchers, is measuring the size of the pancreas in such men and assessing its function. Some scientists think that it's related to malnutrition in early life, impacting the development of the beta cells so they don't produce as much insulin.” Currently, the gold-standard methods of diagnosing and assessing the progression of type 2 diabetes are fasting plasma glucose tests, which measure blood sugar after fasting, and the HbA1c blood test, which detects levels of a chemical compound called HbA1c that indicates blood sugar levels over time. But such tests are being shown to be ineffective in some populations. Last year a major study highlighted that a significant number of people of African ancestry are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes much later than they might be, because they carry deficiencies in an enzyme called G6PD. The study showed that many of these patients end up experiencing preventable complications such as diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness. Meanwhile, researchers like Julia Goedecke, a professor and chief specialist scientist at the South African Medical Research Council, have found that using fasting plasma glucose as a way of diagnosing type 2 diabetes in African women tends to be ineffective, because it assumes the patient is carrying a significant amount of liver fat. “Fasting glucose is often used as a marker of diabetes risk, but that's because liver fat's a big driver of fasting glucose levels,” says Goedecke. “In Africans it's actually a poor marker, because most women who present with diabetes have low liver fat, so you often miss diabetes if you only take a fasting glucose value.” Instead of liver fat, Goedecke's research has indicated that many of these cases are being driven by an impaired ability to clear insulin from the bloodstream, causing people to already have abnormally high insulin levels. “We hope this data will also give us a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the disease, and ideas for interventions to try and prevent it,” she says. “And we have higher chances of finding those people in Africa than anywhere else.” “Imagine if we could one day do the same for diabetes,” he says.
