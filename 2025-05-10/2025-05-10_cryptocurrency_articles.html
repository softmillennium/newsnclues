                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But in the cryptocurrency jungle, every rise can turn into a free fall. On May 9, Doodles launched $DOOD, its community token, via a highly anticipated airdrop. The creative revolution is here… we are building a movement that will transcend ages. On May 8, Doodles NFT sales jumped 97%, exceeding 1.1 million dollars. CryptoSlam then ranked the collection third globally. This brutal reaction evoked the fate of PENGU from Pudgy Penguins, which had dropped 50% on its launch day. The reasons for this setback are multiple. First, a significant selling pressure, typical of airdrops where holders seek to cash out. Despite long-term ambitions — gamification, governance, artistic incentives — the project did not specify immediate use cases. But at launch, many users saw it only as a simple memecoin without concrete functionality. The launch on Solana also caused confusion: the holder base, mainly Ethereum, had to open compatible wallets to participate. In summary, Doodles suffered from a combination of aggressive timing, divided audience, and very high expectations. Joel Agbo, contributor at CoinGecko, reminds us that these tokens “often start as memecoins but aim for utility in the long run“. This was also the bet of Pudgy Penguins, whose PENGU dropped quickly… before rising to a 2.8 billion capitalization. Doodles could follow this model, provided trust is rebuilt. And Binance's support, which listed $DOOD, shows that the project retains credibility among major crypto players. Nothing is decided for $DOOD: the next chapter will depend on commitment and vision.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Their 555,000 BTC is illiquid with no plans to sell," the analyst wrote in a May 10 X post. "Strategy's holdings alone mean a -2.23% annual deflation rate — likely higher with other stable institutional holders," Ju continued. Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, is an outspoken Bitcoin advocate who evangelizes the scarce digital currency to potential investors and has inspired many other companies to adopt a Bitcoin treasury plan. Additionally, Strategy acts as a bridge between Bitcoin and traditional financial (TradFi) markets by funneling funds from TradFi investors into Bitcoin through selling corporate debt and equity, which the company uses to finance more BTC purchases. According to Michael Saylor, over 13,000 institutions hold Strategy stock directly in their portfolios. Related: Bitcoin yet to hit $150K because outsiders are ghosting — Michael Saylor recently said that Strategy is synthetically halving Bitcoin by outpacing miner supply through high demand. Other institutions including hedge funds, pension funds, asset managers, and tech companies continue buying BTC as a portfolio diversifier or a treasury asset to hedge against fiat currency inflation. ETF inflows have also helped to stabilize Bitcoin's price by injecting fresh capital from traditional financial markets, smoothing out the volatility of Bitcoin and making downturns less severe. However, the most august institutional players — sovereign wealth funds — will not ramp up Bitcoin purchases until clear cryptocurrency regulations are established in the United States, according to SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Standard Chartered's head of digital assets, Geoffrey Kendrick, has indicated that his previously stated Bitcoin price target of $120,000 for the second quarter might be too conservative. In a light-hearted remark, Kendrick said, “I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low.” Kendrick's statement suggests growing confidence in Bitcoin's upward trajectory among institutional analysts, even as the digital currency continues to experience its characteristic price swings. Kendrick's role as head of digital assets represents the bank's commitment to providing insights into this emerging asset class for its clients and investors. This stance marks a notable shift from the skepticism many banking executives expressed toward digital assets in previous years. Major financial institutions have gradually moved from dismissing cryptocurrencies to analyzing them as legitimate investment vehicles. Price predictions from established financial institutions can influence market sentiment and investor behavior. When analysts from traditional banks make bold forecasts about cryptocurrency prices, it often lends credibility to the asset class among mainstream investors. While delivered with humor, Kendrick's comment carries weight in the investment community due to Standard Chartered's reputation. The bank's willingness to publish specific price targets for Bitcoin represents a maturation in how traditional finance approaches digital asset valuation. “I apologise that my USD120k Q2 target may be too low,” Geoffrey Kendrick, head of digital assets at Standard Chartered. While Kendrick did not elaborate on the specific factors leading him to suggest his target might be conservative, several market dynamics could support such a view. Bitcoin's limited supply of 21 million coins creates scarcity, particularly as institutional demand increases. The cryptocurrency market has historically moved in cycles, with periods of rapid price appreciation followed by corrections. Analysts tracking these patterns may identify signals suggesting the current upward movement has more room to run than anticipated. Regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors all shape Bitcoin's price trajectory. Market observers note that price targets from major banks often serve as psychological anchors for investors. As digital assets continue to gain mainstream acceptance, the forecasts from traditional financial institutions will likely play an increasingly important role in shaping market narratives and investor expectations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin SV Investors File to Revive 'Loss of Chance' Claim in $13.3 Billion Case With Binance Bitcoin SV (BSV) investors have asked the UK Court of Appeal to readmit their claim that Binance's delisting of BSV in April 2019 caused them to lose out on significant growth in the value of their holdings. In July 2024, the Competition Appeal Tribunal struck out a particular element of the group's complaint, which argued that the Binance delisting resulted in a “forgone growth effect,” preventing BSV from developing into a “top tier” cryptocurrency. It's this particular claim that would allow for the highest possible financial penalty against Binance (above $13 billion), based on the assumption that BSV would have grown to what Bitcoin's value was in July 2022, when the group originally filed their complaint. "Because of the delisting, there has been damage which continues to this day," said John Wardell KC. "If it hadn't been for the delisting, BSV would be a first-tier currency like Bitcoin." “There is no duty to mitigate if your damaged asset cannot generate sufficient funds," said Wardell. "It is well established that defendants will not be prejudiced by financial inability to mitigate." “BSV could have been exchanged for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies," he said. "BSV is and was, at all relevant times, a readily marketable asset.” The case against Binance is part of a class action also involving Kraken, ShapeShift and Bittylicious, which all delisted BSV between April and June 2019. The case was brought on behalf of all UK-based Bitcoin SV holders between April 2019 and July 2022, estimated to be in the region of 243,000 investors. Speaking to Decrypt, Ashley Fairbrother—a partner at legal firm Edmonds Marshall McMahon—acknowledges that the case is “very novel” and has “an equally extraordinary” backstory. Fairbrother also noted that recent years have brought a few examples of investors attempting to bring claims against exchanges, although these claims have usually been “fundamentally flawed,” as witnessed in Piroozzadeh v Persons Unknown (2023). “While legal action against exchanges is theoretically possible, much like claims against traditional banks, significant legal and practical hurdles would need to be overcome,” Fairbrother explained.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lido Finance, Ethereum's largest liquid staking platform by locked value, has introduced a proposal that grants staked ether (stETH) holders direct voting power alongside existing DAO tokenholders. Currently, only holders of LDO$1.09, Lido's governance token, have a say in how the protocol evolves. Dual Governance: Coming SoonYears in the making, Lido DAO contributors are proud to present an outline for the upcoming release of Dual Governance featuring design & code choices, parameters, deployment & rollout.https://t.co/Iu7J1cOlcr Over 25% of all ETH is staked on the network running through its infrastructure. In the current system, decisions don't take effect right away, as there is a set period before they're executed. That gives users time to react if they don't agree with certain changes. However, Ethereum staking is different because one can't quickly unstake or withdraw ETH, even with the current timelock. The proposed dynamic timelock assumes that, as enough users, who aren't satisfied with a proposed change, deposit their stETH (or wrapped stETH and withdrawal of NFTs) into a designated escrow contract for withdrawal, the timelock duration begins to increase — this is called crossing the “first seal” (set at 1% of total Lido ETH staked). This creates a sort of safety valve — allowing stakers to signal objection and exit — while still giving the DAO time to respond or cancel the contentious action. The plan comes as Ethereum has surged more than 30% over the past week, riding momentum from its Pectra upgrade, which introduced execution-layer reforms to improve scalability and efficiency. The rally has sparked renewed attention on Ethereum-native applications like Lido, which is critical in capital flow and validator participation across the chain — and directly impacts ETH market structure. If approved, the change could shift how governance is distributed across Ethereum's staking ecosystem, setting a precedent for other DeFi protocols seeking to include users, not just tokenholders, in decision-making.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the global financial system moves towards digitalization, XRP is gradually gaining a foothold in the field of international payments. Recently, Ripple has strengthened cooperation with a number of Asian and European banks to promote the practical application of XRP in cross-border payments. Compared with the traditional SWIFT system, XRP not only significantly reduces handling fees, but also shortens transaction time from several days to several seconds. At the same time, the regulatory attitude of many countries towards XRP has also become positive, which has significantly improved its market liquidity. Under this trend, more and more investors choose to invest XRP in cloud mining platforms such as Blockchain Cloud Mining, and take advantage of its advantages of no need to deploy equipment and remote participation to obtain stable daily returns. This investment method not only enhances the use value of XRP, but also provides a new value-added channel for coin holders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's milestone week comes as new crypto exchange-traded funds are hitting the market. Investor and best-selling personal finance author Ric Edelman thinks the rollout gives investors more access to upside. "You can now invest in bitcoin ETFs that protect you against the downside volatility while preserving your ability to enjoy the upside profits," Edelman told CNBC's "ETF Edge" this week." You can generate massive amounts of yield, much more than you can in the stock market." Edelman is the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, which educates financial advisors on cryptocurrencies. He is also in Barron's Financial Advisor Hall of Fame. "Crypto is meant to be a long-term hold, just like the stock market," said Edelman. His thoughts came as a bitcoin rally got underway. As of Friday's close on Wall Street, bitcoin gained 6% this week. It is now up almost 10% so far this month. However, Edelman sees problems when it comes to leverage and inverse bitcoin ETFs. He warned that not all crypto ETFs are appropriate for retail investors, suggesting most don't understand how they work. "These leveraged ETFs often have an assumption you're going to hold the fund for a single day, a daily reset," he said. "That's literally the same thing as buying a lottery ticket. During the same interview, "ETF Edge" host Bob Pisani referenced 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) as an example of a leveraged bitcoin product that includes daily fees and resets. The fund is beating bitcoin this week, jumping more than 12%. So far this month, the ETF is up 19%. But the BITX is underperforming bitcoin this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin keeps going up to its all time high, but a possible temporary pause on its growth momentum may be around the corner. Michael van de Poppe hints that bitcoin is about to close an effective consolidation phase before surmounting its prior ten peaks. During this phase altcoins are set to outperform as attention begins to drift from the unrelenting rise of Bitcoin. The consolidation periods are usually characterized by weeks of slow market movements, and so this period could be the best opportunity for altcoins to receive attention. Nonetheless, for many investors this may be a pivotal opportunity to revalue their portfolios and discover the world of altcoins. Next week might be a watershed for altcoins, especially Ethereum (ETH). According to Daan Crypto Trades, many of the most shorted coins including Ethereum were subjected to extreme price movements in the past week as a result of short squeezes. Some long-dormant meme coins experienced a whole 2 to 4 times increase in prices in the span of a few days thanks to the high short demand. These explosive moves hint at a volatility-ready market that large trade and price opportunities. Nevertheless, these altcoins will be truly tested only after the initial price peak. Even though short squeezes can cause sharp price surges, the latter's sustainability is based on sustained spot demand. Investors remain slightly dubious but optimistic, keeping their stake in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other mighty altcoins. As the next few days are likely to prove critical, the market is paying careful attention to demand and price action to determine if the recent upsurge in altcoins will be a long-term trend or short-lived.

Nidhi is a Certified Digital Marketing Executive and Passionate crypto Journalist covering the world of alternative currencies. Bitcoin is holding strong at $103,656, up 8% this week. Altcoins are gaining momentum, with Ethereum rallying 31.7% after the Pectra upgrade, now trading at $2,403. Solana is up 15%, and Cardano's ADA gained 14%. Altcoin Sherpa has laid out two exciting strategies to play this bull run. Firstly, he suggests chasing the runners, meaning coins that have already pumped, like meme coins or trending AI tokens. These coins tend to have momentum, volume, and liquidity, making them easier to trade, like Popcat, Moodeng, and AVA Virtual. These coins have already made big moves, so the upside could be smaller. And if the market flips, they could crash hard. The other strategy is to accumulate the sleepers—coins that haven't moved much yet, such as older projects or coins with untapped narratives (like AI, gaming, or zk-tech). These coins have higher upside potential since they're at lower prices and could see big pumps if they catch a new trend. However, they are often illiquid, and it may take a long time for them to take off. Besides, there's also a risk that they may not move at all. Sherpa suggests that if you're more active, chasing the runners might be a better option, while option two is better suited for a long-term play. Analyst Crypto Rover also believes that the altcoin season is starting. As Bitcoin's market share hits a key level, analysts expect a shift toward altcoins, with Ethereum and others showing strength. This could kick off a big altcoin rally in 2025. Recently, Altcoin Daily analysts have identified top 14 altcoins to watch for in 2025. These include Ethereum, which is leading the charge with institutional interest and Layer 2 solutions, and Ondo Finance (ONDO), which is tokenizing real-world assets with support from BlackRock. XRP is gaining momentum in enterprise payments, while Cardano and World Mobile Token focus on eco-friendly blockchain and decentralized connectivity. Solana and Sui are also strong contenders in Layer 1. Other promising coins include Borg Token (BORG), COTI (COTI), Foxy (FOXY), Supra (SUPRA), Injective (INJ), Paid Network (PAID), and ResearchCoin (RSC).

Ethereum's (ETH) price has lagged behind Bitcoin over the last two years. However, over the past two days, ETH has outperformed BTC and other major coins. Ethereum's recent price action against Bitcoin supports this bullish narrative. According to recent chart data, rare golden crosses have appeared on the ETH/BTC pair's one-hour and four-hour charts, with short-term momentum building in Ethereum's favor. It is often regarded as a bullish signal that precedes sustained upward momentum. On the daily ETH/BTC chart, ETH has broken above the 50-day SMA at 0.02 in a two-day climb, a key resistance level that had previously capped upside attempts. In a Friday tweet, Arkham wrote, "Ethereum just had its best day since 2021." On Wednesday, Ethereum successfully implemented its Pectra upgrade. On Thursday, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization burst through the $2,000 barrier in a significant surge, eventually topping $2,400 early Friday, reaching its highest level in almost three months. Between Thursday and Friday, ETH climbed by more than 37%, while Bitcoin rose only 7.7%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New York is home to four of the largest bitcoin mines in the country, which consume huge quantities of electric power and water to cool their server farms, emit loud humming noises around the clock and flood the atmosphere with copious greenhouse gases and pollutants. In many cases, they are also driving nearby residents crazy. “It's a low hum that just kind of sits in your ears.” A network algorithm assigns each transaction a unique random identifying code, which bitcoin “mines” derive by operating powerful computers day and night, running an endless series of random numbers to break those codes. We deliver climate news to your inbox like nobody else. Every day or once a week, our original stories and digest of the web's top headlines deliver the full story, for free. Our #1 newsletter delivers the week's climate and energy news – our original stories and top headlines from around the web. Dan Gearino's habit-forming weekly take on how to understand the energy transformation reshaping our world. A digest of the most pressing climate-related news, released every Tuesday and Friday. Once a correct code is reached, confirming a transaction, which happens on average across the network every 10 minutes, a bitcoin miner receives 3.125 newly minted bitcoins (each worth around $95,000), which is the fee for helping maintain the network and keep it secure. Some bitcoin miners are attracted to New York for its cheap electricity—many Northern towns that border Canada have low rates due to abundant hydropower. But others are enticed by the state's decommissioned or low-use power plants, which they buy and connect to their computers, often running those power plants all day, every day. Two different bitcoin mines have set up their operations in small Northwestern New York towns, and bought local “peaker” gas plants—power plants that only operate during times of peak demand. Cold freshwater is also used to cool the computers. The water consumption of bitcoin mines is understudied, but concerning to many experts. In these small New York communities, the resistance to these bitcoin mines has been stark and wide-ranging, employing multiple different levers in local and state governance. “Crypto mines exploit all of the distributed impacts in a way that has made it really hard to regulate and hard for communities to understand,” said Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney with Earthjustice that has fought the sale of these power plants to bitcoin miners in court. The amount of energy that bitcoin mines—or more broadly cryptocurrency mines—use is relatively obscured. Greenidge Generation, a power plant off the coast of Seneca Lake near Dresden, New York, was initially a coal-fired plant but had been operating as a gas “peaker” plant since 2017, after it was acquired by Atlas Holdings LLC in 2014. In March 2020, a bitcoin mine adjacent to the power plant began operations. Power plants that operate in New York must obtain an air permit from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation every five years. Greenidge Generation's permit expired in 2021, and as it made its way through the renewal process, the company shared data on its energy generation activities. According to the company, it produced 203,918 megawatts of electricity for the state grid in 2018, when it was still operating as a peaker plant. In 2020, when it began to expand its operations into bitcoin mining, it still supplied 215,588 megawatts to the grid, but also produced an additional 132,215 megawatts for bitcoin mining, meaning the plant would have to run much more often. In 2022, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law a two-year moratorium on air permits for fossil fuel power plants that serve cryptocurrency mines. Greenidge was grandfathered in because it had submitted its application for a renewal air permit before the law went into effect. In June of that same year, however, the Department of Environmental Conservation still denied the renewal of Greenidge Generation's air permit, saying that its continued operation would be inconsistent with the State's Climate Act, which sets stringent greenhouse gas emissions limits over the next two decades. Since it began its cryptocurrency mining operations, Greenidge Generation has been emitting more greenhouse gases. According to court filings, the plant's projected total emissions from 2022 through 2026 “is more than six times the emissions the facility was producing, on average, prior to shifting to cryptocurrency mining operations.” Since its air permit renewal was denied, Greenidge Generation has gone through multiple cycles of appeals, and all the while it continues to run its power plant. Seneca Lake Guardian and other community groups oppose the company's appeals in court, represented by Earthjustice. “At some point they're going to exhaust their options, and I am confident that we will prevail.” When a bitcoin mine moves into a small community like the one near Seneca Lake, municipal officials are rarely aware of the impact it could have on local residents. Some are even swayed by the promise of new jobs to offer tax abatements. “I don't think most communities realize what they're inviting into their community until it's too late,” said DeRoche. The bitcoin mine near New York's border with Canada, which is owned by the Canadian company Digi Power X (formerly Digihost), also bought a gas peaker plant—Fortistar—in order to power its operations in a small town just north of Buffalo called North Tonawanda. For the residents of North Tonawanda, this pushed many to action. Deborah Goldeck, a resident of the town for 40 years, has been fighting for more regulation on the Digi Power X mine since it started operations in 2022. According to Goldeck, a May 2024 meeting of the town's common council where multiple people voiced their concerns led to widespread change across the town. Residents' advocacy culminated in a two-year ban on cryptocurrency mining in North Tonawanda, and a formal noise study to evaluate whether the existing mine is violating the town's noise ordinance. “We just can't live like this,” said Goldeck. In 2021, the water consumption of bitcoin mining was estimated to be 1,573 billion liters (also known as gigaliters), and has continued to increase since then. In North Tonawanda, residents are worried about pressure on the wastewater infrastructure. “My house has a pipe that goes down the hill into the lake, and that's my water source,” said Taylor. “If there's a harmful algal bloom in front of my water source, I can't use my water at all. That same year, under direction from the state Department of Conservation, Greenidge Generation also made some efforts to protect local marine wildlife from its water intake systems. Though local residents have found some success in limiting the expansion of cryptocurrency mines in their towns by enacting local laws and moratoriums, it is these numerous larger lawsuits at the state level that can prevent existing mines from continuing their operations, even if they are not all successful. “You cannot allow the purchase of this power plant, which is going to result in astronomical increase in operations and pollution, to go through without a climate law analysis,” said DeRoche. The Digi Power X air permit also expired in 2021. The Department of Environmental Conservation has yet to make a decision on its renewal application. Digi Power X also plans to build a cryptomining facility on 20 acres in Hildebran, a small town in Burke County, North Carolina. Town officials said at a public meeting that the company has yet to apply for permits. Bruce Berry, who lives about a mile away, told Hildebran Town Council members earlier this month that “anybody who lives close to one of these is not happy. If you want to go home and sit on your porch and listen to the birds, you can't.” However, a new bill would give local governments more leeway in some types of zoning decisions. Both Digi Power X and Greenidge Generation did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Other cryptocurrency mines in the state of New York are not powered by their own gas plants. Instead, like most businesses, they are hooked up to the electricity grid. This means that the greenhouse gas emissions linked to their operations, and their impacts on New York residents, are much harder to track—making lawsuits less likely. “I think it's harder to get reliable information about the ones that are on the grid and how much power they're using—how much they're spiking local electricity rates, and how much they're impacting the grid and the community's price of power,” said DeRoche. Using mapping technology, datasets from the New York Times and dispersion models, scientists were able to identify 635 power plants that were supplying electricity to these mines between August 2022 and July 2023. “The potential amount of energy demand that these [34] power-hungry facilities are able to put together is as high as 33 percent more than the entire city of Los Angeles,” said Gianluca Guidi, a visiting scholar at Harvard who co-authored the study. The study also tracked air pollution, specifically the pollutant PM2.5; exposure to it can lead to health impacts like childhood asthma and premature mortality. Although New York state only has four of these 34 large mines, multiple areas of New York City were identified as hotspots—counties where at least one community was experiencing a non-negligible amount of increased air pollution due to these bitcoin mines' demand on the grid. One hotspot was identified in Queens, near the Astoria Generating Station, a local gas plant. Our nonprofit newsroom provides award-winning climate coverage free of charge and advertising. We rely on donations from readers like you to keep going. The hotspot in Staten Island, for example, was traced back to a New Jersey power plant, and the bitcoin mines that plant was serving were in upstate New York. Allies of the cryptocurrency industry have pushed back against the results of studies like these, arguing that cryptocurrency mining can stabilize the grid, meaning they can power down operations at peak demand times and make use of excess renewable energy. This notion of grid stabilization is based on “expected operation rather than actual participation in demand-side markets or other firm commitments to reduce consumption during peak demand conditions.” Today, the Trump family also owns a crypto company, World Liberty Financial, and the president's sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are heavily invested in a bitcoin mining company called American Bitcoin. He also placed cryptocurrency allies in the Securities and Exchange Commission, an agency that had previously been responsible for curbing corruption and fraud in the industry. Given Trump's support for increased fossil fuel extraction and expanded infrastructure for oil, gas and coal, the energy-intensive operations of bitcoin mines may continue to be powered by polluting power plants. Meanwhile, the New York Independent Systems Operator is already planning for an increase in energy demand over the next 10 years due, in part, to cryptocurrency mines and data centers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump's reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH's renewed outlook. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard. Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. The ETH futures premium has yet to exceed the 5% threshold typically associated with a neutral market, indicating that demand for leveraged bullish positions remains notably limited. Some analysts interpret this as an opening for further short covering, while others contend that Ethereum's core fundamentals have yet to improve meaningfully. Irrespective of Ether's price action, recent network upgrades have notably enhanced layer-2 scalability. More importantly, they have helped solidify Ethereum's position as the leading platform in terms of decentralization and security. This is reflected in Ethereum's total value locked (TVL), which stands at $64 billion. For comparison, the three largest direct competitors—Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron—collectively hold a total value locked (TVL) of $22.3 billion. The limited demand for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has emerged as a key warning sign. Even Ether's strongest single-day price performance in four years failed to prevent a third consecutive day of net outflows, according to data from Farside Investors. On May 8 alone, US-listed Ether spot ETFs experienced net outflows totaling $16 million. Reduced network activity lowers overall demand for ETH and negatively affects net staking yields, as the protocol's burn mechanism relies on competition for data processing. ETH options markets also offer insight into whether whales and market makers anticipate further downside risks. Nevertheless, Ether could regain market attention after US President Donald Trump reversed his position following earlier public endorsements of competing altcoins. According to a Politico report published on May 8, President Trump felt he had been “used” and had severed ties with the lobbyist who reportedly proposed the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. While Trump's social media post on March 2 specifically mentioned Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP, the subsequent March 6 “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order struck a much more reserved tone.
