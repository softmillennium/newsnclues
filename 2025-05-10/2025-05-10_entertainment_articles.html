                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Johnny Rodriguez, the first country star of Mexican American descent known for such recordings as “You Always Come Back (To Hurting Me)” and “Ridin' My Thumb to Mexico,” died Friday after entering hospice care. His daughter confirmed Rodriguez's death in a social media post. “It is with profound sadness and heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our beloved Johnny Rodriguez, who left us peacefully on May 9th, surrounded by family,” she wrote. “Dad was not only a legendary musician whose artistry touched millions around the world, but also a deeply loved husband, father, uncle, and brother whose warmth, humor, and compassion shaped the lives of all who knew him.” Born in Sabinal, Texas — just 90 miles from the Mexico border — Juan Raul Davis Rodriguez became “Johnny Rodriguez” after catching the attention of businessman Happy Shahan, who hired him to sing at his Alamo Village, a John Wayne film set turned Texas tourist attraction. That same year, Rodriguez released his second album, All I Ever Meant to Do Was Sing, which added two more hits to his resume. The hard-luck anthem “Ridin' My Thumb to Mexico” mixed wanderlust with a broken heart, while “That's the Way Love Goes” found him interpreting Lefty Frizzell's sublime ballad a decade before Merle Haggard's version. “Rodriguez is already a superb C&W stylist and one of the most promising country writers,” Rolling Stone's Chet Flippo wrote of Rodriguez in 1974. He scored with “Dance With Me (Just One More Time),” “I Just Can't Get Her Out of My Mind,” “I Wonder If I Ever Said Goodbye,” “North of the Border,” and “Foolin',” and put his own spin on a pair of rock staples, covering the Beatles' “Something” and the Eagles' “Desperado.” He also recorded a rousing version of Robert Earl Keen's “Corpus Christi Bay.” When the supergroup of Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Waylon Jennings were recording their debut album Highwayman with producer Chips Moman in 1984, they recruited him to sing on their version of Woody Guthrie's “Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos).” “It's one of those old stories about maltreatment of aliens,” Cash said to introduce the song when he and Rodriguez delivered a duet version on the TV series Nashville Now in 1987. Joe Louis Walker, Revered Electric Blues Musician, Dead at 75 Jill Sobule, Singer of History-Making 1995 Single 'I Kissed a Girl,' Dies in House Fire at 66 While not an “outlaw country” singer, Rodriguez had his share of troubles. In 1998, he was arrested and charged with murder after shooting an acquaintance that he mistook for a burglar in his Sabinal, Texas, home. Metallica's 'Enter Sandman' at Sold-Out Virginia Tech Concert Sparks Seismic Activity Sugarland Drop Out of 2025 ACM Awards Performance After Jennifer Nettles Illness Rodriguez continued to tour and perform live throughout his life. Despite sporting a cast on his right hand that prohibited him from playing guitar, Rodriguez, then 65, was in superb voice and gregarious spirit, flashing his 1000-watt grin in between verses. “I asked Willie [Nelson] … how you can say so much in so few words,” Rodriguez once recalled during an interview in Australia. “He said, ‘Just be honest and make it rhyme.'</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Between her roles as Cipher in The Fast and the Furious franchise and Furiosa in Mad Max, she's game for anything. Unfortunately, her kids still think Tom Cruise is cooler, which she shared in a humorous story with Jimmy Kimmel. Theron is an actress adored by fans all over the globe. It's disheartening that her kids couldn't care less about the movies she's been in. In one case, one of her children even compared her to Tom Cruise, with Cruise coming out on top. “I was picking up my youngest from dance yesterday and we drove past the new Mission Impossible poster,” Theron said on Jimmy Kimmel Live. “Where Tom Cruise is hanging onto some yellow plane, and he just looks really cool.” “My kids were with me when I shot Old Guard 2, and I worked on this incredibly intricate sequence. Where we brought in this amazing helicopter pilot, Fred North,” she went on. Shooting 99% of it on a real helicopter as it's trying to, like, shake me off like a rag doll. “We took like two weeks to shoot this sequence. And my child yesterday just looked at this poster of Tom Cruise and went, ‘It's weird, he looks so much cooler than you did when you were hanging off the helicopter.' Theron stars with Uma Thurman in The Old Guard 2, a sequel to her 2020 action film. “And [I] always wanted to do something with her. Because when I kind of came into the action world, she was really, to me, like the sensei. Like, she was the OG.” Then, Theron and Kimmel agree that Thurman was robbed when she didn't get an Oscar for Kill Bill. “What she did in that film was just so unbelievable.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Legend says it is “sad, sometimes shocking” to look now at his former collaborator Kanye West, who played an instrumental role in Legend's musical breakthrough 20 years ago. Legend was signed to West's GOOD Music label, and the latter also appeared on the album, which went on to sell three million copies, win three Grammy Awards and make Legend's name as an artist. John Legend, Sheryl Crow & More Join Dawes For 'I Love L.A.' Tribute Opening At 67th Grammy Awards West was already a star himself with his hit album The College Dropout. 20 years later, Legend has described West during that fertile creative period as “passionate, gifted and had big dreams for himself and the people around him.” It does feel sad, sometimes shocking, to see where he is now.” West has encountered widespread controversy in recent years, from selling T-shirts adorned with swastika logos to wearing a black Klu Klux Klan hood in public. He has previously been banned from the platform X for some of his offensive statements. Legend told The Times:  “I didn't see a hint of what we're seeing now, his obsessions with antisemitism, anti-blackness, and it is sad to see his devolution.” His descent started then and seems to have accelerated recently.” She Don't Have to Know is a soap opera. I don't think my life was ever that interesting.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With a new single racking up millions of streams, Kanye West is continuing to spread alarming antisemitic rhetoric. On Thursday, the 24x Grammy winner released ‘Heil Hitler' on multiple streaming platforms, many of which have since removed the track while it continues to rack up millions of streams on Elon Musk‘s X, along with the single's art, which resembles a swastika. As of Saturday, the song remains on the social media site while Spotify, Soundcloud and other platforms have worked to remove it. The song has since be shared by multiple profiles on social media and music streaming sites, with self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate promoting it in a video. In a petition started by the Anti-Defamation League to “reinstate guidelines meant to protect users from disinformation and hate” on Facebook and Instagram, the organization wrote, “Thanks to advocates like you raising your voice, Spotify has removed Kanye's Hitler song from their platform. Now, we need your help to hold another company accountable.” The Yeezy mogul's X account was briefly deactivated in February after writing on the platform that he's “never apologizing for my Jewish comments,” adding in a disturbing series of posts, “I'm a Nazi. Following a similar antisemitic rant in 2022, which raised concerns for West's mental wellbeing, the artist released an apology in Hebrew the next year. Meanwhile, Musk's stance on free speech and censorship leave little hope for potentially regulating hate speech on the platform, after he previously ripped into advertisers who pulled out of X in 2023 over his own amplification an antisemitic post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elton John, Dua Lipa, Coldplay, and Florence Welch are among the over 400 artists who have signed a letter calling on British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to update copyright laws in the face of A.I. “We, along with 400 other creatives, have signed and sent this letter to the Prime Minister, urging him to give Government support to proposals that would protect copyright in the age of AI,” Elton John wrote on social media. Paul McCartney, who previously lobbied for copyright law protections in a BBC interview earlier this year, also signed the letter, along with Kate Bush, Robbie Williams, and hundreds more musicians, actors, playwrights, directors, and artists. “The fight to defend our creative industries has been joined by scores of UK businesses, including those who use and develop AI. The creative industries have always been early adopters of technology. Indeed, many of the world's greatest inventions, from the lightbulb to AI itself, have been a result of UK creative minds grappling with technology.” Metallica's 'Enter Sandman' at Sold-Out Virginia Tech Concert Sparks Seismic Activity Sugarland Drop Out of 2025 ACM Awards Performance After Jennifer Nettles Illness This past December, artists, publishers, media companies and more banded together to form the Creative Rights in AI Coalition, which aims to keep the current copyright protections in place despite the U.K.'s continued courtship of AI technology That's your job,” McCartney said to lawmakers in a BBC interview earlier this year. If there's such a thing as a government, it's their responsibility — I would think — to protect young people to try and enhance that whole thing so it works. So that these people have got job and can enhance the world with wonderful art.” Rolling Stone is a part of Penske Media Corporation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UPDATED, SATURDAY AM WRITETHRU after Friday update: Disney/Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* is currently playing a bit ahead of Shang-Chi's second weekend with $9 million Friday and a weekend around $35M, off 53% from its opening last week. That second weekend ease is the eighth best among all MCU titles across 36 releases. That will get the Florence Pugh-Wyatt Russell-Sebastian Stan Marvel ensemble past $130M by Sunday. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings during its post-Labor Day frame in 2021 did $34.7M, off 54%. Currently the weekend for all titles looks to be doing $91M, -5% from a year ago ($96.1M per Box Office Mojo), that frame boosted by Disney/20th Century Studios' opening of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes with $58.4M. How does it stack up to other fourth weekends for horror films? Sinners is behind Blair Witch Project‘s fourth weekend of $24.3M, but that's a bit of apples to oranges as it was technically the second wide weekend for the found-footage movie, which had a two-weekend platform. Interestingly, Sinners isn't that far from the fourth weekend of A Minecraft Movie ($22.7M). A Minecraft Movie (WB) 3,468 theaters, Fri $1.9M, 3-day $8.8M (-36%), Total $409.8M/Wk 6 Best areas for business –again not to use that word in strongly– are South Central, Midwest, Mountain and West. AMC Empire NY is the top grossing venue stateside with just over $13K through Friday. Fight or Flight (Vert) 2,153 theaters, Fri $1M, 3-day $2M/Wk 1C+ CinemaScore. 48% definite recommend on PostTrak, which is OK, but the second best of the new bunch here this weekend. Best areas of play are Midwest, Mountain and West with AMC Century City the best venue with close to $4K through yesterday. Shadow Force (LG) 2,170 theaters, Fri $720K, 3-day $2M/Wk 1CinemaScore is a B here for this Kerry Washington-Omar Sy Lionsgate action pic, which was made for $40M net. Business is light with the pic's best regions being the South, East, South Central and Midwest. King of Kings (Angel) 1,089 (-946) theaters, Fri $140K 3 day $700K (-59%), Total $59M/Wk 5 Friendship (A24) 6 theaters, Fri $227K, 3-day $500K, PTA $83K/Wk 1 Excellent limited start with strong business at AMC Lincoln Square NYC, Angelika NY, AMC Burbank, AMC Grove, AMC Century City and the Vista in LA (where do you park when you go there?). It's pretty much official, this is the best opening theater average of 2025 to date. Remember, there are bigger events to come at the summer B.O. PREVIOUSLY, FRIDAY AM: Disney and Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* will continue to storm the weekend box office in its second session with an estimated $30 million, off 60% or less from its debut frame. The Jake Schreier-directed movie will cross the century mark Friday stateside in a weekend that's littered with a bunch of single-digit-million openers. Summer competition doesn't start until next weekend, when New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines will debut to a projected $30M-$40M. Thunderbolts* will have all the Imax and PLFs this weekend. Warner Bros' Sinners is not going to hell at the box office, but rather continues skyward ending week 3 with $46.6M and a running total of $193.3M. The Ryan Coogler-directed, Michael B. Jordan-starring vampire movie is crossing $200M today with a fourth weekend that's expected to be potent with $23M-$25M, -30%, per industry forecasts. Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 ends its second week with $13.1M and a running total of $44.7M. The Eli Craig-directed title is set in a fading midwestern town in which Frendo the clown, a symbol of bygone success, reemerges as a terrifying scourge. We just heard the movie did $600,000 previews. Lionsgate's Kerry Washington and Omar Sy action movie Shadow Force is eyeing $3M-$4M at 2,170 screens. Critics aren't hot on it with 50% Rotten. In Shadow Force, an estranged couple with a bounty on their heads must go on the run with their son to avoid their former employer, a unit of shadow ops that has been sent to kill them. Vertical is excited about its airplane action movie Fight or Flight, which carries a 78% fresh with both critics and audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. The Josh Hartnett-starring, James Madigan-directed pic has the best previews of anyone with $550K, and that's from last night and Monday Mystery screenings. Out of the new movies tracked on PostTrak last night, Fight or Flight had the best scores with a 49% definite recommend and 3 stars. Pic's blurb: A mercenary takes on the job of tracking down a target on a plane but must protect her when they're surrounded by people trying to kill both of them. Briarcliff Entertainment has Juliet & Romeo at 1,350 theaters and it stars Jason Isaacs, Rupert Graves and Rebel Wilson. The Timothy Scott Bogart pop musical movie is based on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

If you build it, they will come — even if sometimes “they” are stormtroopers looking to arrest you for speaking out against Emperor Palpatine. To do this, he turned some quite real places in our world. The Imperial Senate is a tricky and thankless location to create. It needed to exist in a way that held true to the glimpses we've already seen in other films and series, but worked for what “Andor” needed. Oh, and all of that needed to look like “Star Wars.” Related Stories ‘Poker Face' Season 2: Costume Designing Wicked Looks for Cynthia Erivo's Quintuplets ‘Top Chef' Has ‘Honed in' on What Makes It an Enduring Success, According to Its Judges “[The style is] not just 1920s, kind of Art Deco, you know? But there's a Calatrava architecture or things with odd-shaped windows or complex curves [that start] to have the bones of something you can work with,” Hull told IndieWire. “I do think you can shoot ‘Star Wars' on location really successfully, actually.” But it's just interesting, and I think [locations] actually also help inspire some of the sets we did later. I think it's very easy to do a very contrived thing, especially under pressure and the time that we have. Hull toured Italy, France, and Spain to find some of those layers, particularly as they might relate to the peak of the political power on Coruscant. “That was where we were most aware of class and status. The whole concept is that those who have are on top and those [who] have not are down below. And to be honest, I don't think we spend enough time below,” Hull said. That more humane sense of space comes through because “Andor” found a place that has those white elephant bones and Calatrava-style architecture on a large enough scale: the City of Arts and Sciences complex in Valencia, Spain. The complex in Valencia couldn't provide everything that “Andor” needed to chase Mon out of the Senate, of course. We wanted that to actually be out in the main atrium. It was way more shocking to have Stormtroopers in the Senate, but there are certain limits to what you can do on location, generally. So we built quite a lot of these elements,” Hull said. To do this, Hull ended up modeling out a view of Coruscant and then trying to find points he could logically connect and expand on. “[We] went looking for real plazas to put between it, not worrying about the statues that you see in the prequels and things like that, because there's a timeline thing there, possibly. But also, you know, maybe we're on the other side of it. And particularly with the way Tony writes, it's about understanding where you are as an audience.” Where we are as an audience throughout the escape sequence of Episode 9 is in turmoil, mainly, as Cassian (Diego Luna) and Mon rush to escape the Senate lockdown while trying to keep their fear of discovery, of themselves and the whole rebellion, in check. It's ultimately that sense of the Empire's hand that Hull and his team convey through all their choices, on set and on location, making the world of “Star Wars” feel even bigger than it looks. “It just felt epic, in a way that I was worried about going into the project, that we wouldn't be able to achieve,” Hull said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, Jay Wheeler honors mom in new song. From career milestones to new music releases to major announcements and those little important moments, Billboard editors highlight uplifting moments in Latin music. Here's what happened in the Latin music world this week. Mexican star Alejandro Fernández announced that a portion of proceeds from every ticket sold on his ‘De Rey a Rey' U.S. and Canada tour will be donated to Backline, a nonprofit organization dedicated to mental health and wellness support for music industry professionals and their families. According to a press release issued by Live Nation, who is behind this upcoming tour, this partnership will “specifically help expand Backline's services and reach within the Latino music community—an area often underserved by mental health resources.” Some of the members of Grupo Frontera made a special visit to fan Perla Leyla, a 7 year old girl fighting cancer. “Thank you for this beautiful surprise,” she captioned the sweet video posted on Instagram. Puerto Rican star Jay Wheeler unveiled “Mejor Que Tú” — which replaced “Track Loading” on his album Girasoles. “‘Mejor Que Tú' is personally one of three very special tracks on this album,” Wheeler said in a statement. “It's a very special song dedicated to my mom. Karol G's new documentary, Tomorrow Was Beautiful, is the culmination of her history, making, record-setting Mañana Será Bonito stadium tour. I also feel that the beautiful kind of self-love you start to develop begins to blossom and becomes more noticeable.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Republicans and Democrats prepare to face off about Medicaid cuts in next week's Energy and Commerce Committee meetings at the House of Representatives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is vehemently speaking out against threats to Medicaid. Republicans are considering a range of proposals to slash Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities, in order to fund an extension of Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy. Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans are trying to pass the bill by Memorial Day, but the Medicaid fight is a tough one for Republicans — particularly those in swing states or in red states whose constituents heavily rely on Medicaid. She continues, “In order to do that, you have to gut what is left of the health care and social safety net in the United States. Ocasio-Cortez referenced a Congressional Budget Office report on Wednesday that scored parts of Republicans' Medicaid plan. “They confirmed millions of Americans will be left out in the cold from their cuts on Medicaid,” she says. Republicans have committed to cutting $880 billion in spending under the committee's purview; it would be impossible to do that without significantly slashing Medicaid. One of the ways Republicans are considering cutting Medicaid spending is to add work requirements to the program, which Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is against, because it adds burdensome paperwork demands that could lead to eligible beneficiaries losing their insurance for administrative reasons. Medicaid has strict income caps, so adding work requirements could also force people to perform low-wage jobs in order to maintain their health insurance coverage. The majority of people covered under Medicaid are already working, according to a KFF report studying Medicaid enrollees which also found that many of those not working couldn't because of caregiving responsibilities, illness or disability. If the federal government enacted work requirements, a 2023 CBO report found that about 600,000 people would lose coverage, but the policy would not increase employment. When Arkansas implemented the policy, it resulted in thousands losing coverage. Metallica's 'Enter Sandman' at Sold-Out Virginia Tech Concert Sparks Seismic Activity Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez argue that the administrative burden and red tape of work requirements would result in a huge loss of coverage for Americans. Critics of Medicaid cuts are also extremely concerned about how it would affect rural hospitals and other providers whose patients rely on Medicaid, arguing it would destabilize health care for communities beyond those who have Medicaid as their health insurance. The committee markup is expected to take place on Tuesday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Real Housewives of New York City” has not been canceled, according to Bravo. RHONY has been on “pause” for several months. The 15th season of the show starred Erin Lichy, Ubah Hassan, Brynn Whitfield, Jessel Taank, Sai De Silva, and Jenna Lyons, as well as newcomers Racquel Chevremont and Rebecca Minkoff. As rumors about RHONY swirled on Friday, several franchise stars reacted. Is that true?” De Silva shared a screenshot of an article addressing the cancellation report and wrote, “It's just fake news.” Andy Cohen also posted to his story to agree with Variety editor Kate Arthur's comment that said, “Nothing has happened with RHONY that's different from before Bravo made those announcements earlier this week. Earlier in the week, Bravo announced an update on several “Real Housewives” shows, confirming that the franchises set in Beverly Hills, Orange County, Potomac, and Salt Lake City would all be returning to the network. Page Six then posted a report that claimed the network took RHONY off the air, with no firm plans for its return. OG RHONY star Bethenny Frankel took the report to heart and posted a goodbye message to the beloved franchise she helped launch in 2008. It is bittersweet,” she said in a TikTok video on May 9. “It's the end of an era, for me personally, and for that show which was an alchemy of disaster.” “It was a flawed group of women in a flawed city authentically being ourselves,” she said of the original cast before criticizing Bravo for the reboot of the series two seasons ago. “They cast this glossy, curated version of what they thought people wanted New York City to be,” she added of the revamped cast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ABC has renewed several of its unscripted shows for the 2025-26 season, but one of its longest-running reality franchises remains in limbo. The network announced Friday that it has picked up new seasons of American Idol, America's Funniest Home Videos, Celebrity Jeopardy!, Celebrity Wheel of Fortune and Shark Tank for next season. Roundball Rocked: With NBA Return Looming, NBC Purges Scripted Roster The Bachelor typically films in the fall for a January premiere, so if ABC decides to go ahead with the show as usual, it still has time to make a call and get things in place for its usual cycle. As for the renewed series, American Idol will go into its ninth season on ABC (and 24th overall, including its Fox run) in 2025-26. AFV — ABC's longest-running unscripted show — will enter its 36th season in the fall. The network has also renewed seven scripted shows (911, Abbott Elementary, High Potential, Grey's Anatomy, The Rookie, Shifting Gears and Will Trent) and placed a straight-to-series order to 911: Nashville, a spinoff of 911. ABC has yet to make a decision on first-year drama Doctor Odyssey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeff Bridges says he's doing well while in remission from his 2020 lymphoma diagnosis. My wife laughs at me, she says, ‘I haven't showered in days. Some positive sides to it, I suppose. Although I don't mind her smell,” he said. Bridges opened up about getting COVID in a March 2021 post on his website. “My 9×12 tumor has shrunk to a 2×2 thing. On January 7, I get a letter from the place where I'm getting my chemo infusion for the cancer.” Soon after, my wife Sue and I share an ambulance to the ICU. We both got the ‘Roma,'” he continued. Bridges shared that he spent five weeks in the hospital because of his compromised immune system from battling cancer but shared a positive message to fans. A post shared by The Late Show (@colbertlateshow) Jeff Bridges told AARP in June 2023 that he was afraid for his acting career while fighting to overcome cancer and COVID-19. So at first I said, ‘Well, we'll see.' But eventually that became, ‘Maybe I can.' Then I began to think of it as a gift being presented,” he said. A post shared by Jeff Bridges (@thejeffbridges) The drama follows a CIA operative named Dan Chase, played by Bridges, who goes on the lam after killing an assassin who breaks into his house. “The Old Man” ran for two seasons before getting canceled, but Bridges is returning to the big screen as Kevin Flynn for “Tron: Ares,” which will premiere on October 10, 2025.</p>
