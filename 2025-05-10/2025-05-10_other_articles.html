                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Yellowjackets season 3 ended by sharing answers about Pit Girl and hinting that if the show gets renewed for season 4, adult Shauna Sadecki (Melanie Lynskey) will be front and center. Ever since the Showtime drama premiered in November 2021, fans have been captivated by the dark story of a teenage girls soccer team who get lost in the Canadian woods. Yellowjackets has always excelled at sharing a few different mysteries in each season, but if Yellowjackets season 4 happens, some fans think that one big question can remain unanswered. As soon as the girls' soccer team ends up stranded in the Canadian woods, there appears to be a strange and unsettling presence. Teenage Lottie Matthews (Courtney Eaton) thinks The Wilderness, as the girls call it, is real, and she's stubborn and unwilling to listen to any rational discussions. But while fans have wondered since the pilot episode if there really are supernatural elements, many viewers think Yellowjackets season 4 will continue to feature these scary moments without giving a rational explanation. Idk, feel like the show may end this way…" "They'll never say if it was supernatural or not. In another thread, Redditor @hauntingvacay96 wrote, "I hope and think it will stay ambiguous." This is a great point, and the show would arguably suffer if fans were given a yes or no answer about whether these forces are real. Like the best TV dramas that have been released in the past few decades, Yellowjackets features tough characters who don't fit into easy categories or boxes. While most of the characters are harsh, cruel, and violent, they each have sympathetic moments, and viewers get to know their inner lives. It's also fascinating to watch the adult timeline and see how the characters, who have been through similar terrible experiences and done horrible things, split up and come together. Yellowjackets benefits from the long-form storytelling of television and doesn't need to give easy answers like the satisfying end of a horror movie. In an interview with Variety in May 2023, Simone Kessell, who plays adult Lottie Matthews, answered a question about the paranormal aspects of the series. I think these are all mechanisms they've put in place to survive." "I think it's their karma catching up. I think they're so warped from what has happened." While there are many shows like Yellowjackets and several great coming-of-age dramas, the unique nature of the Showtime drama keeps fans coming back and also makes them hopeful for a fourth season renewal. Yellowjackets Season 2 is Showtime's most-streamed premiere — and for good reason. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. As the mysteries around Avengers: Doomsday further engage during filming, fans are left wondering which characters could die. Pokemon GO players who are looking to take on Mega Houndoom in Raid Battles can use this guide to help themselves prepare. Players will uncover a lot of secrets while exploring Lumiere during the prologue in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Activision continues its battle against cheating in Call of Duty titles by going after the popular manufacturer of the Cronus Zen device. Following our hands-on preview of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, Game Rant spoke with the game's director about how the project took shape. Zoro and Mihawk's eventual showdown is one of the most anticipated in One Piece, but Zoro needs to perfect this ability before they clash! Players meet Moonbird in Chapter 2 of The Midnight Walk.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Before Johnny Carson was a comedian, he was The Great Carsoni, the 14-year-old magician who entertained youthful audiences in Nebraska for $3 a show. While he ultimately took a different route into show business, he maintained a lifelong interest in magic and how illusionists performed their tricks. In Carson's opinion, many of those so-called clairvoyants were simply recreating magicians' tricks. Instead of presenting the craft as an artful illusion, psychics were claiming actual superhuman abilities and charging big money for their services. In the 1970s, Geller became a popular talk-show guest who'd perform demonstrations of what he claimed to be psychokinesis, dowsing and telepathy. Carson was willing to have Geller as a guest, but if he claimed to be truly psychic, he should pass an actual test of his abilities. Carson enlisted the help of the Amazing Randi, another illusionist who had developed a side hustle exposing frauds who claimed to have supernatural powers. (Randi would make debunking Geller's abilities a second job for years.) Geller and his team provided The Tonight Show with a set of props for the appearance, in which he'd use the eerie power of his mind to buckle spoons and perform other amazing feats. Geller wasn't allowed anywhere near the new props until he sat next to Carson on live television. What followed was 20 of the cringiest minutes in late-night history. The look on Geller's face when he saw the replacement spoons gave it away — he was about to be exposed as a fraud. The New York Times Magazine called the Tonight Show segment “a legendary immolation, in which Geller offered up flustered excuses to his host as his abilities failed him again and again.” But a funny thing happened after Geller's Tonight Show appearance. His failure made such a splash that he was immediately booked on Merv Griffin and other talk shows. People who wanted to believe in paranormal phenomena talked themselves into Geller's failure as proof that he was psychic. Ironically, he said, “That Johnny Carson show made Uri Geller.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Review & Photography by Manny Manson for MPM Wolverhampton is a town with steel in its soul. Built on the bones of industry and raised on the holy trinity of Sabbath, Priest, and dare I say Robert Plant, it's no surprise that one of the UK's most beloved grassroots venues—KK's Steel Mill—feels like sacred ground to rock fans. Downing of Judas Priest fame, the venue fuses raw industrial charm with modern stagecraft, a cavernous hall of metal and sweat and roar, where heritage and heaviness collide. Outside, for once the rain had stayed clear and not soaked the streets of the Black Country, but inside KK's, a different kind of storm was brewing, a storm that would span eras, genres, and generations. A night that promised both spiritual incantation and fretboard fireworks. Opening tonight's bill were Wytch Hazel, the Lancastrian quartet who've been quietly conjuring their own peculiar alchemy for over a decade. And following them, none other than the great Michael Schenker himself, here, celebrating fifty years since his UFO debut with a full-force set of classic anthems and deep cuts. Both, in their own way, worship the riff. Wytch Hazel appeared first, robed in white, their necks adorned with crucifixes and their stage presence somewhere between medieval monks and Victorian occultists. Their aesthetic is unmistakable, deeply pagan and entirely devout. Formed in Lancaster by singer/guitarist Colin Hendra, Wytch Hazel have carved a unique path through the contemporary rock landscape since their debut Prelude in 2016. Drawing from the heavy blues of early Sabbath, the melodic flair of Thin Lizzy, and the stately solemnity of British folk, theirs is a sound both familiar and otherworldly. Following Prelude came II: Sojourn in 2018 and then III: Pentecost in 2020, each album deepening the band's identity, pairing scripture and solos with a sense of unflinching earnestness. The riff is immediate, majestic and propulsive, with Hendra's voice ringing out like a clear bell over its churning chords. This is Wytch Hazel's great strength: they believe in their music. “I Am Redeemed,” this one from the earlier III: Pentecost, follows with its grand marching rhythm and ringing dual leads. Hendra and second guitarist Alex Haslam (Big Al) trade licks with unhurried precision, their playing evoking Wishbone Ash and early Maiden in equal measure. Andy Shackleton on bass and Aaron Hay on drums provide the rock-solid backbone, the rhythm section understated but never lacking in drive. The crowd is attentive, absorbing it all with silent reverence. “Still, We Fight,” a standout from II: Sojourn, ups the drama with its triumphant vocal line and rolling toms, before “Archangel,” from III: Pentecost, offers a stately, near-processional groove. This is music steeped in ancient imagery and spiritual metaphor, but it never tips into the pompous. The crosses they wear aren't props. Then comes “Dry Bones,” another thunderous track from III: Pentecost with a swaggering bassline and one of Hendra's finest vocal performances. “The Devil Is Here,” another from II: Sojourn snarls with urgency. It's heavier than earlier material, but retains that melodic backbone. Think Blue Öyster Cult by way of Lindisfarne. Up next comes “Woven,” an upcoming cut from their soon-to-be-released album V: Lamentations (due in July), a somewhat ethereal track built on layered guitars and haunting harmonies. If Wytch Hazel's past albums conjured fields and firelight, this song feels more like stone and smoke, a deeper, darker chapter. “Elements,” another debut from the new record tonight, builds on that momentum with galloping rhythms and a surprisingly intricate solo passage. “Spirit and Fire,” back to III: Pentecost, is all uplift and shimmer, perhaps the most overtly devotional track in the set, but its fervour feels genuine. The closing song, “Healing Power,” is a fitting finale, and a final taste of the new album, it swells and soars with clean vocals, righteous harmonies, and a closing riff that lingers in the rafters long after the lights dim. And now, it's time for the fire to be passed. While Wytch Hazel offered reverence and ritual, what follows is a full-blooded rock resurrection. Michael Schenker's “My Years with UFO” 50th Anniversary World Tour has arrived, and tonight marks the opening of its UK leg. Michael Schenker's name is etched into hard rock history. Bursting onto the scene in the early '70s as a teenage prodigy with the Scorpions, he joined UFO in 1973 and, over the next five years, helped craft some of the most enduring and influential hard rock records ever made: Phenomenon (1974), Force It (1975), No Heavy Petting (1976), Lights Out (1977), and Obsession (1978). With his white Flying V and unmistakable tone, he became a cornerstone of that era, melodic, fearless, and utterly unique. As the lights drop once again at KK's Steel Mill in Wolverhampton. An expectant hush swells through the crowd. Moments earlier, Wytch Hazel had transformed the room into a flickering cathedral of medieval power and spiritual conviction, now, anticipation turns electric. The riff alone is enough to summon goosebumps, but what it signals is even more exciting—the arrival of one of hard rock's most storied guitarists. Michael Schenker is about to take the stage. This is the UK opening night of his “My Years with UFO” 50th Anniversary World Tour. A retrospective journey through a back catalogue that has helped to shape hard rock and heavy metal as we know it. But unlike many legacy tours, this one feels fiery, alive, charged with intent. There's reverence, yes, but also raw energy, KK's is buzzing with it! And then he appears, under the lights, no leather jacket, with sleeves rolled up nowadays, Flying V slung low, his white hair hidden by a sunglass laden fluffy hat and neck scarf, arms bared save for tattoos and an elbow support. The band lock in behind him and bang, they're into “Natural Thing,” the 1976 classic from No Heavy Petting. It's like a piston firing into life. The guitars are underpowered, hidden beneath a punchy, slightly over-forward rhythm section. The low-end is too prominent, and for an artist like Schenker, whose career has been built on lyrical solos and biting melodic phrasing, it's a frustrating mix. But it's not enough to derail the energy. “Only You Can Rock Me,” from 1978's Obsession, rolls in next, and the band begins to settle. There's a communal joy rippling through the venue, everyone knows the words, everyone is here for this celebration. The band Schenker has assembled for this run is solid and well-drilled. On vocals is Swedish singer Erik Grönwall, stepping into the shoes of Phil Mogg, no small task. Grönwall, best known for his work with H.E.A.T. and a short stint with Skid Row, brings a bright, soaring voice and an energetic stage presence. He's not trying to mimic Mogg, but instead sings the songs with his own flair, hitting the high notes with power, if not always with perfect clarity. He has the pipes, without doubt, but they often fight for airspace against the booming bass and drums. Still, his energy is infectious, and when the band kicks into “Doctor Doctor” from 1974's Phenomenon, the room erupts. Voices rise in unison, arms go up, and Schenker finally starts to emerge from the murk with a blistering solo that reminds us why he's worshipped by guitarists across genres. Schenker was only 18 when he penned this classic UFO track, it was their first to enter the top 40, back when we had an eclectic ‘POP CHART'. From “Mother Mary” and “I'm a Loser” to “This Kid's” and “Lights Out,” each song arrived like a call to arms, an explosion of tightly coiled, melodic hard rock that has aged with incredible grace. The twin leads and punchy arrangements still sound vital, relevant, even revolutionary. Barend Courbois (Blind Guardian, Tank) handles the bass with muscular precision, his tone booming through the mix, perhaps too much at times; especially over of stage right, but giving each track a thunderous low-end that ensures nothing sounds too flat. On drums, Bodo Schopf (also of the Michael Schenker Group) is a machine, as ever he is tight, powerful, playing with both restraint and muscle. Guitarist and keyboardist Steve Mann, a Schenker mainstay, fills in the cracks with deft rhythm playing and tasteful keys, providing atmosphere without cluttering the sound. The band downshifts into “Lipstick Traces,” a haunting acoustic instrumental from Phenomenon. It's a brief, reflective pause in the set, a chance for Schenker to show his more lyrical side. He segues straight into “Between the Walls,” a deep cut from 1975's Force It, where it's segued with the previously played, “This Kids” tonight the pairing works brilliantly. It's intimate, powerful, and a stark reminder that Schenker's mastery lies not just in shredding but in soul. Originally from 1977's Lights Out, the track builds slowly, patiently, with Mann's keys laying a lush backdrop for Grönwall's vocal, which here finds space to shine. When Schenker's lead finally arrives, it's nothing short of stunning, achingly melodic, restrained, and full of character. It's the kind of playing that transcends technique. From there, it's full throttle to the finish. “Let It Roll”, from 1975's Force It, brings back the chugging swagger, while “Can You Roll Her” from 1976's No Heavy Petting and “Reasons Love” dig deeper into the catalogue. There's no filler here, just a barrage of stone-cold classic tracks played with fire, shot, straight from the hip. Even with the low guitar mix, it's immense. The main riff lands like an earthquake, and the solo that follows is a journey in and of itself, building, tumbling, ascending. Schenker is fully in command now, his fingers dancing, not fighting. “Shoot Shoot” (Force It) is all bite and swagger, one last blast of the full-throttle UFO sound. Schenker dedicates this final song of the night to Phil Mogg and the late, great Pete Way. There's a real tenderness in the tribute, Schenker doesn't say much, but his eyes and the music do. A celebration of the people who made those songs what they were, and the fans who have kept them alive for five decades. And yet, despite those technical flaws, the show shone. A visionary who chose melody over machismo, who walked away from commercial success more than once to follow his own compass, fought demons at every turn, but brushed them away. And tonight, standing before a crowd of believers at KK's Steel Mill, he reminded us why that matters. But few can claim a catalogue like Schenker's. And for those who were there, it'll echo in their heads and hearts for a long time to come. PARADISE SLAVES, the brand new band featuring former members of 36 CRAZYFISTS and DIECAST,…</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“The Conjuring: Last Rites” is marketed as the final entry in its universe, but I wouldn't bet on that. Given that the movie closely draws from one of the most infamous case files of the Warrens, the world's foremost paranormal investigators, researchers, and demonologists before the rise of today's modern “ghost hunters,” who primarily film content for reality series programs on television and/or YouTube channels, with little genuine thought for helping victims of hauntings, possessions, and paranormal attacks. Honestly, what kind of disrespectful YouTuber or streamer would intentionally rile up spirits, insult them, and do everything in their minuscule brainpower to gather evidence of a haunting, a possession, or even demonic activity? All for the sake of gaining subscribers, views, likes, and so on. Then, after collecting enough video and audio evidence, they suddenly leave the family, the poor victims, and those seeking help to deal with the more active, angry, and increased paranormal activity because of their careless actions, meant only to serve their cause without realizing the dangerous long-term consequences of it. The Warrens were never like that, and that is why The Conjuring films are also necessary to expose all these shady individuals with cameras because even when Ed and Lorraine Warren would gather video and audio evidence and used the existing handheld cameras at the time, they only did these things for documentation and not to brag about it, show it to the world, and upload it online. Obviously, without the Warrens, The Conjuring Universe would not have existed because these movies are based on their lives. It was only through The Conjuring Universe that the world got to see this dedication displayed by Ed and Lorraine Warren. That is why I believe The Conjuring Universe has not only expanded but endured for so long. Its basis in the real-life investigations (case files) of the Warrens over many decades means the producers and movie studios have countless case files to choose from and, of course, to give them the movie treatment they deserve. Another reason The Conjuring films resonate with audiences is the actors themselves, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who portray Ed and Lorraine Warren. They convincingly embody their real-life counterparts, showing a genuine desire to free families from their demonic hauntings, possessions, and poltergeist activity at home. Much credit goes to The Conjuring Universe for helping realign the direction of horror toward more refined, sanitized, and tasteful reenactments of real-life cases representing the genre. None of The Conjuring films resort to blatant, tasteless horror full of blood splatter, dead bodies, and frights for the sake of scaring; they prioritize storytelling first, followed by horror tropes. One can observe that after the first Conjuring and in between the sequels and spinoffs, many filmmakers in the horror genre consciously made an effort to pattern themselves to, improve on their work, or at least acknowledge that they could do better, thanks to the bar raised by The Conjuring Universe. Before The Conjuring Universe started, it felt like everything that could have been done to the genre was accomplished, but who knew that all it took was to take a few steps back and reassess everything to find out that all that was needed was to return to more traditional, tried-and-true, classic filmmaking methods? Or else they are wasting their money purchasing tickets to watch a two-hour movie with only a handful of solid jump scares, scream-out-loud moments, and frights, but empty, aimless, soulless storytelling as the downside, which is the all too common case before The first Conjuring movie came out. At this stage of their professional lives, the Warrens are older but still willing to help as always, because that is one of their mantras in this vocation, which has become a driving force for them to continue doing what they do. To endanger their lives (mind, body, and spirit) again to save another family tormented by demonic spirits is not only a risk for them but also a service for the greater good in banishing evil from those affected by it. On a little side note, I have seen all the existing interviews, reports, and documentaries I could find about Ed and Lorraine Warren, and besides being very in-depth on what they do and their real-life cases, one thing stood out, and that is they discussed several times that there were many times that they did not think they would be able to get out of it alive, but they still went for it. That speaks to their fearlessness about this. I have nothing but respect and admiration for the Warrens, as millions of other people do, and it is a wonderful gesture to them that another movie has been made to further chronicle their lives as the world's foremost paranormal investigators, researchers, and demonologists. Indeed, they may be gone and reunited with God, but their heroic, selfless, and legendary acts are being remembered through movies because, whether they are entirely based on, loosely based, or exaggerated, the whole point here is that they are still derived from their lives. Which leads me to this: for an official teaser trailer, that felt like a full-length one because it was packed; it had a lot of meat to it, and it is probably the best one I have ever seen from them.

Padakkalam, helmed by debutant director Manu Swaraj, aims to be just that except that it is meshed with a supernatural element, a la Indiana Jones and the desi ‘parakaya pravesha' (body swapping). Padakkalam movie review: Despite engaging performances, particularly from Suraj Venjaramoodu and Sharafudheen, the film's weak writing and underdeveloped female characters hinder its overall impact. Whenever a movie is set on a college campus with a group of friends and some professors as the key players, you can expect that there will be a lot of laughs, some action and perhaps, mystery as well. Padakkalam, helmed by debutant director Manu Swaraj, aims to be just that except that it is meshed with a supernatural element, a la Indiana Jones and the desi ‘parakaya pravesha' (body swapping). Jithin (Sandeep Pradeep) is in love with his engineering college classmate Jeevika (Niranjana Anoop) but she suddenly decides to break up with him citing personal differences. While a heartbroken Jithin is trying to brainstorm with his friends - Ramzad (Arun Pradeep), Kannan (Saaf) and Nakul (Arun Ajikumar) - on what do, a college strike is on with Jithin's department demanding that their HOD be replaced as he got the job with fake documents. Shaji gets elevated as HOD naturally as he is senior but Jithin and his friends discover something is amiss when Shaji starts behaving strangely and their suspicion falls on Renjith. They believe that Renjith has used some supernatural power and/or black magic to control Shaji and start to investigate this. They shockingly discover that he can control people through some means and are worried what his main objective is. And they get into a major issue. The story is weak from the beginning and while the four students, Suraj Venjaramoodu and Sharafudheen have been used to elicit laughs using situations, mannerisms and dialogues, it's only partly effective. However, this is just not enough to make the movie totally fun ride. The female characters in the movie - Jeevika and Shaji's wife (Pooja Mohanraj) - hardly have no major role to play and that's unfortunate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At a Congressional hearing on UFOs on May 2, leading scientists and Pentagon insiders claimed that the U.S. government is hiding evidence of alien life. Daily Mail tells about secret CIA documents. These documents prove contact with extraterrestrial beings. Officials continue to deny encounters with mysterious phenomena. But a newly discovered Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) document proves the government may have identified extraterrestrials creatures decades ago. In the 1970s and 1980s, the CIA conducted experiments with people who claimed to be able to perceive information about distant objects, events, or people. This process is known as “remote viewing.” One such report, titled Description of Personnel Associated 'ET' Bases, detailed a session in which a remote viewer was given unknown targets and asked to describe what he saw. The document describes alleged alien bases located in Alaska, South America or Africa, as well as on Titan, Saturn's largest moon. "We have encountered three types of entities so far, associated with bases in various locations within the solar system," the subject wrote. But the Titan base apparently had human scientists working there, including an "attractive woman." The remote viewing session was part of the CIA's top-secret STARGATE program, which recruited people believed to have psychic abilities for military and intelligence purposes during the Cold War. The program began in the early 1970s and was officially closed in 1995 after it was deemed scientifically unreliable and operationally ineffective for intelligence gathering. During a remote viewing session, participants typically drew what they "saw" and took brief notes about their perceptions. The 12-page document includes several drawings believed to depict the locations of these alien bases - one of which resembles a rocky mountain. This drawing has been interpreted as Mount Hayes in Alaska, which is approximately 2,5 meters high. Numerous witnesses have long reported seeing flying saucers, strange lights and other unexplained phenomena in the Mount Hayes area. He said there were two beings standing outside one of the bases, "performing some routine task." According to the session recordings, one of them was sitting at a round console with a round, screen-like object. At Titan Base, a remote viewer did not report seeing any alien life, but described the place as apparently staffed by people who were "indistinguishable from native earthlings." The final location was described as being somewhere south of the equator, although the remote observer was unable to determine whether it was in South America or Africa. At this base, the observer said he saw two beings. Humanity is unable to make contact with this creature," the report notes. The agency used people with supposed psychic abilities to assist in a number of intelligence operations. Psychics were used to track kidnapped hostages held by terrorist groups. Their abilities were used to locate fugitives in the United States. One such program, known as Sun Streak, even tasked a remote viewer with finding the Ark of the Covenant, which he claimed was hidden somewhere in the Middle East. Another high-profile session involved renowned telepathic clairvoyant and intelligence agent Joe McMoneagle, dubbed "Remote Viewer No. It was larger than Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza. “I started getting images of people trapped in a place where the atmosphere was getting worse,” McMonigle recalled. “It was obvious that these people were dying for some reason, but they were people, but twice our size.” Manhattanhenge 2025: When to Expect a Unique Sunset in New York This Year Reprinting of materials is allowed only with an active link to the source page.
