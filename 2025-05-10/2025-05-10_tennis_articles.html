                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic will play again before the French Open and Jim Courier is delighted. But with Roland Garros on the horizon, Djokovic has stepped up his preparations as he goes in pursuit of a record 25th major title. After Novak Djokovic withdrew from the Italian Open, there were no plans for him to play again before entering the French Open. But as he gets older, playing himself into peak match condition before a Grand Slam is imperative for Djokovic. It seems like he understands this as it emerged on Friday that Djokovic has accepted a wildcard to play in the Geneva Open, a decision that Jim Courier welcomes. It's great news for tennis and it's great news for Novak that he is going to get at least one match in,” Courier told Tennis Channel Live. “Remember last year he got hit by the bottle in Rome and lost early. Then he went to Geneva and played there until the semi-finals. Lost to Machac and I'd say he put in less than his best effort in that match, because he had one eye on Paris. If he gets two or three matches out of this tournament, that's perfect. That's all he needs for a little momentum.” Djokovic is set to make his second successive appearance at the Geneva Open after reaching the semi-finals in 2024. He is keen to play some more matches before Roland Garros after playing just two matches on clay since the 2024 Paris Olympic Games. Djokovic will aim to rediscover his best form in Geneva and Courier further explained why this is a good move for the World number six.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Danielle Collins pulled off a huge upset at the Italian Open on Saturday, breezing past defending champion and No. The American hit headlines in January when she riled up the booing fans at the Australian Open, reminding them that they “pay her bills” and gesturing to kiss her behind. Afterwards, Collins shared an emotional insight into her tennis journey, explaining just how much the sport had shaped her. It's already been a rollercoaster season for Collins, who previously planned to retire at the end of 2024 before her circumstances changed and she decided to keep playing. 35 started the year with a bang, making a big impression in Melbourne when she hit back at the hostile crowd and told them: “One of the greatest things about being a professional athlete is the people that don't like you and the people that hate you, they actually pay your bills. It's all going towards the Danielle Collins Fund. Collins was then unable to defend her title at the Miami Open and, after losing in the Charleston quarter-final in April, she was sidelined for a month before returning in Rome this week. It's Swiatek's earliest exit at a WTA 1000 tournament since 2021. Just in    Rafael Nadal, Serena Williams and Federer called out for Italian Open conduct This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding. After getting just her second win in nine meetings with the world No. "I think it's shaped me so much. Coming from a pretty humble beginning, I think it's hard getting into tennis,” the former world No. “Tennis is an expensive sport and my parents did everything for me. It's been more than three years since Collins last got a win over Swiatek, beating her in the 2022 Australian Open semi-final. Explaining how she got the win on Saturday, the American said: “My priority today was to go out and be consistent with the shots that I was hitting. Sometimes that can go one way or another. “But I think having the confidence and trusting myself in those big moments to go after it, to trust my athleticism and to really just like not be afraid to go after my shots in those big moments, I think was key.” See today's front and back pages, download the newspaper, order back issues and use the historic Daily Express newspaper archive.

Berrettini rallied from 3-5 in the second set and saved two set points on return — both with volley winners — before completing a hard-fought one-hour and 55-minute win. HEAR HIM ROAR 📣Berrettini triumphs over Fearnley 6-4 7-6(0) to win at home 🇮🇹@InteBNLdItalia | #IBI25 pic.twitter.com/1uglZbufPy The 29-year-old's return this year was an emotional one: He raised his arms aloft and unleashed a triumphant roar to the passionate fans inside Campo Centrale. After improving to 8-5 in the Italian capital, Berrettini will next face Madrid champion Casper Ruud, who maintained his rhythm with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over Alexander Bublik. Yet Ruud kept his cool in a clinical deciding set, during which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. After extending his winning streak to seven matches, the 26-year-old will aim to maintain his momentum in Rome, where has reached the semi-finals on three occasions (2020, 2022-23). “It feels great,” said Ruud, who now leads Bublik 7-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “I'm not sure how to address this match. When Sascha starts his game, it becomes a bit of a show, so you just try not to admire it, to stay focused. “He always hits spectacular shots, and sometimes it's a little frustrating for us opponents. It's never easy against Sascha, we had a tough match here in Rome a couple of years ago, so happy to get another today.” In other early action on Saturday, Marcos Giron stunned countryman and fourth seed Taylor Fritz 7-6(4), 7-6(3) to reach the third round at a clay-court Masters 1000 for the second time in his career (Rome 2022).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PARIS, FRANCE - JUNE 11:  Novak Djokovic of Serbia celebrates with the winners trophy after victory ... More against Casper Ruud of Norway in the Men's Singles Final match on Day Fifteen of the 2023 French Open at Roland Garros on June 11, 2023 in Paris, France. Novak Djokovic will be seeking a record 25th Grand Slam title at Roland Garros beginning later this month, but Chrissie Evert doubts the 37-year-old can pull it off in Paris. “I would never underestimate him, but I would be surprised if he won another major, let's put it that way,” Evert said Friday during a phone interview from Boca Raton, Fla. “I mean, you've got to give the guy credit. I would be pleasantly surprised, just with his results in the past and he's human…I'm not feeling it." He lost his first-round matches in Madrid and Monte Carlo on red clay, as well as on hardcourts at Doha and Indian Wells, but he did reach the finals in Miami and the semifinals at the Australian Open where he suffered a muscle tear in his hamstring. “I've seen him play brilliantly on grass, and he's won Wimbledon so many times, that's why I can't say no, he's not gonna win another one,” Evert said. “I don't think it's gonna be the French Open….but you can never count him out.” Per DraftKings, Djokovic, a three-time Roland Garros champion, is tied for the third betting favorite to win the title behind defending champion Carlos Alcaraz (+120) and world No. 1 Jannik Sinner (+250), who was set to return from his doping ban on Saturday in Rome. 2 Alexander Zverev are both at +900 to win the title. PARIS, FRANCE - JUNE 08:  Iga Swiatek of Poland celebrates winning match point against Jasmine ... More Paolini of Italy during the Women's Singles Final match on Day 14 of the 2024 French Open at Roland Garros on June 08, 2024 in Paris, France. As for the women, four-time champion and world No. 2 Iga Swiatek (+160) is the favorite, followed by world No. “I don't know how you can pick anybody between Sabalenka, Iga and Coco, and with [Australian Open champ] Madison Keys really to me would be my fourth pick,” Evert said. She added that Sabalenka and Gauff are “playing at the top of their games,” but that Swiatek needs to find another gear in Paris. “I just don't know how Iga is going to react,” Evert continued. We know what she is capable of, and with her past records, she's brilliant at the French Open, but I just don't know if she can find her A game, because she's going to need it…It's kind of like we're seeing her C game right now.” Evert will be part of the TNT broadcast in Paris that also includes Venus Williams, Andre Agassi, Boris Becker, John McEnroe, Mats Wilander, Lindsay Davenport and Caroline Wozniacki. Patrick McEnroe will emcee the star-studded gala celebrating the achievements of nearly 1,000 young people who benefit each year from HJTEP's tennis and education programs. Both a live and silent auction will raise critical funds needed to support these programs. Chrissie Evert working with the Harlem Junior Tennis & Education Program (HJTEP) in 2010. She added: "I am chairwoman of the USTA Foundation, so I'm familiar with a lot of these programs, and I've been really working with them for five years now,” Evert said, adding that she gives credit to Katrina Adams, the former chairman and CEO of the USTA and now the Executive Director and President of Harlem Junior Tennis. “I think that Katrina does a great job,” Evert said. She continued: “You know, life isn't fair, and there are a lot of kids out there who just don't have the opportunities that others had. And so what better thing to do once you've retired and you made a lot of money and you've had your place in the sun, but it's like it's time to give back.”</p>

Ahead of the match, Navone told ATPtour.com, “He has been out for three months, and is still No. But this is why we play tennis, to play in the biggest stadiums in the world.” As for Sinner, he's still dealing with the repercussions of the ban, saying in a pre-tournament press conference, “What's missing for me is the complete feedback of where my level is. That's going to come slowly with time of playing. After the first-round match, I'm going to have a good picture of myself and where I'm at.” If you don't have cable, Tennis Channel is available with live TV streaming services like DirecTV, Sling, and others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu has been putting in the hard work in the gym as it has resulted in an improvement in her movement on clay, according to Marion Bartoli as she also shared her thoughts on the world No 49's coaching arrangement with Mark Petchey. Raducanu, though, will also be the first to admit that she has limited experience on clay as this is only her fifth main draw appearance at the Madrid-Rome swing. But there has been a noticeable change in the way she is sliding on the surface, according to 2013 Wimbledon winner Bartoli. “I think she's moving better which is crucial on clay. The surface is lively and you're sliding all over the place so you need to get your legs extremely strong,” she told Sky Sports Tennis. Raducanu has been working with Petchey since the Miami Open, but for now it remains an interim solution as he is not able to fill the role on a full-time basis due to his work as a television commentator. Emma Raducanu comes through ‘mental' second-round match after last-minute switch Emma Raducanu wins humorous WTA award – ‘Oops!… she did it again!' Petchey as well as long-term mentor Jane Donoghue are in her box in Rome and Bartoli explained why they are a perfect fit for the 22-year-old. “She will really need someone on the court with her every day if she wants to work on her technique. She's going to her box quite often with eye contact which means she trusts the people inside that box.” Emma Raducanu appears to have discovered the joy on court once again and it is helping her game.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aussie tennis sensation Alex de Minaur is looking to level up his clay court game ahead of Roland Garros and a potential showdown with Jannik Sinner having practised with Carlos Alcaraz. However, de Minaur is still seeking a win over Alcaraz on clay after the Spaniard knocked him out in Monte Carlo and Barcelona. But in an important move from the Aussie, de Minaur and Alcaraz spent 1.5 hours on court hitting at high-intensity in the Italian capital ahead of their campaigns. However, while sending a scare through the tennis world ahead of Roland Garros, Alcaraz teamed up with de Minaur for a training session in Rome. While losing the set to Alcaraz in the mini-practice match, de Minaur can take a lot away from the battle as he prepares for his first-round clash with Luca Nardi. Meanwhile, Alcaraz told reports he is feeling back to his best as he welcomes the challenge of Sinner returning to the tour. The time off for the Spaniard appeared to do him some good with his forehand and movement looking back to his best. Alcaraz and De Minaur playing a practice set. Sinner is back in action in Rome this week after a three-month suspension for inadvertently ingesting a banned substance. The Italian fans welcomed him with open arms during a practice session. Sinner's absence might present de Minaur the perfect opportunity to grab a first career win over Sinner, with their head-to-head record currently 10-0 in the Italian's favour. Clay isn't Sinner's favourite surface, and if he shows any signs of rust it might open the door for de Minaur. De Minaur has only ever won the solitary set against Sinner, but that came way back in 2020. While de Minaur is hoping for a deep run in Rome, unfortunately his fiancee Katie Boulter was eliminated in the first round. Boulter has never excelled on clay, but recently made inroads on the surface at the Bille Jean King Cup. Raducanu would need to reach the semi-final in Rome, but will also have an opportunity to overtake Boulter in Paris. Boulter has been struggling in 2025 having been eliminated in the second round of the Australian Open and Indian Wells.
