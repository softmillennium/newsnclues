Trump announced breakthrough after talks apparently secured by secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and vice-president, JD Vance

India and Pakistan have agreed to a US-mediated ceasefire with immediate effect, though its longevity was thrown into question after reports of cross-border shelling and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir just hours after it was announced.

The ceasefire – which was hoped to end days of escalating clashes between the two nuclear-armed countries – was first declared by the US president, Donald Trump, on Saturday afternoon, after 48 hours of diplomacy between India and Pakistan, apparently brokered by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and vice-president, JD Vance.

Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

The ceasefire was later confirmed in a post on X by the Pakistani deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, who said the ceasefire would come in “with immediate effect”.

The Indian foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said the heads of military operations from both countries had spoken on Saturday afternoon.

“It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea. Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.” The top military officials would speak again on 12 May, Misri added.

However, the agreement was thrown into question after cross-border shelling restarted between the Indian and Pakistan armies on Saturday night. Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administered Kashmir, was also rocked by heavy explosions and projectiles that soared through the sky from over the border.

An Indian government source told AFP that Pakistan had violated the ceasefire. A senior Pakistani security source said it was India that had started the ceasefire violations.

Rubio said the ceasefire agreement had come after extensive negotiations by him and Vance with the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, and other top officials.

“I am pleased to announce the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio said on X.

“We commend prime ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,” he added.

News of the ceasefire was greeted with celebrations across India and Pakistan, particularly in Kashmir, the disputed region divided between the two countries that had been at the forefront of hostilities, with dozens killed in shelling over the border – known as the Line of Control (LoC) – in the past week.

In Uri, near the border in Indian-administered Kashmir, one of the worst-hit towns in the recent cross-border violence, Tanveer Chalko, 30, described scenes of jubilation.

“When news of the ceasefire broke, displaced families in camps began dancing with joy,” he said. “This is a great step towards peace and the welfare of the people. As a resident of a frontier area, I cannot put into words what this announcement means for us. Now everyone is preparing to return home.”

But Lal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, a border town in Indian-administered Kashmir where many were killed and injured in this week's violence along the LoC, said the news of the ceasefire was bittersweet. His home was destroyed in cross-border shelling and two of his relatives were killed.

“We've been here before – temporary ceasefires brokered by global powers. But until India and Pakistan seriously settle their disputes, we must brace for even greater conflicts,” he said.

However, those who gathered in the streets to celebrate were then driven indoors as explosions began to boom out over parts of Indian-Kashmir on Saturday night.

Historically, the US has played an important role as a mediator between India and Pakistan when hostilities have flared up. The Trump administration's proactive role in brokering peace was, however, a notable reversal of Vance's position 48 hours earlier, when he said the US would not intervene in the India-Pakistan conflict as it was “none of our business”.

The ceasefire appeared to give both sides the opportunity to walk away claiming victory. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” said India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.

In Pakistan it was met with a chorus of approval. “Congratulations to the civil and military leadership for emerging out of the war with dignity, professionalism and national resolve unequivocally intact,” said the Pakistani senator Sherry Rehman.

The ceasefire came after India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border missile strikes against significant military targets on Saturday, with many fearful it would escalate into all-out war. India and Pakistan have fought four wars, most recently in 1999.

The fighting this week was first inflamed on Wednesday after Indian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were in response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in which militants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which it blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists.

The situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks. India claimed to have intercepted more than 400 drones targeting cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday. In retaliation, India said it had launched four drone strikes on Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure.

By Saturday morning, India had accused Pakistan of launching strikes on dozens of airbases and military headquarters across north India, using long-range weapons, drones and fighter aircraft. The accusations came a few hours after Pakistan said India had fired six surface-to-air missiles targeting three of Pakistan's most important military bases early on Saturday morning. Both accused the other of firing cross-border missiles first.

At a press conference, the Indian army spokesperson Col Sofiya Qureshi accused Pakistan of attacking 26 sites in India, including the Pathankot military airfield in Punjab, Srinagar airport and Udhampur air force base in Indian-administered Kashmir, as well as “deplorable and cowardly” attacks on civilian infrastructure.

Qureshi said “Indian armed forces successfully neutralised these threats” but added that some damage was done to equipment and personnel at four airbases.

The Indian army alleged its attack on Pakistan's military bases on Saturday was in retaliation for high-speed missiles fired at several airbases in Punjab at about 2am. “In a swift and calibrated response, Indian armed forces carried out precision attacks only on identified military targets,” said Qureshi.

Pakistan's version of events was different to that of India. In an address broadcast on state TV at about 3.30am, the military spokesperson Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry claimed India had struck first, using fighter jets to fire surface-to-air missiles at Pakistan's Nur Khan, Murid and Rafiqui military bases. He said the “majority” of India's missiles were intercepted by air defence systems.

Shortly after, Pakistan confirmed it had begun its counterattack against India, under the name Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos, a phrase from the Qur'an roughly translating to “wall of lead”.

In the hours after the missile attacks, both India and Pakistan said they were committed to de-escalation, if the other side agreed to stop their attacks.

The US-brokered ceasefire allayed international concerns over a cycle of escalation and fears of a wider war. Earlier on Saturday, the G7 had called for both countries to exercise “maximum constraint”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

World Trade Organization hails ‘constructive step' as senior figures come together to discuss tariffs

Senior US and Chinese officials held talks early on Saturday in Geneva in a tentative first step towards defusing a trade war that is disrupting the global economy, according to China's state-owned news agency and people close to the talks.

China's vice-premier, He Lifeng, and the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, met after weeks of growing tensions as duties on imports between the world's two largest economies have risen above 100%.

The trade dispute, combined with the decision by the US president, Donald Trump, last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stoked fears of a sharp global downturn.

Trump said on Friday that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods “seems right”, suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145% levies imposed on Chinese imports. The location of the talks has been kept secret, although a witness saw more than a dozen police cars outside a private residence in a leafy Geneva suburb.

Shortly after 9.30 am local time, Bessent, the US trade representative Jamieson Greer and about a dozen US delegates marched through the lobby of the Intercontinental hotel, ignoring journalists' requests for comment before ducking into waiting cars and speeding off.

The Chinese delegation left from another hotel, the President Wilson on the shores of Lake Geneva, with large police contingents escorting the two convoys through the city, blocking all other traffic on their routes. By late morning, Chinese state media confirmed the weekend-long talks had begun.

Tariffs imposed on the Asian manufacturing giant since the start of the year currently total 145%, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245%.

In retaliation, China slapped 125% levies on US goods, cementing what appears a near trade embargo between the world's two largest economies.

Beijing has said the US must lift tariffs first and vowed to defend its interests. Bessent has said the meetings in Switzerland would focus on “de-escalation” and not a “big trade deal”.

The head of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said on Friday that she welcomed the talks, calling them a “positive and constructive step toward de-escalation”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US secretary of state urged both sides to de-escalate as he leads efforts to secure a solution to the deepening crisis

US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has offered US assistance in starting “constructive talks” to end the conflict between India and Pakistan, as the two states traded heavy missile fire on Saturday, prompting concerns over wider military escalation.

Rubio has been engaged in back-and-forth diplomacy between the two countries in recent days, calling for de-escalation as India and Pakistan have been engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday.

The US's top diplomat “continued to urge both parties to find ways to de-escalate and offered US assistance in starting constructive talks to avoid future conflicts,” state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on Saturday.

Fighting between India and Pakistan started on Wednesday after Indian missiles hit nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people and triggering a cycle of tit-for-tat attacks between the two countries. India said Wednesday's missile strikes were in retaliation for an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir in late April, which saw militants kill 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which India blamed on Pakistan.

Clashes peaked on Saturday, as both countries launched missile strikes deep in each other's territories, using long-range weapons, drone swarms and fighter jets.

Both Indian and Pakistani officials have said that they did not wish to see further escalation. At a press briefing on Saturday, Indian military officers said: “Indian armed forces reiterated their commitment to non-escalation, provided the Pakistan side reciprocates.”

Pakistan's defence minister, Khawaja Asif, said while they had no “issue to de-escalate,” that he did not trust India's statements.

There has been a flurry of international diplomacy to head off conflict, as despite both India and Pakistan stating that they do not want escalation, there has been a steady uptick in intensity during the week of clashes.

The deepening hostilities have raised widespread international concern, with the two nuclear powers closer to war than they have been in decades.

US efforts to try to mediate between India and Pakistan have been spearheaded by Rubio, who has been in regular contact with both Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, since the Kashmir attack.

India has been a key US ally in the region in recent years, seen as a counter to China's rising influence – a top policy concern of the Trump administration. The US, in turn, is India's largest trading partner, and Reuters reports that it has offered preferential trading terms to the Americans in order to secure a stronger partnership with its ally.

Nonetheless, the US had earlier seemed reluctant to get involved in the India-Pakistan row, with US president, Donald Trump, calling the tit-for-tat strikes “a shame” earlier in the week. The vice-president, JD Vance, said an India-Pakistan war would be “fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America's ability to control it”.

The US currently does not have an ambassador in India nor Pakistan, as the Trump administration has yet to fill the vacancies.

Other countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have stepped in to try to defuse the situation. China, which supplies much of Pakistan's military hardware, also said that it would be willing to “play a constructive role” to find a solution to fighting.

Pakistan's defence minister said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia was playing a key role as interlocutor and that the Saudi foreign minister had sent a representative to Pakistan.

UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, joined G7 ministers in calling for calm, with the G7 issuing a statement on Saturday urging “maximum restraint” from both India and Pakistan. 
 “We call for immediate de-escalation and encourage both countries to engage in direct dialogue towards a peaceful outcome,” the statement read.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Myanmar's junta chief met Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平) for the first time since seizing power, state media reported yesterday, the highest-level meeting with a key ally for the internationally sanctioned military leader.

Senior General Min Aung Hlaing led a military coup in 2021, overthrowing Myanmar's brief experiment with democracy and plunging the nation into civil war.

In the four years since, his armed forces have battled dozens of ethnic armed groups and rebel militias — some with close links to China — opposed to its rule.

The conflict has seen Min Aung Hlaing draw condemnation from rights groups and pursued by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, but he has maintained close ties to allies China and Russia. 

He met Xi in Moscow on the sidelines of Russia's Victory Day celebrations on Friday and thanked China for its humanitarian assistance following a 7.7-magnitude earthquake in March, reported junta media the Global New Light of Myanmar.

He also thanked China “for its support of Myanmar's stance on regional and international fronts,” it said.

Chinese state media Xinhua news reported that Xi expressed his country's support for Myanmar pursuing development “suited to its national conditions, safeguarding its sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national stability, and steadily advancing its domestic political agenda.”

Xi said he hoped Myanmar would take “concrete measures to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, institutions and projects in Myanmar, and intensify efforts to combat cross-border crimes.”

More than 6,600 people have been killed since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, and millions displaced. Concerned about the violence on its doorstep destabilizing regional peace and its economic ambitions, China has reportedly mediated talks between Myanmar's junta and key rebel groups.

China is a major ally and arms supplier to the junta, but analysts say it also maintains ties with armed ethnic groups in Myanmar that hold territory near its border.

Beijing has long been eyeing Myanmar's resource-rich northern Shan state — now under rebel control — for infrastructure investment under its trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative.

While Min Aung Hlaing's Friday meeting with Xi was his first time in his role as junta chief, the general had previously met the Chinese leader in Myanmar's capital Naypyidaw in January 2020, a year before seizing power.

Thousands of overseas Filipino workers have already cast their ballots in the race dominated by a bitter feud between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and his impeached vice president, Sara Duterte.
While official turnout figures are not yet publicly available, data from the Philippine Commission on Elections (COMELEC) showed that at least 134,000 of the 1.22 million registered overseas voters have signed up for the new online system, which opened on April 13.

More than 20 foreign leaders were in Russia to attend a vast military parade today marking 80 years since the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, taking place three years into Russia's offensive in Ukraine.

US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer began talks with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland yesterday aiming to de-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off trade between the world's two biggest economies and damage the global economy.

The US delegation has begun meetings in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng (何立峰), Xinhua News Agency said.

Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks have begun, but spoke anonymously and the exact location of the talks was not made public.

Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim, but there is hope that the two countries would scale back the massive taxes — tariffs — they have slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on US-China trade.

US President Donald Trump last month raised US tariffs on China to a combined 145 percent, and China retaliated by hitting US imports with a 125 percent levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped US$660 billion.

Even before the talks began, Trump on Friday suggested that the US could lower its tariffs on China, writing on social media that a “80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott [Bessent].”

Sun Yun (孫韻), director of the China program at the Stimson Center, said that it would be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting would produce any substantive results.

“The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,” she said, adding that even a small reduction would send a positive signal. 

Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon, and has imposed a 10 percent tax on imports from almost every country in the world.

The dispute with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20 percent charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the US. The remaining 125 percent involve a dispute that dates back to Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed the 145 percent.

During Trump's first term, the US alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. 

Those issues were never fully resolved, and the fight over China's tech policy now resumes.

Trump is also agitated by the US' massive trade deficit with China, which came to US$263 billion last year.


DEFENDING DEMOCRACY: 
                                        Taiwan shares the same values as those that fought in WWII, and nations must unite to halt the expansion of a new authoritarian bloc, Lai said                                        The government yesterday held a commemoration ceremony for Victory in Europe (V-E) Day, joining the rest of the world for the first time to mark the anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe.
Taiwan honoring V-E Day signifies “our growing connections with the international community,” President William Lai (賴清德) said at a reception in Taipei on the 80th anniversary of V-E Day.
One of the major lessons of World War II is that “authoritarianism and aggression lead only to slaughter, tragedy and greater inequality,” Lai said.

One of the bills, the Taiwan Assurance Implementation Act, requires the US Department of State to periodically review its guidelines for engagement with Taiwan, and report to the US Congress on the guidelines and plans to lift self-imposed limitations on US-Taiwan engagement.

“The rates of change on the depth and breadth of their exercises is the one non-linear effect that I've seen in the last year that wakes me up at night or keeps me up at night,” Paparo was quoted by FT as saying while attending the annual Sedona Forum at the McCain Institute in Arizona.

Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv on May 10, President Volodymyr Zelensky rebuked the idea of a demilitarized zone in the war and emphasized the importance of first securing a ceasefire.



""We agreed that a full and unconditional ceasefire must begin on Monday, May 12, for at least 30 days. We jointly demand this from Russia, and we know we are supported in this by the United States,"" Zelensky said.

The announcement follows mounting fears that the two nuclear-armed countries were on the brink of engaging in another full-scale war.

Ukrainian media outlet ZN.UA reported on May 10 that their law enforcement sources confirmed an ongoing probe by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau into suspected embezzlement, money laundering and bribery.



Iran is preparing to send Russia Fath-360 short-range ballistic missile launchers, Reuters reported on May 9, citing Western security and regional officials familiar with the matter.

""Ukraine and all allies are ready for a complete unconditional ceasefire on land, in the air, and at sea for at least 30 days, starting as early as Monday,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote.

U.S. President Donald Trump has acknowledged in private that Russia is difficult to negotiate with because they ""want the whole thing,"" referring to Ukraine, the WSJ reported, citing sources familiar with the comments.

The visit marks Merz's first trip to Ukraine, and the first time all four leaders have travelled there together.

A notice about the airspace closure was published on the U.S. Defense Department's NOTAM (Notice to Airmen) website on May 10, as cited by Ukrainian defense news outlet Militarnyi.

""As in the past, it is now for Russia to show its willingness to achieve peace,"" the EU's statement reads. 




Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov rejected the idea of a 30-day ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, claiming in an interview with ABC News on May 10 that it would be ""an advantage"" for Ukraine.

""Our involvement in the war was justifiable, and this belongs to our sovereign rights,"" North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said. ""I regard this as part of the sacred mission we must execute for our brothers and comrades-in-arms.""

The Kremlin has released a guest list of countries and foreign leaders planning to attend the contentious May 9 Victory Day parade.

Military personnel from 13 countries are expected to march through Moscow on the day of the parade. At least 29 world leaders are also expected to attend the event, Russian state-controlled media reported on May 6. 

Troops from Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Egypt, Laos, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Myanmar, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam will march in the parade. 

Twenty-nine foreign leaders will also attend, including those from Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Burkina Faso, China, Congo, Cuba, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, Palestine, Serbia, Slovakia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. 

Representatives from North Korea and Russian-controlled Abkhazia and South Ossetia, as well as defense ministers from 31 countries, will also be present.

Every year on May 9, Russia holds grandiose military parades in celebration of the end of World War II in Europe. Last year, only nine foreign leaders joined Putin at the parade. Ukraine and most European nations mark May 8 as Victory in Europe Day.

Ukraine has invited senior EU leaders and officials to Kyiv on May 9 to counter Russia's celebration.

The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, on April 15 warned EU leaders against attending Russia's Victory Day celebrations in Moscow.

Speaking at a press conference in Kyiv on May 10, President Volodymyr Zelensky rebuked the idea of a demilitarized zone in the war and emphasized the importance of first securing a ceasefire.



""We agreed that a full and unconditional ceasefire must begin on Monday, May 12, for at least 30 days. We jointly demand this from Russia, and we know we are supported in this by the United States,"" Zelensky said.

The announcement follows mounting fears that the two nuclear-armed countries were on the brink of engaging in another full-scale war.

Ukrainian media outlet ZN.UA reported on May 10 that their law enforcement sources confirmed an ongoing probe by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau into suspected embezzlement, money laundering and bribery.



Iran is preparing to send Russia Fath-360 short-range ballistic missile launchers, Reuters reported on May 9, citing Western security and regional officials familiar with the matter.

""Ukraine and all allies are ready for a complete unconditional ceasefire on land, in the air, and at sea for at least 30 days, starting as early as Monday,"" Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico arrived in Moscow on May 9 to celebrate Victory Day, commemorating the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. 

Slovak and Russian press agencies reported that Fico was accompanied by other politicians from his party, including Erik Kaliniak, Lubos Blaga, Richard Gluck. A deputy from the far-right Slovak National Party, Miroslav Radachovsky, was also a part of the group.

During his visit, Fico is expected to hold bilateral talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, and a government representative of Vietnam.

Fico, who anticipated arriving in Moscow on May 8, was delayed in his arrival, following the Baltic states' decision to bar Slovakia's government plane from flying over their respective country's airspace en route to Moscow.

""Estonia informed us a couple of minutes ago that it will not allow us to fly over its territory,"" Fico wrote on Facebook. ""Of course, we are talking about a deliberate attempt to disrupt my visit to Moscow on the occasion of the official celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.""

The Kremlin uses the annual victory celebrations for propaganda purposes and to showcase its military might, while Russian propaganda leans heavily on the Soviet victory in World War II.

Fico is known for inflammatory statements on Ukraine and the war that often echo Moscow's talking points. He has repeatedly criticized military aid for Ukraine and called for restoring relations with Russia after the war.

Fico's planned visit comes as another jab at the Western efforts to internationally isolate Putin over Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine. Slovakia is a member state of both NATO and the EU.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:kyivindependent.com","‘Almost all Russians poisoned by imperial propaganda,' says journalist Ekaterina Barabash after escaping Russia","https://kyivindependent.com/almost-all-russians-poisoned-by-imperial-propaganda-says-journalist-ekaterina-barabash-after-escaping-russia/","Sat, 10 May 2025 14:35:44 GMT","

In early May, 64-year-old film critic and journalist Ekaterina Barabash made international headlines when it was revealed that she had pulled off a daring escape from house arrest in Russia and sought political asylum in France.

Barabash was put under house arrest in February for posts that she had made criticizing Russia's war against Ukraine. She was accused of spreading “knowingly false” information about the military on her social media.

The Kremlin has intensified its crackdown on dissent in Russia since the start of its full-scale war against Ukraine, not only targeting those who dare to speak out against the war but also fostering a climate of surveillance that hearkens back to the worst periods of the Soviet era, urging Russian citizens to police one another.

For Barabash, the war struck a personal chord — she is the daughter of a renowned Ukrainian academic and her son lives in Ukraine with his family. Unlike many Russians — who either seek to justify the war or retreat into indifference — Barabash felt a moral imperative to speak out

“Most people in Russia aren't willing to look for the truth,” Barabash told the Kyiv Independent from France.

“They've always been taught that Ukraine is just a part of Russia. But this belief is a kind of poison. It's something that every Russian grows up with, often without even realizing it.”

In this exclusive interview, Barabash reflects on the moment she decided to risk her life to flee Russia, how her Ukrainian heritage shaped her perspective on Russian culture over the years, why even “good Russians” who oppose the war don't understand Ukraine, and the bleak future facing anyone with a conscience who chooses to remain in today's Russia.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.The Kyiv Independent: Since the idea for this interview originally came after you escaped house arrest in Russia, I just wanted to start off by asking, how are you doing?

Ekaterina Barabash: I escaped from house arrest in Russia on April 13. I got past the checkpoints and left my home. We had a plan — I was supposed to be free within 24 hours. But things didn't go as expected, and I ended up having to hide for two and a half weeks. Unfortunately, I can't share all the details right now. It's a shame, because some parts are really interesting. Maybe one day I'll write about it — maybe even a small book.

During that time, I hid in many places — in forests, fields, villages, and so on. It was a bit frightening and definitely dangerous. I knew I had to leave quickly, and that sense of urgency never left me.

We had hoped they wouldn't notice my absence for at least a few hours, but they realized I was gone very quickly — within just minutes, maybe half an hour. They started searching for me almost immediately. I don't know all the details of how the search was carried out.

After that, I had to cross the border into a European country. Of course, it was an illegal crossing. From there, things were arranged to help me move forward. A woman from Reporters Without Borders (RSF) came to meet me, and she helped bring me safely to Paris.

The Kyiv Independent: Was there a specific moment when you decided that you would take the risk and escape, or did you know from the moment you were arrested that this was what you had to do?

Ekaterina Barabash: No, I didn't make the decision right away. At first, when they placed me under house arrest, it felt almost like a breath of fresh air. It was so unexpected — usually, in political cases, people accused of such “crimes” are held in jail while they await trial. But the judge said that because I had a very old mother, and I myself am not so young, they decided to place me under house arrest until the court date.

At first, it gave us hope — even my lawyer believed that I might only receive a large fine rather than jail time. But within a few days, after some conversations with certain people, I realized the risk was very high. The chance of being sentenced to prison was real. I believed I could face five, six, even seven years in a Russian prison — and a Russian prison is worse than death.

That was when some people from Europe, who help political prisoners like me, told me clearly: even though I was at home, I needed to plan my escape.

At first, I was in shock. I never imagined I would have to leave — especially not my mother, who is 96 years old. But eventually, I realized it was the best option. I had to choose between two impossible outcomes: prison or fleeing the country. So, of course, I chose to escape.

That's when we began the operation. I had coordinators from Europe who guided me through every step. They told me what to do, what to prepare, and explained our plan in detail.

The Kyiv Independent: What makes your case unique among other Russian opposition figures is that you have very strong ties to Ukraine. Does your Ukrainian heritage influence how you view Russia and Russian culture?

Ekaterina Barabash: Yes, I was born in Ukraine, though I was very young when we left — I was only five months old when my parents moved to Moscow. So my entire life has been connected to Russia. I always felt like I had two motherlands: Ukraine and Russia. I was born in Ukraine, but I was raised and educated in Russia, in Moscow.

My family has always had very strong ties to Ukraine. My father, who passed away five months ago, was a well-known figure there. He was a literary critic and the author of many books written in Ukrainian. He was highly respected in the academic community.

Years earlier, my son also moved to Ukraine for personal reasons. He lives there now with his wife and my grandchildren.

So when the war began, my situation was very different from that of my friends in the Russian opposition. For me, it was not just a political crisis — it was a personal tragedy. My closest relatives were there, being targeted by drones and missiles. And I couldn't stay silent. I couldn't hold back my grief or outrage.

I couldn't keep this anger and pain inside me. I started to speak out, openly accusing the Russian government and military of killing innocent people and invading Ukraine. I wrote things like, ""I hate you — you are murderers.""

My perspective on the war was deeply personal. It wasn't just politics for me — it was about my family, my roots, and the suffering of people I love.

Even intelligent and well-educated Russian people often don't truly understand Ukraine. Almost all Russians have been poisoned by imperial propaganda. They've been raised with it — it's part of their worldview.

They've always been taught that Ukraine is just a part of Russia. That the Ukrainian language is just a slightly different version of Russian. That Ukrainians are our ""younger brothers,"" and we are all one people — Russians. I've heard this over and over, even from good people, even from those who are against the war.

But this belief is a kind of poison. It's something that every Russian grows up with, often without even realizing it.

I knew at least a little about Ukrainian culture and history — something most Russians don't. I've done interviews and written about Ukrainian culture. So yes, my point of view was different from the beginning.

The Kyiv Independent: We know that Russia's war against Ukraine started in 2014, not 2022. In what ways did Russian public opinion about the war in Ukraine change during those eight years?

Ekaterina Barabash: Most people in Russia simply didn't care — and they still don't. Even many anti-Putin individuals, including some of my friends, didn't grasp that the war actually started in 2014. When the invasion happened in 2022, they acted as if it was the beginning of the war. I had to remind them, ""No, the war started eight years ago.""

Later on, many of them started to understand, at least a little, what had been happening. But the truth is, almost no one cared. They saw (the invasion of Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts) as some small conflict in eastern Ukraine, maybe with some Russian soldiers involved, but they didn't recognize it as the coming of something horrific.

They didn't understand the connection between the illegal annexation of Crimea and the war that followed. Yes, Crimea was officially part of Ukraine. But they thought that (Soviet leader Nikita) Khrushchev had “given” Crimea to Ukraine many years ago and that Russia had long claimed it.

Then came the war.

The Kyiv Independent: What would you want to say to people still in Russia?

Ekaterina Barabash: You know, I've recently realized one thing that I didn't understand at first: it's impossible to change their minds. It's like religion — you either believe or you don't. If you want to know the truth, you can seek out information, but most people in Russia aren't willing to look for it.

There's a common response I get when I ask why they don't check alternative sources, like Ukrainian media. There are plenty of (Ukrainian) outlets that offer Russian-language versions of the news, and many people understand English, so they could easily access European media, too. Yet, they only rely on Russian sources.

The answer I often hear is, ""Everyone lies."" They're willing to accept the lies from Russian propaganda, but they won't even consider competing narratives from other sources. ""Everyone lies,"" they say. It's an awful argument — a foolish one, really.

It's unfortunate, really, but what can I say to these people? Honestly, there's nothing more I can say. If you're scared, just stay silent. I understand — everyone has families, property, and they don't want to end up in jail. But if you care, then leave Russia, if you can, if it's possible.

I know it's not easy to leave behind elderly parents. I never intended to leave mine. But my father told me several times, ""Leave, leave, leave. The end will be very, very dramatic."" Still, I couldn't bring myself to go. I had to take care of them.

But if you care, if you can leave, then do it. Russia is not a place to stay. If you have any sense, you'll understand that.

Hey there, Kate Tsurkan here, thanks for reading my latest interview. It's horrific that in Russia you're considered a criminal for calling out the actual criminals who are murdering innocent people, but thankfully we have people in this world like Ekaterina Barabash who are not afraid to call evil what it is. I hope her story inspires you and helps show that if a 64-year-old grandmother can stand up to authoritarianism in this world, then so can you. It you like reading about this sort of thing, please consider supporting The Kyiv Independent.

Six-year-old Lilly Sullivan and her four-year-old brother Jack were reported missing on May 2

The mysterious disappearance of two young children from their mobile home in the rural Nova Scotia hamlet of Lansdowne has captured headlines around the world. It's been more than a week since police and search and rescue teams began scouring the thickly wooded land and waterways, searching for any trace of six-year-old Lilly Sullivan and her four-year-old brother Jack.

The community is in a far-flung corner of Pictou County, with the closest town a 15-minute drive away. A few local cars, logging trucks and the big yellow school bus are usually the only traffic to be seen. A network of backcountry roads that only the locals know criss-cross rivers and dense forest that's swarming with blackflies. There's no cellular service.

Many of the roughly 100 people who live in Lansdowne are related, and have been there for generations. 

Lilly and Jack, along with their mother Malehya Brooks-Murray and baby sister Meadow, moved to the community two years ago, into the childhood home of Daniel Martell, who describes himself as the missing children's stepfather. The children's biological father has no contact with them, according to their family. Mr. Martell's mother also lives on the property, in a dilapidated camper with multiple cats and a dog. It overlooks the fenced-in backyard where Ms. Brooks-Murray and Mr. Martell reported they must've escaped from and wandered off. 

The following is a timeline of the search for the two missing children so far.

Liberal MP Chandra Arya, pictured in March 2019, was removed as the Liberal candidate for Nepean shortly before the election campaign began in March 2025.The Canadian Press

A former MP who was barred from running in the federal election for the Liberal Party because of alleged ties to India has formed a lobby group for Hindu Canadians.

Chandra Arya, who served as a member of Parliament for the Ottawa riding of Nepean for more than nine years, was removed as the Liberal candidate for the district shortly before the election campaign began in March. The Indian-born MP was replaced by Liberal Leader Mark Carney, who won the riding in the April vote.

Mr. Arya announced on social media Thursday that he has set up the Hindu Public Affairs Council of Canada, which bills itself as “unapologetically Hindu” and “resolutely Canadian” but also necessary at this time to defend a community he describes as under attack.

The former MP in particular singled out Khalistan supporters – a separatist movement among some Sikh adherents who advocate for carving an independent homeland out of India – as a concern. The Indian government strongly opposes the Khalistan movement, which has followers in Canada.

“In an era when anti-Hindu and Khalistani forces are emboldened and our community is under siege, Canada HPAC rises with resolve,” Mr. Arya said in a post on Facebook and X. “We will not stay silent. We will not back down.”

Asked in an interview why he's forming an association to represent a specific religion, Mr. Arya said that other faiths have their own lobby groups, including the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs or the National Council of Canadian Muslims.

He noted that not all Hindus in Canada trace their roots back to India – they come from countries all over the world – but for Hindus, he said India remains important. “For us, India is our holy land,” Mr. Arya said.

As The Globe and Mail reported in March, the Liberal Party revoked Mr. Arya‘s bid to run for the party leadership and his nomination in his own Ottawa riding over alleged foreign-interference concerns involving India.

Mr. Arya said he will not seek any remedy over this. “I don't have time for that political drama theatre.” He said of his removal: “They kicked me out because I spoke very publicly, very honestly, very bluntly about Hindu Canadians and against Khalistani extremists.”

He said he believes India-Canada ties, badly damaged after former prime minister Justin Trudeau, could be repaired under the new Prime Minister, Mr. Carney. In 2023, Mr. Trudeau announced Canada had credible intelligence that “agents of the government of India” carried out the fatal shooting of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Sikh leader in British Columbia. India has denied any role in this and a diplomatic row ensued.

“Prime Minister Carney is in a good position to turn the page,” Mr. Arya said. He said differences will persist “but at the same time, the economic relations, the trade relations, the investment relations, and people-to-people relations can be repaired.”

He said good relations with India would benefit “Canadian geopolitical and security interests.”

Balpreet Singh, legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization, said he is concerned about Mr. Arya‘s new group, saying “it appears to be echoing government of India disinformation” about the Sikh community and promoting the “false narrative” that all advocacy for Khalistan is inherently extremist.

“At a time when Sikh advocates for Khalistan are facing violence from Indian authorities, the creation of such an organization is alarming,” he said. 

Mr. Singh noted that Mr. Arya was disqualified not only from the Liberal leadership race but from running again as an MP over allegations of foreign interference.

“Given this context, it is crucial that his activities and those of the Canada HPAC be closely monitored to ensure they are not acting as proxies for the Government of India,” he added. 

Mr. Arya said his group will only be funded by individual donations. “It is not going to be a charitable institution. So it has to be funded by ordinary Hindu Canadians across the country, small amounts of 20 bucks, 40 bucks a month. That is what I'm seeking.”

Asked if he would accept funding from the Indian government or Indian-based donors, he indicated he would not. “Just because I met Prime Minister Modi once, people think I am very well connected in India,” he said. “I am not.”

Responding to Mr. Singh's comments, Mr. Arya said in an e-mail he won't be silenced.

“In Canada, whenever someone publicly raises concerns on behalf of Hindu-Canadians, anti-Hindu and Khalistani groups attempt to silence them by labelling them as ‘Indian agents' or ‘Modi agents' and falsely framing it as foreign interference,” he said. “This is a deliberate tactic to delegitimize and intimidate our voices.”

Mr. Arya said in a separate statement to The Globe that other communities such as Jewish-Canadians, Sikh-Canadians, Pakistani-Canadians, and Ukrainian-Canadians are “commendably well-organized and significantly represented in Parliament, often at levels disproportionately higher than their population share.” Hindu-Canadians, by contrast, he said, lack a similar political presence, institutional infrastructure and public advocacy.

He said that has consequences, including “that federal political parties have, in some instances, pandered to anti-Hindu and Khalistani extremist elements, a deeply troubling trend that demands public scrutiny and institutional counterbalance.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theglobeandmail.com","As the U.S. trade war escalates, LNG Canada is poised to start exports to Asia","https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-lng-canada-exports-asia-us-trade-war-asia/","Sat, 10 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The Canadian energy industry is looking to LNG Canada as a promising sign that the country is capable of shipping its resources to new markets and reducing its U.S. economic dependence

At a sprawling construction site in northern British Columbia, LNG Canada chief executive officer Chris Cooper points out the finishing touches being made at the terminal that will soon be exporting liquefied natural gas.

With extra insulation installed over here and new cladding added over there, the finish line is finally within sight, more than 12 years after the joint venture received its export licence.

The $18-billion export terminal is now more than 98 per cent completed after nearly seven years of construction, and the first LNG shipment from Kitimat, B.C., is slated to set sail to Asia by mid-2025.

“We're actually leading the way on a new industry and we're helping Canada to diversify its export markets – and that's a huge deal,” Mr. Cooper said in his first media interview since becoming CEO on April 1.

With a hard hat and safety glasses on, he is dwarfed by the towering energy equipment and the network of pipes surrounding him at what will be Canada's first LNG export terminal. One of the largest industrial projects ever constructed in Canada has risen on the 400-hectare site, a huge footprint equivalent in size to Vancouver's popular tourist attraction, Stanley Park.

Chris Cooper, a global energy specialist who joined LNG Canada in late 2021 and became CEO in April this year, says the company is helping Canada to diversify its export markets.

From various vantage points across Kitimat, residents can see LNG Canada's flare stacks that have been used to burn off natural gas during the commissioning process.

Within weeks, LNG produced in Kitimat will start being loaded onto Asia-bound ships that will be docked at the wharf at the head of Douglas Channel, an inlet lined with rolling coastal mountains.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly asserted that the United States has plenty of resources, including natural gas, and he claims that the U.S. doesn't need what Canada has to offer.

But Canada, the world's fifth-largest natural gas producer, exported 45 per cent of its gas supplies last year south of the border.

As the trade war escalates, the Canadian energy industry is looking to LNG Canada as a promising sign that the country is capable of shipping its resources to new markets and reducing its economic dependence on the United States.

“We see this kind of Canadian movement of standing together and actually taking control of what we want to do with our natural gas in Canada,” Mr. Cooper said. “That diversification of Canada's gas into Asia is a big advantage for Canada, and the timing is very important.”

During the federal election campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives underscored the importance of the project's possible Phase 2 expansion, which would double the plant's capacity to 28 million tonnes a year.

Prime Minister Mark Carney is striving to carry out his campaign pledge to make Canada an energy superpower globally, aiming to boost conventional energy production while also spurring the transition to renewables.

LNG Canada could help him fulfill part of the pledge on the conventional side. Shell PLC SHEL-N and the four co-owners of LNG Canada are considering whether to approve Phase 2.

London-based Shell owns 40 per cent of LNG Canada. Malaysia's state-owned Petronas acquired its 25-per-cent stake in 2018. The other participants in the venture are PetroChina and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp. (each with a 15-per-cent stake) and South Korea's Kogas (5 per cent).

The decision on whether to expand is expected next year, and if there is a green light from the co-owners, the Kitimat plant at full tilt would rank among the world's largest facilities for LNG export capacity.

Canada remains far behind the United States in constructing and opening LNG export terminals. The first LNG export facility in the lower 48 states began operating in 2016 and another seven U.S. sites have opened since then.

Mr. Trump has been touting Alaska LNG as a promising proposal to reach Asian markets.

The United States, Australia and Qatar were by far the world's largest LNG exporters last year. Russia ranked fourth, followed by Malaysia.

A report last year by Clean Energy Canada, a think tank at Simon Fraser University, said the focus on fossil fuels such as LNG ends up delaying the global transition to renewables such as wind and solar.

However, global energy demand is forecast to surge over the next 25 years from increases in population, including in developing countries.

“That energy addition drives the need for, in general, more energy from all sources,” said Teresa Waddington, LNG Canada's vice-president of corporate relations. “Our chance with Phase 2 to truly put Canada squarely on the map in terms of an LNG exporting nation with significant capacity is really exciting.”

An era of major projects in British Columbia is winding down as LNG Canada's first phase nears completion, and attention is turning to what the future might hold.

Other large projects that have wrapped up in the past couple of years in B.C. include the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion and Coastal GasLink. Calgary-based TC Energy Corp. TRP-T owns 35 per cent of Coastal GasLink and is the operator of the 670-kilometre pipeline for natural gas that stretches from northeast B.C. to Kitimat.

The Site C hydroelectric dam in northeast B.C. is scheduled to be fully in service later this year.

The energy spotlight is shifting to prospects such as Ksi Lisims LNG, a proposal backed by the Nisga'a Nation. Floating production facilities are scheduled to be opened by Ksi Lisims on Pearse Island on B.C.'s North Coast in 2029, with other vessels exporting LNG to Asia.

But Ksi Lisims must first undergo an environmental review.

Earlier this year, the B.C. government loosened its net-zero rules for Ksi Lisims and other proposals to export LNG from the province, given uncertainty over how long it will take for new hydroelectricity supplies to be added to the grid.

Other energy proposals in B.C. include FortisBC's expansion plans at its domestic Tilbury LNG site in Delta and Summit Lake PG LNG near Prince George.

The B.C. government's budget tabled in March highlighted how the provincial economy already has become more reliant on natural gas than the traditional dependence on the forestry sector, which has been slumping.

Mr. Cooper, a global energy specialist who rose through the ranks at Shell, joined LNG Canada in late 2021. He took over last month as the project's CEO, replacing Jason Klein, who returned to his home state of Texas after three years at the helm of LNG Canada.

“We're proud to be a catalyst for a thriving new energy business,” Mr. Cooper said. “Our gas goes to Asia to benefit them, but there are a lot of benefits in B.C. as well.”

The much-anticipated rise of LNG in B.C. has been a long time coming.

Pacific NorthWest LNG, led by Petronas, cancelled its project near Prince Rupert, B.C., in 2017 after struggling to navigate various environmental issues.

The co-owners of LNG Canada, including Petronas, made the final investment decision in the fall of 2018 to forge ahead with construction of the export terminal in Kitimat. It marked a breakthrough for the country's energy sector after years of failed or stalled proposals.

Back in 2013, there were more than 20 LNG proposals in British Columbia.

Today, only LNG Canada and two smaller B.C. projects – Woodfibre LNG near Squamish and Cedar LNG in Kitimat – are under construction.

Woodfibre plans to start exporting to Asia by late 2027 while Cedar is aiming to begin shipping to Asia by late 2028.

“Less dependence on the U.S. is a good thing, for sure,” said Ron Burnett, president of the Kitimat Economic Development Association.

There is a diversity of viewpoints among Indigenous groups over the fledgling LNG industry in B.C.

The Coastal GasLink pipeline across northern B.C. will supply natural gas to LNG Canada and Cedar, which are situated in Kitimat on the traditional territory of the Haisla Nation.

TC Energy CEO touts Asia as key to Canada's economic diversification away from U.S.

Crystal Smith, the Haisla's elected chief councillor who is also chair of the First Nations Natural Gas Alliance, said Haisla leaders opposed the now-defunct Northern Gateway oil pipeline proposal from Alberta to Kitimat, but they support LNG as a fuel that will be safe to transport.

“The community support had a lot to do with, definitely, the commodity that was being proposed for our territory, when it came to the impacts of LNG being exported through our waters,” said Ms. Smith, who will be seeking re-election in July.

The Haisla own 50.1 per cent of Cedar, while Calgary-based Pembina Pipeline Corp. holds 49.9 per cent.

Cedar will use electricity from BC Hydro for powering electric motors that drive compressors for liquefaction on a floating production vessel. Cedar will rely on upgrades to an existing transmission line for hydroelectricity.

The construction of LNG Canada has led to much-needed revenue for the Haisla through benefits agreements, and sparked economic development in the Kitimat area, notably on the Haisla's main reserve of Kitamaat Village.

The construction of LNG Canada has led to much-needed revenue for the Haisla Nation and has sparked local economic development, notably in Kitamaat Village, where an affordable-housing complex is among the new buildings.

New buildings in Kitamaat Village include a youth centre, a health facility and an affordable-housing complex with 23 units.

The First Nations Natural Gas Alliance, an Indigenous group that formed in 2015, believes that resource development will be crucial for economic reconciliation.

The alliance supports tapping into abundant reserves of natural gas in northeast B.C. and transporting the commodity to the West Coast, viewing LNG as a crucial part of creating prosperity in Indigenous communities.

First Nations that have endorsed LNG Canada include the Haisla, Kitselas, Kitsumkalum, Gitxaala and Gitga'at.

But a group of Wet'suwet'en Nation hereditary chiefs has led a campaign opposing the contentious Coastal GasLink project, the first export pipeline for natural gas across northern B.C.

A second pipeline, needed to supply Ksi Lisims, is called the Prince Rupert Gas Transmission (PRGT) project, which is co-owned by the Nisga'a and Western LNG.

B.C. Environment Minister Tamara Davidson is expected to rule on the fate of PRGT this spring after she reviews arguments, including from climate activists opposed to it.

The Skeena Watershed Conservation Coalition and allies, including the Gitanyow Nation and several Gitxsan Nation leaders in the region, have warned about the climate impacts of PRGT and Ksi Lisims. That includes greenhouse gas emissions stemming from methane leaks in the production of natural gas through fracking in northeast B.C.

Building LNG Canada's export terminal has been a test of stamina.

At the peak of construction last year, the project required more than 9,000 workers on rotation in Kitimat, including room for 4,500 people at any given time at the on-site accommodation centre called Cedar Valley Lodge.

There were still about 7,500 workers recently helping to finish the remaining bits and pieces of equipment. The District of Kitimat itself has nearly 9,000 year-round residents.

A vessel, the Maran Gas Roxana, spent four weeks at the Kitimat site this spring, unloading imported LNG as part of the equipment-testing and cool-down process at the terminal.

The first phase of LNG Canada will rely on natural gas-fired turbines. High-efficiency turbines using Baker Hughes “aeroderivative” technology will help supercool natural gas into liquid form.

LNG Canada, which has a 40-year export licence, will employ up to 350 workers during operations.

The project‘s first phase will have two “trains,” or separate LNG cooling processes. Each train is designed to handle seven million tonnes a year of LNG exports to Asia.

The new terminal is aiming to perform better than the B.C. government's standard for “emissions intensity,” targeting 0.15 carbon dioxide equivalent tonnes for each tonne of LNG produced – below the government's limit of 0.16.

JGC Fluor BC LNG JV, a joint venture between JGC Corp. and Fluor Corp., is the project's engineering, procurement and construction contractor.

Large modules originated from the Qingdao fabrication yard in China for installation in Kitimat, while smaller units came from the Zhuhai facility, also located in China.

The total cost of building the first phase has been pegged at $48.3-billion, including the $18-billion Kitimat terminal, the $14.5-billion Coastal GasLink pipeline and other infrastructure, as well as annual budgets for drilling in the prolific North Montney region of northeastern B.C.

Increased supplies of hydroelectricity would be required if Phase 2 is to eventually switch to electric motors for driving the compressors needed to liquefy natural gas.

But the proposed North Coast transmission project by BC Hydro for twinning the B.C. line between Prince George and Terrace could take a decade to complete.

In the meantime, LNG Canada is fully permitted to use natural gas-fired turbines for liquefaction for both Phase 1 and Phase 2.

For Kitimat, LNG Canada represents new beginnings.

The new export terminal is on the former site of a methanol plant that was closed in 2006 by Methanex Corp.

The marine terminal for LNG vessels used to be a wharf that formerly belonged to the Eurocan pulp and paper mill that West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. shut down in 2010.

“We've had some hard times. When Eurocan and Methanex closed within a few years of each other, that was a tough time,” Kitimat Mayor Phil Germuth said.

He spoke in a meeting room at the District of Kitimat's municipal offices located on the third floor of City Centre Mall, which sits between neighbourhoods of suburban houses.

Along the waters of Douglas Channel, LNG Canada's industrial neighbour is Rio Tinto PLC's RIO-N aluminum smelter. Rio Tinto employs more than 1,100 workers in the Kitimat region.

Kitimat was carved out of the wilderness in the early 1950s by Rio Tinto's predecessor, Alcan, when it built an aluminum smelter and a hydroelectric dam to power it.

While U.S. tariffs on Canadian aluminum have sparked much uncertainty and anxiety, Rio Tinto insists that it will maintain a calm approach to its business strategy.

“We can control what's in our sphere of control, which is safe operations,” said Simon Pascoe, general manager at Rio Tinto's Kitimat smelter.

With the nascent LNG industry in Canada, the hope is that Asian fuel buyers will be enticed by the shorter shipping route from B.C., compared with the U.S. Gulf Coast.

It takes roughly 10 days for a ship to sail from Kitimat to North Asia, versus 20 days from U.S. Gulf Coast, via the Panama Canal.

LNG exports from B.C. to Asia would indirectly help Europe because that frees up LNG supplies elsewhere in the world to be rerouted to Europe.

Bryce Mathew Watts, executive director of the Kitimat Museum and Archives, said residents know the economic stakes are high with Rio Tinto's local smelter, LNG Canada's expansion potential and Cedar's construction.

“Everyone understands what puts food on our tables,” Mr. Watts said. “There have been good years and bad years, so with new resources coming through, it diversifies and gives us more life as a community.”

The museum already has displays to show Kitimat's roots in the aluminum industry. The next chapter in local history to be documented will be LNG, now part of a broader tale of Canada's quest to wean itself off economic reliance on the United States.

Hours after the announcement of a ceasefire agreement, explosions were heard in Srinagar. Both India and Pakistan had earlier confirmed the truce. DW has more. 

Welcome to DW's live coverage of developments from India and Pakistan on Saturday, May 10:

Blasts were heard across the city of Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir on Saturday, just hours after India and Pakistan agreed on a ceasefire, according to Omar Abdullah, chief minister of the territory Jammu and Kashmir. 

""What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!"" he said on X.

In another post, he wrote: ""This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up.""

The Reuters news agency also reported that blasts were heard in Jammu City and projectiles were seen in the sky. The French AFP news agency reported an anonymous Indian source saying Pakistan had violated the ceasefire agreement.  

The ceasefire agreed by India and Pakistan has been welcomed by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy.

""Today's ceasefire between India and Pakistan is hugely welcome. I urge both parties to sustain this. De-escalation is in everybody's interest,"" he posted on X.

Tensions escalated earlier this week after India launched missile strikes, targeting what it said were terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Kashmir has been contested between Pakistan and India since 1947 and the two nuclear-armed neighbors each administer part of the region but claim ownership of all the territory.

Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said his country and Pakistan had reached an understanding and that New Delhi would maintain a firm line against terrorism.

""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action,"" he said in a message on the social media platform X.

""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,"" he wrote.

India has claimed that Pakistan is supporting terrorism from across the border after a deadly attack on civilians in the Kashmir region on April 22 that killed 26 people.

Pakistan has denied any involvement and called for an independent investigation. 

India and Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire bilaterally, sources in India told DW. 

""The stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries,"" the source said, adding that there was no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.

Earlier on Saturday, US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agreement came after 48 hours of talks, with Washington's involvement.

Pakistan has fully reopened its airspace for all types of flights, the country's airports authority has said.

""All airports across the country are now available for regular flight operations,"" a statement read.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had chosen a ""path of peace"" as the two countries agreed to a ceasefire.

""Over the past 48 hours, Vice President Vance and I have engaged with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, and National Security Advisors Ajit Doval and Asim Malik. I am pleased to announce the Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,"" Rubio posted on X.

The Indian Foreign Ministry has said Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations had called the Director General of Military Operations of India on Saturday afternoon, and it had been agreed that all sides would stop firing. 

""It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all fighting and military action on land and in the air and sea with effect of 17:00 hours Indian Standard Time today (1230 UTC/GMT),"" Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said. ""Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.""

Military officials would speak again on May 12, Misri added.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry has confirmed the ceasefire previously announced by US President Donald Trump.

""Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,"" Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister & Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on X.

""Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!""

US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that both India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire, though neither country has confirmed the arrangement.

""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" Trump posted on social media.

Viral social media posts claim to show India's attacks on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. But some videos are used out of context and are seemingly aimed at stoking tensions even further.

DW's fact-checking team had a look at some of the viral videos doing the rounds in the context of the escalation between India and Pakistan.

Read DW's full report here.

Amid heightened military tensions and ongoing cross-border shelling and drone activities between India and Pakistan escalating, the Indian government has ordered the blocking of 8,000 accounts on X and the removal of Pakistan-linked content across digital platforms. Some Indian news portals like Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat, and The Wire have also been impacted.

DW has more on that here.

 

When former British India gained independence and was divided into India and Pakistan in 1947, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to choose which new country to join, or to remain independent.

The Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, a Hindu ruler of a Muslim-majority state, initially wanted independence but ultimately chose to accede to India after a Pakistani-backed tribal invasion.

A war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended that they hold a referendum on whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, neither country could agree on a deal to demilitarize the region ahead of such a vote.

In July 1949, as recommended by the UN, India and Pakistan agreed on a ceasefire line which eventually became the so-called Line of Control (LoC). following an agreement signed in 1972.

The region became divided into India-administered Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir plus Gilgit-Baltistan. Adding to the complexity, China also controls a portion (Aksai Chin).

Both India and Pakistan still claim full sovereignty over the region.

There have been sporadic conflicts between the two sides over the contested region since then, interspersed with periods of de-escalation.

But the election of the Hindu-nationalist BJP to power in India in 2014 marked a new period of tension. The BJP government responded to a major attack in 2019 by launching cross-border air strikes. Later that year, it revoked Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy, sparking increased protest within the region that was met with repression.

This was followed by a period of relative calm in which Delhi promoted a nascent tourist sector in the region that began to boom until the attack against tourists near the hotspot of Pahalgam on April 22, 2025.

The Information Minister for Pakistan-administered Kashmir said that 11 civilians were killed in overnight shelling by India near the so-called Line of Control (LoC) — the de facto border that separates the two countries in Kashmir.

""Last night, intense shelling from the Indian side took place at more than five different locations along the Line of Control. As a result, 11 people, including a child and four women, lost their lives, and 56 others were injured,"" Information Minister Mazhar Saeed Shah told the AFP news agency.

The reported figures cannot be independently verified.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that ""the ball is India's court"" when it came to de-escalating current hostilities.

Dar, who also serves as Pakistan's deputy prime minister, spoke to broadcaster Geo News after a call with Rubio.

""War is not our priority and we genuinely want peace but without hegemony of any country,"" Dar was quoted as saying by German press agency dpa.

Dar was also reported to have said he was hopeful that talks with India can begin and when asked about contact between the neighbors and said ""messages have been exchanged on both sides.""

A senior Indian military officer has been quoted as saying that India would be committed to ""non-escalation, provided the Pakistan side reciprocates.""

The Associated Press quoted Indian Wing Commander Vyomika Singh with that information but said that Pakistani forces had been observed mobilizing in forward areas ""indicating an offensive intent to further escalation.""

""Indian armed forces remain in a high state of operational readiness,"" Singh was quoted as saying.

Singh also said that Indian forces had carried out ""precision strikes only at identified military targets in response to Pakistani actions.""

""All hostile actions have been effectively countered and responded proportionately,"" she said.

The Reuters news agency meanwhile reported that Pakistan's foreign minister had told local TV that if India were to stop here then ""we will consider to stop here.""

The comments come after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on the countries to ""re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation.""","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","world"

Amid heightened tensions over the Kashmir region, India has ordered the blocking of thousands of accounts on social media and restrictions on news portals, sparking concerns over free speech.

With military tensions high and amid ongoing cross-border shelling and drone activities between India and Pakistan, the Indian government has ordered the blocking of 8,000 accounts on X and the removal of Pakistan-linked content across digital platforms.

Press freedom activists have condemned the move.

The Pakistani army responded with drone and artillery attacks after the Indian army claimed to have attacked nine locations in Pakistan and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir on Wednesday, killing what they said were numerous militants.

The Indian government also ordered the social media platform X to block over 8,000 accounts, including those of prominent Pakistani journalists like Hamid Mir and Najam Sethi, news organizations and even some Indian news portals like Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat and The Wire.

On Thursday, the country's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting also issued an advisory directing online streaming platforms to immediately remove all Pakistani-origin content, including web series, films, songs and podcasts, citing national security.

The Elon Musk-owned X has said it received executive orders from the Indian government requiring the company to block more than 8,000 accounts in India.

""To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government's demands,"" the company said in a post on its Global Government Affairs handle.

""In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws,"" the company statement continued. ""For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.""

X also pointed out that falling foul of the executive orders could subject the company to potential penalties, including significant fines and imprisonment of its local employees.

Free speech advocates see the move by the Indian government as censorship, especially at a time when both sides have been engaged in competing narratives that have historically obscured the truth in India-Pakistan conflicts.

""At this crucial period, India should refrain from illegally and arbitrarily blocking social media accounts and websites of journalists, news publications and citizens, nor take any other steps that can restrict the flow of information,"" Prateek Waghre, an independent technology policy researcher, told DW.

""Such restrictions create a fertile ground for confusion and false narratives to take root, as they also limit access to reliable information and reportage,"" added Waghre.

Pratik Sinha, founder of fact-checking website Alt News, dedicated to combating misinformation and disinformation, criticized the government for clamping down on the media and independent voices in the name of national security.

""Authorities have never liked any form of independent media as it construes it as speaking against the government or country. This is censorship,"" Sinha told DW.

The annual South Asia Press Freedom Report, entitled ""Frontline Democracy: Media Amid Political Churn,"" released early this month, presents a stark assessment of press freedom in India, highlighting persistent and deepening challenges for journalists and media organizations.

Despite India's slight rise in the World Press Freedom Index, moving up to 151 out of 180 countries in 2025, the report underscores that core issues threatening press freedom remain unresolved.

""Every authoritarian effort is being made to crush those who seek to hold power to account — crackdowns on media houses, surveillance, intimidation and harassment of journalists, filing of police cases; arbitrary detentions; and the unleashing of raids by the Income Tax Department, and the Enforcement Directorate that oversees financial crimes,"" the report stated.

Another report, by the Free Speech Collective, highlights how the first four months of 2025 have not boded well for freedom of speech and expression in India.

""Censorship was rife, through direct and indirect attacks on free speech and press freedom,"" the report said.

""Any content-specific takedowns must proceed under clear legal grounds, publish the legal rationale so they can withstand constitutional scrutiny and establish an independent oversight mechanism for future national-security content actions,"" Apar Gupta, of the Internet Freedom Foundation, told DW.

The website of The Wire, a news organization known for its investigative journalism and its outspokenness, became inaccessible across much of the country on Friday.

The platform said the move was based on orders from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, under the IT Act of 2000 and said it would take legal steps to challenge it.

The Wire's ombudsperson Pamela Philipose told DW that at a time when hostilities at the borders are raging and citizens across the country are anxious to get authentic, misinformation-free news, this move to block it is extremely disturbing.

""The news portal always took to provide the public with a truthful account of all developments in a manner that was both readable and credible,"" said Philipose. ""We can only hope that this is only a passing blip and it will soon be back to doing what it does best — bringing authentic news and information to the Indian and international public.""

A government spokesperson refused to comment on the actions, but the motivations appear to blend genuine security concerns with a desire to control narratives.

But free-speech activists and media commentators believe the space for hard-hitting journalism, dissent and debate has rapidly shrunk in India's mainstream media.

Amrita Johri, a right-to-information activist who has worked on the issue closely, said the Digital Personal Data Protection Act of 2023, due to be put into effect soon, will undermine press freedom, investigative journalism and the public's right to information.

Activists have said the new measure also amends the Right to Information Act and provides a blanket exemption on the disclosure of personal information which will severely weaken people's ability to seek crucial information and demand accountability from the government.

""It will have a chilling impact on all those who collect, process and disseminate personal information including journalists, media, civil society and even political parties,"" Johri told DW.

""While curbs on fake news and misinformation are needed, regulations must be within the constitutional framework and subject to oversight by an independent mechanism,"" she added.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:truthout.org","Israel Always Wanted to Exterminate Gaza. Now, It's Seizing the Opportunity.","https://truthout.org/articles/israel-always-wanted-to-exterminate-gaza-now-its-seizing-the-opportunity/","Sat, 10 May 2025 17:30:29 GMT","

With international backing, Israel is now openly planning for permanent occupation of Gaza and forced mass expulsion.

With international backing, Israel is now openly planning for permanent occupation of Gaza and forced mass expulsion.

It has been a year since Israel first invaded Rafah and crossed Biden's illusory “red line.” The Israeli army destroyed the Rafah crossing, isolating Gaza from Egypt and completely cutting it off from the outside world. Israel was free to conduct the mass displacement of Palestinians away from the Egyptian border, but it never admitted to that goal. 

But now, Rafah is no more, and Israel's recently approved plan to reoccupy Gaza indefinitely has made explicit what many have already expected for months: that the ulterior motive of creating permanent military installations and buffer zones in Gaza is to facilitate the mass expulsion of Palestinians. 

Israel is now openly announcing its intentions and publicly advertising ethnic cleansing as “voluntary migration.” This didn't happen overnight, but has been the result of a slow, deliberate process of hemming Palestinians into concentrated sub-ghettoes under fire while creating vast military buffer zones on swathes of flattened Gazan territory. The plan has been implemented in piecemeal over the past 18 months, but now those pieces are falling clearly into place.

Just last week, Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Israel's main war aim of “defeating its enemies” superseded the goal of releasing Israeli captives in Gaza, echoing previous statements from his Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, the so-called hardliner.

This isn't a new development. It has been Israel's plan all along, but the Israeli government has had to stagger its implementation over the course of a year and a half due to a series of internal and external constraints. Yet it continued to set the stage for ethnic cleansing every step of the way. 

The watershed moment came in February during the short-lived ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, when U.S. President Trump articulated his shocking plan for the U.S. to “own” Gaza and turn it into a “Riviera of the Middle East,” while the people of Gaza would be relocated elsewhere. Suddenly, the President of the United States was endorsing a plan that Israel had never dared voice in public. Even a month earlier, Netanyahu had said in a televised statement that “Israel has no intention of permanently reoccupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.”

This is the exact plan that the Israeli war cabinet has just approved.

Since Trump made his February statement, which he later walked back, Israel has been emboldened to go full steam ahead with its plan. The resumption of the war and the blowing up of the ceasefire are partly informed by this newfound determination to see through Israel's “final solution” for the Gaza question. The reason it is able to do it is because the international community has barely lifted a finger to stop it.

But Trump's February announcement was not where Israel's strategy to take over the strip and displace its people originated. Well before Israel was forced by Trump to enter into the ceasefire with Hamas, the army had thrown all its force behind a military plan proposed by a cohort of Israeli generals based on an earlier vision laid out by retired Israeli general Giora Eiland. Dubbed “the Generals' Plan,” its aim was to completely depopulate northern Gaza through siege and starvation. The implementation of the plan included completely sealing off the 400,000 Palestinians residing in the area and leaving them without food, water, or medicine; a non-stop wave of demolitions and detonations of residential buildings and houses; widespread carpet-bombing; and the direct, forcible evacuation of schools-turned-shelters and hospitals in the north.

By the time the ceasefire was reached on January 19, the population of north Gaza had been reduced to less than 100,000. The last functioning hospital in the area, Kamal Adwan Hospital, was also forcibly evacuated following an 80-day siege and several direct attacks by Israeli drones. Israeli forces also abducted several members of the medical staff, including the hospital's director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, who continues to be detained by Israeli forces to this day. 

The Generals' Plan failed after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians returned to the north in a historic return march during the ceasefire, setting up camp beside the rubble of their homes and sending a clear message that their displacement had been anything but “voluntary.” 

Israel's plans for realizing its solution to the “Gaza problem” had been frustrated, and it was dragged into the ceasefire kicking and screaming. Israel continued to stall at every stage of the ceasefire, sabotaging it at every opportunity and refusing to enter into negotiations that would see a permanent end to the war. It continued to bide its time, waiting for an opening. Trump gave Israel the opening it needed in February, and Netanyahu's war cabinet has been barreling through all internal obstacles within the Israeli political system ever since. 

In March, the Israeli Defense Ministry approved the creation of a special bureau to promote the expulsion of Palestinians. At the time, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was still in effect, albeit tenuously, as Israel refused to move to the second phase of the ceasefire talks, which would have involved negotiations over permanently ending the war. Five days after the ceasefire broke, U.S. National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was still saying that the idea of transferring Palestinians was “practical” and “realizable.”

Then, in early April, Israel revealed the carving out of a new militarized strip of land south of Khan Younis called the Morag Corridor, cutting off the southernmost Rafah governorate from the rest of Gaza. Everything south of Morag, including all of Rafah, was announced as part of a military buffer zone, reducing the surface of the Palestinian enclave by a fifth. This was made possible by Israel's intensified bombing and demolition campaign of Rafah since the Israeli army invaded the governorate in May 2024, leveling all of the city's infrastructure.

Israel's Channel 12 reported that the aim of the Morag Corridor was to facilitate the “voluntary migration” of Palestinians, while Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, announced in a televised statement that the Israeli army was “cutting off” the continuity of the Gaza Strip and implementing the voluntary migration plan. Katz reiterated this plan weeks later, stating that Israel's strategy in Gaza included destroying infrastructure, blocking the entry of humanitarian aid, and “promoting voluntary transfer.”

Since the beginning of Israel's genocide in Gaza, Israel has revealed parts of its final plan in stages. At the start of the genocide, then Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel was imposing a “total siege” on Gaza, preventing the entry of food, water, electricity, or fuel, and labeling Palestinians as “human animals.” The genocidal implications of the war's endgame were apparent, but the unfolding of Israel's plan in Gaza continued to be concealed politically by endless rhetoric about ceasefire talks, and even the release of Israeli captives. The Israeli government now makes no pretenses of the captives' importance, after officially moving them to the bottom of the priority list of the war's goals.

Every step of the way, Israel has met no practical consequences for its escalation, and no government with any leverage over Israel has moved to impose any political repercussions. Even the generalized official rejection by European and Arab governments of Trump's Gaza plan wasn't followed by any action. And of course, Israel's refusal to move on to the second phase of the ceasefire and its constant violations of the truce were met with silence. That silence continues to be deafening as Israel carves the Morag Corridor, erases Rafah, and is now moving to do the same thing to other parts of Gaza.

Total impunity accompanied every one of Israel's milestones in the march toward exterminating Gaza, from the hundreds of bombings of schools, hospitals, aid workers, paramedics, and journalists, to the deliberate starvation of Gaza's population. Now, the permanency of Israel's occupation of Gaza is official, and so is the stated aim of ethnically cleansing its people. And we still have no reaction.

The fact that the silence persists as Israel's end goals have been made clear confirms that the extermination of Gaza was never the vision of the Israeli far-right, or even of Netanyahu personally; it was an international decision. 

This must be the new realization that underlies any account of the destruction of Palestinian life, including the impending Israeli annexation of the West Bank and the full colonization of East Jerusalem, the Naqab, and any other part of historic Palestine where the Palestinian people still struggle to preserve their collective existence.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

Michigan's attorney general is posing as an anti-Trump champion. So why is she helping Trump's FBI to target protesters?

Democratic anti-Trump warriors are popular with the party base — and they know it. On Wednesday, May 7, Michigan's Democratic Attorney General Dana Nessel put out a strongly worded press release decrying the latest “appalling Supreme Court decision” in favor of President Donald Trump's ban on trans people in the military. The previous day, Nessel's office had announced it would join another in a string of lawsuits against the Republican administration over its abuse of presidential powers to override states and dismantle federal regulations.

This continues a steady drumbeat of opposition to Trump and the Republican administration that Nessel and other Democrats have been promoting — except when it comes to Palestine.

On Palestine, the Michigan attorney general has sung quite a different tune. Since 2024, Nessel's office has been involved in deploying increasingly repressive tactics against pro-Palestine activists in Michigan, most recently supporting and collaborating with Trump's FBI to raid several homes of pro-Palestinian protestors in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and Canton on April 23. Nessel joins Democrats across the country like New York City Mayor Eric Adams and former President Joe Biden in staking out a position on this form of dissent that is dangerously similar to Trump's.

The self-professed resistance to Trump from Democrats is meaningless when they're capitulating on Palestine and collaborating with police and federal law enforcement to shut down protests and frighten dissenters. This behavior, which predated the Trump administration, now places them squarely in Trump's corner, makes them active collaborators in rising authoritarianism, and undermines trust with core constituencies who are the most likely to be criminalized and targeted by Trump: immigrants, Arab Americans, Muslims, Black people, and queer and trans people.

While Nessel's office claimed the April raids involving multiple law enforcement agencies were unrelated to previous anti-genocide protests on the University of Michigan campus, the stated reason for the raids did not add up, either. The Attorney General's Office said it was investigating acts of vandalism, but then confiscated electronics, interrogated activists and arrested no one. Nessel estimated $100,000 in damage from this supposed vandalism at unnamed locations — implying that her office has tallied the cost of all the pro-Palestine spray paint spread across Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and metro Detroit over the last year, and is using this tally to make a case for invading the homes of several grassroots anti-genocide activists. Tracking down taggers appears to be more of a pretense than an actual practice.

“Vandalism is a petty misdemeanor. Even if it is vandalism, why is the AG involved? Why is she not more concerned with a lot of the other issues that are unfolding in our country and in our state?” said a campus organizer who spoke to Truthout on condition of anonymity.

Nessel had already made her position known in September 2024 when she filed charges against encampment demonstrators at University of Michigan after being urged to do so by members of the university's powerful Board of Regents. As The Guardian reported, her office took the very unusual step of bypassing local law enforcement who had either declined to bring charges against Gaza protesters or dropped charges after the fact. The Guardian's investigation found extensive financial and personal ties between Nessel and several of the most pro-Israel regents on the University of Michigan board.

In yet another twist, on May 5, Nessel's office dropped charges against 7 out of 11 demonstrators whom her office had charged over the May 2024 encampment at the university. That came just two days after a small plane flew in circles over the University of Michigan's massive graduation ceremony, pulling a banner that said “No Universities Left in Gaza. Nessel Drop the Charges.” Nessel's press release Monday claimed the charges were dismissed because of “distractions and ongoing delays” creating a “circus-like atmosphere.” Put another way: These political arrests backfired.

“All of us want to get to the bottom of how these charges happened in the first place,” said Drin MacKeen-Shapiro, one of the demonstrators whose charges were dropped. “The AG's conduct in this has been thoroughly unethical, corrupt and solely designed to crush pro-Palestine speech in the state, specifically on the order of the University of Michigan regents.”

MacKeen-Shapiro, a 22-year-old who graduated from the University of Michigan last weekend, was put back in jail for four days in April on an alleged bond violation after a private security firm followed him between classes and “caught” him going outside of the strict limits he's been given for being present on campus during his last days as a student. He was relieved that his charges were dropped, but unhappy to see Nessel continuing to target other protestors.

“The FBI raids demonstrate the total cooperation between Dana Nessel's office and the Trump administration, who are united on this issue of crushing the anti-genocide movement across the country,” he told me. “Once again we see that Dems and Republicans are two sides of the same coin on this issue, particularly Trump and Dana Nessel.”

Another demonstrator whose felony charges were dropped, Sammie Lewis, says they are still worried about what's next in this environment of escalating repression. They followed how dozens of #StopCopCity activists in Atlanta have been rounded up and charged under RICO (federal racketeering) laws, in that case by Republican State Attorney General Chris Carr.

“I'm thinking a lot about Atlanta and Stop Cop City and the ways that protesters have been grouped together by weird associations, and the case is not strong, but they charged a lot of people,” Lewis said. “I feel like I can't let my guard down and enjoy this victory. It's a battle won, but the war is still going. And of course, we're still fighting for Palestinian liberation.”

Nessel, whose office did not respond to a request for comment from Truthout, provides an extreme example, but there is nothing unusual about her stance. Many Democrats are vocally opposed to authoritarian tactics unless the issue is Palestine. For example, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who pushed for Los Angeles to become a “sanctuary city,” has simultaneously been vocal in her support for hyperpolicing of Gaza protests in the city, even as the LAPD and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department have escalated their violence against demonstrators.

This inconsistency reflects the larger hypocrisy of the many Democrats who are “progressive except for Palestine”: Even Cory Booker, recently championed for his 25-hour anti-Trump speech on the Senate floor, couldn't bring himself to vote to stop billions in funding to the Israeli military in April.

Allowing and encouraging authoritarian repression around Palestine is not only a slippery slope but also an unpopular stance that protects power and position rather than the will of the people; polling in 2024 and early 2025 consistently showed a majority of voters and a supermajority of Democrats support a ceasefire and an arms embargo on Israel if that ceasefire was violated. To look back at the past for only a moment, the moral and political failure to stand with Gaza may have lost Democrats the national election. But looking forward, we can only hope Democrats will find a moral and political center that is not “oppose repression except on Palestine” or “support free speech except for Palestine.” This is weakness and hypocrisy when we need fearless leadership and solidarity.

The current Republican administration is dead set on using local police, the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to silence dissent, an intention they are making zero effort to hide. By approving these tactics when it comes to pro-Palestine protesters, Democrats have helped create the wedge that Republicans will now use to divide us all, cleaving off the most vulnerable and allowing them to be disappeared and deported even as politicians issue press releases “decrying” the administration. Attorney General Nessel and her supporters would do well to reverse course, drop all remaining charges against protesters and withdraw from all collaborations with Trump's machine of criminalization.

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

The Tufts student was snatched on a Boston street in March and imprisoned for 45 days for writing a pro-Palestine op-ed.

Rümeysa Öztürk, one of several pro-Palestine scholars kidnapped and imprisoned by the Trump administration under its dubious interpretation of an 18th-century law and a Cold War-era national security measure, was released from Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody Friday following a federal judge's order.

U.S. District Judge William Sessions III in Vermont ruled that Öztürk — a 30-year-old Turkish Ph.D. student at Tufts University in Massachusetts and Fulbright scholar — was illegally detained in March, when masked plainclothes federal agents snatched her off a suburban Boston street in broad daylight in what eyewitnesses and advocates likened to a kidnapping and flew her to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Louisiana.

“Thank you so much for all the support and love,” Öztürk told supporters outside the facility following her release.

The government admits that Öztürk committed no crime. She was targeted because of an opinion piece published in Tufts Daily advocating divestment from Israel amid the U.S.-backed nation's genocidal assault on Gaza and its apartheid, occupation, ethnic cleansing, and colonization in the rest of Palestine. Öztürk was arrested despite a U.S. State Department determination that there were no grounds for revoking her visa.

“There has been no evidence that has been introduced by the government other than the op-ed,” said Sessions, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton. “That literally is the case.”

BREAKING: a federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to immediately release on bail Rumeysa Ozturk, a Muslim grad student at Tufts University who was abducted and abused by ICE agents, all because she wrote an editorial, yes, an editorial, critical of the Israeli government's genocide.

“There is no evidence here as to the motivation, absent consideration of the op-ed, so that creates unto itself a very significant substantial claim that the op-ed — that is, the expression of one's opinion as ordinarily protected by the First Amendment — form the basis of this particular detention,” the judge continued, adding that Öztürk's “continued detention potentially chills the speech of the millions and millions of people in this country who are not citizens.”

“There is absolutely no evidence that she has engaged in violence, or advocated violence, she has no criminal record,” Sessions noted. “She has done nothing other than, essentially, attend her university and expand her contacts in her community in such a supportive way.”

“Her continued detention cannot stand,” he added.

The Trump administration has openly flouted judge's rulings — including a U.S. Supreme Court order — that direct it to release detained immigrants. Sessions' Friday ruling follows his earlier order to send Öztürk to Vermont and Wednesday's 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmation of the judge's directive, both of which have been ignored by the administration.

Seeing that Öztürk was still in ICE custody hours after his order, Sessions reiterated his directive Friday afternoon.

“In light of the court's finding of no flight risk and no danger to the community, petitioner is to be released from ICE custody immediately on her own recognizance, without any form of body-worn GPS or other ICE monitoring at this time,” the judge wrote.

Multiple media outlets reported Öztürk's release Friday afternoon.

Mahsa Khanbabai, Öztürk's attorney, told Courthouse News Service she's “relieved and ecstatic” that her client has been ordered released.

“Unfortunately, it is 45 days too late,” Khanbabai lamented. “She has been imprisoned all these days for simply writing an op-ed that called for human rights and dignity for the people in Palestine. When did speaking up against oppression become a crime? When did speaking up against genocide become something to be imprisoned for?”

The Trump administration has dubiously invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which allows the president to detain dor deport citizens of countries with which the U.S. is at war, in a bid to justify Öztürk's persecution. The administration has also cited the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which empowers the secretary of state to order the expulsion of noncitizens whose presence in the United States is deemed detrimental to U.S. foreign policy interests.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio — who lied about Öztürk supporting Hamas — has used such determinations to target people for engaging in constitutionally protected speech and protest.

“We do it every day,” Rubio said in March in defense of the policy. “Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visas.”

Rubio has invoked the law to target numerous other students who the government admits committed no crimes. These include Mahmoud Khalil, Mohsen Mahdawi, and Yunseo Chung — all permanent U.S. residents — as well as Ranjani Srinivasan and others. Far-right, pro-Israel groups like Betar and Canary Mission have compiled lists containing the names of these and other pro-Palestine students that are shared with the Trump administration for possible deportation.

Foreign nationals — and some U.S. citizens wrongfully swept up in the Trump administration's mass deportation effort — are imprisoned in facilities including private, for-profit detention centers, where there are widespread reports of poor conditions and alleged abuses.

These include denial of medical care, insufficient access to feminine hygiene products, and rotten food at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center, where Öztürk — who, according to Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), has received no religious or dietary accommodations and had her hijab forcibly removed — is being held.

Öztürk also suffers from asthma and told Sessions via Zoom Friday that her attacks have increased behind bars due to stress. Dr. Jessica McCannon, a pulmonologist, testified that Öztürk's asthma appears to be poorly controlled in ICE custody, according to courtroom coverage on the social media site Bluesky by freelance journalist Joshua J. Friedman.

U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was among those who on Friday demanded Öztürk's immediate release, while other lawmakers and human rights and free speech defenders celebrated Sessions' decision.

“Rümeysa Öztürk has finally been ordered released,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said on social media. “She has been unlawfully detained for more than six weeks in an ICE facility in Louisiana, more than 1,500 miles away from Somerville. This is a victory for Rümeysa, for justice, and for our democracy.”

In the United States, we guarantee free speech. No one here will lose their rights and freedom for publishing an op-ed. This is a win for the rule of law. Rümeysa is free!

Seth Stern, director of advocacy at Freedom of the Press Foundation, said in a statement that “it is unfathomable that in the United States legal system, it takes 45 days for a judge to rule that people can't be put behind bars for writing op-eds the government doesn't like.”

“Without a system committed to its principles, the Constitution is just words on paper, and they don't mean much if this can happen here,” Stern continued. “Öztürk's abduction and imprisonment is one of the most shameful chapters in First Amendment history.”

“We're thankful that Judge Sessions moved it one step closer to an end and we call on the Trump administration to release Öztürk immediately and not attempt to stall with any further authoritarian nonsense,” he added.

Amid President Donald Trump's defunding threats and pressure from ICE officials, universities have told “many hundreds” of international students that they have lost their immigration status and must immediately self-deport. These notifications were based on the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) termination of students' records on the Student Exchange and Visitor Information System (SEVIS), a database used by schools and authorities to access visa information.

Although DHS admitted in court that it had no authority to use SEVIS to revoke students' status, the Trump administration still canceled more than 1,800 visas before reversing course last month pending an ICE policy revamp.

In addition to moving to deport pro-Palestine students, the Trump administration is sending Latin American immigrants — including wrongfully expelled Maryland man Kilmar Abrego García — to a notorious prison in El Salvador, and the president has repeatedly threatened to send natural-born U.S. citizens there.

As with Öztürk and other detained students, the Trump administration has dubiously invoked the Alien Enemies Act in trying to deport García and others. However, federal judges — including multiple Trump appointees — have thwarted some of these efforts.

On Friday, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said that Trump and his advisers are “actively looking at” suspending habeas corpus as a means of overcoming judicial pushback against the administration's deportation blitz.

“Well, the Constitution is clear — and that of course is the supreme law of the land — that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion,” Miller told reporters at the White House. No foreign entity has invaded the United States since Japanese forces landed in the Aleutian Islands in the then-territory of Alaska during World War II.

Critics pointed out that Miller's proposal is, in fact, blatantly unconstitutional.

“Since it appears needs to be said: The authority to suspend habeas corpus lies with Congress, not the president, and is only legal during extreme circumstances of rebellion or invasion,” Democratic pollster and strategist Matt McDermott said  on Bluesky. “Stephen Miller is full of shit.”

It wasn't just Democrats and Palestine defenders who cheered Sessions' ruling Friday. Billy Binion, who covers “all things injustice” for the libertarian website Reason, said on social media that the government's “entire case against her is that… she wrote an op-ed.”

Anyway, I continue to be amazed at the number of people who claim to be free speech warriors while simultaneously weaponizing the power of the *federal government* to save them from words that offend them. Grim.

“Hard to overstate how bleak — and frankly embarrassing — it is that the Trump administration wants to jail and deport someone for speech,” he continued. “In America.”

At this moment, we are witnessing a terrifying array of anti-democratic tactics to silence political opposition, increase surveillance and expand authoritarian reach.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on May 9 targeting what he called the overcriminalization of regulation across the United States.

The president said that many of the regulatory crimes are “strict liability” offences, privileging large corporations that have the means to obtain a legal team that can work around the regulations.

“The purpose of this order is to ease the regulatory burden on everyday Americans and ensure no American is transformed into a criminal for violating a regulation they have no reason to know exists,” the order stated.

Within one year of signing the order, the heads of each agency and the attorney general are ordered to provide a report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The report must contain a list of all enforceable criminal regulatory offences, the range of potential criminal penalties for a violation, and the applicable mens rea standard, referring to criminal intent.

That report will be updated at least once a year and made available online. Criminal enforcement of any offense not included in that report is then strongly discouraged.

“Strict liability criminal regulatory offenses are disfavored,” the order stated. ”Any proposed or final criminal regulatory offense that includes a strict liability mens rea for the offense shall be treated as a 'significant regulatory action' and submitted to the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for the review applicable to significant regulatory actions under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), or any successor process.”

The order also called for more transparency, demanding that all future notices for proposed rule-making and final rules be published in the Federal Register, including the criminal violation and the authorizing statute, in consultation with the Justice Department.

The heads of each agency are also ordered to publish guidance in the Federal Register on their plans to address criminal liability regulatory offenses within 45 days of the order.

The agency should clarify that when deciding to refer alleged violations of criminal regulatory offences to the Justice Department, they should consider factors such as the harm or risk of harm, whether the defendant had knowledge related to the rule as well as any evidence that they were aware of their lawful conduct, and the potential the defendant could gain from the offense.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

One of the many lawsuits contesting President Donald Trump's agenda will hit the Supreme Court for oral argument for the first time on May 15.

The case arises from a challenge to Trump's birthright citizenship executive order. The hearing is unusual in that it stems from a preliminary appeal in which the Trump administration is challenging a federal judge's use of nationwide injunctions to block the president's agenda.

With more than 100 lawsuits against Trump's policies, lower court judges have issued a raft of nationwide injunctions halting parts of the administration's agenda, from federal spending freezes to immigration enforcement to canceling diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.

The injunctions are highly controversial because they impose policy changes for the entire country rather than offer relief only for plaintiffs in the lawsuits, drawing scrutiny from some Supreme Court justices and members of Congress.

Trump has said they are detrimental to the nation's future.

“STOP NATIONWIDE INJUNCTIONS NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE. If Justice Roberts and the United States Supreme Court do not fix this toxic and unprecedented situation IMMEDIATELY, our Country is in very serious trouble!”

Meanwhile, the hearing may also touch on questions about the constitutionality of Trump's order on birthright citizenship. The order challenged the idea that birthright citizenship allows an illegal immigrant's child to receive citizenship if born in the United States.

“While the parties litigate weighty questions, the Court should ‘restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that ‘purport to cover every person ... in the country,' limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power,” she wrote in a filing.

Competitive Enterprise Institute attorney Devin Watkins told The Epoch Times that the dispute before the high court on Thursday “really doesn't have anything to do with the merits of the government's position on birthright citizenship.”

Rather, the key question of this appeal, he said, is whether lower courts have the power to issue blocks that affect those who are not parties to the lawsuit.

“Children will lose access to health care and may indeed be deported, notwithstanding that at the conclusion of the litigation they will be found to have been U.S. citizens all along,” their brief read.

Republicans have argued that Article III of the Constitution limits relief to parties involved in a case and introduced legislation attempting to limit judges' authority in this area. They've pointed to the constitutional phrasing “cases and controversies.”

Florida State University Law Professor Jacob Eisler, however, told The Epoch Times that Trump's policies have nationwide implications. Relief, therefore, could not be confined to discrete parties before the court.

While some of the plaintiffs suing Trump are pregnant immigrants, others have included state governments.

In issuing one of the injunctions before the high court, U.S. District Judge John Coughenour said in February that a geographically limited injunction would be “ineffective” because plaintiff states would have to pay for the children of illegal immigrants who travel from other states.

“On this one, the merits are pretty closely entwined with the relief,” Super said, for those affected by the policy.

The hearing could result in the justices remanding or sending the group of birthright citizenship cases back to lower courts with further instructions. In contrast to typical Supreme Court cases, they're expected to offer tentative legal conclusions rather than an outright ruling that Trump's order is unconstitutional.

They could also comment on whether New Jersey and others challenging the administration are likely to succeed in arguing that Trump's order violates the Constitution. At oral argument, the justices could ask about the text of the 14th Amendment and how it has ruled on birthright citizenship in previous cases.

Those disagreeing with Trump's order on birthright citizenship point to something known as the citizenship clause, which states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Both sides disagree over who exactly is protected by that language.

The states and other entities suing the administration say this case shows that the children of illegal immigrants should receive citizenship. In their amicus brief, Congressional Democrats said that “the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment confers citizenship on all persons born in the United States and subject to its laws.”

But the administration and others, like the state of Tennessee and some members of Congress, have argued it's more limited.

“There is widespread agreement,” the members said, that the amendment “means that children born in the United States to ambassadors or invading soldiers would not receive citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment.” They added that “the best reason is because they do not owe total allegiance to the United States.”","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

A confrontation erupted Friday at a New Jersey detention center after three Democratic members of Congress and a group of protesters entered the federal immigration facility without authorization, according to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), accusing the lawmakers of storming the gate and endangering public safety.

The group allegedly forced their way into the first checkpoint, occupying a guard shack as a bus carrying detainees entered the facility. DHS said the action was an unlawful breach that endangered law enforcement personnel and detainees—some of whom are suspected murderers, rapists, gang members, and terrorists, according to the agency.

“Members of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond a bizarre political stunt and puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and detainees at risk,“ Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. ”Members of Congress are not above the law and cannot illegally break into detention facilities. Had these members requested a tour, we would have facilitated a tour of the facility.”

Video footage shared with media outlets shows Baraka being handcuffed by officers after a verbal dispute outside the gate. According to witnesses, the confrontation escalated when Baraka attempted to join the congressional delegation in entering the facility but was blocked by federal officials.

Baraka, a Democrat who is running to succeed term-limited New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, has been a vocal opponent of Delaney Hall's reopening and has filed suit against ICE and GEO Group, the private prison operator contracted to run the facility under a $1 billion, 15-year federal agreement. The 1,000-bed center began intake operations on May 1 and is part of a broader Trump administration effort to expand immigration detention capacity nationwide.

“At around 1 pm today, my colleagues @RepLaMonica @RepMenendez and I arrived at the Delaney Hall ICE detention facility in Newark to exercise our oversight authority as Members of Congress,” Coleman wrote. “Contrary to a press statement put out by DHS we did not 'storm' the detention center.”

Watson Coleman noted that Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-N.J.) was also present and criticized DHS for not acknowledging her in its statement. She said the group had been delayed repeatedly at the gate, then eventually escorted inside.

“Reopening Delaney Hall won't make us safer and it won't create an immigration system that is fair and secure for all families,” she added. She accused the center of prioritizing profit over justice and due process.

In remarks to news outlets, McLaughlin called Baraka a “sanctuary mayor” whose “political antics” were endangering ICE agents and detainees. She said that Baraka had repeatedly refused to follow standard entry procedures, despite being told he could enter like anyone else if proper protocols were followed.

The Epoch Times has contacted DHS, McLaughlin, and Baraka's office for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

    Editor's Note: “My Happy Place,” a CNN Original Series following celebrities on deeply personal journeys, airs Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT. CNN also tapped anchors and correspondents to share their happy places. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta's is Ann Arbor, Michigan.



            Rodger Bowser has worked in kitchens in London, studied cooking in Ireland and been a private chef on houseboats in France.
    


            But when it came time to plant his flag somewhere and build a lasting career in food, he always knew he'd return to Ann Arbor.



            His decision goes back to Bowser's formative years as an aspiring chef, when he moved here from rural Michigan for a summer job and became enchanted with the place.
    


            “Being in Ann Arbor, in a college town with multiple thoughts and viewpoints and diversity, and just the way people thought about things … it really opened my eyes up to a different world that I didn't know existed,” says Bowser, now head chef at Zingerman's Delicatessen, a beloved Ann Arbor eatery.
    


            Such is the pull of this unassuming Midwestern city, where students, faculty, staffers and alumni migrate back and forth from the handsome University of Michigan campus to the nearby restaurants, shops and bars of Ann Arbor's bustling downtown. The planet around which the rest of the city orbits, the school boasts some 53,000 students and a vast menu of cultural happenings, lending Ann Arbor a casual sophistication.
    


            A2, as it's known to locals, consistently ranks among the nation's top college towns. Most visitors to the city have ties to the university, but with a year-round calendar of events, a thriving food scene and big-time college sports, Ann Arbor offers plenty for other visitors as well.
    


            “For a weekend getaway, it's a pretty cool place to be,” Bowser says. “There's great entertainment — we have folk festivals, film festivals … we've got great museums and great restaurants. And if you're into the nature part of things there's some pretty cool stuff around town in terms of parks and stuff like that. I really like this town.”
    


            Most mentions of Ann Arbor start with the University of Michigan, the state school with its blue-and-maize (they don't call it yellow) color scheme and famous sports teams, perennial powerhouses in football and basketball.
    


            Notable alumni include former President Gerald Ford, Google co-founder Larry Page, actor James Earl Jones, quarterback Tom Brady and CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, along with numerous members of Congress and foreign heads of state. One of the top public universities in the country, U of M attracts students from all 50 states and 99 countries, giving Ann Arbor an international flavor that complements its friendly Midwestern charm.
    


            Its central campus sits in the heart of the city and offers many attractions, including a handful of free museums. Chief among them is the university's art museum, whose large collection includes 19th-century landscapes, portraits by Pablo Picasso and abstract works by Helen Frankenthaler.



            From there it's a short walk to the school's museum of natural history, which offers kid-friendly exhibits on everything from microscopic organisms to dinosaurs, plus a planetarium hosting star shows and animations on black holes.
    


            The U of M campus also is home to some striking 20th-century architecture, including an Art Deco bell tower and grand buildings by Albert Kahn and Eero Saarinen. But its most crowd-pleasing structure may be its Gothic law school library, whose gorgeous reading room looks like something from a Harry Potter set.



            Stroll through the central campus's main pedestrian thoroughfare, called the Diag, on a warm day and you'll find hundreds of students lounging in the grass, playing music, hustling to class or passing out leaflets for events. And wow, are there a lot of events. On one recent spring day, posters around town heralded theatrical productions, jazz concerts, a comedy festival, a Zine Jamboree, a roundtable on human rights in Turkey and a Beyoncé-themed dance party.
    


            No happening in Ann Arbor, however, can compete with Michigan football. Each home game draws thousands of visitors who turn the town into a sprawling street festival, complete with tailgate parties and throngs of raucous, blue-clad fans. Games are held in Michigan Stadium, nicknamed “the Big House,” which holds 115,000 people and is the largest stadium in the country. Almost all of Ann Arbor's population can fit inside.
    


            Residents rave about the town's game-day atmosphere, which reached a crescendo two seasons ago when Michigan won the national title.
    


            “You should come here on a Saturday in the fall,” says Parker Kern, a U of M sophomore who is studying aerospace engineering, echoing a common refrain. “There's a bunch of people in the streets and they're all migrating towards the Big House. Everyone's really excited. There's music everywhere. And usually we win.”
    


            City resident Nate Hoard often hosts several dozen friends for pre-game festivities at his house near campus. Many of them park their cars on his front lawn.
    


            “It's electric. They sell T-shirts that read, ‘Saturdays in Ann Arbor,'” says Hoard, describing the scene. “It doesn't matter if they (the football team) are good or bad. Even in the worst seasons, it's the best day.”
    


            Don't worry: Non-football fans will find plenty of other diversions here — starting with places to eat.
    


            Ann Arbor isn't known as a foodie destination. But for a mid-sized city it punches above its weight, buoyed by a mix of creative student hangouts and higher-end eateries serving everything from Afro-Caribbean food to Korean barbecue to award-winning cocktails.
    


            The granddaddy of the city's culinary scene isn't some starchy, white-tablecloth restaurant, though. It's a deli.
    


Zingerman's opened in 1982 and has grown into a regional institution, serving more than three dozen varieties of sandwiches from its handsome brick storefront in the Kerrytown neighborhood just north of downtown. Its specialty is the Reuben, but the exhaustive menu also includes barbecued brisket, Italian subs and a handful of vegetarian options — many named for the staffers who created them.
    


            Even Bowser, now a Zingerman's managing partner, has a difficult time deciding what to order.
    


            “What's my favorite sandwich? The one in front of me,” he says. “It's hard to pick.”
    


            Over the years the deli has expanded into a Zingerman's empire with a bakery, a creamery, a coffee purveyor and catering business — all in Ann Arbor — along with a mail-order service. Their growing domain also includes Miss Kim, a lively Korean restaurant serving such innovative small plates as lotus roots with toasted cashews in a doenjang pepper sauce. Its chef, Ji Hye Kim, is a four-time James Beard Award semifinalist.
    


            Students also flock to Frita Batidos, a Cuban-inspired, casual eatery in an airy downtown space that's locally famous for their deliciously messy burgers, customizable with such toppings as tropical slaw, cilantro-lime salsa or a fried egg. For a savory-sweet combo, pair your burger with a batido, a Cuban fruit milkshake.
    


            For more elevated dining, visitors can head around the corner to Peridot, a cozy spot serving creative small plates with Asian influences, along with killer cocktails. A recent menu featured kampachi sashimi with prosciutto, pomelo and herbs in a ginger vinaigrette. Sitting at the bar offers a chance to watch Elliott Reibert, a finalist in this year's US Bartenders' Guild national competition, do his thing.
    


            And if you want a nearby nightcap, consider The Last Word, a handsome basement bar with live music, a full kitchen and a speakeasy vibe.
    


            Ann Arbor's density of bars, eateries and events is one of the things that appealed to Hoard when he moved here 11 years ago.
    


            “I park my car Friday night when I get home and I don't have to drive again ‘til Monday morning,” says the 43-year-old, who runs a distribution company and lives downtown. “I can walk to a Big Ten game … I can walk to a 5-star restaurant. Whatever I want is within walking distance. All these things add up to a great atmosphere.”
    


            Further afield is York Food + Drink, a spacious hangout south of downtown with a deli counter, a wine store, a bar and a recent pop-up serving barbecue. York has been a community gathering spot for decades; on a recent weekday afternoon a group of senior citizens shared a table, writing postcards to Congress to lobby for preserving Social Security.
    


            Owner Tommy York drifts from table to table, chatting with customers. He greets an arriving woman by name and asks about her new hip.
    


            “I know everybody (in town). Not because I'm special, but because I've been working in retail food for a long time,” says York, who bikes to work. He came to Ann Arbor for grad school in the ‘80s and never left, buying the business in 2001 because he wanted a casual place where people could bring their kids.
    


            “One of the things I like about the Midwest is that you don't have to get dressed up to go out,” he says. “You come as you are.”
    


            Founded as a frontier outpost in 1824, Ann Arbor got a huge boost when the fledgling University of Michigan relocated here 13 years later from Detroit. According to legend, the village was named for the wives of its two founders, both named Ann, and the area's towering bur oaks. Ann Arbor celebrated its bicentennial with much fanfare last year.
    


            The city's arboreal heritage lives on at the Nichols Arboretum — affectionately known as the “Arb” — a park-like expanse along the Huron River with walking paths, grassy fields and more than 100 species of trees. It also has a reputation as a romantic spot. Playwright Arthur Miller, a Michigan alum, famously recalled the Arb as “good for anatomical studies, especially in spring under a moon.”
    


            Other city attractions include a botanical garden, the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library, a 106-year-old farmer's market each Saturday and miles of walking trails along the winding Huron River, where residents go kayaking and tubing in the summer.
    


            Visitors also can easily spend a day browsing the streets of Ann Arbor's compact downtown, home to eclectic shops selling everything from vinyl records to macarons. There's also an outpost of Shinola, the Detroit maker of wristwatches, leather bags and other luxury goods. Many local merchants know one another and are quick to recommend each other's stores and restaurants.
    


            This home-grown, community feel is an Ann Arbor trademark, says Hilary Gustafson, co-owner of Literati Bookstore, a downtown mainstay that hosts author readings, panels and a handful of book clubs. Gustafson and her husband Michael opened the store in 2013, filling a void left by Borders, the Ann Arbor-based bookstore chain that had closed its original store here two years earlier.
    


            “Sure, we are a retail business — we sell books. But our role as we see it is kind of a community-building space,” she says. “A lot of other businesses here are like-minded … we're not just a collection of stores selling goods — we're a collection of stores that support each other and try to build community.”
    


            Indeed, Ann Arbor hums with a distinct blend of civic spirit and school pride. People like it here, and it shows. It's one reason why University of Michigan alums return over and over.
    


            Asked what he enjoys most about Ann Arbor, Tommy York doesn't hesitate.
    


            “There's something here for everybody,” he says. “And the people — the people are great. I'm a small-town person in a city that has big stuff.”

            High-level talks between the United States and China have begun in Geneva, Switzerland, Chinese state media reported on Saturday, in a possible thaw in the trade war sparked by President Donald Trump's massive tariffs.
    


            Vice Premier He Lifeng will lead the talks on the Chinese side, while US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will be America's chief representative, state broadcaster CCTV said in a brief report.
    


            Bessent urged the public earlier this week not to expect a major trade deal out of the meetings, but he acknowledged it was an important step in negotiations.
    


            The US has placed a minimum 145% tariff on most Chinese imports, and China has responded with a 125% tariff on most US imports. As a result, trade between the two sides is falling sharply, according to logistics experts.
    


            Even reducing that tariff rate by half still might not be enough to change trade levels significantly. Economists have said 50% is the make-or-break threshold for the return of somewhat normal business between the two countries.
    


            On Friday, hours after Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer had set off for Switzerland, Trump floated the possibility of slashing tariffs on Chinese goods to 80% while demanding China “open up its market to USA.”
    


            “80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.
    


            The combination of fewer goods arriving in the US and increased costs on imports that do arrive has already started pushing up prices for Americans. Goldman Sachs analysts said Thursday that a key measure of inflation would effectively double to 4% by the end of the year because of Trump's trade war.
    


            And with ships carrying goods under the 145% tariffs now coming into port, a trade deal wouldn't lower prices immediately.
    


            To say Americans depend on a wide range of Chinese goods understates how pervasive they have become in daily life. Footwear, clothes, appliances, microchips, baby goods, toys, sports equipment, office machine parts and much more all pour into the US from China in staggering numbers.
    


            But now those imports are decreasing. Imports into the United States during the second half of 2025 are expected to fall at least 20% year over year, according to the National Retail Federation. The decline from China will be even starker. Investment bank JPMorgan expects a 75% to 80% drop in imports from there.
    


            The trade war has already affected the US economy. The nation's gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the US economy, showed America's first quarterly contraction since early 2022, as importers raced to bring in goods before punishing tariff rates kicked in.
    


            The impact of the sky-high tariffs is also being felt keenly in China, whose exports to the US fell sharply in April. Chinese outbound shipments to the US stood at $33 billion last month – a whopping 21% decline from the $41.8 billion recorded in April 2024, according to a CNN calculation.
    


            Steep US tariffs have also taken a heavy toll on China's manufacturing sector. Chinese factory activity contracted at its fastest pace in 16 months in April, adding urgency to Beijing's efforts to roll out fresh economic stimulus.
    


            The news that Bessent and Greer would meet their Chinese counterparts in Geneva has raised hopes of a detente between the two nations. The US and China are the world's largest and second-largest economies, respectively, bigger than even the next 20 economies put together, according to World Bank data.
    


            Trump also told a conservative radio host on Wednesday that he would raise the case of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai “as part of the negotiation.” Lai, a pugnacious former publisher whose now shuttered tabloid Apple Daily was a regular thorn in Beijing's side, is in the midst of a national security trial that could send him to prison for life.
    


            CCTV did not say if Lai featured in the talks.

            A Soviet-era spacecraft that was designed to make a soft landing on Venus — but instead remained trapped in Earth orbit for decades — likely fell from the sky early Saturday morning, according to the European Space Agency.
    


            The object, referred to as Cosmos 482 or Kosmos 482, is believed to be a capsule launched by the Soviet Union in March 1972 that failed en route to a transfer orbit that would have taken it to Venus to study its environment. The probe entered the dense layers of the atmosphere around 9:24 a.m. Moscow time (2:24 a.m. ET) Saturday, splashing down in the Indian Ocean west of Jakarta, Indonesia, according to the Russian space agency, Roscosmos.
    


            The ESA, which was one of several organizations using ground sensors to keep tabs on the falling space junk, also said on its website that the vehicle was not spotted by radars in Germany around 7:32 UT (3:32 a.m. ET), indicating, “it is most likely that the reentry has already occurred.”
    


            In the decades since it was launched, Cosmos 482 circled Earth aimlessly as it was slowly dragged back toward home.
    


            Astronomers and space traffic experts have had their eyes on the object for years now as its orbital path slowly reached lower and lower altitudes, a result of the subtle atmospheric drag that exists even hundreds of miles away from Earth.
    


            The cylinder-shaped craft is about 3 feet (1 meter) in diameter.

What is ‘Kessler Syndrome' — and why do some scientists think the space disaster scenario has already started?



            Because the spacecraft no longer had the ability to maneuver, it was destined to undergo what space traffic experts refer to as an uncontrolled reentry — plunging back to Earth in a manner that can be extremely difficult to accurately forecast. The sheer complexity of spaceflight and unpredictable factors, such as space weather, complicate efforts to pinpoint exactly when or where an object will fall out of orbit.
    


            This particular piece of space junk did not pose a substantial risk to people on the ground, experts told CNN. But it garnered international attention because of Cosmos 482's unique history.
    


            “This object was designed to survive reentering Venus, so there's fair odds that it'll survive coming back (to Earth) in one piece,” said Marlon Sorge, a space debris expert with The Aerospace Corporation, on Monday. “That actually makes the risk less … because it would stay intact.”
    


            Often, when spaceborne garbage hurtles back toward Earth, objects such as defunct rocket parts are torn apart by the jarring physics as they can slam into Earth's thick inner atmosphere while still traveling at more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,000 kilometers per hour).
    


            Each of the pieces from the rocket part can then pose a threat to the area where it lands.
    


            But Cosmos 482 was well suited to make the trip home in one piece. The spacecraft had a substantial heat shield that protected the vehicle from the intense temperatures and pressures that can build up during reentry.
    


            And because Cosmos 482 was designed to reach the surface of Venus — where the atmosphere is 90 times denser than Earth's — the probe likely remained intact.
    


            The Soviet Union's Space Research Institute, or IKI, ran a groundbreaking Venus exploration program amid the 20th century space race.
    


            Venera, as the program was called, sent a series of probes toward Venus in the 1970s and '80s, with several spacecraft surviving the trip and beaming data back to Earth before ceasing operations.

            Of the two Venera vehicles that were launched in 1972  , however, only one made it to Venus.
    


            The other, a spacecraft sometimes cataloged as V-71 No. 671, did not. And that's why researchers believed that Cosmos 482 was the failed Venera vehicle. (Beginning in the 1960s, Soviet vehicles left in Earth orbit were each given the Cosmos name and a numerical designation for tracking purposes, according to NASA.)
    


            While a landing on dry ground was unlikely, it wasn't impossible. The Cosmos 482 object's trajectory showed it could have landed within a broad swath of land that includes “the whole of Africa, South America, Australia, the USA, parts of Canada, parts of Europe, and parts of Asia,” said Marco Langbroek, a lecturer and space traffic expert at Delft Technical University in the Netherlands, via email.
    


            Sorge emphasized that if Cosmos 482 had landed on dry ground, onlookers would have been advised to keep their distance. The aged spacecraft could leak dangerous fuels or pose other risks to people and property.
    


            “Contact the authorities,” Sorge urged. “Please don't mess with it.”
    


            Legally speaking, the object also belongs to Russia. According to rules mapped out in the 1967 Outer Space Treaty — which remains the primary document underpinning international law on the matter — the nation that launched an object to space retains ownership and responsibility for it even if it crashes back to Earth decades after launch.
    


            Though defunct objects in space routinely fall out of orbit, most pieces of debris disintegrate entirely during the reentry process.
    


            But the world is in the midst of a new space race, with commercial companies such as SpaceX launching hundreds of new satellites to orbit each year. That burst in activity has raised alarms across the space traffic community, as experts are seeking to ensure that objects don't collide in space or pose a risk to humans if they make an uncontrolled descent back home.

            Safety standards have drastically improved since the 20th century space race when the Soviet Venus probe was launched, noted Parker Wishik, a spokesperson for The Aerospace Corporation.
    


            Still, incidents such as the Cosmos 482 reentry are a stark reminder.
    


            “What goes up must come down,” Wishik said. “What you put up in space today might affect us for decades to come.”

NEW ORLEANS (AP) — The new pope's French-sounding last name, Prevost, intrigued Jari Honora, a New Orleans genealogist, who began digging in the archives and discovered the pope had deep roots in the Big Easy.

All four of Pope Leo XIV's maternal great-grandparents were “free people of color” in Louisiana based on 19th-century census records, Honora found. As part of the melting pot of French, Spanish, African and Native American cultures in Louisiana, the pope's maternal ancestors would be considered Creole.




“It was special for me because I share that heritage and so do many of my friends who are Catholic here in New Orleans,” said Honora, a historian at the Historic New Orleans Collection, a museum in the French Quarter.

Honora and others in the Black and Creole Catholic communities say the election of Leo — a Chicago native who spent over two decades in Peru including eight years as a bishop — is just what the Catholic Church needs to unify the global church and elevate the profile of Black Catholics whose history and contributions have long been overlooked. 

Leo, who has not spoken openly about his roots, may also have an ancestral connection to Haiti. His grandfather, Joseph Norval Martinez, may have been born there, though historical records are conflicting, Honora said. However, Martinez's parents — the pope's great-grandparents — were living in Louisiana since at least the 1850s, he said.

Andrew Jolivette, a professor of sociology and Afro-Indigenous Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, did his own digging and found the pope's ancestry reflected the unique cultural tapestry of southern Louisiana. The pope's Creole roots draw attention to the complex, nuanced identities Creoles hold, he said.

“There is Cuban ancestry on his maternal side. So, there are a number of firsts here and it's a matter of pride for Creoles,” said Jolivette, whose family is Creole from Louisiana. “So, I also view him as a Latino pope because the influence of Latino heritage cannot be ignored in the conversation about Creoles.”

Most Creoles are Catholic and historically it was their faith that kept families together as they migrated to larger cities like Chicago, Jolivette said.

The former Cardinal Robert Prevost's maternal grandparents — identified as “mulatto” and “Black” in historical records — were married in New Orleans in 1887 and lived in the city's historically Creole Seventh Ward. In the coming years, the Jim Crow regime of racial segregation rolled back post-Civil War reforms and “just about every aspect of their lives was circumscribed by race, extending even to the church,” Honora said.





The pope's grandparents migrated to Chicago around 1910, like many other African American families leaving the racial oppression of the Deep South, and “passed for white,” Honora said. The pope's mother, Mildred Agnes Martinez, who was born in Chicago, is identified as “white” on her 1912 birth certificate, Honora said. 

“You can understand, people may have intentionally sought to obfuscate their heritage,” he said. “Always life has been precarious for people of color in the South, New Orleans included.”

The pope's grandparents' old home in New Orleans was later destroyed, along with hundreds of others, to build a highway overpass that “eviscerated” a stretch of the largely Black neighborhood in the 1960s, Honora said.

A former New Orleans mayor, Marc Morial, called the pope's family's history, “an American story of how people escape American racism and American bigotry.” 

As a Catholic with Creole heritage who grew up near the neighborhood where the pope's grandparents lived, Morial said he has contradictory feelings. While he's proud of the pope's connection to his city, Morial said the new pontiff's maternal family's shifting racial identity highlights “the idea that in America people had to escape their authenticity to be able to survive.”

The Rev. Ajani Gibson, who heads the predominantly Black congregation at St. Peter Claver Church in New Orleans, said he sees the pope's roots as a reaffirmation of African American influence on Catholicism in his city.

“I think a lot of people take for granted that the things that people love most about New Orleans are both Black and Catholic,” said Gibson, referring to rich cultural contributions to Mardi Gras, New Orleans' jazz tradition and brass band parades known as second-lines.

He hoped the pope's Creole heritage — emerging from the city's “cultural gumbo pot” — signals an inclusive outlook for the Catholic Church.

“I want the continued elevation of the universal nature of the church — that the church looks, feels, sounds like everybody,” Gibson said. “We all have a place and we come and bring who we are, completely and totally, as gifts to the church.”

Shannen Dee Williams, a history professor at the University of Dayton, said she hopes that Leo's “genealogical roots and historic papacy will underscore that all roads in American Catholicism, in North, South and Central America, lead back to the church's foundational roots in its mostly unacknowledged and unreconciled histories of Catholic colonialism, slavery and segregation.” 

“There have always been two trans-Atlantic stories of American Catholicism; one that begins with Europeans and another one that begins with Africans and African-descended people, free and enslaved, living in Europe and Africa in the 16th century,” she said. “Just as Black history is American history, (Leo's) story also reminds us that Black history is, and always has been, Catholic history, including in the United States.”



Kim R. Harris, associate professor of African American Religious Thought and Practice at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, said the pope's genealogy got her thinking about the seven African American Catholics on the path to sainthood who have been recognized by the National Black Catholic Congress, but haven't yet been canonized. 

Harris highlighted Pierre Toussaint, a philanthropist born in Haiti as a slave who became a New York City entrepreneur and was declared “Venerable” by Pope John Paul II in 1997.

“The excitement I have in this moment probably has to do with the hope that this pope's election will help move this canonization process along,” Harris said. 

While it's not known how Leo identifies himself racially, his roots bring a sense of hope to African American Catholics, she said.

“When I think about a person who brings so much of the history of this country in his bones, I really hope it brings to light who we are as Americans, and who we are as people of the diaspora,” she said. “It brings a whole new perspective and widens the vision of who we all are.”

Reynold Verret, president of Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans, the only historically Black Catholic university, said he was “a little surprised” about the pope's heritage.

“It's a joyful connection,” he said. “It is an affirmation that the Catholic Church is truly universal and that (Black) Catholics remained faithful regardless of a church that was human and imperfect. It also shows us that the church transcends national borders.”

NEW YORK (AP) — When country star Maren Morris would voice support for the LBGTQ community, including publicly clashing with Jason Aldean's wife over gender-affirming care for transgender youth, she thought she was doing it as an ally. She didn't realize it at the time, but she was also speaking up for herself, too.

“I just maybe, internally, hadn't had the bravery to go there in myself, and say the words out loud,” said Morris, who recently came out as bisexual. “When you spend the majority of your life in straight relationships and you haven't explored that part of yourself … is now the right time for me to tell everyone while I'm married that like, 'Hi, I'm also attracted to women?'”

The Grammy winner, who's also stood in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter social justice movement and immigrants, has experienced drastic life changes throughout the past year, including a divorce with fellow singer-songwriter Ryan Hurd. These learning curves shaped “Dreamsicle,” her fourth studio album, out now.

“There's a freedom that I've found in this album that's a new version of what I thought I had,” Morris explained. “It's just more wise and lived-in. And maybe part of that's just like being in your 30s — you just don't care as much.”

Following 2022's “Humble Quest,” the 35-year-old singer-songwriter crafted 14 tracks filled with an eclectic, yet cohesive mix of traditional country, pop, soft-rock and dreamy bluegrass vibes. It continues the free-flowing, unconfined mix of sounds the “The Bones” singer is known for. Production includes superstar pop producer Jack Antonoff, John Ryan, Laura Veltz and The Monsters & Strangerz production team, with Morris credited as a writer on every song.




“I was writing all through all of those personal losses and evolutions. … I was really just avoiding going home, and I would stay in my sessions late, and also write on days that I probably should have just taken a nap or gone to see my therapist,” Morris said. “There were moments where I'm singing on some of these songs where I don't even remember doing the vocal because I was just in such a state of loss and grief.”

Standout moments include the beautiful Americana-esque “grand bouquet” where Morris sings, “been so busy praying for my grand bouquet/not noticing you gave me a new flower every day.” There are also her staple poppy songs like “cry in the car” that attempt to mask the pain and frustration of heartbreak behind upbeat tempos.

But it's not all doom and gloom; “The Middle” vocalist explores new themes, like on the previously released singles “bed no breakfast,” and “push me over” which she wrote with the electro-pop band MUNA.

“I went on a date with a woman for the first time, and I was just like I want to write about this,” she said, noting she felt safe exploring the topic with the queer-identifying band.

While she says each song represents some facet of this new era, the title track provides the fullest picture.

“It was the first song for one of my albums that I wrote alone and I don't often do that,” said Morris, who added “Dreamsicle” came to her at one night as a 3 a.m. realization that change was necessary. “Everything that I thought was going to be permanent in my life, like in some form or fashion, either ended or evolved into something completely different.”

Morris is currently prepping for her global tour in July, with more than 40 dates mixing headlining shows and festival appearances. 

Since coming out, she emphasizes she's received an abundance of love throughout Nashville, and has been overwhelmed by the support in the country music space that some have criticized as intolerant.

More importantly, she hopes fans understand “Dreamsicle” is not a “divorce record,” but a celebratory album of healing.

“It deals with grief. It deals with the friends that helped patch you back together,” Morris said. “It's important to show and to prove to myself that I can process and heal from this. … If I can do it, ... someone will hear it and feel like they can get through that day that they're in.”

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, mocked Democrats for advocating for the return of illegal immigrant and wife beater Kilmar Abrego Garcia, saying, ""I think they hate Donald Trump so much that it's driven them to crazy town."" (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy)

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, mocked ""crazy town"" Democrats for defending illegal immigrants like alleged MS-13 gang member and Salvadoran national Kilmar Abrego Garcia over U.S. citizens, saying that many seem to have an incurable case of Trump derangement syndrome.

Cruz's comments came after several Democratic lawmakers, including Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, traveled to El Salvador to advocate for Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. after he was deported to his home country. The remarks also came just before Newark, N.J., Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested Friday after joining several members of Congress in storming an ICE detention facility.

""It is a very bizarre political decision that the Democrats have made,"" Cruz said. ""They have decided that they are the party of illegal immigrants and the party of gang members.""

""The vast majority of Americans,"" he went on, ""don't want more gang members and violent criminals in this country, and it really is a shame the Democrats have gotten so extreme in their hatred of Donald Trump that the one thing they can stand for is more illegals and more gang members.""

DEM IMMIGRATION TALKING POINTS FIZZLE AS DARK PICTURE OF ABREGO GARCIA EMERGES

Senator Ted Cruz, R-Texas, mocked ""crazy town"" Democrats for defending Salvadoran illegal immigrants like alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia over U.S. citizens. 

Bringing up Van Hollen's and other Democrats' trips to El Salvador on behalf of Abrego Garcia, Cruz said: ""We're seeing Democrat senators, Democrat house members flying down to El Salvador and putting all their political capital behind the position that we need more illegal immigrants in America, we need more criminals in America, and we need more MS-13 gang members in America.""

""I think Trump derangement syndrome is a real mental illness,"" he went on. ""I think they hate Donald Trump so much that it has driven them to crazy town. . . . Why is it that Democrats care so much about supporting violent criminal illegal aliens, they care so much about supporting MS-13 gang members?""

Though many Democrats claim that Abrego Garcia is an innocent man who was wrongly deported, the administration has pointed to considerable evidence that he is a member of the MS-13 gang.

According to police and court records shared with Fox News Digital, Abrego Garcia was arrested in Hyattsville, Maryland, in October 2019, at which point he was identified by the Prince George's County Police Gang Unit as an MS-13 gang member.

A federal immigration court in Baltimore further determined that Abrego Garcia was not eligible for release, because he had ""failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that his release from custody would not pose a danger to others, as the evidence shows that he is a verified member of MS-13.""

Several DHS sources have confirmed to Fox News Digital records indicating that Abrego Garcia also had been pulled over by a Tennessee highway patrol trooper while driving an SUV belonging to Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, another illegal alien who in 2020 confessed to human smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border.

Fox News Digital has also reviewed court documents filed by Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, alleging that he had seriously beaten and verbally abused her multiple times and mentally abused her children.

In April, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's decision ordering the Trump administration to arrange Abrego Garcia's return.

(Pete Kiehart for The Washington Post via Getty Images)

The court required the ""government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador."" 

The Trump administration agreed to clear any administrative obstacles keeping Abrego Garcia from returning to the U.S., but Attorney General Pam Bondi has said that returning him is ""up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That's not up to us."" 

After Fox News Digital asked Van Hollen whether he was aware of the domestic violence allegations against Abrego Garcia before he went to visit him in El Salvador, the senator became defensive, saying: ""What I said here was these issues need to be litigated in the courts, okay?""

""What Donald Trump needs to do is put up or shut up in the courts, and he's just not done that,"" he went on.

""My response is, always stick to the Constitution, stick to the due process rights of people who live in America, and if we all do that, then we'll be doing the right thing for our country.""

First lady Melania Trump hosted a special ceremony on Thursday announcing the latest commemorative stamp honoring the legacy of former first lady Barbara Bush alongside Mrs. Bush's daughter, Doro Bush Koch.

Washington, D.C. – First lady Melania Trump hosted a special ceremony this week announcing the latest commemorative stamp honoring the legacy of former first lady Barbara Bush. Fox News Digital was on hand for the event. 

Mrs. Trump was joined on stage in the East Room of the White House on Thursday by Doro Bush Koch, daughter of Barbara Bush; Alice Yates, CEO of the George & Barbara Bush Foundation; and Judy de Torok, vice president of corporate affairs at the U.S. Postal Service.

""Barbara's unwavering conviction, dignity and deep loyalty to her loved ones have left an indelible mark on our hearts and history,"" said Mrs. Trump. (See the video at the top of this article.)

""Barbara Bush, known to many as mom, Ganny, the Silver Fox, or most famously in our family, the Enforcer, will forever be remembered for her strength, abounding love for family, quick wit, and deep commitment to literacy,"" said Bush Koch.

""[My father was the] only man she would ever kiss at a school dance,"" their daughter added. 

""Two years later, she was engaged to George H.W. Bush, beginning a partnership that would span decades and help shape history. Little did she know the adventures ahead.""

""Mom told her staff she wanted to do something every day to help others, so that's what she did. She scheduled many events and visits that highlighted a need helped encourage volunteerism or focused on literacy,"" Bush Koch shared. 

Melania Trump and Bush Koch both highlighted Barbara Bush's 1990 commencement speech at Wellesley College, in which she encouraged graduates to believe in something larger than themselves, to get involved in some of the big ideas of the day.

""While she is known for championing literacy, she also supported women's empowerment, changed the national conversation on AIDS, and took a stance supporting gay rights,"" said the first lady. (Yuri Gripas for Fox News Digital)

""Barbara Bush's iconic commencement address at Wellesley College in 1990 remains an important moment in the conversation surrounding women's roles in society. Her message, which emphasized the importance of family and personal integrity, encouraged women to carve their own paths in life,"" said Trump.

Bush Koch noted a ""defining moment"" when her mother cradled an infant with HIV at a time when there was a stigma surrounding the disease.

""That simple, compassionate act, captured in a photo that made national headlines, spoke louder than words ever could. Mom was never one to shy away from speaking the truth or taking a stand,"" said Bush Koch.

Mrs. Trump shared that the hallmark of Bush's legacy is not just her respect for tradition but also the ways in which she broke convention.

""Her legacy lives on not only in history books, but in the hearts of everyone she touched. It's unlikely that Mom ever pictured herself on a postage stamp, and it's very likely that she would be wondering what all this fuss is about today,"" said Bush Koch.

Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage, in an exclusive Fox News Digital interview, points to President Trump and says a main reason he's coming out of retirement to run for Congress is ‘I have a friend in the White House right now'

LEWISTON, MAINE - EXCLUSIVE - Former two-term Gov. Paul LePage of Maine says President Donald Trump is a major reason why he's coming out of political retirement at age 76 – and he's eyeing a campaign comeback.

""I never, ever had any aspirations to go to Washington until now,"" LePage said this week in his first national interview after launching his bid for the House in Maine's Second Congressional District, which is a top swing seat the GOP aims to flip in the 2026 midterm elections.

The contest will likely be one of the most closely watched House races in the country next year as the Republicans aim to hold their fragile majority in the chamber.

""Donald Trump, I think, is doing what is necessary in addressing the debt this country is facing. And I think that's a big, big thing for me,"" LePage said as he was interviewed in the Maine city where he was born and raised.

HOUSE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CHAIR SPELLS OUT HIS PLAYBOOK TO HOLD THE CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY

Former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who is running for the House in 2026 in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, speaks with Fox News Digital in Lewiston, Maine, on May 7, 2025, in his first interview after announcing his candidacy.  (Fox News - Paul Steinhauser)

LePage highlighted, ""I have a friend in the White House right now. I know President Trump. I think I can have an audience of President Trump. I know several of his secretaries very well. And so I think this is a good time. It's a good time for me to go help.""

LePage – the brash and blunt politician who won over blue-collar workers struggling with economic woes, which helped the Republican businessman win election and re-election in the blue-leaning state – was one of the first major GOP elected officials to endorse Trump when the president first ran for the White House nearly a decade ago.

""I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular,"" LePage joked at the time, in a line that's since become famous.

The conservative governor, who grabbed national attention with controversial comments made during his tenure, briefly moved with his wife, Ann, to Florida after finishing his second term in 2019.

""I am done with politics. I have done my eight years. It's time for somebody else,"" he said at the time.

CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS TARGETING THESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS IN 2026 MIDTERM BATTLE

But LePage re-established residency in Maine five years ago and challenged his successor as governor, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, in the 2022 election.

LePage ended up losing his bid for a third term by 13 points to Mills, but he did carry the 2nd Congressional District in that race.

Moderate Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, a U.S. Marine veteran who deployed to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and who often bucks his own party in Congress, has held the seat since first winning it in 2018.

But Golden won re-election by a razor-thin margin last year in the district, which is the second-most rural in the U.S. and the largest east of the Mississippi River.

And Trump, who carried the district in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections by nine, seven and 10 points, earned an electoral vote each time, as Maine and Nebraska, are the only two states in the union to allocate their electoral votes partially by congressional district.

MAINE'S GOLDEN TAKES AIM AT FELLOW DEMOCRATS OVER POLICY

Golden, in a statement after LePage announced his candidacy, said, ""I thought Paul was doing his best work in retirement.""

But the 42-year-old Golden has yet to announce whether he'll seek re-election next year or instead run for either the state's Senate seat or the open governor's office.

Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spotlighted LePage's tenure as governor.

""Paul LePage's time in office was defined by his obsession with blocking Mainers' ability to receive quality health care, opposing Medicaid expansion at every possible opportunity,"" DCCC national press secretary Viet Shelton argued in a statement. ""At a time when Republicans in Congress are pushing the largest cut to Medicaid in history, Mainers can't afford LePage's crusade to rip health care away from people.""

In his Fox News interview, LePage reiterated that the nation's debt is a top motivation for him to return to politics. As of May 8, the national debt was $36,212,886,111,158.26, according to Fox News' National Debt Tracker. 

""It's the spending and the debt that this country has, and I'm worried about my grandchildren, great-grandchildren. And I think we have a president now that's really willing to tackle it, and I'm willing to help,"" he said.

But LePage added that ""the other thing that is really big is what's happening in our country with the woke environment. I think I want to be there to help clean that up if we can. Having boys play in girls' sports is really sad.""

He also highlighted his Tuesday meeting—part of a three-day swing through the congressional district—with Maine student Cassidy Carlisle, whom he described as ""the courageous young woman fighting unfair male competition in girls' sports.""

Maine's 2nd Congressional District shares a long border with Canada.

When asked if he'll be spotlighting border security and immigration as major issues in his campaign, Lepage said, ""Big time.""

But the controversial tariffs the president placed on nations across the globe last month has strained relations with Canada.

""I'm all for the tariffs,"" LePage said. ""The tariffs will fix our international trade and lower taxes.""

LePage acknowledged: ""Is it going to hurt in the short term? Yeah, it's going to hurt a little bit in the short term, but I think it's necessary.""

And he predicted that ""the tariffs are going to be a short-term problem. I think they're going to settle out.""

LePage spoke with Fox News at Lewiston's Franco Center, a performing arts center and historic site of Franco-American culture located in a former Gothic church built in 1907 for French Canadian immigrants in Maine, which is located alongside the city's historical mills and canals.

The former governor, who survived a troubling and often brutal upbringing, gave Fox News a tour of the many dwellings within blocks of the Franco Center, where he spent his childhood.

The eldest son of 18 children, LePage grew up speaking French in an impoverished home with an alcoholic and abusive father who was a mill worker.

At age 11, he ran away from home after his father beat him and broke his nose. He lived on the streets of Lewiston and often crashed on friends' couches for a couple of years before earning a living shining shoes, washing dishes at a restaurant, and haling boxes for a local truck driver. 

""I had a very, very, rough upbringing as a youth. We were in welfare, we were in poverty,"" he said.

LePage, speaking in the church where he was baptized and sought refuge during his family troubles, told Fox News, ""It feels good coming in this building. This was a special building. A couple of nuns and priests were really helpful in my upbringing.""

He went on to graduate from high school, and with financial help from friends, attended and graduated from college.

He later enjoyed success as a businessman, including greatly expanding Marden's Surplus and Salvage, a Maine-based discount store chain.

Years later, he ventured into politics, winning election to the Waterville city council and later serving as the city's mayor before winning statewide office in 2010.

The former governor says his rough childhood has influenced his political life in a way that not many other politicians can understand.

And he lamented, ""Unfortunately, the mentality in the current society is not to help people get out of poverty, but it's to keep them in poverty.""

""I want to help get them out of poverty,"" he said. ""I think there are so many programs that we can institute that will elevate people in poverty, rather than keep them.""

Denmark Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Friday that ""you cannot spy against an ally"" in response to reports that the U.S. was gathering intelligence on Greenland, as U.S. President Donald Trump has continued to suggest purchasing the Arctic island.

""Cooperation about defense and deterrence and security in the northern part of Europe is getting more and more important,"" Frederiksen told The Associated Press. ""Of course, you cannot spy against an ally.""

Frederiksen made the comments as Denmark and Greenland push back on Trump's desire to acquire the autonomous Danish territory, stressing that it is not for sale. Trump, however, has not ruled out taking it by military force despite Denmark being a NATO ally.

""I don't rule it out. I don't say I'm going to do it, but I don't rule out anything,"" Trump said earlier this week during an interview on NBC News' ""Meet the Press."" 

""We need Greenland very badly. Greenland is a very small amount of people, which we'll take care of and we'll cherish them and all of that, but we need that for international security,"" he added.

The Danish prime minister's statement on Friday came the day after Denmark summoned the top American diplomat in the country for an explanation to a report from The Wall Street Journal about several high-ranking officials under the U.S. director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, directing intelligence agency heads to collect information on Greenland's independence movement and views about U.S. resource extraction on the island.

Acting head of the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen, Jennifer Hall Godfrey, met with Danish diplomat Jeppe Tranholm-Mikkelsen at the Danish Foreign Ministry, although details of the meeting were not disclosed.

Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told Greenland newspaper Sermitsiaq that the reports of U.S. espionage are unacceptable and disrespectful. 

Nielsen said last month that Greenland ""will never, ever be a piece of property that can be bought by just anyone"" and that ""the talks from the United States have not been respectful.""

Gabbard's office released a statement saying she had made three ""criminal"" referrals to the U.S. Justice Department over intelligence community leaks in response to the report from The Wall Street Journal, which cited two sources familiar with the matter.

""The Wall Street Journal should be ashamed of aiding deep state actors who seek to undermine the President by politicizing and leaking classified information,"" Gabbard said. ""They are breaking the law and undermining our nation's security and democracy. Those who leak classified information will be found and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry discusses the Democratic Party's support of open borders and what it means for their future political viability on ‘The Will Cain Show.'

Texas lawmakers are charging ahead with what they call the nation's strongest legislative effort yet to block hostile foreign powers from purchasing land in the Lone Star State. 

Championed by Republican state Rep. Cole Hefner and state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, Senate Bill 17 (SB17) is designed to stop governments and entities tied to countries like China, Iran, North Korea and Russia from gaining a foothold on Texas soil.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Hefner described SB17 as ""model legislation"" aimed at shutting down land purchases that pose a national security threat. 

""This bill is about actions and affiliations, not race, not nationality,"" Hefner said. ""If you're acting on behalf of a hostile foreign adversary, we're going to take that land back.""

The bill is in direct response to real-world events. 

Hefner cited the 2021 case of a retired Chinese general acquiring over 140,000 acres near Laughlin Air Force Base. 

""We've [also] seen the attempt of foreign actors or hostile foreign adversaries to buy land close to food processing plants,"" Hefner said. ""And it's just something that we have found the more we dig into it, the more we find that there's a lot of things we don't know and a lot of vulnerabilities that are out there.""

The bill prohibits entities and individuals affiliated with governments designated as national security threats, based on the U.S. Director of National Intelligence's annual assessments, from purchasing real estate if those purchases pose risks to public health or safety. 

The law empowers the state's attorney general to investigate, block and even reverse such land deals through court-ordered receivership.

Under SB17, ""real property"" includes agricultural, commercial, industrial, and residential land as well as mines, minerals, and timber. The law includes key exemptions for U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, and property intended as a personal homestead.

""The strong points of our bill is that it can apply to anyone if we can prove they're acting as an agent,"" said Hefner. ""So even if they're from a friendly country, but they're actually on behalf of a foreign adversary, then they will be subject to the bill.""

The bill gives the attorney general investigative powers, and authority to appoint receivers to manage or sell properties acquired in violation of the law.

Hefner pushed back hard on critics who claim the bill is xenophobic. ""This has nothing to do with skin color or ethnicity,"" he said. ""It's about protecting Texans and Americans from foreign espionage and influence.""

He also stressed that SB17 should not be seen as a partisan move. ""It shouldn't be a partisan issue. This is about national security. This is about keeping our citizens safe,"" said Hefner. ""It's not about Republican or Democrat, it's not liberal or conservative. It is just taking care of our people. 

""And I believe that's the, you know, the number one responsibility of the government is to make sure that people can live free and safe in their state.""

SB17 is set to take effect Sept. 1. Hefner said he hopes the legislation sparks a nationwide effort. 

""We need to wake up,"" he said. ""This is about securing the homeland, not playing politics.""Fox News Digital's Nick Butler contributed to this report.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., discusses how Democrats are lashing out at DOGE for revealing wasteful federal spending and fraud on ‘Hannity.'

Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a top House ally of President Donald Trump and a MAGA firebrand with a national following, is passing on a 2026 Senate run.

The three-term conservative lawmaker who represents a solidly red district in northwest Georgia, in a lengthy statement announcing her decision that was posted to social media on Friday night, took aim at Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Ossoff, a top GOP target whom Republicans view as extremely vulnerable in next year's midterm elections.

But Greene saved much of her venom for fellow Republicans, many of whom feared a polarizing campaign if Greene became the party's 2026 nominee in Georgia, and for the institution of the Senate itself.

""Someone once said, ‘The Senate is where good ideas go to die.' They were right. That's why I'm not running,"" Greene wrote as she announced her decision.

And Greene argued, ""Here's the hard truth: the Senate doesn't work. It's designed to obstruct the will of the people and protect the Uniparty's grip on power. Nearly everything requires 60 votes to pass, and even when we have a majority, a pack of Republican Senators always votes ""no"" on the bills that matter most.""

FIRST ON FOX: REPUBLICAN LAUNCHES SECOND STRAIGHT BID TO FLIP DEMOCRAT-HELD SENATE SEAT IN KEY BATTLEGROUND

Greene's announcement came four days after two-term Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who was the National Republican Senatorial Committee's top recruit in battleground Georgia, revealed that he would also pass on a Senate bid.

The popular conservative governor, who is term-limited and prevented from seeking re-election in 2026, was the GOP's dream candidate to take on Ossoff, as Republicans aim to expand their 53-47 Senate majority in next year's elections.

ONLY ON FOX NEWS: SENATE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CHAIR REVEALS HOW MANY SEATS HE'S AIMING FOR IN 2026

Greene, in her statement, claimed, ""Beating Jon Ossoff? That would be easy. He's a silver-spoon progressive who's never held a real job or worried about putting a roof over his family's head.""

""So, Jon Ossoff, you can stop with the fundraising emails and campaign ads claiming I'm your opponent. I'm not running,"" she added.

While criticizing Ossoff, Greene turned up the volume on her own party, including ""the same elites who scoffed at me when I first ran for Congress in 2020.""

""Most elected Republicans, propped up by consultants and rich donors, fail to deliver on their campaign promises. Why? Because their donors and handlers don't want change. They want to protect their own interests, not yours,"" Greene charged.

She took aim at ""the Republicans who see Trump as a speed bump,"" and argued that ""polling has become so dishonest that most people barely pay attention to it anymore. Voters are sick of the consultants who keep getting rich whether we win or lose.""

Greene described herself as ""effective, fearless, and relentless, not because I serve the Republican Party, but because I serve the American people.""

But she added that ""I won't fight for a team that refuses to win, that protects its weakest players, and that undermines the very people it's supposed to serve… To the elite retreaters, the consultants, and the establishment: consider this your warning.""

In the wake of Kemp's announcement, GOP Rep. Buddy Carter, who represents coastal Georgia, launched a Senate campaign this week. Other Georgia Republicans expressing interest in running are Reps. Mike Collins and Rich McCormick, state Insurance Commissioner John King, state Agriculture Commissioner Tyler Harper, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and State Sen. Greg Dolezal.

Georgia-based Republican consultants tell Fox News they expect a crowded and competitive primary.

Greene, earlier this year, said that she was also considering a run for Georgia governor. And in her statement, she didn't rule out a gubernatorial run in the race to succeed Kemp.

Senior Department of Defense leaders in both the Biden and Trump administrations agree that the Chinese Communist Party poses the greatest threat to the United States. One senator has made it his personal mission to get the military to back that rhetoric with action.

Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) brings up Russian and Chinese aggression in both the aerial and maritime domains off Alaska's coasts in every Armed Services Committee hearing, whether it's for the confirmations of military civilian appointees or annual hearings from combatant commanders.

He's pushing relevant military leaders to reopen a naval base in the Aleutian Islands that closed about three decades ago, and to put more resources across Alaska.

“This is part of a broader strategic repository that our military needs to really think hard about, and in the Indo-Pacific, to be honest, their strategic thinking has been lazy,” he told the Washington Examiner.

Naval Air Facility Adak, located on Adak Island, is so far west, it's approximately 1,200 miles southwest of Anchorage and about 1,000 miles west of Hawaii. The islands are much further west than any other state within the United States, making it the closest point between the United States and Russia and China.

The Navy is preparing a report detailing the possible reopening of the base, while Sullivan has received public confirmation from the commanders of U.S. Northern Command and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, the relevant combatant commands, that they support the reopening of the base that closed in 1997.

Navy officials recently visited the base, which originally opened in May 1942 about six months after the Japanese bombings of Pearl Harbor, and they “had a low, medium and high restructuring plan that they had sketched out and each one of those has more capabilities [than the last],” Sullivan said.

At its peak, there were 90,000 troops mobilized to the Aleutian Islands during World War II. U.S. forces on the island were able to launch a successful offensive against the Japanese held islands of Kiska and Attu in 1943.

“Adak is towards the end of the Aleutian archipelago, the stretch of islands that extend in a long arc from the Alaskan coast,” Dr. Joshua Tallis, an analyst with CNA, an independent not-for-profit analytical organization, told the Washington Examiner. “The island and its airfield played a role in World War II as a base from which to attack Japanese forces in the Aleutians.”

The senator said the base has three piers, two 8,000-foot runways, a big hangar, and can store 22 million gallons of fuel even if it “looks a little bit run down.”

“Opening [Naval Air Facility] Adak as a fully operational base would greatly facilitate our ability to operate and respond quickly to threats in both the Arctic and Pacific regions,” a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokesperson told the Washington Examiner. “The base occupies a unique strategic positioning, simultaneously abetting the Pacific and Arctic regions.”

“U.S. forces use Naval Air Facility Adak during training and exercises to enhance our ability to conduct operations from an austere environment, increasing the force's dynamism and ability to rapidly adapt to changing operational landscapes,” the spokesperson added.

The Aleutian Islands are a chain of 14 main islands and more than 50 smaller ones off Alaska's southwestern coast.

“It is a further western point which would enable, along with Eareckson, an opportunity to gain time and distance on any force capability that's looking to penetrate,” INDOPACOM Commander Adm. Samuel Paparo said during a recent hearing in front of the Armed Services Committee, referencing Eareckson Air Station, which is also located in the Alaskan Aleutian Islands.

Tallis downplayed Adak's location as a maritime resupply route due to the lack of “necessary supporting infrastructure,” but noted the base's “real potential value is in staging aircraft, and for the Navy that specifically means maritime patrol aircraft.”

Sullivan warned during a committee hearing that a Chinese shipping company, which he suspects is a front for the government, has repeatedly reached out to the Aleut Corporation to lease Adak naval base now that it's vacant.

“It's a Chinese shipping company that is certainly, in my view, a front company for the PLA. How embarrassing would it be to the Pentagon or the Navy — these guys would never do it; the Aleut Corporation is all patriotic — but let's assume they weren't, and somehow they signed a 100-year lease with a Chinese shipping company that is always out there looking at Adak,” he told Paparo.

The commander responded, “Imagine having the Belt and Road Initiative include Alaska,” referring to China's international exploitative strategy to build foreign partnerships through infrastructure agreements that benefit Beijing primarily, often at the expense of the nation that makes the deal.

A spokesperson for the Aleut Corporation confirmed to the Washington Examiner that they “do receive inquiries from Chinese shipping companies” to lease the base. “I don't know if it's as routine as annually, but I can confirm there have been repeated asks.”

The U.S. military has tracked a more closely aligned Russian and Chinese military, with the two countries increasing their joint operations in the Pacific and Arctic regions. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to strengthen their strategic partnership during the latter's visit to Moscow to celebrate Victory Day on May 8.

Alaska proper poses its own strategic significance with the 49th state representing the furthest north part of the country, and the closest point to the Arctic. The melting ice caps have created new strategic transportation routes that are now being contested. Eight countries are considered to have claims in the Arctic — the U.S., six other NATO members, and Russia — while a ninth, China, has unilaterally declared itself to be a “near-Arctic country.”

“Over the last year, we've seen a significance increase in both Russian air and maritime activity in the vicinity of Alaska, both in the Bering [Strait] and up in the Arctic.” Gen. Gregory Guillot told the Senate Armed Services Committee in February, “I do think that [China will] increase their presence both independently and as well as increased cooperation with the Russians in the air, in the maritime, and undersea.”

Russian and Chinese aircrafts have increased their incursions into Alaska's Air Defense Identification Zone, which is where sovereign airspace ends and is a defined stretch of international airspace that requires aircraft to identify itself in the interest of national security, to levels “not seen since before the Russian invasion of Ukraine” in 2022, according to NORTHCOM Commander Gen. Gregory Guillot.

The Russian and Chinese naval drills have also violated Alaska's EEZ, or Exclusive Economic Zone, which is the maritime area beyond a country's territorial waters where that country maintains special rights for exploration and exploitation of natural resources.

“Over the past twelve months, NORAD and NORTHCOM intercepted joint Russian and Chinese bombers off the Alaska coast, tracked Russian surface vessels off both coasts, detected and assessed numerous North Korean missile launches, tracked multiple Chinese dual-use military and research vessels in the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean,” Guillot added. “Last year, we saw the most Chinese vessels off the coast of Alaska than we've ever seen and simultaneously.”

Each time an adversary's military crosses into the U.S.'s EEZ or AZID, U.S. forces intercept them, though those missions can be dangerous, especially in the instances where the incursion is far from where U.S. personnel are located across Alaska.

XI AND PUTIN CALL TRUMP'S GOLDEN DOME ‘DEEPLY DESTABILIZING'

“Every single time one of these Russian bear bomber task forces or the joint Russia-Chinese task forces come into our AZID, every single time our military base in Alaska goes and intercepts them. These are F-35s, F-22s, and F-16 [aircrafts]. They do such a good job, they're so professional that it's almost like people yawn,” Sullivan said, noting that those pilots often have to fly hundreds of miles before they even intercept the aircraft. “That's a risky mission and what we need is more infrastructure to support their base.”

A major warning from military officials during these hearings is that the U.S. is seeing additional cooperation between U.S. adversaries China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran. Each of the four have strengths and weaknesses in their militaries and the officials stressed that they could help advance each other's capabilities.

“It's a transactional symbiosis where each state fulfills the other state's weakness to mutual benefit of each state,” Paparo said. “China's unprecedented aggression and military modernization poses a serious threat to the homeland, our allies, and our partners.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

VATICAN CITY — Pope Leo XIV is just over a day into his pontificate and is already capturing style critics' attention with his return to form on papal aesthetics.

It might seem silly to fuss over the pope's image. The bishop of Rome's first and foremost responsibility is helping the world to find salvation through Jesus Christ, not strutting the catwalk.

There is legitimacy in preventing robes and rings from becoming idols that overshadow the spiritual priorities of the office. However, when one's life is spent almost entirely in the public eye, how one is presented ceases to be superfluous.

There is a reason popes dress in robes and cassocks, not polo shirts and blue jeans. Appearances send a message.

When he first emerged on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday, one message was immediately clear — Leo values tradition. He appeared in the same white cassock, red mozzetta, and papal stole combo worn by most modern popes but abandoned by his predecessor, the late Pope Francis.

Francis, known for his rejection of ornate clothing and accessories during his reign, was a singular personality in the Vatican. His appreciation for simplicity came from his lifelong embrace of material poverty, adhering to the Jesuit vow of poverty, admired by many who believed it conveyed a sense of closeness with the world's poor.

Throughout his reign, he rarely wore anything more ornate than his plain white cassock with a bespoke fascia around his waist. He wore black orthopedic shoes instead of the traditional crimson papal slippers. 

On cold days, he opted for a plain white coat and similar scarf. He brought his own eyeglasses from home. His Casio wristwatch cost less than $15. 

Instead of residing in the luxurious papal accommodations enjoyed by pontiffs before him, Francis stayed in a modest Vatican guesthouse.

His disavowal of pomp was not for everyone. Some Catholics voiced a preference that the pope would maintain the same regalia as prior pontiffs. 

There were simple fashionistas among these critics, but others expressed a deeper consideration — that the individual man is obscured and minimized behind the beautiful wardrobe. The bespoke garments can paradoxically humble the person and emphasize his office instead.

There have been a few other notable fashion choices from Leo in his first 48 hours. He wears a gold pectoral cross that he received from his religious order, the Augustinians, when he became a cardinal. 

At his first Mass as pope on Thursday morning, he carried a gold ferula that was originally gifted to Pope Benedict.

He will also reportedly be moving into the Apostolic Palace, a sprawling residence immediately next to St. Peter's Basilica and decorated with centuries' worth of fine art and sculpture.

It's important to keep in mind that Leo's change in personal style from Francis is hardly a rebuke of the late Jesuit.

ROBERT PREVOST ELECTED FIRST AMERICAN PONTIFF: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT POPE LEO XIV

The pope paid direct tribute to Francis during his greeting to the public on Thursday and emphasized his continued support of the Francis-era “synodal church” philosophy.

Cuts to agencies that protect workers' lungs are going to result in the resurgence of a preventable illness.

A person who has severe silicosis has to fight for every breath. A short walk that should take just 20 minutes can take an hour. Climbing stairs, carrying groceries, and normal recreational activities are distant memories.

Silicosis is typically caused by years of breathing in silica dust at work, and can worsen even after work exposures stop. In recent years, after decades of inaction, the federal government finally took several important steps to reduce the incidence of this ancient and debilitating disease. Under the Trump administration, all that progress is going away, in but one example of the widespread destruction now taking place across the federal government.

Silicosis first caught the attention of the federal government in the early 1930s, when hundreds of workers hired by the chemical company Union Carbide and its subsidiary to drill a tunnel through a mountain of almost pure silica died of silicosis. Most of the workers were Black, and many were buried in unmarked graves. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's secretary of labor, Frances Perkins, issued a report on the widespread problem across factories and mines, informing businesses that control measures, “if conscientiously adopted and applied,” could prevent silicosis.

Perkins's report went mostly unheeded. For all of the 20th century and the early part of the 21st century, the government's silica-control standards failed to adequately protect workers and prevent workplace disease. Hundreds of workers employed in mines, foundries, and at construction sites developed silicosis, and some died from it. Many others died from lung cancer, also caused by silica exposure.

The 1970 law that established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) also launched a scientific-research agency, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), whose job included providing OSHA with recommendations for health standards. In 1974, NIOSH provided OSHA with strong evidence that its silica-exposure standard needed to be more stringent—that too many workers were being exposed to too much silica, and suffering greatly as a result. (One of us, David, ran OSHA for more than seven years during the Obama administration. The other, Gregory, led the NIOSH Division of Respiratory Disease Studies for 15 years and served as deputy assistant secretary  of labor in the Mine Safety and Health Administration [MSHA] for three years.)

OSHA's process for setting this sort of health standard is not known for its speed. OSHA started working on a strengthened silica standard in 1997 and finally issued new rules for general industry and construction 19 years later (while David was running the agency)—but, significantly, the agency didn't include mines and quarries, which are under the authority of MSHA, in the Department of Labor. Ever since, when workers face high levels of airborne silica, employers have been required to use engineering controls to reduce exposure; if airborne silica levels are still too high, employers must also provide workers with NIOSH-certified facemasks such as N95s (the N stands for “NIOSH”).

For many years, lung-disease experts employed in the congressionally mandated NIOSH Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program (CWHSP) provided medical testing and counseling to miners in an effort to identify workers who were showing early signs of lung disease, including silicosis. Under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, miners with a dust disease such as silicosis have the legal right to transfer to jobs with less dust exposure, and to have their exposure going forward monitored frequently. The chest X-ray readings of NIOSH's trained and certified experts help sick miners move to safer work areas, which may improve their prognosis.

Despite OSHA's new silica standard, MSHA's standard remained outdated, and more miners were getting sick, particularly younger miners. Risk has been driven up by changes in mining practices, such as longer hours, the mining of seams that have less coal and more silica, and the use of new mining equipment that generates more dust. MSHA started working on a new silica standard during the Obama administration, but that work was halted when the first Trump administration came into power in 2017. The agency restarted work when Joe Biden took office and last year finally issued a strengthened silica standard.

In the few months since the second Trump administration began, the federal government's efforts to control silicosis have been destroyed. Elon Musk's DOGE fired the entire CWHSP team and most of the NIOSH engineers, staff, and other scientists who are doing research to make mining less dangerous. The White House made clear that virtually all of NIOSH's functions are being permanently scrapped.

Additionally, in early April, the president signed four executive orders to promote the mining and use of coal. Then, days before MSHA's rule could go into effect, the new leadership at the Department of Labor “paused” enforcement, claiming that employers would have difficulty complying because NIOSH no longer has staff to certify the respirators and measurement devices necessary for implementing the policy.

Although the Trump administration has not announced major personnel cuts to OSHA yet, the agency's ability to prevent silicosis is under threat as well. DOGE has announced that 11 OSHA offices, along with 34 MSHA offices, will be closed, which will lead to fewer inspections, undoubtedly followed by more injuries and illnesses.

Even without these cuts, silicosis was already making a comeback, this time in a different industry: the fabrication and installation of artificial-stone kitchen countertops. In the Los Angeles area, more than 200 workers, almost all Latino immigrants, have developed silicosis; several have needed lung transplants. There are likely to be thousands more affected workers throughout the country, but the true number is unknown. Most of the workers in this industry are employed in small fabrication shops, and OSHA is so under-resourced and underpowered that it has had difficulty merely finding the shops where the work is being done.

Preventing silicosis is exactly the sort of essential public-health work that government employees perform with little or no recognition. When these policies work, lives are saved—invisibly, as no one can ever know who didn't get silicosis because of good regulation and enforcement. But soon enough, if the Trump administration's devastation of NIOSH, MSHA, and OSHA goes uncorrected, workers will certainly be getting silicosis because of inadequate public-health protections—and those losses will be quite visible, if not to the Trump administration then certainly to the people unfortunate enough to get sick.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Don't let polarization distract you from one of the most important issues the world faces.

by  Kelsey Piper

At the dawn of the Covid pandemic, I wrote a newsletter about the approaching virus that highlighted what I saw as the biggest risk: that the question of whether to take Covid seriously would become a partisan political issue. To tackle something this big, I wrote, we'd have to all be on the same page.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

As a country, we have vastly more capacity to grapple with difficult challenges and complex tradeoffs when those issues haven't been subsumed into partisan politics, so I was relieved at the time that Covid hadn't become a partisan issue. It seemed to me that we could handle it as long as we worked hard to keep things that way.

That didn't work out that way, of course. 

I've had this story on my mind because, over the last few years, I've watched as the rapidly falling rates of family formation in the US — and much of the rest of the world — go from a niche issue to a mainstream issue to an increasingly partisan issue. And that stands to be a tragedy, just as Covid's politicization was a tragedy. 

Ensuring that our economy and society support people in deciding whether they want children, and the ability to have as many children as they want, is way too important to surrender to the culture wars. And yet that's where we seem to be headed.

Just about everywhere you look, birth rates are collapsing. 

Many demographers thought that the global population would stabilize around mid-century. But that's now looking increasingly unlikely. Instead, the world's population is expected to actually start shrinking worldwide this century, potentially as soon as 2060.

You might wonder: What's the big deal? Wouldn't fewer people mean fewer demands on resources, more space and opportunity for everyone else?

But the economics of population don't work this way. An aging and shrinking population means a massive decrease in expected quality of life in the future. It means a smaller working population will be supporting a larger elderly population. It means there will be fewer people to do all of the things that don't technically need to be done, but that make life richer and more interesting. And a shrinking population doesn't represent a one-time adjustment, but a dimming state of affairs that will continue to degrade until something reverses it. 

Surely, though, this would still be better for the environment, right? No. Richer societies are better positioned to combat climate change, and while we have been headed in the right direction, with rich countries' per capita emissions falling rapidly over the last decade, that progress would be likely to reverse in a fiscally overburdened, rapidly shrinking society. In many ways, the most environmentally destructive civilizations in our history were the poorer, early industrial ones, and returning to that state shouldn't be heralded as a good sign for the environment.

But this looming demographic crisis, one every bit as real and serious as climate change itself, has been met so far with significant ambivalence, if not outright denial. 

Part of the reason is that many of us grew up being warned about the opposite scourge of overpopulation. And part of the reason is growing political polarization. 

As my colleagues Rachel Cohen and Anna North have written, there's been a surge of interest in falling birth rates on the right. Elon Musk tweets about it (and reportedly pays an enormous number of women to impregnate them); a Natalist Con in Austin recently featured some good, serious discussion of these issues, but also some fairly awful right-wing provocateurs. 

The significant right-wing interest in pronatalism has many liberals convinced it's a stalking horse for the end of women's rights, and not worth taking seriously except to rebut.

But this is simply wrong. I will never forgive Elon Musk for the damage he did to PEPFAR, but if he accurately says the sky is blue, that doesn't suddenly make it red. It makes no sense to refuse to participate in the conversation about one of the biggest issues of the next few decades because most, though not all, of the people currently talking about it have distasteful politics. Rather, that's all the more reason to talk about it.

One of the most important triumphs of the modern era is that, for the first time in history, people have meaningful control over when and whether they have children. That is a social good on which we absolutely shouldn't compromise. No one who doesn't want children should have to have them, and any pronatalist who makes anything like that argument should be ignored.

But there are a lot of policies around population that add to freedom, will make people's lives materially better, and give them more choices that align with other liberal priorities and would likely increase birth rates. 

Americans right now have fewer children than they say they want, and figuring out a way to close that gap would all by itself produce a more stable population. No single policy is a silver bullet — not even close — and the whole suite of them would be very expensive. But it arguably wouldn't be as expensive as the costs of failing to address this, and marginal efforts do produce marginal improvements.

And there are lots of potential progressive wins that could be connected to pronatalism: less expensive housing, universal pre-K, support for new parents, better schools, and more affordable healthcare. If a shared interest in helping more people start families helps build a broader coalition for that very progressive-friendly political work, that's a good thing.

Beyond any specific policy prescription, though, I think population is a very real problem, and it is corrosive to pretend otherwise. A largely stable population would be okay. A population that shrinks somewhat and then stabilizes would also be fine. A population halving every 50 years is absolutely not going to be fine. 

We should all be proactively working to ensure that does not happen, and that means not ceding one of the most important issues we face to the worst people in politics.

Marco Rubio's four jobs, explained the best we can.

by  Devan Schwartz and  Sean Rameswaram

Perhaps you've heard about wearing multiple hats at work, but four? It might be too many for most people, but not Marco Rubio. As the New York Times put it this month, he's become the “secretary of everything” for the Trump administration: secretary of state, interim national security adviser, acting USAID administrator (albeit for a gutted agency), and acting archivist of the United States at the National Archives and Records Administration.

Put another way, if the Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency asked Rubio what he accomplished this week, it would be a long email. And the former Republican senator from Florida is proving to have better survival instincts in Trump world than some observers expected. 

Nahal Toosi, a columnist and senior foreign affairs correspondent at Politico, is one of those Rubio skeptics. She predicted in January that Rubio wouldn't last long in the second Trump administration, perhaps less than a year. But she's less sure now, as Rubio emerges from the administration's first 100 days with a longer list of titles than he began with.

Toosi spoke with Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram about Rubio's growing portfolio, how he's juggling it all, and how he's accommodated himself to a second Trump administration, including on big issues like immigration and foreign aid. Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get your podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

How did Marco Rubio become so important at work?

He abandoned everything, or much of, what he has stood for in the past, endeared himself to Trump, supported the president vocally and through policy changes, and earned the president's trust. 

I will also say it's hard to get into the Trump circle. There's not a lot of people who meet the loyalty tests. Rubio has proven that he can do that. The reason that it's important to point this out is because when he took the initial position of secretary of state, many people viewed him as one of the weakest in Trump's orbit. I wrote an entire column about how all these people in town were saying, He is not going to last very long. He won't last even six months as scretary of state. 

The fact that he has climbed the ranks and taken all these positions and earned the president's trust in such a way — that is really remarkable, but it goes to show how unrecognizable he is compared to what Marco Rubio was five, 10 years ago.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

Marco Rubio's been around a long time. When you hear candidate Donald Trump talking about draining the Washington swamp, it's people like Marco Rubio. There were reports that he was asking President Biden for more funding for USAID before he became one of the faces of the elimination of USAID. He's not exactly MAGA. Are you saying that there hasn't been much tension between Rubio and Trump? 

I wouldn't say [Rubio is] a traditional Republican. He came in on a wave of reactionary [sentiment against] the establishment. But he over time established his bona fides in the Senate as a hawkish Republican: pro-human rights, pro-democracy promotion, definitely pro-humanitarian assistance, the type of guy who supported Ukraine, wants to be tough on dictatorships around the world, including Iran.

But I would say he also has proven to be a very flexible type of politician over the last several years. He has moderated his positions. My understanding is he's gone out and learned a lot about the American heartland. But now that he has joined the Trump team, he has really gone to the MAGA world, to the point where even far-right influencers like Laura Loomer are now praising Marco Rubio.

And I imagine much of that acceleration has happened via his initial job, secretary of state? 

Yes. And part of the reason that that has happened is because he's used that perch to agree very vocally with a lot of Trump policies, right? In defending, for instance, President Trump's takedown of Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy in that famous Oval Office meeting.

But wasn't Rubio one of the only Cabinet members in that meeting who looked uncomfortable? 

He looked like he was sinking into the couch. But afterward he got on TV, he went public, he defended the president. He realized immediately, Okay, I have to speak out, or it's gonna look like I'm not supportive of President Trump, right? And I have to be subordinate to him. Look, another area where he's been astonishingly pro-Trump is the anti-immigration stuff. 

“He's going to be responsible for any major crisis that happens.”

This is really remarkable for Rubio because he has often touted his own family's immigrant story. They're from Cuba. And now he is seemingly gleefully stripping students of their visas and negotiating deals that are sending people to a prison in El Salvador without them getting proper hearings in court. And he's even suggesting he'll defy the judges if they request information in support of Trump.

Some of these things you think, Wow, does he have to go this far? Obviously it's working for him in terms of surviving under Trump. But who knows, in a month from now Marco Rubio may be out of favor. A lot of people thought that Mike Waltz, the national security adviser who was pushed out, would last longer than he did. Now that Rubio is actually in charge of these key portfolios — national security adviser and the State Department — in a way he has a bigger target on his back too. Because he's going to be responsible for any major crisis that happens. 

This is the job he most recently acquired, Donald Trump's national security adviser. What exactly does that entail? 

The national security adviser is based at the White House, and they are like a point guard. They keep an eye on what all the agencies are thinking. They coordinate and they bring together options for the president when it comes to foreign policy and national security issues. Now, that's if they do it in the way that's considered proper, which is to be an honest broker, to be the guy that says, here's what State is thinking. Here's what DOD is thinking, here's what the CIA wants. 

A lot of national security advisers acquire more power than that. They very much have their own points of view. They do their own negotiations. They rival other people in the administration for power. That's always caused a bit of tension in past administrations. So we definitely could have seen Rubio at odds with a national security adviser in the future, but now it would be like being at odds with himself.

Is there any conflict there? Does being Trump's national security adviser come at the expense of his other roles, especially secretary of state? 

One of the key mysteries right now is how is he going to do both jobs at the same time. And remember, he has two other jobs, but let's put those aside.

How he splits his time is something that's going to be very important to watch. The only person who's done this in the past is Henry Kissinger. And that was in the '70s. And back then, the world was, to be honest, not as complicated. Not that it was great, but it was not what we have now.

What do you think he's excited about accomplishing as our secretary of state, if not our national security adviser, our chief archivist, and the head of USAID?

If he survives in the roles for several months or over a year, that is an accomplishment. Under President Trump, survival is difficult. He has had a constant turnover in the past. In terms of other accomplishments, if this administration were to strike important deals with Iran, say over its nuclear program, or bring about a peace between Russia and Ukraine, these are things that they can point to as accomplishments.

I do want to point out, there is another major player in terms of foreign policy right now, and that's Steve Witkoff. He's a special envoy for the president. He's actually the lead on portfolios like Iran and Ukraine. But Rubio can very much have a major role in those as well. And ultimately the president is the one who's going to take the credit for the accomplishments and knowing how Rubio is operating, he will definitely cede the limelight to the president.

His views on immigration may point to an early clash with the Trump administration.

by  Amanda Lewellyn and  Noel King

Pope Leo XIV, formerly known as Robert Prevost, is the first American pontiff. 

He was elected on Thursday, less than three weeks after the death of Pope Francis, and his elevation immediately made history. Leo grew up in Chicago, majored in math at Villanova University, and spent decades serving the Catholic Church in Peru. 

Significantly, Pope Leo is also the first pontiff to hail from the Augustinian order, which was founded in 1244.

The Augustinians are a mendicant order, which means they rely largely on charitable donations for their needs. They prioritize community and missionary work, with a special emphasis on serving the poor and the weak. 

Those beliefs may have influenced Leo's decision, while he was still a cardinal, to share critiques of the Trump administration online, particularly on issues of immigration — which puts him at odds with another prominent American Catholic: Vice President JD Vance.

In a January interview with Fox News, Vance used his faith as a justification for the Trump administration's America First agenda. “You love your family and then you love your neighbor, and then you love your community, and then you love your fellow citizens in your own country, and then after that, you can focus [on] and prioritize the rest of the world,” Vance said. 

Shortly after that interview, Leo shared a link to a National Catholic Reporter article titled “JD Vance Is Wrong: Jesus Doesn't Ask Us to Rank Our Love for Others.” 

Today, Explained wanted to get to know this new pope and better understand why the conclave selected him. So we called up Terence Sweeney. He's an assistant teaching professor in the humanities department and honors program at Villanova University — not only the pope's alma mater (class of '77) but also the only Augustinian university in the United States. 

His conversation with Noel King, edited for length and clarity, is below. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts and Spotify.

How surprised were you [by Pope Leo's selection]? 

I was both surprised and not surprised. I've been talking about him with friends and students for the past couple of weeks. Yesterday morning, I popped into the office of Father Allen, an Augustinian on campus, and I said, ‘Are we gonna have an Augustinian pope?' And he said he didn't think so. 

Sure enough, a few hours later, I got a text message from my friend who said, ‘You called it.' 

But at the same time, I was very surprised. I was hopeful for him, but he's an American, and traditionally, that's seen as, ‘Oh, it won't happen.' So I both kind of called it and was totally shocked.

So tell us who he is. Who is Robert Prevost, or Pope Leo XIV?

Prevost is a kid who grew up in Chicago and went to Villanova University. He had met Augustinians as a young man and joined the order just after college. Maybe most notably, [he] then proceeded to spend most of his life as a priest and then a bishop in the missions in Peru. He could have gotten assigned to a nice parish in a wealthier part of the United States, but instead, he went to Peru to be with the poor, to do work there, to do ministry there, and I think that's in many ways the heart of who he is.

You can think about it like this: I have a pretty cushy spot at Villanova. I have a house. It's comfortable. To suddenly shift gears to a totally new culture, learning the language fully in a place that maybe doesn't have as many perks as an American suburban parish might, I think that's a real sign of wanting to be with those on the margins of global power and economics. 

I don't think we've had a pope in centuries who has had this experience of working in the missions. We've had pastor popes, scholar popes, diplomat popes. But a pope who spent most of his life in a poor part of a country doing missionary work — I don't even know if we've ever had one.

When Pope Francis died, there was a big conversation about whether the church would pick somebody who was more traditional or who was viewed as more progressive, the way Pope Francis was. What kind of choice is Pope Leo XIV? Where does he fall on that spectrum?

In some ways, like Pope Francis, he kind of throws us off of these spectrums.

He took the name Leo, which is a pretty traditional papal name. He's the 14th, right? He's not the first. He's closely identifying with both the first Pope Leo, Pope Saint Leo the Great, and Pope Leo XIII, who are richly part of the tradition. Leo XIII is notable for his work on something called Catholic social thought: what the church brings to the questions of economics and justice and politics. And that has tended to be something that what we call progressive Catholics have really centered on. 

I think it was also notable that the language of his first address to the people in St. Peter's Square was richly tied in with Pope Francis: He talked about bridge-building and peace being with all of you. And I think there are some signs that he wants to carry on a lot of what Pope Francis did, but maybe make more connections, we might say, between the kind of Pope Francis side of the church and the Pope Benedict side.

You've mentioned several times that he is an Augustinian. What is an Augustinian, exactly?

The Augustinians are a group of friars. They were founded in 1244, and they're grounded in three principles: living in community, a really strong sense that wherever we go, we go together. [A] deep sense of the heart. If you ever see an icon of St. Augustine, he's often holding a heart. [That symbolizes] the sense that what we need to do is make connections with other people in their hearts. And a really strong call to the mission to go out. The original Augustinians often went into cities and various places to be with people where they were. 

After Robert Prevost was chosen yesterday, immediately it came to the surface that he had expressed some opinions on immigration. I saw people — and you had written about this in the past — drawing a line between the Augustinian tradition and the current controversies that the United States is facing over immigration. What is the Augustinian position on immigration?

Fundamentally, one of the most important parts of being an Augustinian is sometimes called the order of loves. It's this idea that our hearts need to grow. Our hearts can get very narrow. We can fall in love only with ourselves. So we need to find a way to have our hearts expand to make room for God, who is infinite. When you make room for God, you make room for everyone, particularly for those in need. One of the big tasks of his pontificate for Americans — for all kinds of Catholics, all kinds of people — is helping us broaden our hearts.

Notably, we have a vice president who's Catholic. JD Vance has spoken about the order of loves. You can think about what he said as having a lot of the right words, but getting the tune wrong. He described one of the very important ideas that the order of loves teaches us: that we rightly prioritize people who are closer to us. He's emphasizing that and saying: Americans rightly prioritize Americans. But he's missing the point of the order of loves, that [the heart] was supposed to expand, to go outward. Whereas Vance seems to be talking about it as a way of retracting and going inward.

Pope Francis challenged him on this. Then Prevost retweeted an article in America magazine about challenging Vance on this. That's an early indication that he, as pope, is going to very much stand with a broadening of our loves.

It is very 2025 for a new pope to be retweeting criticism of a vice president. What do you think it tells us about Pope Leo XIV?

I think that he sees his office as a bishop, and now as bishop of Rome, as a prophetic one. He has a task of prophetic witness. That prophetic witness is going to speak about a lot of things. He is going to speak about the environment. He will definitely speak about immigration. He is going to speak about abortion. He is going to speak about a number of things that are going to throw American binaries off. 

We have to keep in mind that he's a profoundly pro-refugee and pro-life pope, and something I share with him, the sense that the love that we broaden out is meant to go particularly to the smallest and the most forgotten. And I think he sees that, and I think he's going to speak in that prophetic witness as did the popes before him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Mark Zuckerberg says AI could soon do the work of some engineers at Meta. Here's how AI is shaking up other Big Tech firms.","https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-ai-startup-company-with-small-team-2025-5","Sat, 10 May 2025 08:45:00 GMT","

Mark Zuckerberg said today's founders and entrepreneurs should take advantage of the technology he couldn't when he was building Facebook two decades ago.

""If you were starting whatever you're starting 20 years ago, you would have had to have built up all these different competencies inside your company, and now there are just great platforms to do it,"" the Meta CEO said said at the Stripe Sessions conference this week.

Zuckerberg says using technologies like AI can help today's founders ""focus on the core idea"" of a company.

""I think that this is just going to lead to much better quality stuff that gets created around the world because now you're just being able to have these, like, very small talent-dense teams that are, like, passionate about an idea,"" Zuckerberg said.

Zuckerberg has talked about the effect of AI on much larger companies, including Meta, on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast in January.

""Probably in 2025, we at Meta, as well as the other companies that are basically working on this, are going to have an AI that can effectively be a sort of midlevel engineer that you have at your company that can write code,"" he said.

Of course, LLMs have been known to have troubling hallucinations at times, and companies could see negative repercussions from hollowing out their mid-level engineer ranks.

""Ease of use is a double-edged sword,"" Harry Law, an AI researcher at the University of Cambridge, previously told BI. ""Beginners can make fast progress, but it might prevent them from learning about system architecture or performance.""

Using AI too extensively in coding could also make scaling or debugging difficult, he warned.

""Security vulnerabilities may also slip through without proper code review,"" he said.

Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan said in a CNBC interview in March that ""vibe coding"" will help startups stay leaner by allowing smaller teams of engineers to produce work that would otherwise take a team of 50 to 100 developers.

""I mean, the wild thing is people are getting to a million dollars to 10 million dollars a year revenue with under 10 people, and that's really never happened before in early stage venture,"" he said.

""You can just talk to the large language models and they will code entire apps,"" Tan continued. ""You don't have to hire someone to do it.""

Vibe coding, the hot new buzzword in the valley, was coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy in a post on X in February.

""There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding,' where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists,"" Karpathy wrote in his post. ""I'm building a project or webapp, but it's not really coding — I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.""

Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke recently told managers that before asking to hire someone new, they must prove AI couldn't do the job better alone.

In March, Anthropic cofounder and CEO Dario Amodei said AI could be ""writing essentially all of the code"" in 12 months' time.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in the company's third-quarter earnings call in October that more than 25% of the new code created at the company is generated by AI and then checked by employees.

Pichai said using AI to code boosted the company's ""productivity and efficiency.""

""This helps our engineers do more and move faster,"" Pichai said.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in early February that he expected software engineering would look ""very different"" at the end of 2025.

The use of AI at large tech companies to aid, expedite, or outright do their employees' work dovetails with the industry's growing focus on efficiency in recent years.

Zuckerberg proclaimed 2023 a ""year of efficiency"" for the company, which has seen several rounds of mass layoffs in recent years. Several of its peers have also slashed thousands of jobs as they focus on flattening their organizational structures and pushing out their ""lowest performers.""

Over the last several years, the world has watched as China edges close to or past the technological frontier in more and more areas. Earlier this year, US investors were jolted even further when DeepSeek's AI model proved to be close to the state of the art American models. So what is the process by which China actually develops new tech? Why has it worked out so well? And how do priorities set by President Xi Jinping actually get transmitted to researchers and businesses? On this episode, we speak to Kaiser Kuo, the host of the Sinica podcast. He discusses the cultural dimension of tariffs, and what he sees as a fundamentally different attitude towards the benefits of technological progress in China vs. what is seen in the US.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

As negotiations ramp up for President Donald Trump's tax agenda, there are key issues to watch, according to policy experts.   

The House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees taxes, released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill on Friday evening. However, the bill could change significantly before the final vote. The full committee will debate and advance this legislation on Tuesday.

With control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, Republican lawmakers can pass Trump's package without Democratic support via a process known as ""reconciliation,"" which bypasses the Senate filibuster with a simple majority vote.

But reconciliation involves multiple steps, and the proposals must fit within a limited budget framework. That could be tricky given competing priorities, experts say.

""The narrow [Republican] majority in the House is going to make that process very difficult"" because a handful of votes can block the bill, said Alex Muresianu, senior policy analyst at the Tax Foundation.

Plus, some lawmakers want a ""more fiscally responsible package,"" which could impact individual provisions, according to Shai Akabas, vice president of economic policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center.

As negotiations continue, here are some key tax proposals that could impact millions of Americans.

One of Trump's goals is to fully extend the trillions in tax breaks he enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, in 2017.

This legislation brought sweeping changes for individuals and businesses, including lower tax brackets, bigger standard deductions, a more generous child tax credit, a higher estate and gift tax exemption and a 20% deduction for pass-through businesses, among other provisions.   

Without TCJA extensions, more than 60% of taxpayers could see higher taxes in 2026, according to the Tax Foundation.

The preliminary House Ways and Means text includes some temporary and permanent enhancements beyond the TCJA. These include boosts to the standard deduction, child tax credit, tax bracket inflation adjustments, the estate tax exemption and pass-through business deduction, among others.

Some lawmakers are also pushing for bigger tax breaks than what's currently offered via the TCJA provisions.

""The child tax credit is one that we're watching very closely,"" Akabas said. ""There's a lot of bipartisan agreement on preserving and hopefully expanding that.""  

TCJA temporarily increased the maximum child tax credit to $2,000 from $1,000 per child under age 17, and boosted eligibility. These changes are scheduled to sunset after 2025.

The House in February 2024 passed a bipartisan bill to expand the child tax credit, which would have boosted access and refundability. The bill didn't clear the Senate, but Republicans expressed interest in revisiting the issue.  

The early House Ways and Means text proposes expanding the maximum child tax credit to $2,500 per child for four years starting in 2025.

Another TCJA provision — the $10,000 limit on the deduction for state and local taxes, known as ""SALT"" — was added to the 2017 legislation to help fund other tax breaks. That provision will also expire after 2025.

Before the change, filers who itemized tax breaks could claim an unlimited deduction for SALT. But the so-called alternative minimum tax reduced the benefit for some higher earners. 

Repealing the SALT cap has been a priority for certain lawmakers from high-tax states like California, New Jersey and New York. In a policy reversal, Trump has also voiced support for a more generous SALT deduction. 

""If you raise the cap, the people who benefit the most are going to be upper-middle-income,"" since lower earners typically don't itemize tax deductions, Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, previously told CNBC.

The SALT deduction was absent from the preliminary House Ways and Means text. But Congressional negotiations are ongoing.

On top of TCJA extensions, Trump has also recently renewed calls for additional tax breaks he pitched on the campaign trail, including no tax on tips, tax-free overtime pay and tax-exempt Social Security benefits. These ideas were not yet included in the early House Ways and Means text.  

However, there are lingering questions about the specifics of these provisions, including possible guardrails to prevent abuse, experts say.

For example, you could see a questionable ""reclassification of income"" to qualify for no tax on tips or overtime pay, said Muresianu. ""But there are ways you could mitigate the damage.""

Not every day is a good day for Barbie, if prices for dolls in the U.S. keep rising amid President Donald Trump's tariff policy announcements.

A series of household items including leggings, Barbie dolls power drills and washing machines have increased in price since Trump initially announced a sweeping set of global tariffs on April 2, according to an industry note issued by the Telsey Advisory Group on Tuesday.

Between April 16 and April 30, the price of a Target-exclusive Barbie doll increased by nearly 43% to $14.99, up from $10.49, Telsey reported. A Whirlpool washing machine at Lowe's went up in price by nearly $82 to $599, over the same time frame.

Other notable price hikes include Girl's Cat and Jack leggings at Target, which went up by nearly a third — to $6, from $4.50 — and a Dewalt drill at Tractor Supply that rose by $20, to $179. (As of Friday afternoon, the drill is on sale for $99.)

The Telsey analysis included luxury items, too. A medium Louis Vuitton Neverfull tote bag will run you $2,130 today, for example — $100 more than on April 16, Telsey noted.

The price changes in the Telsey note shouldn't be viewed as definitive evidence of tariff impact, its authors wrote. The group tracked only one or two items per analyzed company, and didn't account for extant discounts or internal pricing strategies.

Some of the consumer items tracked by Telsey didn't change in price. Others became less expensive. But if higher consumer prices due to tariffs aren't yet a reality for Americans, they will be soon, said Telsey's note.

""A consistent narrative across retailers and brands is that higher costs will be passed on to consumers,"" its authors wrote. ""Many management teams are accelerating and attempting to make 'non-regrettable' decisions about the supply chain and/or product price changes.""

Each product tracked by Telsey was chosen based on factors like its expected longevity and connection to Chinese manufacturing. Most of the tariffs initially announced by Trump are paused until July 9, replaced instead by a 10% baseline tariff on all foreign goods — but Chinese imports currently face a levy of 145%.

Many American companies that manufacture products in China have publicly discussed plans to diversify their supply chains. But few have expressed a willingness to relocate production specifically to the U.S., with some CEOs saying the country lacks the manufacturing expertise to make high-quality goods at business-friendly prices.

""Design, development, product engineering, brand management all happens in America,"" Barbie-maker Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. ""Making product, producing product in other countries, allows us to create quality products at affordable price points.""

Trump reportedly hit back at Mattel on Thursday, threatening to place a 100% tariff on the company if it took its manufacturing ""somewhere else."" It's unclear how exactly such a tariff could be implemented.

The president also suggested on Friday that the U.S. could potentially lower its tariffs on China to 80%, still be a high rate. Previously, he indicated that consumers should simply buy fewer dolls, in response to price hikes.

""I don't think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that's 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls,"" Trump told NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. ""I think they can have three dolls or four dolls, because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","India and Pakistan agree to immediate ceasefire","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/10/trump-india-pakistan-ceasefire-.html","Sat, 10 May 2025 13:03:43 GMT","



India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire Saturday, but the peace between the two nuclear-armed powers did not seem to last, with explosions reported in the area of Kashmir controlled by India.

Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, said on X that fighting started in the region's capital city, ""air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up.""

The initial ceasefire announcement came hours after fighting escalated on Saturday, with both nations launching continued military operations against each other.

President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire in a post on Truth Social and said the agreement was the result of U.S.-brokered talks, but the extent of the administration's involvement was not clear.

Pakistani and Indian leaders confirmed the ceasefire agreement but did not cite U.S. involvement in their initial statements.

An Indian foreign ministry official said the deal was ""worked out directly between the two countries,"" according to the New York Times.

Prime Minister of Pakistan Shehbaz Sharif did, however, thank Trump for his ""proactive role for peace"" and the U.S. for ""facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability.""

Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar did not mention the role of the U.S. in a statement confirming the ceasefire and said that ""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.""

""It will continue to do so,"" Jaishankar wrote on X.

Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar's ceasefire announcement on X also did not mention U.S. involvement.

""Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!""

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement that Vice President JD Vance met with leaders of the two nations over the last two days and that the countries agreed ""to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.""

Indian or Pakistani officials have not publicly confirmed that they've agreed to such talks.

Jaishankar said he did speak with Rubio Saturday morning, but did not detail U.S. involvement in the ceasefire deal talks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","America is failing its youngest investors, warns personal finance guru Ric Edelman","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/10/america-failing-its-young-investors-warns-financial-guru-ric-edelman-.html","Sat, 10 May 2025 14:05:24 GMT","



One of the most recognized names in personal finance is urging Americans to increase their financial literacy, and urging the country to do a better job of providing the education. 

""We spend a lot of time trying to improve financial literacy. We stink at it,"" said Ric Edelman, founder of Edelman Financial Engines, on this week's CNBC ""ETF Edge.""

Edelman believes the problem is rooted in the fact the U.S. has never had a great tradition of encouraging smart personal finance, and he says it has never been more important to fix, given how long people are now living. That increases the risks related to running out of money later in life and creates serious questions about standard investing models for long-term financial security, such as the 60-40 stock and bond portfolio.

""We are the first generation, as baby boomers, that will live long lives as part of the norm,"" Edelman said. ""Everyone before us, our parents and grandparents mostly died in their 50s and 60s. You didn't have to plan for the future, because you weren't going to have one,"" he added.

One of his biggest concerns with the current generation of young investors is that they seem to believe in get-rich-quick schemes. Many of the new investing websites have been too encouraging of risky strategies that lure young investors in, he says, promoting financial gambling rather than investing. Options and zero-day options have become a significant part of the daily trading landscape in the last several years. According to data from the New York Stock Exchange, the percent of retail traders participating in the options market approached the 50% mark in 2022. In 2024, options volume hit an all-time record.

Edelman says younger generations should be wary of a corporate America that makes consumer finance more complicated than it should be, which includes the manufacturing of overly sophisticated and expensive financial products. ""They want to make it complex, to make you a hostage rather than a customer,"" he said. 

He also cautions young investors to make sure they are getting information about personal finance from credible sources. ""When so many are getting their financial education from TikTok, that's a little scary,"" he said.

Edelman believes the cards are stacked against young investors because of the lack of high schools mandating a course in personal finance. ""The only way we discover the issues of money is through the school of hard knocks as adults, and we're over our heads when it comes to buying a car, getting a mortgage, insurance and saving for college"" he said. 

That situation is improving for the next generations of adults. Utah was the first state to require a personal finance course for high school graduation in 2004, and the list grew to include 11 states by 2021. As of this year, 27 states now require high school students to take a semester-long personal finance course for graduation, according to Next Gen Personal Finance. 

Another big challenge for young investors is they often don't have a lot of money to invest, with many recent college graduates struggling to pay bills and left with little to put towards other financial goals. But there is at least one reason to be hopeful about younger Americans, Edelman says: they are highly motivated to reach financial success.

""Today's youth looks at their parents and sees how poorly they were prepared for retirement. They don't want that to be their future"" he said.

Anacortes, a small coastal town in Washington state, typically bustles with tourists during the summer months.

But local business owners like Kaia Matheny are bracing for less foot traffic — and a financial hit — this year as tensions around trade and concerns about immigration policy push foreigners to reconsider the U.S. as a travel destination.

Matheny is the co-owner of Adrift Restaurant, a nautical themed farm-to-table eatery in downtown Anacortes. The town, a gateway to the San Juan islands, is a two-hour drive south of Vancouver.

She's seen sales fall amid fewer customers from Canada, which is generally the U.S.' top source of international visitors. Air and land arrivals from Canadians fell 14% and 32%, respectively, in March compared to the same time in 2024, according to Tourism Economics.

A sharp decline in foot traffic among foreign tourists looks set to persist through summer, data shows. Matheny is ""wary"" about what that will mean during peak season, which typically kicks off in June.

Tourism ""won't be what it is usually,"" Matheny said. ""We'll batten down the hatches and make the best of it.""

Tourism is a big U.S. export: Foreign visitors spent more than $180 billion here in 2024, more than all agricultural exports combined, said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.

However, international visits to the U.S. fell 12% year-over-year in March, according to Oxford Economics.

It's not just Canada: Visits from Western Europe, Asia and South America — historically the U.S.' highest-value travel markets — are also down by double-digit percentages, according to the U.S. Travel Association.

Data suggests the weakness will persist through the summer.

Air bookings for overseas summer travel to the U.S. are pacing about 10% behind the same time last year, according to Tourism Economics, which is affiliated with Oxford Economics. (These were bookings made as of March.)

Canada and Mexico are worse, data show. Summer bookings from Canada to the U.S. are down more than 30%, for example.

""Foreign visitations to the US are the largest services export in the country and the outlook is quickly souring,"" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a research note published in May.

The loss in international tourism is expected to cost the U.S. economy $10 billion this year compared to 2024, said Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics. The U.S. Travel Association pegs the potential loss at an even higher $21 billion in 2025, if current travel trends continue.

""It's alarming,"" Freeman said. Many businesses and destinations ""count on the international visitor, in particular.""

The tourism pullback appears to be ""more a U.S. issue right now"" rather than a broad global weakness in travel, since other regions are seeing positive tourism growth, said Lorraine Sileo, senior analyst and founder of Phocuswright Research, a market research firm.

Domestic tourism isn't poised to pick up the slack — the market was slowing heading into 2025 and the ""revenge travel"" trend, which had propelled Americans to travel due to pent-up demand after Covid-19 lockdowns, has largely been played out, she said.

""I don't think it's all doom and gloom for the U.S. travel industry,"" Sileo said. ""But it'll be a tough year.""

Many factors underpin the decline in international visitors, travel experts said.

For one, President Donald Trump has announced several rounds of tariffs, sparking fears of a global trade war and raising the average import duties to the highest level since the early 1900s.

Trade wars are ""intrinsically combative"" with the international community, Sacks said.

In early April, China issued a risk alert for tourists heading to the U.S., citing deteriorating economic relations and domestic security. Several European nations also recently issued U.S. travel advisories, citing reasons such as heightened border security and potential issues around travel documents.

Trump has also drawn the ire of Canadian citizens and lawmakers through repeated suggestions that Canada become the 51st U.S. state, experts said. Likewise for Greenland, which is part of Denmark.

""Now is also the time to choose Canada,"" former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said during a speech in February. ""It might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada and explore the many national and provincial parks, historical sites and tourist destinations our great country has to offer,"" he added.

Searches conducted in March and April from Canadians for travel to the U.S. dropped 50% from 2024, according to Beyond, a data provider on the global short-term rental market.

""We saw a nearly immediate drop in Canadian search activity after the tariff news broke back in February,"" Julie Brinkman, CEO of Beyond, wrote in an e-mail. ""While interest in the U.S. dropped, Mexico saw a 35% increase in searches. That tells us travelers aren't canceling trips — they're choosing new destinations.""

Anecdotes on social media support that notion.

""Proud to say we've cancelled 3 US based cruises over the next 2 years and instead will be vacationing in Europe and Canada,"" one Reddit commenter wrote recently.

Growing concern tied to U.S. immigration policy is perhaps the most consequential development in recent months, experts said.

""Whether fair or not, a perception is taking hold that more people are being detained, more devices [are] being searched and legal travelers [are] being deported back to their origin country,"" Freeman said. ""That creates a great deal of fear.""

Nationally, small and mid-sized business profits have already ""deteriorated sharply"" amid the travel slowdown, said Aaron Terrazas, an economist at Gusto, a payroll and benefits provider.

The share of ""tourism"" companies that are profitable fell to 32% in April 2025, down from 41% and 43% in April 2024 and 2023, respectively, according to Gusto. The category includes tour operators, condo or time-share agencies and ticket or reservation agencies.

The share of profitable ""accommodation"" businesses fell to 36%, down from 44% and 45%, Gusto found. The category includes small hotels and motels, guesthouses, cottages and cabins, and RV parks and campgrounds.

Slower customer traffic — and lost income — are the main culprits, rather than an increase in expenses from inflation or labor costs, Terrazas said.

The erosion in profitability and revenue is ""unusually sharp and unusually sudden, particularly for a time of year when we normally start to see travel pick up,"" Terrazas said. ""There's no obvious reason why domestic travel would collapse so sharply and so suddenly in a single month, whereas for international travel there are more obvious explanations.""

The longer the slowdown continues, the greater the odds businesses will be forced to make tough choices and potentially cut staff, Terrazas said.

Financial losses come at a time when the U.S. hasn't returned to pre-pandemic levels of travel, further pressuring businesses that rely on tourism, Freeman said. The U.S. welcomed 72 million foreign visitors in 2024, shy of the 78 million in 2019, he said.

While non-residents account for less than 10% of all U.S. tourism demand, they are far more ""lucrative"" spenders, Freeman said.

The average overseas visitor spends more than $4,000 per person per visit, eight times more than the average American tourist spends domestically, Freeman said. The average Canadian and Mexican tourist spends $1,200 per visit.

Less foreign travel will have a disproportionate impact on certain areas.

Las Vegas; Los Angeles; Miami; New York; Orlando, Florida; and San Francisco, for example, account for the largest share of foreign tourists, said Sweet of Oxford Economics.

While New York has a large, diverse economy that can likely absorb a tourism loss without going into recession, the same probably isn't true of places like Las Vegas or Honolulu, he said.

""These economies are very, very sensitive to tourism,"" said Sweet. ""This is their main economic driver.""

So far, Matheny, the co-owner of Adrift Restaurant, has seen monthly sales fall 4% relative to last year — not a ""huge"" decrease, but a ""noticeable"" one, she said.

The restaurant has had to cut its buying by an equivalent amount, she said. That in turn hurts the local economy in Anacortes, since the restaurant sources the bulk of its food from local farms and fisheries — hurting their bottom lines, too, said Matheny.

""It's a community impact,"" she said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","BTC, DOGE, ETH Price News: What's Next for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether Ahead of US-China Trade Talks","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/10/dogecoin-surges-10-bitcoin-nears-104k-amid-renewed-risk-on-sentiment","Sat, 10 May 2025 09:48:21 GMT","

Bitcoin pushed past the six-figure mark for the first time in over two months, coming within a hair of $104,000 in early Asian hours Saturday, as crypto markets staged a sharp rebound on improving macro sentiment and Ethereum's latest network upgrade.

Dogecoin DOGE$0.23667 led the gains among majors with a 10% rally, while ether ETH$2,482.53 rose 3.5% following the successful implementation of its long-awaited Pectra upgrade, bringing weekly gains over 30%.

Other majors, including Solana SOL$172.67, Cardano ADA$0.83463, xrp XRP$2.44, and BNB Chain's BNB$656.47, rose between 2% and 6%, driven by a shift in investor sentiment from caution to risk-on.

The move follows a string of pro-crypto developments in the U.S. this week. On Wednesday, New Hampshire passed a bill allowing the state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Arizona followed suit a day later with its own legislation supporting a crypto reserve. The state-level momentum comes as political leaders lean further into digital asset policy ahead of the November election in some states.

President Donald Trump's bullish remarks on upcoming U.S.-China trade talks also helped ease market jitters. The comments coincided with the U.S. and U.K. signing a fresh trade agreement that will remove reciprocal tariffs and lower duties on American goods, further lifting sentiment across equities and crypto alike.

“President Trump's optimistic outlook on this weekend's China trade talks is easing fears of an escalating trade war, encouraging traders to shift capital back into asset classes like cryptocurrencies,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a message to CoinDesk. “This could very well drive bitcoin back towards its all-time high and potentially surpass it.”

BTC trades about 5% below its January record high of over $108,700 as of European morning hours on Saturday.

Analysts say the recent moves mark a decisive break from the sluggish price action that plagued altcoins through much of March and April.

“Traders believe the crypto industry may have finally found its second wind as a hedge against market uncertainty,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.

“Investors are changing their perspectives on crypto now that altcoins have departed from a negative trend and found buying pressure from a renewed risk-on sentiment,” Ruck added.

Ethereum's 30% rally this week is also being attributed to growing institutional interest and the momentum behind its Pectra upgrade, which introduces long-anticipated execution layer reforms aimed at boosting efficiency and scalability.

“The upgrade provides reforms Ethereum desperately needs to cement its position as a leading chain amidst growing competition,” BTSE's Mei said. “Given that Ethereum is trading well below its all-time high, we could see substantial upside in the coming weeks and months, especially as macro fears ease and institutions become more willing to allocate towards crypto and crypto ETFs.”

Still, traders are closely watching this weekend's U.S.-China trade negotiations. Talks are set to begin later on Saturday in Switzerland, and any signs of stalemate or renewed tension could undercut the current rally.

New York is home to four of the largest bitcoin mines in the country, which consume huge quantities of electric power and water to cool their server farms, emit loud humming noises around the clock and flood the atmosphere with copious greenhouse gases and pollutants. 

In many cases, they are also driving nearby residents crazy.

“I'm probably within a mile and a half of the facility, and I can hear it,” said Erin Robinson, a sociology professor at Canisius University in Buffalo who lives close to a bitcoin mine near the New York border with Canada. “It's a low hum that just kind of sits in your ears.”

Bitcoin, the largest and best-known cryptocurrency, is managed by a decentralized network of bitcoin users. A network algorithm assigns each transaction a unique random identifying code, which bitcoin “mines” derive by operating powerful computers day and night, running an endless series of random numbers to break those codes.

Once a correct code is reached, confirming a transaction, which happens on average across the network every 10 minutes, a bitcoin miner receives 3.125 newly minted bitcoins (each worth around $95,000), which is the fee for helping maintain the network and keep it secure. The energy use for these operations is very high—which means the price of electricity governs where these mines are located. 

Some bitcoin miners are attracted to New York for its cheap electricity—many Northern towns that border Canada have low rates due to abundant hydropower. But others are enticed by the state's decommissioned or low-use power plants, which they buy and connect to their computers, often running those power plants all day, every day. 

Two different bitcoin mines have set up their operations in small Northwestern New York towns, and bought local “peaker” gas plants—power plants that only operate during times of peak demand. 

When miners bought these plants, they drastically increased operations at the gas plants, ultimately increasing greenhouse gas emissions. These mines are made up of hundreds of computers—and they all run hot. Numerous large fans are used to cool down the servers, which are often very loud for local residents. Cold freshwater is also used to cool the computers. The water consumption of bitcoin mines is understudied, but concerning to many experts. 

In these small New York communities, the resistance to these bitcoin mines has been stark and wide-ranging, employing multiple different levers in local and state governance. 

“Crypto mines exploit all of the distributed impacts in a way that has made it really hard to regulate and hard for communities to understand,” said Mandy DeRoche, a deputy managing attorney with Earthjustice that has fought the sale of these power plants to bitcoin miners in court.

The amount of energy that bitcoin mines—or more broadly cryptocurrency mines—use is relatively obscured. In early 2024, under former President Biden, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) was directed to collect data from 130 identified commercial cryptocurrency miners operating in the U.S., but the survey is still ongoing. 

As of last year, the EIA puts cryptocurrency's energy usage at anywhere between 0.6 percent  to 2.3 percent of U.S. electricity consumption. In New York, the energy for bitcoin mining usually comes from either the electric grid, operated by the New York Independent System Operator, or a power plant that the miners own. 

Greenidge Generation, a power plant off the coast of Seneca Lake near Dresden, New York, was initially a coal-fired plant but had been operating as a gas “peaker” plant since 2017, after it was acquired by Atlas Holdings LLC in 2014. In March 2020, a bitcoin mine adjacent to the power plant began operations.

“The Greenidge facility actually became the test case for how 49 other underutilized or decommissioned power plants across the state could turn to bitcoin or cryptocurrency mining and be resurrected,” said Yvonne Taylor, who lives next to Seneca Lake and is the vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian, an organization that works to preserve the Finger Lakes.

Power plants that operate in New York must obtain an air permit from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation every five years. Greenidge Generation's permit expired in 2021, and as it made its way through the renewal process, the company shared data on its energy generation activities. 

According to the company, it produced 203,918 megawatts of electricity for the state grid in 2018, when it was still operating as a peaker plant. In 2020, when it began to expand its operations into bitcoin mining, it still supplied 215,588 megawatts to the grid, but also produced an additional 132,215 megawatts for bitcoin mining, meaning the plant would have to run much more often.

In 2022, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law a two-year moratorium on air permits for fossil fuel power plants that serve cryptocurrency mines. Greenidge was grandfathered in because it had submitted its application for a renewal air permit before the law went into effect.

In June of that same year, however, the Department of Environmental Conservation still denied the renewal of Greenidge Generation's air permit, saying that its continued operation would be inconsistent with the State's Climate Act, which sets stringent greenhouse gas emissions limits over the next two decades. 

Since it began its cryptocurrency mining operations, Greenidge Generation has been emitting more greenhouse gases. According to court filings, the plant's projected total emissions from 2022 through 2026 “is more than six times the emissions the facility was producing, on average, prior to shifting to cryptocurrency mining operations.”

Since its air permit renewal was denied, Greenidge Generation has gone through multiple cycles of appeals, and all the while it continues to run its power plant. The plant is legally allowed to continue operating until the last day of the application process, which includes appeals and further reviews, under the State Administrative Procedures Act. 

Seneca Lake Guardian and other community groups oppose the company's appeals in court, represented by Earthjustice.

“They're behaving like a petulant, rich child, because they don't like the answer that they get,” said Taylor. “At some point they're going to exhaust their options, and I am confident that we will prevail.”

When a bitcoin mine moves into a small community like the one near Seneca Lake, municipal officials are rarely aware of the impact it could have on local residents. Some are even swayed by the promise of new jobs to offer tax abatements.  

“I don't think most communities realize what they're inviting into their community until it's too late,” said DeRoche. “With the water consumption, the fire and safety risks, the water pollution, the noise pollution, people realize after the fact that maybe this is not the best use of community tax dollars.”

The bitcoin mine near New York's border with Canada, which is owned by the Canadian company Digi Power X (formerly Digihost), also bought a gas peaker plant—Fortistar—in order to power its operations in a small town just north of Buffalo called North Tonawanda. The bitcoin mine is located close to some local residents, like Robinson, the Canisius professor, which means that the low but persistent hum of the facility's fans can be heard in some of their homes.

For the residents of North Tonawanda, this pushed many to action. Deborah Goldeck, a resident of the town for 40 years, has been fighting for more regulation on the Digi Power X mine since it started operations in 2022. According to Goldeck, a May 2024 meeting of the town's common council where multiple people voiced their concerns led to widespread change across the town. 

Residents' advocacy culminated in a two-year ban on cryptocurrency mining in North Tonawanda, and a formal noise study to evaluate whether the existing mine is violating the town's noise ordinance. 

“We just can't live like this,” said Goldeck. “We want out.”

A 2021 full environmental assessment of the operations at the Fortistar power plant filed with the city prior to the sale stated that Digi Power X planned to run the plant all day, every day to power its cryptocurrency mining operation. It also estimated its future water consumption at 500,000 gallons of water a day, the equivalent of around 25 swimming pools. 

Bitcoin mines use water, in addition to fans, to cool down their servers. In 2021, the water consumption of bitcoin mining was estimated to be 1,573 billion liters (also known as gigaliters), and has continued to increase since then. 

In North Tonawanda, residents are worried about pressure on the wastewater infrastructure. Near Seneca Lake, Taylor worries about the discharges of water from the Greenidge Generation data center into Seneca Lake and the nearby Keuka Lake. 

The warm water, she says, could lead to increased amounts of cyanobacteria in Seneca Lake, creating harmful algal blooms in the water source of many in her community. 

“My house has a pipe that goes down the hill into the lake, and that's my water source,” said Taylor. “If there's a harmful algal bloom in front of my water source, I can't use my water at all. I can't flush the toilet, I can't shower, I can't bathe.”

Taylor's group, Seneca Lake Guardian, as well as Sierra Club and the Committee to Preserve the Finger Lakes, sued Greenidge Generation in 2023, alleging that their discharges violated the Clean Water Act. 

The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed, with the court ruling that the company's application for a permit renewal was sufficient. That same year, under direction from the state Department of Conservation, Greenidge Generation also made some efforts to protect local marine wildlife from its water intake systems. 

Though local residents have found some success in limiting the expansion of cryptocurrency mines in their towns by enacting local laws and moratoriums, it is these numerous larger lawsuits at the state level that can prevent existing mines from continuing their operations, even if they are not all successful. 

In November 2024, in North Tonawanda, another lawsuit was successful with the New York Supreme Court ordering the Public Service Commission to re-review its approval of the sale of Fortistar power plant to Digi Power X while considering the state's Climate Act. Digi Power X can continue to operate the power plant until the commission makes a new decision.

“You cannot allow the purchase of this power plant, which is going to result in astronomical increase in operations and pollution, to go through without a climate law analysis,” said DeRoche. 

The Digi Power X air permit also expired in 2021. The Department of Environmental Conservation has yet to make a decision on its renewal application.

Digi Power X also plans to build a cryptomining facility on 20 acres in Hildebran, a small town in Burke County, North Carolina.  Town officials said at a public meeting that the company has yet to apply for permits.

Dozens of homes are near the proposed site. Bruce Berry, who lives about a mile away, told Hildebran Town Council members earlier this month that “anybody who lives close to one of these is not happy. What are we getting here? I'm looking for the benefits. It doesn't create any jobs. People lose their serenity. If you want to go home and sit on your porch and listen to the birds, you can't.”

Hildebran town officials said they can't stop the company from building the facility because the state legislature has limited their zoning authority. However, a new bill would give local governments more leeway in some types of zoning decisions. It has yet to become law.

Both Digi Power X and Greenidge Generation did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 

Other cryptocurrency mines in the state of New York are not powered by their own gas plants. Instead, like most businesses, they are hooked up to the electricity grid. This means that the greenhouse gas emissions linked to their operations, and their impacts on New York residents, are much harder to track—making lawsuits less likely. 

“I think it's harder to get reliable information about the ones that are on the grid and how much power they're using—how much they're spiking local electricity rates, and how much they're impacting the grid and the community's price of power,” said DeRoche.

But recently, a group of scientists at Harvard released a study that attempted to trace air pollution from the 34 largest bitcoin mines in the country, previously identified by the New York Times. 

Using mapping technology, datasets from the New York Times and dispersion models, scientists were able to identify 635 power plants that were supplying electricity to these mines between August 2022 and July 2023. 

“The potential amount of energy demand that these [34] power-hungry facilities are able to put together is as high as 33 percent more than the entire city of Los Angeles,” said Gianluca Guidi, a visiting scholar at Harvard who co-authored the study. 

The study also tracked air pollution, specifically the pollutant PM2.5; exposure to it can lead to health impacts like childhood asthma and premature mortality. According to city data, long-term exposure to the pollutant even contributes to an estimated 1 in 25 deaths in New York City.

Although New York state only has four of these 34 large mines, multiple areas of New York City were identified as hotspots—counties where at least one community was experiencing a non-negligible amount of increased air pollution due to these bitcoin mines' demand on the grid. 

One hotspot was identified in Queens, near the Astoria Generating Station, a local gas plant. While observing the way weather and the atmospheric conditions impact the dispersion of air pollutants, study authors found that other hotspots were less clear-cut.

The hotspot in Staten Island, for example, was traced back to a New Jersey power plant, and the bitcoin mines that plant was serving were in upstate New York. This is because the electricity grid is not always divided perfectly along state lines. 

“It can happen that you have a bitcoin mine or any large facility in a specific state drawing energy from a power plant that is now in another state,” said Guidi. “Then you have the dispersion of the pollution coming out of the power plants that goes and affects, potentially, a community in another state.”

Allies of the cryptocurrency industry have pushed back against the results of studies like these, arguing that cryptocurrency mining can stabilize the grid, meaning they can power down operations at peak demand times and make use of excess renewable energy. 

According to a spokesperson for the New York Independent System Operator, the agency in charge of the state's grid, this claim has not yet been tested. This notion of grid stabilization is based on “expected operation rather than actual participation in demand-side markets or other firm commitments to reduce consumption during peak demand conditions.”

The cryptocurrency industry has received particular attention from President Trump, who spoke at the 2024 bitcoin conference during his campaign. Today, the Trump family also owns a crypto company, World Liberty Financial, and the president's sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are heavily invested in a bitcoin mining company called American Bitcoin. 

Since taking office, Trump has signed an executive order declaring the need for a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. He also placed cryptocurrency allies in the Securities and Exchange Commission, an agency that had previously been responsible for curbing corruption and fraud in the industry. 

Given Trump's support for increased fossil fuel extraction and expanded infrastructure for oil, gas and coal, the energy-intensive operations of bitcoin mines may continue to be powered by polluting power plants.

Meanwhile, the New York Independent Systems Operator is already planning for an increase in energy demand over the next 10 years due, in part, to cryptocurrency mines and data centers. 

“As the demand on the grid grows at a rate greater than the build out of generation and transmission, deficiencies could arise within the ten-year planning horizon,” according to a 2024 report on grid reliability. 

Today, the mines in North Tonawanda and Dresden are still operating—and so are their polluting power plants. 

“The burden of proof still comes down to the people—we're still in charge of proving that there isn't a risk,” said Robinson, the Canisius professor. Agencies “assume that it's safe until they see an accident or see devastation in terms of our power grid or wastewater or noise violations.”

Bitcoin's milestone week comes as new crypto exchange-traded funds are hitting the market.

Investor and best-selling personal finance author Ric Edelman thinks the rollout gives investors more access to upside.

He finds buffer ETFs and yield ETFs particularly exciting.

""You can now invest in bitcoin ETFs that protect you against the downside volatility while preserving your ability to enjoy the upside profits,"" Edelman told CNBC's ""ETF Edge"" this week."" You can generate massive amounts of yield, much more than you can in the stock market.""

Edelman is the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals, which educates financial advisors on cryptocurrencies. He is also in Barron's Financial Advisor Hall of Fame.

""Crypto is meant to be a long-term hold, just like the stock market,"" said Edelman. ""It's meant to diversify the portfolio.""

His thoughts came as a bitcoin rally got underway. The cryptocurrency crossed $100,000 on Thursday for the first time since February. As of Friday's close on Wall Street, bitcoin gained 6% this week. It is now up almost 10% so far this month.

However, Edelman sees problems when it comes to leverage and inverse bitcoin ETFs. He warned that not all crypto ETFs are appropriate for retail investors, suggesting most don't understand how they work.

""These leveraged ETFs often have an assumption you're going to hold the fund for a single day, a daily reset,"" he said. ""That's literally the same thing as buying a lottery ticket. This isn't investing.""

During the same interview, ""ETF Edge"" host Bob Pisani referenced 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) as an example of a leveraged bitcoin product that includes daily fees and resets.

The fund is beating bitcoin this week, jumping more than 12%. So far this month, the ETF is up 19%. But the BITX is underperforming bitcoin this year. It is up about 1.5%, while bitcoin is up roughly 10%.

Volatility Shares is the ETF provider behind BITX.

The company writes on its website: ""The Fund is not suitable for all investors … An investor in the Fund could potentially lose the full value of their investment within a single day.""

 Ethereum price catches a bid as regulatory and investor sentiment shift in ETH's favor. 

Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump's reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH's renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.

Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

The ETH futures premium has yet to exceed the 5% threshold typically associated with a neutral market, indicating that demand for leveraged bullish positions remains notably limited. ETH's continued underperformance—trailing the altcoin market capitalization by 17% in 2025—helps explain the prevailing lack of investor confidence.

Some analysts interpret this as an opening for further short covering, while others contend that Ethereum's core fundamentals have yet to improve meaningfully.

Irrespective of Ether's price action, recent network upgrades have notably enhanced layer-2 scalability. More importantly, they have helped solidify Ethereum's position as the leading platform in terms of decentralization and security. This is reflected in Ethereum's total value locked (TVL), which stands at $64 billion. For comparison, the three largest direct competitors—Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron—collectively hold a total value locked (TVL) of $22.3 billion. 

The limited demand for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has emerged as a key warning sign. Even Ether's strongest single-day price performance in four years failed to prevent a third consecutive day of net outflows, according to data from Farside Investors. On May 8 alone, US-listed Ether spot ETFs experienced net outflows totaling $16 million.

The muted enthusiasm following Ether's recent bullish momentum can be partly attributed to the sharp 85% drop in Ethereum network fees from January to April. Reduced network activity lowers overall demand for ETH and negatively affects net staking yields, as the protocol's burn mechanism relies on competition for data processing.

ETH options markets also offer insight into whether whales and market makers anticipate further downside risks. 

Currently, put (sell) options are trading at similar levels to equivalent call (buy) options, indicating a neutral sentiment. This outcome is somewhat discouraging for Ether bulls. Nevertheless, Ether could regain market attention after US President Donald Trump reversed his position following earlier public endorsements of competing altcoins.

According to a Politico report published on May 8, President Trump felt he had been “used” and had severed ties with the lobbyist who reportedly proposed the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. While Trump's social media post on March 2 specifically mentioned Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP, the subsequent March 6 “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order struck a much more reserved tone.

Despite the evident apathy in both the Ether derivatives market and spot ETF flows, a rally toward the $2,700 level remains plausible—especially if investor sentiment shifts in response to the failed lobbying efforts undertaken by some of Ethereum's competitors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Solana Vs. Ethereum: Sygnum Reveals Who Wins","https://bitcoinist.com/solana-vs-ethereum-sygnum-who-wins/","Sat, 10 May 2025 00:00:58 GMT","

Sygnum, the Swiss- and Singapore-regulated digital-asset banking group, has ignited fresh debate over the pecking order of smart-contract platforms with the publication of its 8 May “Digital Nugget” commentary, pointedly titled Is Solana overtaking Ethereum?

In the report, Sygnum's research desk acknowledges that Ethereum retains an “undisputed” lead in revenues and institutional adoption, yet concludes that the market narrative has swung decisively in Solana's favour—a reversal dramatic enough for the bank to describe Solana as the system currently “overtaking” its older rival in mind-share if not in absolute fundamentals.

“Ethereum's strategic pivot […] has led to a 5–10 percent outperformance of Ether over Solana,” the note observes, citing the chain's refocused roadmap on main-net scalability and user-experience. Nonetheless, the authors concede that “sentiment on Ethereum remains poor for now” despite its “continued leading position and still superior revenue generation.”

Sygnum's analysts dissect the often-conflated metrics of fees, revenues and token value. While Solana has recently “dominated in fee generation,” its protocol income “continues to substantially lag Ethereum (with the exception of the brief period around the issuance of the Trump family tokens on Solana).” The bank quantifies the gap at roughly two- to two-and-a-half-times in favour of ETH—an edge that endures even after Solana's frenetic surge in retail transaction volumes.

Layer-2 dynamics on Ethereum, long criticised for siphoning activity away from the main chain, receive a balanced treatment. The report reiterates that rollups have “led the market to see Ether as less valuable,” but adds a little-noticed parallel: “a comparable issue affecting the value of the Solana tokens is overlooked.” Because “most of the fees are paid to validators and do not grow the value of the Solana token,” Solana's own monetary premium may be equally vulnerable.

Token-economic self-help is not on the immediate horizon: a community proposal to tweak Solana's inflation schedule—an initiative Sygnum says “would have had a similar effect” to ETH's fee-burn mechanic—“was conclusively voted down recently.”

Market capitalisation paints a different picture of runway. With Solana valued at roughly one-third of Ether but already generating half its revenues, Sygnum calculates “more room for Solana to outperform – especially with the tailwind of a better narrative and sentiment.” Even so, the report cautions that Solana's income stream is “highly concentrated in the memecoin sector” and hence judged by investors as “less stable.” The implication: valuation discounts may be rational rather than sentimental.

Ethereum's entrenchment among regulated institutions provides the counter-weight. “Tokenisation, stablecoins, and DeFi” are the use-cases “showing traction and have the support of governments, regulators, and traditional financial institutions,” Sygnum writes, noting Ethereum's 57% share of tokenised assets—augmented by a further 20% on its Layer-2 cohort zkSync. BlackRock's flagship BUIDL fund, for example, keeps “93% of its assets on Ethereum,” a decision the asset manager links to the network's “decentralization, credibility and security.”

By contrast, Solana's slice of the tokenisation pie “remains below 3%,” and its year-to-date doubling of stablecoin share leaves it “just above 5%,” still an order of magnitude behind Ethereum. The area where Solana has moved the needle most convincingly is DeFi total value locked: its share has climbed from 9.5% to 11.5% against Ethereum's slide from 63.5% to 55% since January.

“The narratives continue to strongly favour Solana,” Sygnum concedes, even after Ethereum Foundation's internal reshuffle and public vow to “adjust its go-to-market strategy and to clarify and articulate the value proposition.” Yet narrative alone will not decide custody mandates or settlement rails for traditional finance.

“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum's security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” the bank concludes, reminding readers that network effects in crypto “are very hard to overcome – just as they are in other tech fields such as social media.”

Indeed, history's roll-call of “Ethereum killers” is a cautionary tale: “most have faded away until now,” despite technological ingenuity. Against that backdrop, the report's summary is both sober and striking: “Ethereum's 2-year long underperformance vs Solana has been temporarily arrested since the strategic pivot… [and] the token value continues to be supported by revenues running at double the rate of Solana's revenues.”

Sygnum's analysis stops short of declaring an irreversible power shift, but its framing is unambiguous: in the current news cycle Solana enjoys the upper hand in perception, whereas ETH retains the upper hand in fundamentals. Whether that juxtaposition amounts to Solana “overtaking” Ethereum or merely drafting in its slipstream will depend, the bank says, on which chain wins the confidence of global finance in the “medium-term.”

For now, as Sygnum delicately puts it, “the market has focused on Solana's greater transaction volumes,” even if “protocol revenues continue to substantially lag Ethereum.” In the scorecard of May 2025, Solana may claim the crowd, yet Ethereum still holds the belt.

At press time, ETH traded at $2,344.

Ethereum's (ETH) price has lagged behind Bitcoin over the last two years. However, over the past two days, ETH has outperformed BTC and other major coins.

Ethereum's recent price action against Bitcoin supports this bullish narrative. According to recent chart data, rare golden crosses have appeared on the ETH/BTC pair's one-hour and four-hour charts, with short-term momentum building in Ethereum's favor.

A golden cross occurs when a shorter-term moving average, usually the 50-period, crosses above a longer-term moving average, like the 200-period. It is often regarded as a bullish signal that precedes sustained upward momentum.

On the daily ETH/BTC chart, ETH has broken above the 50-day SMA at 0.02 in a two-day climb, a key resistance level that had previously capped upside attempts. This breakout could signal the start of a trend reversal, especially if ETH can maintain strength above this level. If the rise continues, the next target could be the 200-day SMA, often seen as a gatekeeper for long-term trend changes.

In a Friday tweet, Arkham wrote, ""Ethereum just had its best day since 2021."" Ethereum surged nearly 30% to a high of $2,489 on Friday, following the Pectra upgrade, which core developers described as the ""most ambitious upgrade"" the network has ever completed.

Bitcoin pushed past the six-figure mark for the first time in over two months, coming within a hair of $104,000 in early Asian hours Saturday, as crypto markets staged a sharp rebound on improving macro sentiment and Ethereum's latest network upgrade.

Dogecoin DOGE$0.23667 led the gains among majors with a 10% rally, while ether ETH$2,482.53 rose 3.5% following the successful implementation of its long-awaited Pectra upgrade, bringing weekly gains over 30%.

Other majors, including Solana SOL$172.67, Cardano ADA$0.83463, xrp XRP$2.44, and BNB Chain's BNB$656.47, rose between 2% and 6%, driven by a shift in investor sentiment from caution to risk-on.

The move follows a string of pro-crypto developments in the U.S. this week. On Wednesday, New Hampshire passed a bill allowing the state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Arizona followed suit a day later with its own legislation supporting a crypto reserve. The state-level momentum comes as political leaders lean further into digital asset policy ahead of the November election in some states.

President Donald Trump's bullish remarks on upcoming U.S.-China trade talks also helped ease market jitters. The comments coincided with the U.S. and U.K. signing a fresh trade agreement that will remove reciprocal tariffs and lower duties on American goods, further lifting sentiment across equities and crypto alike.

“President Trump's optimistic outlook on this weekend's China trade talks is easing fears of an escalating trade war, encouraging traders to shift capital back into asset classes like cryptocurrencies,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a message to CoinDesk. “This could very well drive bitcoin back towards its all-time high and potentially surpass it.”

BTC trades about 5% below its January record high of over $108,700 as of European morning hours on Saturday.

Analysts say the recent moves mark a decisive break from the sluggish price action that plagued altcoins through much of March and April.

“Traders believe the crypto industry may have finally found its second wind as a hedge against market uncertainty,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.

“Investors are changing their perspectives on crypto now that altcoins have departed from a negative trend and found buying pressure from a renewed risk-on sentiment,” Ruck added.

Ethereum's 30% rally this week is also being attributed to growing institutional interest and the momentum behind its Pectra upgrade, which introduces long-anticipated execution layer reforms aimed at boosting efficiency and scalability.

“The upgrade provides reforms Ethereum desperately needs to cement its position as a leading chain amidst growing competition,” BTSE's Mei said. “Given that Ethereum is trading well below its all-time high, we could see substantial upside in the coming weeks and months, especially as macro fears ease and institutions become more willing to allocate towards crypto and crypto ETFs.”

Still, traders are closely watching this weekend's U.S.-China trade negotiations. Talks are set to begin later on Saturday in Switzerland, and any signs of stalemate or renewed tension could undercut the current rally.

Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump's reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH's renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.

Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

The ETH futures premium has yet to exceed the 5% threshold typically associated with a neutral market, indicating that demand for leveraged bullish positions remains notably limited. ETH's continued underperformance—trailing the altcoin market capitalization by 17% in 2025—helps explain the prevailing lack of investor confidence.

Some analysts interpret this as an opening for further short covering, while others contend that Ethereum's core fundamentals have yet to improve meaningfully.

Ethereum maintains leadership in decentralization and TVL

Irrespective of Ether's price action, recent network upgrades have notably enhanced layer-2 scalability. More importantly, they have helped solidify Ethereum's position as the leading platform in terms of decentralization and security. This is reflected in Ethereum's total value locked (TVL), which stands at $64 billion. For comparison, the three largest direct competitors—Solana, BNB Chain, and Tron—collectively hold a total value locked (TVL) of $22.3 billion. 

The limited demand for spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has emerged as a key warning sign. Even Ether's strongest single-day price performance in four years failed to prevent a third consecutive day of net outflows, according to data from Farside Investors. On May 8 alone, US-listed Ether spot ETFs experienced net outflows totaling $16 million.

The muted enthusiasm following Ether's recent bullish momentum can be partly attributed to the sharp 85% drop in Ethereum network fees from January to April. Reduced network activity lowers overall demand for ETH and negatively affects net staking yields, as the protocol's burn mechanism relies on competition for data processing.

ETH options markets also offer insight into whether whales and market makers anticipate further downside risks. 

Currently, put (sell) options are trading at similar levels to equivalent call (buy) options, indicating a neutral sentiment. This outcome is somewhat discouraging for Ether bulls. Nevertheless, Ether could regain market attention after US President Donald Trump reversed his position following earlier public endorsements of competing altcoins.

According to a Politico report published on May 8, President Trump felt he had been “used” and had severed ties with the lobbyist who reportedly proposed the idea of a strategic crypto reserve. While Trump's social media post on March 2 specifically mentioned Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and XRP, the subsequent March 6 “Digital Asset Stockpile” Executive Order struck a much more reserved tone.

Despite the evident apathy in both the Ether derivatives market and spot ETF flows, a rally toward the $2,700 level remains plausible—especially if investor sentiment shifts in response to the failed lobbying efforts undertaken by some of Ethereum's competitors.

Crypto World News

May 10, 2025 by Arslan Tabish 

Bitcoin keeps going up to its all time high, but a possible temporary pause on its growth momentum may be around the corner. Michael van de Poppe hints that bitcoin is about to close an effective consolidation phase before surmounting its prior ten peaks. During this phase altcoins are set to outperform as attention begins to drift from the unrelenting rise of Bitcoin.

Source: X

The consolidation periods are usually characterized by weeks of slow market movements, and so this period could be the best opportunity for altcoins to receive attention. When the market stabilizes the altcoins may grow more significantly and the market's attention will focus on other cryptocurrencies. Nonetheless, for many investors this may be a pivotal opportunity to revalue their portfolios and discover the world of altcoins.

Next week might be a watershed for altcoins, especially Ethereum (ETH). According to Daan Crypto Trades, many of the most shorted coins including Ethereum were subjected to extreme price movements in the past week as a result of short squeezes. Some long-dormant meme coins experienced a whole 2 to 4 times increase in prices in the span of a few days thanks to the high short demand. These explosive moves hint at a volatility-ready market that large trade and price opportunities.

The real test for altcoins will come next week.It has been pretty clear that the most shorted coins, which includes $ETH, got squeezed the hardest and caused the craziest moves this week. Especially some of these previously dead memes got squeezed 2-4x in the matter of days…

Nevertheless, these altcoins will be truly tested only after the initial price peak. Even though short squeezes can cause sharp price surges, the latter's sustainability is based on sustained spot demand. In particular, Ethereum is more likely to perform better in the long term given its third place in the market and greater spot demand than other fringe meme coins.

Although the volatility is high, some fears might poison the altcoin rally. Ethereum, for instance, has witnessed no ETF flows this week, which means there is currently no institutional interest. In order for the present price movements to sustain themselves, there will have to be increased institutional demand. In absence thereof, the momentum of the rally may falter at current levels.

Investors remain slightly dubious but optimistic, keeping their stake in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other mighty altcoins. Quite a few are anticipating a potential pullback in order to identify better entry points. As the next few days are likely to prove critical, the market is paying careful attention to demand and price action to determine if the recent upsurge in altcoins will be a long-term trend or short-lived.

I met Guido Buehler at the Top Marques 2025 luxury fair, in Montecarlo, where he was attending one of the events of zondacrypto, the exchange operating across multiple markets, where he serves a Board Member since October 2023. Mr. Buehler is a veteran of the banking and finance industry, who turned entrepreneur and consultant, and is now present in several industries where he tries to do something he loves: opening boundaries and democratizing access, according to principles of inclusivity and ease of use that are very dear to the blockchain practitioners of the first hour. He is, indeed, one of the godfathers of the Swiss Crypto Valley. 

But let's step back for a second. Mr. Buehler has always loved technology and activities associated with speed, like trading. He started his career at UBS, as a Junior Trader, and then spent there eleven years, finishing his gig as a Managing Director for the Assets Servicing business. 

“I used brand new IT programs, at that time, like Lotus, to automatically understand the position of the bank, or the profitability of its trading portfolio. And many other tech stacks, applied for example to credit balance. I then moved into derivatives, especially linked to the foreign exchange market. And there was new tech there, too. I loved how tech could disrupt legacy processes and ways of working.” 

Mr. Buehler decided to leave UBS to create his own family office, together with a partner, with investments, again, centered on technology. One passion came to him in the early days, around 2017, called blockchain, and Switzerland was the right terroir for this nascent tech, with disruptive ambitions. 

“I got involved into blockchain and crypto, and I tried to be the intellectual father of the first crypto bank of the country, called Seba, now Amina. What I liked in the tech was the overlap, or better the fit, between finance and blockchain. I raised 100 million CHF in three months, and set-up the bank within eleven months, including a full banking license application. It was a sprint, very start-up like. Similarly to the ‘internet of value', or Web 3, what blockchain does is to disintermediate the financial industry, getting closer to what people need, and engaging them into a movement where everyone has the vested interest to grow the value of the network”. 

Mr. Buehler is more of a technology architect, rather than a purist, or a philosopher of the tech. For the likes of zondacrypto, he helps with strategy and positioning. He has, indeed, a very distinct point of view on what Web 3 is and should do. “Blockchain is able to optimize the financial industry, and its entire infrastructure, with clear benefits for retail clients, namely the end consumers. Most boards of legacy banks consider crypto as yet another asset class, while its real value is in the interconnectivity, which changes everything,” says Buehler.

He is also a member of the Swiss Blockchain Federation, who penned, in May, a Manifesto, meant to grow the blockchain ecosystem in Switzerland, building bridges between business, regulation and politics. “Innovation drives progress. With blockchain you use the capital markets just as a measurement, so that you go directly from service to trade, with no middleman. It's the fractionalization, the decentralization that matters. For example, take the tokenization of a house, and its spread co-ownership result. It levels the playing field and democratizes the investment, opening the door to big and small players at the same time,” says Buehler. The feeling of the Manifesto is that Switzerland is losing grounds to other regions, and it needs to reclaim the leadership it once had. The decentralized government of Switzerland seems to be the natural sweet spot for the tech revolution of the blockchain universe. The path that initiated years ago needs to continue, seems to be the intention of the document, signed also by the Crypto Valley Association and the Bitcoin Association Switzerland.    

Mr. Buehler is working on zondacrypto, boosting its strategic capital and visibility. He is also into startups like Swica, which fosters micro-savings' programs for people that just reached disposable income, and create a sort of savings plan, based on blockchain, for example. Swica is active now in Sri Lanka, meaning that a financial revolution is able to touch the margin of the global financial empire. Or a real estate and development concern called Lake Pavilion, which merges minimalistic design, Italian touch and fitness, creating beautiful and holistic living and working areas, in partnership with Molteni and Enea. 

His wish for blockchain? “We need to go from speculation to adoption. The infrastructure players, in primis, need to step up the game. The temptation for money cannot obfuscate everything else. The tech is too powerful to be used for shortcuts,” closes Buehler. 

Exactly like we heard from Yat Siu, the soul of Animoca Brands, the blockchain ecosystem needs new rules, which do boost innovation, but also virtuous players, who respect what blockchain does at best, namely creating shared value, with inclusivity, efficiency and impact. We can do it; this seems to be the message of one of our crypto godfathers.

As tributes pour in for Joseph Nye, a longtime Harvard professor and adviser to U.S. presidents and other global leaders, who died Wednesday, one phrase surfaces repeatedly: “soft power.”Dr. Nye, a towering thinker on international relations and security, coined the term in 1990 in his book “Bound To Lead.” “After looking at American military and economic power resources,” he wrote, “I felt that something was still missing – the ability to affect others by attraction and persuasion rather than just coercion and payment.”His focus was on deploying an underrecognized tool. “Soft power was only one component of power, and rarely sufficient by itself,” Dr. Nye wrote in 2017. “The ability to combine hard and soft power into successful strategies where they reinforce each other could be considered ‘smart power.'”Dr. Nye was known for his love of discussing such ideas with others. The Monitor's Howard LaFranchi recalls meeting him at a small gathering just after arriving in Washington in 2001. “I chatted with him, and he gave me his direct number and told me to contact him at any time. I did on any number of occasions,” Howard recalls. Dr. Nye's thinking on American soft power “laid the foundation of work I would do in the future, be it the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, or earthquake responses around the world. The bridges and the goodwill and long-term investment it built were major, and enhanced U.S. standing and interests.”

Meme coins have become a profitable new business for President Donald Trump's family company. The Trump-branded digital tokens are part of a broader push by the Trump Organization – which is managed by Mr. Trump's sons, and in which the president holds a majority ownership stake – into cryptocurrency, a form of digital money that Mr. Trump once derided but now embraces. 

Ahead of his Jan. 20 inauguration, Mr. Trump began promoting two meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, to his supporters. $TRUMP's market value spiked after its launch to $14 billion; it is now valued around $2 billion. The token got a boost late last month when it was announced that the top 220 holders of the coin, in value, would be invited to a May 22 dinner with the president at Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, with the top 25 also invited to a “Private VIP Reception” with Mr. Trump. 

Democrats have criticized the Trump family's various crypto ventures as selling access to and profiting from the presidency. Sens. Jeff Merkley and Chuck Schumer proposed legislation on May 6 to bar the president, vice president, administration officials, members of Congress, and their families from issuing or sponsoring crypto coins and currencies. 

Top investors in the meme coin $TRUMP will get to dine with President Donald Trump. The move is raising ethical questions, with defenders saying he's breaking no law, while some Democrats call his family crypto ventures “profoundly corrupt.”

“Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,” said Senator Merkley. “This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.”

Non-American holders of $TRUMP appear to be among those vying to win dinner with the president, according to an analysis by Bloomberg, raising concerns about foreign influence – as well as how invitees will be vetted. The organizers, a Trump-affiliated entity called Fight Fight Fight LLC, said that a background check would be mandatory. Foreigners are legally barred from donating to U.S. election campaigns and candidates. 

In a recent interview with NBC News' “Meet The Press,” Mr. Trump claimed he wasn't profiting from his family's crypto businesses. Asked if he had made money from his meme coin, he said “I haven't even looked.” Last Sunday, asked about Democratic lawmakers' accusations, he said that the U.S. needs to “dominate” crypto so that China doesn't, but didn't speak to his family's involvement. 

Meme coins are digital tokens based on popular internet memes. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, meme coins aren't forms of money and are marketed as collectibles, similar to baseball cards, that are traded within a dedicated community. But they also double as speculative investments. Their value is highly volatile, even compared to Bitcoin. 

Dogecoin began as a meme coin that Elon Musk referenced with the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Other coins feature cartoon characters or AI-generated images. Millions of meme coins are created and traded every year. 

Coin issuers earn money on sales and from trading fees. Since they cost virtually nothing to issue, the upside can be substantial, though most meme coins are thinly traded or not at all. 

More controversially, speculators who get early access to meme coins that soar in value can sell at higher prices, typically before coins plunge in value. Unlike stocks or other securities, meme coins aren't regulated and issuers don't have to provide disclosures to buyers. Critics say this allows for market manipulation by insiders who can time their buying and selling. 

Traders who bought $MELANIA in the minutes before it was first promoted on social media earned nearly $100 million in profits, according to an analysis by the Financial Times. In the minutes before Melania Trump formally announced the token's launch on Truth Social on Jan. 19, a small group of traders bought $2.6 million worth of coins. Most were then sold within 12 hours. 

The creators of $TRUMP include the Trump Organization and a Wyoming-based group called Celebration Cards LLC, whose ownership is opaque. The Trump-related entities are estimated to have already earned hundreds of millions of dollars from the sale and trading of the token. The entities also hold 80% of the 1 billion tokens that are being created, a holding potentially worth billions of dollars. Under the issuance rules, these tokens are subject to a lockup period that restricts when they can be sold. 

Mr. Trump already licenses a range of goods, from books to sneakers, that have generated substantial profits for his political committees and other entities he controls. A digital coin is no different, and while it may not seem appropriate for an acting head of state to make money on the side, it isn't clear that any laws have been broken. 

Holding an auction for a private reception with the president – as the $TRUMP contest does for top coin holders – raises more ethical and legal concerns, however. The Constitution's foreign emoluments clause bars presidents from accepting foreign gifts. In his first term, Mr. Trump was accused of violating this law but the Supreme Court dismissed the case after he left office. 

Even if all the $TRUMP contest winners are U.S. citizens, the auction is offering access to the president based on holdings of an asset issued by his family's company. Critics say this amounts to “pay to play” corruption using an untraceable digital currency. 

Republican Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, an ally of both Mr. Trump and the crypto industry, expressed concern about the contest. “This gives me pause,” she told NBC News, adding that Congress needs to set rules for meme coins and other digital assets. “This is the Wild West, and so when I hear things like this, my reaction is, we need to legislate so there are rules.” 

Others say that while the meme coin contest may be unseemly, it's no different from other fundraising efforts that have promised access to the president. In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton was criticized for inviting friends and supporters who had donated to the Democratic National Committee to stay overnight in the White House. 

That the $TRUMP holders are putting money into a private company and not a political committee may be a distinction without a difference, says Carol Goforth, a law professor at the University of Arkansas who studies the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Paying for a dinner seat “is the model for campaign finance and you'd be naive for thinking that this isn't working in a similar way.” 

Asked about the contest at the White House briefing Friday, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump “is abiding by all conflict of interest laws. The President has been incredibly transparent with his own personal financial obligations throughout the years.” 

Mr. Trump's sons control World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency company that launched last year and has marketed a currency called $WLFI. It recently issued a stablecoin, a digital currency tethered to a traditional currency. Last month, a state-backed investment firm in the United Arab Emirates acquired $2 billion in World Liberty Financial's stablecoin. It reportedly plans to invest it in Binance, a cryptocurrency firm that pleaded guilty in 2023 to violations of U.S. federal law and paid a $4 billion penalty. 

This transaction has been criticized by Democrats. In a joint letter to the acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Senator Merkley warned that World Liberty Financial “could be used as a backdoor for foreign kickbacks and bribes.” They also pointed to possible violations of the emoluments clause because MGX, the Emirati investment firm, has close ties to a foreign government. 

“The deal, if completed, would represent a staggering conflict of interest, one that may violate the Constitution and open our government to a startling degree of foreign influence,” they wrote. 

Eric Trump, speaking to Bloomberg TV during a visit to the UAE where he promoted World Liberty Financial, denied that he was coordinating with his father. “There are no conflicts because I don't work with the White House,” he said. 

As head of the executive branch, Mr. Trump oversees the agencies that regulate finance, including cryptocurrencies. His appointees have taken a far more hands-off approach to the industry than the Biden administration did. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission has eliminated a crypto enforcement program and dropped ongoing lawsuits and investigations into prominent crypto exchanges and trading platforms. 

Paul Atkins, the new SEC chair appointed by Mr. Trump, is seen as a pro-crypto regulator who has previously consulted for the industry. “We're seeing a profound shift in outlook” at the SEC, says Professor Goforth. 

Similarly, the Department of Justice has issued guidance that could benefit the industry. An April 8 directive from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche instructed prosecutors not to pursue criminal charges involving digital currencies unless they involved criminal organizations, drug cartels, or terrorist groups. Crypto has become a staple of online scams and extortion rackets.

Congress is in the process of coming up with a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which would represent a victory for the crypto industry, which has become a significant source of campaign contributions. The Senate Banking Committee voted last month to move the bipartisan GENIUS Act for a full vote. The act, which the Senate is expected to vote on before the Memorial Day recess, would establish clear rules for stablecoin issuers and make it easier to hold and invest in the tokens.

The revelations about the Trump family's stablecoin transactions led to calls this week for Democrats to block the bill unless it has stronger anti-corruption provisions. Instead, the legislation proposed by Senators Merkley and Schumer will be put up for a stand-alone vote before the GENIUS Act. Its prospects for passage are dim, however, as it is unlikely to attract any Republican support.

Coinbase (COIN) has its own strategy for BTC on the corporate balance sheet, but it's not a bitcoin maximalist play like that of Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR).

On the company's first quarter 2025 earnings call, CFO Alesia Haas revealed that Coinbase purchased $150 million in crypto, “predominantly bitcoin,” bringing its long-term investment portfolio to $1.3 billion, or 25% of net cash.

Haas, however, went out of her way to draw a line between Coinbase and firms that explicitly tie their corporate identity to holding bitcoin on the balance sheet.

“To be clear, we're an operating company,” she said. “But we do invest alongside the space.”

In other words, Coinbase isn't betting the company on bitcoin. On a Q&A call with retail investors, Armstrong said there was a temptation in its early days to put a lot of BTC on the balance sheet, but it was too risky. Crypto is volatile and, at the time, Coinbase was too young of a company to take that risk.  

Now, as a listed giant things have changed, but there's still not a need to go all-in on bitcoin. Coinbase is allocating profits from operations back into crypto assets, similarly to how a commodity firm might accumulate raw materials it understands deeply. The move is less Michael Saylor and more sector-aligned capital recycling.

In fact, Coinbase didn't even trumpet the purchase in its shareholder letter. The news only surfaced in response to a retail shareholder's question about “accruing hard crypto reserve assets.”

CEO Brian Armstrong didn't speak directly about the purchases, but he did offer a philosophical context. Coinbase, he reminded investors, isn't dabbling in crypto – it is crypto.

“We've been focused on crypto since the beginning, 12 years ago, and we continue to be focused there,” Armstrong said. “Crypto is eating financial services.”

For Armstrong, buying BTC is a byproduct of conviction and operational alignment and not a headline play, treasury pivot, or activist bet.

Coinbase isn't holding BTC to signal to markets some broader conviction, or become a proxy like MSTR. Behind the accounting language is something deeper: a long-view bet that holding Bitcoin, like building the rails beneath it, is simply part of Coinbase's job.

That's not a treasury strategy — it's something in the middle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","BTC, DOGE, ETH Price News: What's Next for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ether Ahead of US-China Trade Talks","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/05/10/dogecoin-surges-10-bitcoin-nears-104k-amid-renewed-risk-on-sentiment","Sat, 10 May 2025 09:48:21 GMT","

Bitcoin pushed past the six-figure mark for the first time in over two months, coming within a hair of $104,000 in early Asian hours Saturday, as crypto markets staged a sharp rebound on improving macro sentiment and Ethereum's latest network upgrade.

Dogecoin DOGE$0.23667 led the gains among majors with a 10% rally, while ether ETH$2,482.53 rose 3.5% following the successful implementation of its long-awaited Pectra upgrade, bringing weekly gains over 30%.

Other majors, including Solana SOL$172.67, Cardano ADA$0.83463, xrp XRP$2.44, and BNB Chain's BNB$656.47, rose between 2% and 6%, driven by a shift in investor sentiment from caution to risk-on.

The move follows a string of pro-crypto developments in the U.S. this week. On Wednesday, New Hampshire passed a bill allowing the state to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Arizona followed suit a day later with its own legislation supporting a crypto reserve. The state-level momentum comes as political leaders lean further into digital asset policy ahead of the November election in some states.

President Donald Trump's bullish remarks on upcoming U.S.-China trade talks also helped ease market jitters. The comments coincided with the U.S. and U.K. signing a fresh trade agreement that will remove reciprocal tariffs and lower duties on American goods, further lifting sentiment across equities and crypto alike.

“President Trump's optimistic outlook on this weekend's China trade talks is easing fears of an escalating trade war, encouraging traders to shift capital back into asset classes like cryptocurrencies,” said Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, in a message to CoinDesk. “This could very well drive bitcoin back towards its all-time high and potentially surpass it.”

BTC trades about 5% below its January record high of over $108,700 as of European morning hours on Saturday.

Analysts say the recent moves mark a decisive break from the sluggish price action that plagued altcoins through much of March and April.

“Traders believe the crypto industry may have finally found its second wind as a hedge against market uncertainty,” Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.

“Investors are changing their perspectives on crypto now that altcoins have departed from a negative trend and found buying pressure from a renewed risk-on sentiment,” Ruck added.

Ethereum's 30% rally this week is also being attributed to growing institutional interest and the momentum behind its Pectra upgrade, which introduces long-anticipated execution layer reforms aimed at boosting efficiency and scalability.

“The upgrade provides reforms Ethereum desperately needs to cement its position as a leading chain amidst growing competition,” BTSE's Mei said. “Given that Ethereum is trading well below its all-time high, we could see substantial upside in the coming weeks and months, especially as macro fears ease and institutions become more willing to allocate towards crypto and crypto ETFs.”

Still, traders are closely watching this weekend's U.S.-China trade negotiations. Talks are set to begin later on Saturday in Switzerland, and any signs of stalemate or renewed tension could undercut the current rally.

House Republicans unveiled a discussion draft of a market structure bill but all eyes this week were on the Senate, where a largely bipartisan effort to advance stablecoin legislation ran up against a wall.



PS: I'll be in Toronto next week for Consensus. In town? Come say hi.



You're reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.



Stablecoin and market structure bills are the two big things around crypto that Congress is expected to get to President Donald Trump's desk this year. There was a press conference by crypto and AI czar David Sacks with the chairs of the House and Senate committees. Everyone had this rough deadline of ""before the August recess.""

Of these two bills, the stablecoin legislation was supposed to be the easier lift. It's focused on just a part of the crypto sector, while the market structure bill will define how a much broader part of the industry operates and is overseen by federal regulators. And up until just over a week ago, the stablecoin bill was largely sailing through with few issues. Now — while it's still expected to become law — the timing of its passage is far less certain.

First thing's first: No one this reporter has spoken to this week thinks the Senate's stablecoin bill — the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act — is dead. According to multiple individuals familiar with the situation, lawmakers were already back to negotiating after Thursday's failed vote, and lawmakers could vote again as soon as next week — potentially even Monday.



Thursday's vote failed after Democrats raised an alarm last weekend that certain provisions around national security, the soundness of the financial system and accountability, though Republicans argued that ongoing stablecoin usage requires swift passage. U.S. President Donald Trump's profiting off of stablecoins also raised alarm bells for lawmakers, senators introducing multiple bills that would prevent the President from issuing financial assets, including the ""End Crypto Corruption Act,"" which would block all members of Congress, the president, vice president, other executive branch officials and their families from ""issuing, endorsing or sponsoring crypto assets.""



On Wednesday, one individual told CoinDesk that it appeared that a deal might be in place so that Democrats would get a vote on the End Crypto Corruption Act, either as an amendment to the GENIUS Act or as a standalone bill, ahead of the procedural vote on the GENIUS Act itself.



This ultimately did not happen, with lawmakers proceeding directly to the so-called cloture vote on Thursday; it fell 48-49.



The vote did not fail on party lines either: though no Democrats voted in favor of the bill, Republicans Josh Hawley and Rand Paul joined 46 Democrats in voting against the motion (Majority Leader John Thune initially voted in favor of the bill, but flipped in a procedural move that will let him bring the bill back for a vote later).



Among other issues was the fact that there was no bill text available at the time the vote kicked off.



The cloture vote, which would open 30 hours of debate, is likely the main piece of leverage Democrats have to try and get their priorities into the bill because it needs 60 Senators to pass. After the debate, there will be another cloture vote before the final passage vote, but it would be difficult for a lawmaker who voted to open debate to walk that back afterward, one of the individuals told CoinDesk.



Having their priorities sorted before getting to the final set of votes would also just generally provide more comfort to lawmakers, the individual said.



None of the individuals who spoke to CoinDesk expect that an actual provision blocking the U.S. President from issuing or being tied to an issuer of a stablecoin will become part of the final bill.



One of the individuals said ongoing negotiations are more focused on how foreign issuers are treated and anti-money laundering provisions.



A broader concern was that a hefty delay in passing the stablecoin legislation may slow down the process for advancing the market structure bill, which will rewrite the law around how the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange Commission oversee digital assets, including how cryptocurrencies might be defined as securities. A discussion draft was introduced in the House this week.



If the Senate votes on the stablecoin bill in the next week or so, it should not hold up the other bill, two individuals told CoinDesk.

CORRECTION (May 9, 11:58 UTC): Corrected headline, first bullet to say Trump-family linked firms profited millions from TRUMP token. Added details in the 11th paragraph about the creators of the token and their ties to trading revenue. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has come a long way since he said the value of crypto was “based on thin air” in 2019. So much so that he is now one of the sector's largest proponents, foraying into memecoins, DeFi, NFTs, and even stablecoins.

A new report by the State Democracy Defenders Fund estimates that Trump's family has increased their net worth by $2.9 billion thanks to crypto, and that now 40% of that net worth is being held in crypto assets. 

His deepening ties to the industry have reverberated across the political landscape, to the point that a broadly bipartisan stablecoin bill failed in a key vote Thursday after Democrats expressed concern about the extent to which he is profiting off the sector.

Trump's support helped spark a continued bull market after his election victory in November, a market that's been dominated by two trends: memecoins and institutional adoption of bitcoin via ETFs. While the latter is the province of, generally, institutional investors and providers, it's the memecoin business that puts retail investors at risk and is potentially ripe for exploitation.

On Thursday, Solidus Labs claimed that 98% of memecoins issued on the token creation platform pump.fun were rug pulls or pump-and-dump schemes. The platform had since refuted the report's claims. 

Another analysis by Chainalysis, cited by CNBC, suggested that the vast majority of TRUMP token holders lost money.

A memecoin is a type of crypto token with no inherent value, often based, as the name suggests, on a meme or cartoon character. Popular examples of this are dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB) and pepe (PEPE). The craze reached a climax in January when Trump touted his own TRUMP token on social media, followed by MELANIA— named after his wife.

TRUMP, which hit a day-one peak of $77.26, is now trading at $10.80, down a whopping 86%. MELANIA slumped even further, losing more than 97% of its value in four months to trade recently at 33 cents.

The hype around Trump's social media post led to a flurry of trading activity. Data from Chainalysis reveals that 760,000 wallets, mainly belonging to retail investors, lost money on the TRUMP token.

A small group of people, however, was immune to those losses. The Chainanalysis data show 58 wallets made profits in excess of $10 million. The token's creators netted a whopping $320 million in trading fees, although it's worth noting that around 5% of the fees went to the decentralized exchange Meteora, which hosted the launch.

CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC collectively own 80% of the TRUMP token's supply, subject to a 3-year unlocking schedule, according to the official website. CIC Digital LLC and Celebration Cards LLC, the owners of Fight Fight Fight LLC, will also receive revenue derived from trading activities of the token, the website said. 

MELANIA was allegedly scooped up by a group of insiders before it was advertised on social media in a technique known as “sniping.” This group of insiders made $100 million on MELANIA tokens by swapping tokens for USDC after its price doubled, according to an investigation by the Financial Times.

One insider with access to the tokens before they went live was Kelsier Ventures' Hayden Davis, who revealed his involvement during an interview in February. Davis was also the brains behind the botched LIBRA stablecoin that brought political chaos to Argentina.

In an interview with Coffeezilla in February, Davis said: “This is going to put me in a lot of danger. Which is fine, I'll answer. I was a part of it [MELANIA]. I think the team did want to snipe it because of how big the snipe was on TRUMP. We definitely weren't the big sniper, that was what we were trying to avoid. We didn't take any liquidity out, zero.”

Trump's foray into crypto isn't limited to memecoins.

The U.S. president's family is also behind World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that raised around $590 million across two pre-sale rounds earlier this year. It raised funds at a time when the market was resting around all-time highs, so that figure of raised crypto is now much less. Arkham Intelligence data suggests that World Liberty Financial holds around $103 million worth of crypto.

Trump also attempted to ride the coattails of non-fungible token (NFT) hype in 2022, releasing a series of cartoons depicting the president as a superhero or a cartoon character. Trump made around $8 million from rolling out these NFTs, according to financial disclosures.

Most recently, there was the crypto dinner event, which saw Trump host a group of 25 TRUMP holders to a private dinner and tour of his Virginia golf club. A Bloomberg report reveals that 19 of those 25 holders were either foreign entities or used an offshore exchange banned in the U.S.

He's set to host another dinner for the top 220 holders of his token later in May. U.S. Senators Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass. called for Trump's impeachment, asking the U.S. Office of Government Ethics to investigate whether Trump violated federal ethics rules by inviting top investors.

The Trump family did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

 Robert Kiyosaki calls on Americans to reject fiat currency and embrace Bitcoin, gold, and silver, warning that central banks are eroding wealth. 

Robert Kiyosaki, businessman and best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is once again sounding the alarm on the dangers of centralized monetary policy, urging his followers to abandon what he calls “fake money” and adopt alternatives like Bitcoin, gold, and silver.

In a May 10 post on X, Kiyosaki backed a hardline stance against central banking systems, particularly the Federal Reserve, while quoting former US Congressman Ron Paul.

Ron Paul, a longtime critic of the Fed and author of End the Fed, described interest rate setting by central banks as “price fixing,” equating it to socialist and Marxist economic control.

Paul warned that such mechanisms erode personal wealth and undermine economic freedom — a sentiment that aligns closely with Kiyosaki's long-held concerns.

“Fake money leads to dishonest money, dishonest statistics, dishonest accounting, dishonest balance sheets, dishonest compensation, dishonest relations, dishonest leaders, and corruption in everyday life,” Kiyosaki wrote.

He called on Americans to “fight back” by opting out of fiat systems and instead embracing decentralized stores of value like Bitcoin (BTC) and precious metals.

Kiyosaki's disdain for fiat currency is not new. He has repeatedly criticized the US dollar, labeling it a “dying” currency inflated by government spending and central bank manipulation.

His financial philosophy, rooted in Austrian economics and personal sovereignty, champions assets that cannot be debased or politically controlled.

Kiyosaki has long argued that bearer assets like gold, silver, and more recently Bitcoin, are critical hedges against inflation and key to long-term generational wealth accumulation through economic cycles.

“Don't work or save fake money,” he advised. “Get on your own decentralized gold, silver, and Bitcoin standard.”

In an April 18 post, Kiyosaki forecasted that Bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2035 as the US dollar continues to lose value to inflationary monetary policies.

“I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million, gold will be $30,000, and silver $3,000 a coin,” he said.

Kiyosaki is not the only one expressing confidence in Bitcoin's future.

In February 2025, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood said that Bitcoin could hit $1.5 million by 2030 if demand for the digital asset continues to grow.

More recently, on Dec. 10, Eric Trump delivered the keynote speech at the Bitcoin MENA event in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and predicted that Bitcoin would hit $1 million due to its scarcity.

 Michael Saylor says those “less committed” to Bitcoin took the opportunity to exit the market after Bitcoin's price surged. 

Strategy founder Michael Saylor says Bitcoin hasn't reached $150,000 yet because holders without a long-term outlook have been selling off while a new cohort of investors are beginning to enter the market.

“I think we're going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.

Saylor said, “Lots of non-economically interested parties are rotating out of the asset.” However, at the same time, “a new cohort of investors are entering.” 

“A lot of Bitcoin, for whatever reason, was left in the hands of the governments and the hands of lawyers, and in the hands of bankruptcy trustees,” he added.

Saylor said that many of these trustees do not have a “10-year investors mindset,” and as Bitcoin's (BTC) price began to rally, they took advantage and “thought this is a good exit point to get liquidity.”

After Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $109,000 on Jan. 20 just hours before US President Donald Trump's presidential inauguration, it experienced a downtrend, falling as low as $76,273 on April 9, before starting to show signs of recovery.

On May 8, Bitcoin reclaimed $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 1 after US President Donald Trump proposed tariffs. The recent price surge has pushed Strategy's Bitcoin holdings to 50.27% above their average Bitcoin purchase price of $68,569. At the time of publication, the firm holds 555,450 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $57.23 billion, according to Saylor Tracker data.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $564.7 in inflows over the past five trading days, according to Farside data.

Meanwhile, Saylor said he's not surprised the US government hasn't yet bought Bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, which Trump signed an executive order for on March 7. The reserve is holding Bitcoin that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings.

However, Saylor didn't anticipate their stance to quickly change so positively following Trump's inauguration.

“I was surprised that the US embraced Bitcoin as radically as it has over the last six months. I think I didn't expect all the Cabinet members to be so enthusiastic,” he said.

 Anthony Scaramucci says a “million dollar Bitcoin” will come down to a SWF saying, “Ok, this is part of the infrastructure of the world's financial services.” 

Sovereign Wealth Funds are already gaining exposure to Bitcoin, but significant allocations won't happen until the United States establishes clearer regulations for the digital assets industry, says SkyBridge founder Anthony Scaramucci.

“I think they are buying it, I think they are buying it on the margin,” Scaramucci, former White House director of communications during US President Donald Trump's first term, said on Anthony Pompliano's podcast on May 8.

“I don't think it is going to be a gigantic groundswell of buying until we greenlight legislation in the United States,” he added. Scaramucci previously said in a February interview with the Financial Times that he expects the US government to propose crypto legislation in November.

SWFs are government-owned investment funds that manage national savings, often built from surplus revenues like oil profits or trade gains. Norway has the largest SWF in the world, with approximately $1.73 trillion in assets under management, followed by China with $1.33 trillion, according to data from Visual Capitalist.

Bitcoin's (BTC) market cap is approximately $2.05 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.

Scaramucci said that if stablecoin regulation is passed, clear guidance is provided for traditional banks to custody of Bitcoin and other digital assets, and there's progress on tokenizing stocks and bonds, a significant wave of buying from Sovereign Wealth Funds is likely to follow.

“Then I will tell you that there will be large blocks of buying, or people worth 10, 20, 30 trillion dollars, buying a half a billion dollars of Bitcoin, buying a billion of Bitcoin,” Scaramucci said.

“But if you wanna see a million dollar Bitcoin, that's when someone at a sovereign says ok, this is part of the infrastructure of the world's financial services architecture,” he added.

ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood recently said that the chances of Bitcoin reaching a seven-figure price by 2030 have increased.

“We actually think the odds have gone up that our bull case will be the right number because of what is becoming the institutionalization of this new asset class,” Woods said in February.

Math Puzzle: Find the Factorial

By Martin Gardner 

The equation n! = 6! × 7! relates three factorials. How large is n?

The equation can be written as n! = 7! × 6!

= 7! × 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6

= 7! × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × (2 × 3)

= 7! × (2 × 4) × (3 × 3) × (2 × 5)

= 7! × 8 × 9 × 10

= 10!

Therefore, n = 10.

The discovery reveals an unexpected connection to the ancient Silk Road.

A 2018 reconstruction project of a hillside road in the capital of the Shanxi Province led to unearthing the tomb, but archaeologists hadn't really reported on the discovery until recently.

Long Zhen, director of the Jinyang Ancient City Research Institute of the Taiyuan Cultural Relics Protection Research Institute, says, according to a translation from the state-run news outlet Xinhua, that the tomb has pairs of figures painted on both sides of the tomb door and that paintings of people continue throughout the tomb, including everything from women pushing stones to grind flour to men making pasta, women using oranges to fetch water, and men stepping on hammers to help pound rice. 

Experts believe the tomb was owned by a man who died in 736 AD at age 63, during the middle of the Tang dynasty, which ran from 618 to 907 AD. He was buried in the tomb along with his wife. 

The eight scenes painted on the tomb are in the “figures under the tree” style, trendy at the time, which—not unlike the name suggests—shows daily activities occurring under artistically rendered trees. The scenes offer a fresh view on what daily life and responsibilities were during the Tang dynasty. 

The figures painted on the tomb all appeared to be of the Han ethnicity—except for one: a figure painted with blond hair and a beard.

Victor Xiong, professor of history at Western Michigan University, who wasn't involved in the discovery, told Live Science the “Westerner,” painted in the tomb leading camels, likely represented someone from Central Asia. “Based on his facial features and outfit style,” Xiong said, “we can identify him as a ‘Westerner,' likely a Sogdian from Central Asia.”

The Sogdian people lived in what is now modern-day Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and were active along Silk Road trading routes.

The murals coat the entire tomb, save for the floor. The South China Morning Post wrote that the artwork is styled similarly to other Tang-era murals with strong outlines, simple shading, and two-dimensional artwork. 

Zhen believes the style coincides with the paintings found in the tomb of Wang Shenzi, a key figure in the late 800s during the fall of the Tang dynasty and rise of the Song dynasty. The styles so closely match, it may have been the same painter. 

Not only was the small, brick tomb covered in paintings, but the gates, corridor, and tomb pedestal holding the coffins were all adorned as well. The domed ceiling strays from the rest of the motif and features a dragon-like image. Figures painted at the gate may represent guardians, with yellow robes and swords tied around their waist. 

Other scenes include a woman in a brightly colored dress leading four horses while a man stands nearby with a whip, women and men holding boxes or ceremonial bowls tucked to their chests, and an old man shown in various scenes reaching toward a snake, carrying an axe and firewood, and holding a cup. The paintings also feature plenty of trees, flowers, mountains, and livestock. Most of the figures throughout the tomb appear to be the same two people, leading the archaeologists to surmise they were the owners of the tomb.

The scenes painted on the mural offered some “never-before-seen” examples of Tang-era chores, Xiong told Live Science, and because the figures were most likely the owners of the tomb, probably depicted the minutiae of their daily lives. But the Westerner's presence adds a bit of mystery to the otherwise staid way of living for the long-deceased man and woman.

Metrics details

The discovery of bifunctional degradation activating compounds (BiDACs) has led to the development of a new class of drugs that promote the clearance of their protein targets. BiDAC-induced ubiquitination is generally believed to direct cytosolic and nuclear proteins to proteolytic destruction by proteasomes. However, pathways that govern the degradation of other classes of BiDAC targets, such as integral membrane and intraorganellar proteins, have not been investigated in depth. In this study we use morphological profiling and CRISPR/Cas9 genetic screens to investigate the mechanisms by which BiDACs induce the degradation of plasma membrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) EGFR and Her2. We find that BiDAC-dependent ubiquitination triggers the trafficking of RTKs from the plasma membrane to lysosomes for degradation. Notably, functional proteasomes are required for endocytosis of RTKs upstream of the lysosome. Additionally, our screen uncovers a non-canonical function of the lysosome-associated arginine/lysine transporter PQLC2 in EGFR degradation. Our data show that BiDACs can target proteins to proteolytic machinery other than the proteasome and motivate further investigation of mechanisms that govern the degradation of diverse classes of BiDAC targets.

A mechanistic understanding of the relationship between extracellular signaling and cell proliferation has led to the development of pharmacological agents that mitigate the progression of human cancers. This has been exemplified by the development of antibodies and small molecules that block aberrant pro-growth signals generated by overexpressed receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) proteins at the cell surface. Antibodies that target the extracellular domains of oncogenic RTKs, such as those found in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family members EGFR (also known as Her1) and Her2, inhibit RTK signaling by competing with extracellular RTK ligands for receptor binding, by inhibiting RTK dimerization, and by inducing RTK internalization and degradation1. More recently, cell-permeable small-molecule kinase inhibitors have been utilized to directly inhibit RTK activity and potentiate the anti-tumor effects of antibodies2,3.

Extracellular ligand binding induces dimerization of RTK monomers and subsequent cross-phosphorylation of their intracellular domains. This mechanism has motivated the development of therapeutics that inhibit RTK dimerization. In particular, Her2 lacks a ligand binding domain and thus can be activated through dimerization with Her3 or EGFR bound to their respective ligands, neuregulin and EGF4. The Her2 antibody pertuzumab, unlike the original therapeutic Her2 antibody trastuzumab, inhibits Her2/Her3 heterodimerization and is used in cases where trastuzumab and kinase inhibitor therapies have lost efficacy5. Similarly, the covalent kinase inhibitor neratinib also triggers Her2 degradation and may prevent dimerization of Her2 with other Her receptors6. Thus, therapeutic modalities that inhibit the scaffolding functions of Her2 may overcome the resistance that develops to other classes of Her2 inhibitors.

Recent advances in the development of bifunctional degradation activating compounds (BiDACs) have enabled the conversion of existing small molecules into potent degraders. These molecules recruit E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes to target proteins, resulting in their polyubiquitination and proteolysis by ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathways7. This mechanism presents opportunities to target proteins that also have essential scaffolding functions, since in theory, appending polyubiquitin chains on the target protein may be sufficient to trigger its degradation. In agreement with this idea, BiDACs targeting BRD4, an epigenetic regulator that recruits transcriptional machinery to histones, triggered BRD4 degradation and exhibited increased potency relative to BRD4 inhibitors in hematological cancer models8,9. This concept was investigated with respect to RTKs using the small molecule lapatinib, which inhibits the kinase domains of Her2 and EGFR. A BiDAC consisting of lapatinib conjugated to a molecule that binds the E3 substrate adapter VHL triggered degradation of Her2 and EGFR. As with BRD4, degradation of these RTKs resulted in a more sustained inhibition of downstream signaling and a greater impact on cell viability than inhibition alone10. However, an unbiased comparison of the effects of RTK inhibition and degradation on cell physiology has not been performed.

The consequences of cellular perturbations can be explored using morphological profiling, a method that utilizes high-throughput microscopy and machine learning-based image analysis to establish morphological phenotypes representing cellular states induced by chemical, genetic, or environmental perturbations. Prevalent techniques such as cell painting utilize a multiplexed panel of dyes to broadly label organelles and other cellular structures11,12. Machine learning-based image analysis tools are used to extract and quantitatively compare information from microscopy images, and morphological profiles derived from such data have been shown to be expressive, high-dimensional representations of cell state analogous to gene expression profiles13. Due to its integrative and information-rich nature, morphological profiling presents a promising approach for unbiased discovery of new phenotypes, accessing signals in the data that lie below the threshold of human perception14,15.

In this study, we ask if BiDAC-dependent degradation of Her2 produces distinct cellular morphologies when compared to other modalities that inhibit Her2 signaling. We find that Her2 BiDACs induce distinctive changes in Her2 localization and levels. Functional genomic analysis of BiDAC-dependent degradation reveals that the localization changes reflect RTK internalization and degradation in lysosomes. In addition, we show that degradation of EGFR partially depends on a non-canonical function of the lysosome-associated amino acid transporter, PQLC2. These data suggest that BiDACs can induce degradation of their targets through multiple ubiquitin-dependent pathways.

To investigate the phenotypic consequences of Her2 degradation, we used a previously reported BiDAC that consists of the Her2/EGFR inhibitor lapatinib linked to a VHL binding group (Lap-VHL) (Supplementary Fig. 1a). We also synthesized a Her2-specific BiDAC by replacing lapatinib with a tucatinib warhead linked to a VHL binding group by an azetidinyl piperidine linker (Tuc-VHL) (Supplementary Fig. 2a and Supplementary Information). Treatment of two Her2-amplified cell lines, SKBR3 and SKOV3, with Lap-VHL resulted in degradation of Her2 and EGFR in a dose and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, B and Supplementary Fig. 1b–e). Exposure to Tuc-VHL resulted in degradation of Her2 (Fig. 1A, B) and inhibition of Her2 kinase activity (Supplementary Fig. 2b), without impacting EGFR levels (Fig. 1A, B and Supplementary Fig. 2c–f). Lap-VHL and Tuc-VHL containing a non-functional VHL binding group (VHLInactive) inhibited Her2 kinase activity but failed to induce Her2 degradation (Fig. 1A, B and Supplementary Fig. 2b).

Active BiDACs reduced SKBR3 and SKOV3 viability (Fig. 1C, D), inhibited SKBR3 growth, (Supplementary Fig. 3a), and induced apoptosis in SKBR3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3b–d) more potently than their inactive counterparts. This difference was most pronounced when cells were treated at doses that induced Her2 degradation (Fig. 1A, B). Thus, active and inactive Her2 BiDACs can be used to compare the consequences of Her2 degradation and inhibition.

To create unbiased morphological profiles of Her2 loss of function, we utilized a modified version of the cell painting protocol12, combining probes for the nucleus, Golgi, mitochondria, and actin with an immunofluorescence probe for Her2 (Fig. 1E). As expected, Tuc-VHL induced a dose and time-dependent decrease in Her2 signal (Fig. 1F). We collected images of cells treated with a panel of Her2 inhibitors to contextualize the effects of BiDAC-based inhibitors. This panel included Her2-binding antibodies (Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab), covalent and allosteric inhibitors (Neratinib, BDTX-189), inhibitors of downstream kinases PI3K (Alpelisib) and AKT (Ipatasertib), in addition to Tucatinib, Lapatinib, and the VHLInactive compounds (Supplementary Fig. 4). Given the time-dependency of BiDAC-induced Her2 degradation, cells were imaged across multiple time points and treatment doses.

A machine learning model was trained to describe each image as a vector in a high-dimensional space. The averaged vector representations for each treatment condition were clustered and visualized on a two-dimensional projection (Fig. 1G). Points in proximity to each other suggest treatment conditions that produce similar morphological phenotypes. For SKOV3 cells treated for 48 h, DMSO controls were localized to the center of the projection (Fig. 1G, gray outline) while inhibitors of downstream PI3K and AKT kinases produced distinctive, dose-dependent phenotypic trajectories in the lower right quadrant (Fig. 1G, purple outlines). In contrast, the BiDAC warheads Lapatinib and Tucatinib induced phenotypes that clustered together at the lower left quadrant, suggesting that these non-covalent Her2 inhibitors do not produce distinct cell states despite their differential specificity for EGFR (Fig. 1G, green outline). The active BiDACs formed a distinct cluster at the top of the projection which was adjacent to the cluster formed by Neratinib, a Her2 covalent inhibitor previously shown to both inhibit Her2 and trigger its degradation6 (Fig. 1G, red outline). The covalent inhibitor BDTX-189 appeared at the bottom of the plot away from Neratinib, indicating that inhibitors of the same target can produce distinct phenotypic profiles (Fig. 1G, blue outline). Active BiDACs administered at higher doses were dispersed away from the primary cluster, suggesting that they induced distinct degradation-dependent phenotypes. Lastly, we observed that Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab induced their own phenotypes that were not adjacent to any of the small molecule inhibitors (Fig. 1G, orange and yellow outlines), consistent with the distinct modes by which these antibodies disrupt Her2 activation. Morphological profiles generated for SKBR3 cells, which are more sensitive to Her2 inhibitors, resembled those for SKOV3, indicating that the clustering patterns were not dependent on degree of dependency on Her2 signaling (Fig. 1H).

Distinct, time-dependent clustering of active BiDAC-treated wells was correlated with the time required to achieve Her2 degradation (Fig. 1F). Indeed, distinct active BiDAC phenotypes were evident at some doses after only 6 h of treatment (Fig. 2A, B, red outlines). To determine the extent to which these phenotypes depend on Her2 staining, we trained models lacking Her2 imaging information. These models showed that active BiDAC clusters were less distinctive and were closer to the VHLInactive BiDACs in the latent space of the model (Fig. 2C–F), a result that was observed in both cell lines at early and late time points (Supplementary Figs. 5 and  6). Upon manual examination of the images, we observed that BiDACs induced formation of Her2-postive puncta (Fig. 2G). These results suggest that changes in Her2 levels and localization are the primary features that account for distinct morphological phenotypes induced by active BiDACs.

G Representative fluorescence microscopy images of SKOV3 cells treated with the indicated drugs for 6 h. n = 45,000 cells were imaged for each treatment condition. Scale bar, 20 μm. For T-SNE plots, dose order represents increasing concentrations of drugs.

The unexpected relocalization of Her2 observed after treatment with functional BiDACs suggested that this phenotype is mechanistically related to RTK degradation. To investigate the mechanisms that govern BiDAC-induced RTK degradation in depth, we used a functional genomics approach that employed SKOV3 cells expressing Cas9 and GFP/RFP knocked-in at one or more Her2 loci and at both EGFR loci (Supplementary Fig. 8a), yielding expression of Her2-GFP and EGFR-RFP (RTK-FP). Treatment of RTK-FP cells with Lap-VHL or Tuc-VHL induced the degradation of the expected RTKs (Fig. 3A, B). Treatment with EGF, which binds to and downregulates expression of EGFR, resulted in degradation of EGFR-RFP but not Her2-GFP (Fig. 3C). Lap-VHL-induced degradation of both RTKs was partially blocked by the addition of a competing VHL-binding molecule (Fig. 3D), consistent with dependence of RTK-FP degradation on VHL recruitment. Thus, RTK-FPs, like untagged RTKs, are amenable to degradation by BiDACs.

To perform the genetic screen, we infected RTK-FP cells with a whole genome CRISPR library containing six single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) per gene. Ten days after infection, cells were treated with 1 µM Lap-VHL, which resulted in a 70% or greater decrease in RTK-FP levels after 24 hs (Fig. 3A, E). Cells that failed to degrade RTK-FPs, defined as those having the 0.5-1% highest RFP or GFP fluorescence levels, were enriched by cell sorting in two separate screens (Fig. 3F). To determine the degree of sgRNA enrichment in the sorted populations, libraries from the sorted and the bulk unsorted populations were prepared from extracted genomic DNA, analyzed by next generation sequencing and compared using MAGeCK analysis (Supplementary Data 1 and  2)16.

Cells that failed to degrade RTK-FPs expressed sgRNAs targeting key E3 complex components, including VHL, the Cullin scaffolding protein CUL2, and the elongin B/C adapters TCEB2 and TCEB117 (Fig. 3G–I). In addition, we detected enrichment of sgRNAs targeting ubiquitin, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 (E1), and the Cullin-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) UBE2R2. Deletion of UBE2R2 partially inhibited degradation of RTK-FPs, consistent with the ability of the CUL2 ligase complex to function with multiple E2 enzymes18 (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c). We also identified core neddylation machinery necessary for activation of cullin E3s, which consists of NEDD8, the heterodimeric NAE1-UBA3 NEDD8 activating enzyme and the UBE2M NEDD8 conjugating enzyme19. Interestingly, we identified all nine subunits of the signalosome, which functions in the removal of NEDD8 from Cullin scaffolds (Fig. 3I). This finding is consistent with a previous study which demonstrated that perturbation of the signalosome complex prevents BiDAC-mediated degradation by triggering the autodegradation of E3 substrate receptors20. We were surprised that sgRNAs targeting the proteasome were not enriched in our screens. Instead, we found enrichment of guides targeting multiple Vo and V1 subunits of the lysosomal ATPase (V-ATPase) and its accessory subunit ATP6AP121 (Fig. 3J), suggesting that BiDAC-induced degradation of RTKs is mediated by the endolysosomal system.

Lysosomal proteolysis requires acidification of lysosomes by the V-ATPase. To investigate the role of lysosomes in BiDAC-induced RTK degradation, we treated RTK-FP cells with the V-ATPase inhibitor, Bafilomycin-A1 (Baf-A1). Baf-A1 inhibited RTK degradation by Lap-VHL (Fig. 4A, B and Supplementary Fig. 8b) and Her2 degradation by Tuc-VHL (Fig. 4C). Treatment with the E1 inhibitor MLN-7243 and the proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib also blocked RTK-FP degradation (Fig. 4A, D–F). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), which also disrupts lysosomal pH, inhibited RTK-FP degradation to a similar extent as Baf-A1 (Fig. 4G–I). To determine if BiDACs trigger trafficking of RTKs to lysosomes, we imaged RTK-FP cells expressing the lysosomal marker LAMP1-SNAP. In untreated cells, RTKs were present at plasma membrane projections and colocalized with LAMP1-SNAP-positive lysosomes (Fig. 4J, K and Supplementary Fig. 9a). Lap-VHL induced relocalization of RTKs to lysosomes, consistent with the BiDAC-dependent changes in Her2 localization observed by morphological profiling (Fig. 2G). Concurrent treatment with Baf-A1 resulted in formation of enlarged LAMP1-SNAP-positive lysosomes containing undegraded RTK-FP (Fig. 4J and Supplementary Fig. 9b). Internalized EGFR-RFP also colocalized with the late endosome marker SNAP-RAB7A, confirming that BiDACs trigger delivery of RTK-FPs to lysosomes through the canonical endocytic pathway (Supplementary Fig. 9c). We asked if inhibition of EGFR-RFP degradation by inhibitors of the lysosome and the ubiquitin-proteasome system was common to EGF, which binds to EGFR and triggers its degradation by the endolysosomal pathway22. EGFR-RFP levels in cells treated with EGF were partially stabilized by Baf-A1 but completely stabilized by HCQ and Carfilzomib (Fig. 4L), suggesting that BiDACs and EGF induce EGFR degradation by similar mechanisms.

Our results raised the possibility that BiDACs trigger RTK degradation by both lysosome and proteasome-dependent pathways. Alternatively, inhibition of one pathway may impact RTK degradation by the other. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined how the localization of RTK-FPs changes in response to BiDACs when used in combination with degradation inhibitors. First, we measured surface RTK levels by staining cells with antibodies against EGFR and Her2 (Fig. 5A). Treatment with BiDACs resulted in a decrease in levels of surface RTKs (Fig. 5B–D). This decrease was not blocked by Baf-A1, consistent with internalization of RTK-FPs and delivery to lysosomes under these conditions (Fig. 4J). Interestingly, inhibition of ubiquitination or proteasome activity resulted in surface retention of RTK-FPs (Fig. 5B–D). Similar effects on EGFR-RFP levels were observed after treatment with EGF, though in agreement with prior studies23, these inhibitors did not completely block EGFR-RFP internalization (Fig. 5E). To track changes in RTK-FP localization, we imaged cells treated with BiDACs and degradation inhibitors by time lapse microscopy. Lap-VHL, but not Lap-VHLInactive, triggered appearance of RTK-FP puncta within 2 h of treatment, which decreased in abundance over the next 8 h (Fig. 5F–H). Cotreatment with Carfilzomib or MLN-7243 prevented RTK-FP clearance and puncta formation, resulting in retention of RTK-FPs at the plasma membrane. In contrast, cotreatment with Baf-A1 did not inhibit puncta formation over time (Fig. 5G, H). Appearance of Her2-GFP-positive puncta was most evident after Baf-A1 treatment, likely due to dequenching of GFP fluorescence associated with the Baf-A1-induced increase in lysosomal pH (Fig. 5G). Together, these data show that proteasome inhibition prevents degradation of RTKs by blocking BiDAC-induced internalization.

The graph shows the mean ± SD fold change in the K48-ubiquitin signal in the affinity purifications, which was normalized to levels of purified Her2-GFP. The data was obtained from three independent experiments. **p = 0.0083, *p = 0.0248, ns not significant by one-way ANOVA. For (B–H), cells were pretreated for 30 min with degradation inhibitors prior to addition of BiDACs. P-values calculated by ANOVA were adjusted using Tukey's multiple comparisons test. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Inhibition of the proteasome results in accumulation of polyubiquitin chains and depletion of free, unconjugated ubiquitin24. We reasoned that this decrease in free ubiquitin may prevent BiDAC-induced RTK ubiquitination and subsequent internalization. To assess the ubiquitination status of Her2, we immunoprecipitated Her2-GFP and determined the levels of Her2-associated K48-linked ubiquitin. Treatment with active Lap-VHL resulted in an increase in K48 ubiquitin chains that were copurified with Her2-GFP (Fig. 5I, J). Cotreatment with Carfilzomib blocked the BiDAC-induced increase in Her2-associated polyubiquitin chains, despite causing the expected accumulation of total polyubiquitin chains (Fig. 5I). Thus, proteasome inhibitor may block BiDAC-induced RTK internalization by blocking RTK ubiquitination.

We found that sgRNAs targeting the amino acid transporter PQLC2 (encoded by the SLC66A1 gene) were enriched in cells that failed to degrade EGFR-RFP (Fig. 6A). PQLC2 localizes to the lysosomal membrane where it transports the cationic amino acids (CAA) lysine, arginine and histidine from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol25,26. Deletion of PQLC2 in RTK-FP cells (PQLC2KO), confirmed by sequencing its genomic locus (Fig. 6B), did not strongly impact basal EGFR-RFP expression levels (Fig. 6C). However, EGFR-RFP degradation by Lap-VHL was reduced in PQLC2KO relative to control cells (Fig. 6C, D). Deletion of PQLC2 also inhibited EGFR-RFP degradation in response to EGF (Fig. 6E, F). We reasoned that loss of PQLC2 may block EGFR-RFP internalization, trafficking, or proteolysis in lysosomes. Imaging analysis revealed that PQLC2KO cells had more internalized EGFR-RFP and had more residual EGFR-RFP in lysosomes following treatment with Lap-VHL (Fig. 6G, H). Deletion of PQLC2 did not impact the rate of BiDAC-induced RTK internalization (Fig. 6I). These data indicate that loss of PQLC2 inhibits lysosomal proteolysis of EGFR-RFP.

PQLC2 contains two proline-glutamine (PQ) loop domains that are critical for its CAA transport function (Fig. 7A)27. PQLC2 also recruits the C9ORF72-SMCR8-WDR41 (CSW) complex to lysosomes by binding to WDR41, an interaction that is enhanced when cells are starved of CAA28. Two dileucine motifs mediate the localization of PQLC2 to lysosomes29. To determine which functions of PQLC2 are necessary for EGFR-RFP degradation, we expressed doxycycline (dox)-inducible PQLC2-Flag variants in PQLC2KO cells (Fig. 7B). PQLC2-Flag mutants were localized to puncta that were morphologically similar to those formed by wild type (WT) PQLC2 with the exception of PQLC2 (L288A/L289A)-Flag, which was present at peripheral structures consistent with the plasma membrane (Fig. 7C). In the absence of dox, EGFR-RFP degradation by Lap-VHL was attenuated in most cells, but a small population of cells exhibited more EGFR-RFP degradation due to leaky PQLC2 expression from the dox-inducible promoter (Fig. 7D). Dox-dependent induction of WT PQLC2 expression in all cells fully restored EGFR-RFP degradation to that of control cells (Fig. 7D, E). Surprisingly, expression of PQLC2 variants that contain inactivating mutations in their PQ domains (P55L and P201L)27 resulted in complete rescue of EGFR-RFP degradation (Fig. 7F). Similarly, we observed rescue by PQLC2 variants containing mutations that disrupt binding to WDR41 (F49A, Y105A, and Y195A)29, and the CSW complex (Fig. 7G). Lastly, partial mis-localization of PQLC2 to the plasma membrane through mutation of its dileucine motifs (L127A/L128A and L288A/L289A) resulted in complete rescue (Fig. 7H), though a fraction of dileucine-mutant PQLC2 was still present at lysosomes (see Fig. 8H below). Together, these results indicate that PQLC2 regulates EGFR-RFP degradation by a mechanism that is not governed by its known biological functions.

We observed that WT and mutant PQLC2 migrated at a size of ~15–18 kD by SDS-PAGE, at half of its predicted molecular weight of 32 kD (Fig. 7B). We reasoned that PQLC2-Flag undergoes cleavage, which yields a C-terminal fragment that is detected by the anti-Flag antibody. To investigate this possibility, we generated PQLC2KO cells that expressed Myc and Flag tags at the C or N-terminus (Myc-PQLC2-Flag or Flag-PQLC2-Myc) and analyzed expression of the resulting N and C-terminally tagged versions. C-terminally Flag or Myc-tagged PQLC2 migrated at the reduced size (Fig. 7I). However, we failed to detect the N-terminal tags (Fig. 7J). To determine the putative cleavage site, PQLC2-Flag was purified by immunoprecipitation and analyzed using Edman sequencing (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b). Ten amino acids corresponding to residues 172-181 were identified at the N-terminus, indicating potential cleavage after a glutamic acid residue that resides within a predicted intralysosomal loop (Supplementary Fig. 10c). Mutation of residues directly adjacent to the putative cleavage site did not impact the size of PQLC2-Flag, and a fragment containing only the residues C-terminal to the cleavage site was not expressed (Fig. 7K). Mutation of a larger segment of the intralysosomal loop produced a protein that migrated at ~30 kD (Fig. 7K), confirming that this region contains the cleavage site. Expression of the cleavage-deficient mutant in PQLC2KO cells rescued BiDAC-dependent EGFR-RFP degradation (Fig. 7L).

We were surprised that the C-terminal cleavage product of full-length PQLC2 was sufficient to rescue lysosomal degradation of EGFR-RFP. To confirm that the cleaved form behaves like the putative full-length protein in cells, we determined the identity of its binding partners by co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometric analysis. Consistent with previous reports28, WT but not PQ domain mutant PQLC2-Flag copurified with WDR41 (Supplementary Fig. 11a) and other components of the CSW complex (Supplementary Fig. 11b, Supplementary Data 3 and  4). However, both WT and mutant PQLC2 co-purified with V0 subunits of the V-ATPase, including AT6V0A1 and ATP6BV0D1 (Supplementary Fig. 11c). These data indicate that the cleaved form of PQLC2 can still bind its partners and suggest that the C-terminal product alone can rescue EGFR-RFP degradation, albeit by an unknown mechanism.

Given the interaction of PQLC2 with subunits of the V-ATPase, we asked if loss of PQLC2 impacts lysosomal pH. We exploited the pH-sensitive fluorescence lifetime properties of mScarlet fluorescent protein30 by generating PQLC2 null cells expressing mScarlet-LAMP1 (PQLC2KO-pH), which localizes mScarlet to the lysosomal lumen. Incubation of PQLC2KO-pH or control-pH cells in buffers of increasing pH containing ionophores resulted in a corresponding increase in mScarlet lifetime (Fig. 8A) across a range of pH 4 to pH 6 (Fig. 8B, C). When cells were cultured in complete media, mScarlet-LAMP1 lifetime was longer in PQLC2KO-pH than control-pH cells, (Fig. 8D), which indicated that deletion of PQLC2 resulted in a higher lysosomal pH (Fig. 8E). PQLC2KO-pH cells also contained significantly enlarged lysosomes (Fig. 8F). To determine if the elevated pH and size of PQLC2-deficient lysosomes is associated with a general defect in lysosomal degradation, we tracked lysosome-dependent turnover of LC3 in cells treated with the autophagy inducer Torin-1. Autophagy induction in control cells was accompanied by conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and degradation of LC3-II over time (Fig. 8G). In contrast, LC3-II remained stable over time in PQLC2KO cells (Fig. 8H), suggesting that LC3-II was not efficiently turned over. Thus, loss of PQLC2 impairs lysosomal degradative functions.

We posited that the incomplete EGFR-RFP degradation in PQLC2KO cells was a consequence of dysregulated lysosomal pH. We therefore asked if expression of the PQLC2 mutants that rescued EGFR-RFP degradation in RTK-FP cells also restored lysosomal pH in PQLC2KO-pH cells. To detect PQLC2 in live cells, we expressed PQLC2 fused to a C-terminal SNAP tag (PQLC2-SNAP). The tag did not interfere with PQLC2 localization, as WT and cleavage deficient PQLC2-SNAP were localized to lysosomes, and the dileucine motif mutant partitioned between lysosomes and the plasma membrane (Fig. 8I). PQLC2-SNAP expression levels were variable between cells, with some cells expressing only mScarlet-LAMP1 and others expressing both mScarlet-LAMP1 and PQLC2-SNAP (Fig. 8J). We exploited this heterogeneity to determine if re-expression of PQLC2-SNAP restored the pH of individual lysosomes (Fig. 8K). Lysosomes negative for PQLC2-SNAP were of the same pH as those in PQLC2KO-pH cells (Fig. 8L). Expression of PQLC2 (WT)-SNAP or any of the mutants restored pH to that of lysosomes in control-pH cells (Fig. 8L). The restoration in pH was concurrent with a decrease in lysosome size (Fig. 8M). These data suggest that maintenance of lysosomal pH, a function not previously attributed to PQLC2, may be necessary for degradation of lysosomal substrates such as EGFR.

Whereas the downstream consequences of blocking RTK-dependent signaling have been studied in detail, the effects of BiDAC-dependent RTK degradation have not been previously explored. In this study, we compared the consequences of inhibiting Her2 using RTK inhibitors, BiDACs, and antibodies. By using unbiased morphological profiling, we were able to identify phenotypic states associated with these perturbations. After selectively removing Her2 staining information from the morphological profile, we observed that BiDACs and their inactive counterparts induced similar phenotypes, suggesting that they have limited additional effects on cell state beyond inhibiting Her2. Thus, the greater potency of BiDACs may be due to a more sustained inhibition of canonical Her2 signaling rather than through loss of Her2 kinase-independent functions10. Unlike BiDACs, AKT and PI3K inhibitors and anti-Her2 antibodies induced distinct phenotypes. The distinctiveness of the AKT and PI3K inhibitor phenotypes was expected, as these kinases integrate many different growth signals, and their inhibition impacts pathways beyond those regulated by Her231. Surprisingly, our data indicate that anti-Her2 antibodies have an impact on cell physiology that is distinct from other inhibitory modalities, potentially due to their ability to simultaneously alter Her2 dimerization, localization, and expression1. A potential limitation to using pharmacological perturbations was that our BiDACs also inhibited Her2 kinase activity and triggered degradation of EGFR. Future studies can address this limitation by inducing Her2 degradation with genetically encoded degrons. Taken together, our unbiased profiling of mechanistically distinct Her2 inhibitors reveals a diverse spectrum of phenotypes associated with agents notionally known to target the same protein. Furthermore, the morphological profiling approach can be used to provide mechanistic insight into how BiDACs trigger degradation of their targets.

The finding that BiDAC-mediated ubiquitination targeted RTKs to the endolysosomal pathway was surprising given our current understanding of ubiquitin-dependent trafficking of RTKs to lysosomes. Lysosomal EGFR degradation triggered by binding to EGF is thought to require modification of EGFR by monoubiquitin32 or lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin chains33. Our functional genomics screen identified UBE2R2 as an E2 that functions in BiDAC-dependent degradation of Her2-GFP. UBE2R2 has been shown to ubiquitinate its substrates with lysine 48 (K48)-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro34, a linkage which canonically targets ubiquitinated proteins for degradation by the proteasome. Our data suggest that BiDAC-dependent K48 ubiquitination is also sufficient to trigger internalization and delivery of RTKs to lysosomes. A recent study used a genetically encoded split ubiquitin system to label EGFR with K63 or K48 ubiquitin chains. K63 ubiquitination resulted in the expected targeting of EGFR to lysosomes35. Modification by K48 chains triggered EGFR endocytosis but resulted in mistargeting of EGFR to the endoplasmic reticulum. A direct comparison between this study and BiDAC-induced EGFR ubiquitination is not possible since the split ubiquitin system does not allow attachment of linkage-specific ubiquitin chains to lysines within EGFR. However, these results raise the possibility that BiDAC-induced K48 chains may recruit machinery that further ubiquitinates EGFR with K63-linked chains, thus promoting its trafficking to lysosomes36. Another possibility is that the sustained K48 ubiquitination induced by BiDACs is sufficient to promote internalization and sorting of RTKs to lysosomes, even in the absence of K63 ubiquitination. Unexpectedly, we found that inhibition of the proteasome blocked RTK degradation by interfering with BiDAC-induced internalization of RTKs from the plasma membrane, an explanation for why Lap-VHL-dependent Her2 degradation was previously reported to require active proteasomes10. We showed that inhibition of the proteasome partially blocked ubiquitination of Her2-GFP, potentially by impacting free ubiquitin pools. Interestingly, inhibition of the proteasome has been shown to inhibit EGF-induced delivery of EGFR to multivesicular bodies but not EGFR endocytosis23. This is consistent with our data showing that Carfilzomib does not fully block the EGF-induced reduction in surface EGFR despite potently inhibiting EGFR-RFP degradation. Further studies are needed to determine the identity and dynamics of ubiquitin chain linkages that govern BiDAC-induced internalization, trafficking, and degradation of plasma membrane proteins.

Our screen uncovered a potential mechanism by which PQLC2 regulates lysosomal homeostasis and, consequently, degradation of lysosomal substrates. PQLC2 functions both as a CAA transporter and as a sensor of CAA abundance within lysosomes. Reduction of CAA availability stabilizes PQLC2 in a conformation that binds WDR41, which in turn recruits other members of the CSW complex to lysosomes28. The role of the CSW complex is poorly understood, but it has been proposed to activate GTPase activity in proteins that function in vesicular trafficking and autophagy37. By reintroducing PQLC2 mutants into PQLC2-null cells, we found that CAA transport and CSW binding were dispensable for rescue of EGFR-RFP degradation, lysosome size, and pH. These results agree with a study using C. elegans, which examined the impact of deleting the PQLC2 homolog LAAT-1 on lysosome function27. Loss of LAAT-1 resulted in lysosome enlargement, impaired lysosomal degradation, and delayed development of the mutant worms. Supplementation of LAAT-1-null worms with CAA rescued development but did not impact lysosomal phenotypes, suggesting that while LAAT-1-dependent CAA transport was sufficient to maintain cytosolic CAA levels to support organismal growth, LAAT-1 regulated lysosomal homeostasis through a different mechanism. Our results indicate that PQLC2 regulates lysosomal pH, potentially through its interaction with the V-ATPase at the lysosomal membrane. Interestingly, PQLC2 has optimal CAA transport activity within the pH range found in lysosomes25. Thus, regulation of V-ATPase activity by PQLC2 may be required for lysosomal acidification, which in turn sets the conditions under which PQLC2 optimally transports CAA. We also found that the reintroduced PQLC2 undergoes cleavage within an intra-lysosomal loop, yielding a C-terminal fragment. While we were unable to obtain an antibody to confirm the size of endogenously expressed PQLC2, previous reports support our findings that the dominant form of PQLC2 is expressed as a cleaved fragment of the full-length protein27,28, including a study in which PQLC2 was fused to a hemagglutinin tag at its genomic locus28. Our results do not rule out the possibility that a minor, undetectable fraction of PQLC2 does not undergo cleavage, as reintroduction of a non-cleaved PQLC2 mutant was sufficient to rescue lysosomal phenotypes and restore EGFR degradation. Additional studies are needed to investigate the relationship between PQLC2 cleavage and its CAA transport and sensing functions.

SKOV3 and SKBR3 cell lines were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Glutamax (Gibco). Parental SKOV3 and SKBR3 lines were obtained from ATCC. RTK-FP SKOV3 cells (Sigma-Aldrich) were subcloned using FACS to yield a homogenously expressing clonal line.

RTK-FP PQLC2KO cells were generated by infection of RTK-FP cells with lentivirus containing LentiCRISPR v2 encoding Cas9 and sgRNAs targeting exon 3 or exon 2 of the SLC66A1 gene. Virus-containing media from HEK293T cells was added at a 1:1 v/v ratio to RTK-FP cells with 5 μg/mL Polybrene infection reagent. The medium was changed after 24 h. After an additional 24 h of incubation, infected cells were selected by treatment with 2 μg/mL puromycin for 72 h to generate a knockout pool. Knockout of PQLC2 in pools was confirmed using genomic sequencing. Clonal lines expressing sgRNA #1 or sgRNA #2 were isolated by limited dilution cloning, and knockout of PQLC2 in individual clones was confirmed by their inability to fully degrade EGFR-RFP. SKOV3 PQLC2KO cells were similarly generated by infection of SKOV3 cells with LentiCRISPR v2 encoding PQLC2 sgRNA #1, selection with puromycin, and subcloning. Control cells were generated by infection of RTK-FP or SKOV3 cells with lentivirus containing LentiCRISPR v2 encoding an sgRNA targeting the cell surface protein CD81.

RTK-FP LAMP1-SNAP and RAB7A-SNAP cells were generated by transient transfection of RTK-FP cells with plasmids encoding LAMP1-SNAP or RAB7A-SNAP, followed by selection in 50 µg/ml Geneticin (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

RTK-FP PQLC2KO cells expressing PQLC2 rescue constructs or LAMP1-SNAP were generated by infection of PQLC2KO clonal cells expressing PQLC2 sgRNA #1 with a dilution series of lentivirus containing a construct encoding PQLC2-Flag or LAMP1-SNAP under control of a dox-inducible promoter. Infected cells were selected by treatment with 10 μg/mL blasticidin for 7 days and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was determined by CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega). Lines infected with a dilution that yielded an MOI ≤ 0.3 were used for downstream experiments. LAMP1-SNAP-expressing cells were further enriched by FACS. Prior, expression of LAMP1-SNAP was induced by treatment with 500 ng/mL doxycycline for 48 h, and LAMP1-SNAP was fluorescently labeled by treating cells with 1 µM SNAP-Cell 647-SiR (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and washed twice prior to sorting of the 647-SiR-positive population.

PQLC2KO-pH cells were generated by infection of SKOV3 PQLC2KO cells expressing PQLC2 sgRNA #1 with lentivirus containing a construct encoding mScarlet-LAMP1 under control of a dox-inducible promoter, followed by selection with 10 µg/mL blasticidin. mScarlet-LAMP1-expressing clones were isolated by FACS. PQLC2KO-pH expressing PQLC2 rescue constructs were generated by infection with virus containing a construct encoding PQLC2-SNAP under dox control. PQLC2-SNAP-expressing cells were enriched by labeling cells with SNAP-Cell 647-SiR, as above, followed by FACS.

UBE2R2KO cells were generated by electroporation of 200 × 103 RTK-FP cells with a mixture of three sgRNAs, 5′ CGAGCUGGUCAUCUGCUGCU 3′, 5′ GGAGGGCUUCCGGAUCACCC 3′, and 5′ CCGCCUUCGUAGAGGGUGUU 3′ (EditCo Bio, Inc.). A single sgRNA targeting CD81, 5′ GTTGGCTTCCTGGGCTGCTA 3′ was used to generate control cells. 120 pmol of sgRNA was combined with 104 pmol of Alt-R Cas9 Nuclease V3 (IDT) in a total volume of 5 µL and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. A master mix from SF Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit S (Lonza Bioscience) was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. Immediately after addition of the sgRNA/Cas9 complex to the master mix, cells were resuspended and electroporated using a 4D-Nucleofector X System (Lonza Biosciences) using program no. FE-132.

CRISPR guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences targeting the SLC66A1 gene were obtained from the Avana library. The oligonucleotide sequence preceding the protospacer is 5′ caccgCATCTCTTACAGACCTACA 3' for sgRNA #1 and 5′ caccgGAGACTCCTGCAACCTCAT 3′ for sgRNA #2. For the sgRNA sequence targeting the CD81 gene, the oligonucleotide sequence preceding the protospacer is 5′ caccg TGGCTTCCTGGGCTGCTACG 3′. Nucleotides in lowercase show the overhangs that facilitate insertion of the oligonucleotides into the BsmBI site of LentiCRISPR v2.

The dox-inducible PQLC2 lentiviral expression construct was generated by inserting PQLC2-myc-flag (OriGene Technologies) between the NheI and NotI sites of the custom dox-inducible lentiviral expression vector pSHUSHV2, encoding a blasticidin resistance cassette and the reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator. PQLC2 mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis followed by insertion into pSHUSHV2. PQLC2 constructs containing N and C-terminal Myc or Flag tags were generated by incorporating sequences encoding these tags into the PCR amplification primers. PQLC2, containing a C-terminal SNAP tag, was generated by Gibson cloning, followed by insertion into pSHUSHV2. LAMP1-SNAP and SNAP-RAB7A were generated by amplification of the LAMP1 or RAB7A cDNA sequences (Origene Technologies) and the SNAP DNA sequence (New England Biolabs), followed by joining using Gibson assembly and insertion into pSHUSHV2 or a vector containing a G418 resistance cassette. mScarlet-LAMP, previously described30, was amplified and inserted into pSHUSHV2.

Cells were harvested by scraping or trypsinization and washed with PBS after pelleting by centrifugation. Cell pellets were lysed in 1% SDS/water and solubilized by sonication. Cell lysates were boiled at 100 °C for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined using Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 20–40 μg of lysate was combined with Laemmli buffer containing 2.5% v/v ß-Mercaptoethanol (BME), heated at 65 °C for 10 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% Criterion TGX gels (Bio-Rad) at 150 V for 75 min. For the Torin-1 time course, proteins were separated on 4–12% Criterion gels (Bio-Rad) in MES buffer to achieve better separation between LC3-I and LC3-II.

The proteins were transferred to 0.22 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% BSA/PBST for 30 min at room temperature followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C in primary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA/PBST. The following day, membranes were washed three times for 5 min in PBST and incubated in secondary anti-mouse IRDye 680RD or anti-rabbit IRDye 800CW antibodies (LI-COR) for 30 mins at room temperature. After three washes in PBST, the membranes were imaged on an Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR).

Six 15-cm plates of RTK-FP cells were cultured until confluence for each treatment condition. Cells were treated with BiDACs with or without Carfilzomib for 60 min, scraped into the treatment media, and pelleted at 4 °C for 5 min. After two washes with cold PBS, cells were lysed in cold RIPA buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% Triton X-100 and 1% Sodium deoxycholate, supplemented with cOmplete EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 5 mg/mL N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, Sigma). The lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 15 min at 20 K × g. The protein concentration of the supernatant was quantified using BCA assay. Twenty five microliters of Chromotek GFP-Trap agarose beads (Proteintech Group) were washed twice with RIPA buffer, combined with 8 mg of lysate per sample and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g, and washed 4× with cold RIPA buffer lacking NEM or protease inhibitors, followed by 2× washes with cold buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.5 mM EDTA. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling beads in 2× Laemmli buffer. The supernatant was combined with 2.5% BME, heated at 65 °C for 10 min, and separated as described above. Twenty micrograms of input and flowthrough was loaded to assess efficiency of the affinity purification. Proteins were transferred to 0.45-μm PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) using the high MW transfer protocol, blotted using anti-GFP and anti-K48-linkage antibodies, and visualized using anti-Rabbit HRP and anti-Chicken HRP antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research) and the SuperSignal West Dura detection reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Live RTK-FP cells expressing LAMP1-SNAP were imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope (Nikon) equipped with a 60× 1.4 na oil objective, in an environmental chamber set to 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a glass bottom #1.5H-N 96-well plate (Cellvis) containing 100 μL of complete phenol-red free RPMI 1640 per well. Five hundred nanograms per milliliter of dox was added to the media to induce expression of LAMP1-SNAP. After a 48 h incubation, cells were treated with 1 μM Lap-VHL or Lap-VHLInactive and 100 nM Bafilomycin-A1 (Selleck Chemicals). To label LAMP1-SNAP or SNAP-RAB7A immediately prior to imaging, cells were treated with 1 µM SNAP-Cell 647-SiR for 30 min at 37 °C, and subsequently washed three times with complete media while adhered to the imaging chamber. After an additional 30 min incubation, the media was replaced with fresh media containing 1 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 Trihydrochloride Trihydrate (Invitrogen) to stain nuclei.

Colocalization analysis and lysosome quantification was performed using CellProfiler (Broad Institute). Confocal image slices for the RFP and SNAP channels were combined into a single max intensity projection. CellProfiler was used to calculate and apply an illumination function to each image and align the images. Lysosomes were identified using the SNAP channel and a Pearson correlation coefficient between the RFP and SNAP signals was calculated on a per lysosome basis.

Time-lapse imaging of live RTK-FP cells was performed using a Opera Phenix Plus System (Revvity Health Sciences) set to 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were seeded as above and treated with 1 µM Lap-VHL in combination with degradation inhibitors. To label nuclei, cells were treated with 50 nM SiR-DNA (Cytoskeleton, Inc.), and single plane images across 20 fields per well were acquired in confocal mode every 30 min. At each time point, the number of puncta in each well was determined using Harmony imaging and analysis software (Revvity) and normalized by the number of SiR-DNA-positive nuclei in the well.

For immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of PQLC2-Flag expression, RTK-FP cells were seeded as above and incubated for 48 h with 500 ng/mL dox. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Following fixation, cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in 1% BSA in PBS for 30 min and stained for 2 h with a 1:500 v/v dilution of anti-Flag monoclonal antibody (M2, Sigma-Aldrich) in blocking solution. After three washes with blocking solution, cells were stained for 1 h with anti-Mouse IgG Fragment conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (Cell Signaling Technologies) diluted 1:5000 v/v in blocking solution, washed 3 times, and imaged on the Opera Phenix Plus System.

Analysis of SKBR3 cell proliferation was performed using an Incucyte SX5 live-cell imaging and analysis instrument (Sartorius). Five thousand cells per well were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate and incubated for 24 h prior to drug treatment and start of imaging. Images were taken in the phase channel every 6 h using the 10× objective over a total period of 120 h, and percent confluence over time was determined using the Incucyte image analysis software.

Flow cytometric analysis was performed using the LSRFortessa X-20 cell analyzer (BD Biosciences). For analysis of total RTK-FP levels, cells were collected from 96-well plates by trypsinization, transferred to V-bottom plates, and analyzed using the high throughput sampler. For staining of surface RTKs, trypsinized cells were transferred to V-bottom plates and pelleted at 300 × g for 5 min. Cells were resuspended in 50 µL of a solution containing 0.5% v/v BSA in PBS, 2 µg/mL anti-EGFR Alexa Fluor 405-conjugated antibody (R&D Systems), and 2 µg/mL anti-Her2 Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated antibody (R&D Systems). After a 30 min incubation at room temperature, 100 µL of 0.5% BSA/PBS was added to each well, and the plates were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min. Plates were washed once with 150 µL of 0.5% BSA/PBS, and the cells were resuspended in FACS buffer containing 2% FBS in PBS for analysis.

Geometric mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was calculated using FlowJo analysis software (FlowJo, LLC). Each MFI value was normalized by subtracting the background MFI determined from analysis of parental SKOV3 cells and dividing by the value obtained from untreated cells within each treatment condition.

For analysis of apoptosis induction, 25,000 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well plate and treated with BiDACs for 24–72 h. Prior to analysis, cells were incubated with 0.1% Caspase-3/7 Green Flow Cytometry Assay reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 25 min. Cells were washed with PBS and transferred to a U-bottom plate in PBS containing 2% FBS prior to analysis.

RTK-FP PQLC2KO cells expressing PQLC2-Flag were treated with 500 ng/mL dox for 48 h, and lysates were prepared as described above. Sixty milligrams of lysate in RIPA buffer was combined with 150 µL of anti-Flag M2 magnetic bead slurry (Sigma-Aldrich) and rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were separated from lysates using a magnetic tube rack, washed five times with cold RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by boiling beads in 2× Laemmli buffer for 10 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, combined with 2.5% v/v ß-Mercaptoethanol, and heated at 65 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% Bis-Tris gel (Bio-rad) at 150 V for 75 min. The proteins were transferred to 0.22 μm PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) using the Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-Rad). The membranes were stained with Coomassie Gel Code Blue at room temperature for 10 min, and destained several times with 50% methanol. A PVDF band corresponding to the expected size of PQLC2-Flag was cut from the membrane and further destained with 50% methanol in a tube, followed by two washes with water. Ten cycles of Edman sequencing analysis were performed (Creative Proteomics) using an ABI Procise 494HT protein sequencing system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

Cells were seeded in 384-well PhenoPlates (Perkin Elmer) using a Fluent Liquid Handler (Tecan). Prior to seeding, cells were counted using a Vi-Cell XR cell counter (Perkin Elmer), and their concentration was adjusted to generate the required stock concentrations that varied depending on the final time point of analysis. Fifty microliters of cell suspension was added to each well at a density of 2500 cells per well for the 2 h and 6 h time points, 1500 cells per well for the 24 h time point, 1000 cells per well for the 48 h time point, and 500 cells per well for the 72 h time point. After seeding, the plates were left at room temperature for 30 min to allow uniform attachment of cells to the plate. The plates were subsequently transferred to an incubator for 16 h.

Cells were treated with experimental compounds using the Echo 555 Acoustic Liquid Handler (Beckman Coulter). Specifically, low dead volume Echo source plates containing 10 μL of compound per well were prepared and stored at −80 °C. Source plates were limited to a maximum of three thaws at room temperature and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min prior to dosing. After dosing, phenoplates were returned to an incubator for the duration of the 2–72 h treatments. The dose order for small molecules corresponds to the following concentrations: 0, 0.05 μM; 1, 0.1 μM; 2, 0.35 μM; 3, 1 μM; 4, 3.5 μM; 5, 10 μM. The dose order for antibodies corresponds to the following concentrations: 0, 0.3 μg/mL; 1, 1 μg/mL; 2, 3.3 μg/mL; 3, 10 μg/mL; 4, 33 μg/mL; 5, 100 μg/mL.

After incubation with drugs, the cells were stained with 0.5 μM of MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Invitrogen) in cell culture media by adding 10 μL of a 3 μM MitoTracker solution to each well using a Multidrop Combi Reagent Dispenser (Thermo Fisher). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. During this time, the cell staining solution was prepared as follows: 1% BSA solution was made by dissolving fresh Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) powder in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS), followed by filtration through a 0.22 μm filter. Next, a 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 solution was prepared by mixing 1% BSA/HBSS with a 10% Triton X-100 stock solution. Dyes from the Cell Painting panel were manually added at the following concentrations to generate the post-fixation permeabilization and staining solution containing 1 μg/mL Phalloidin Conjugates CF430 (Biotium), 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 Trihydrochloride Trihydrate (Invitrogen) and 1.5 μg/mL Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen). To stain Her2, Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Genentech) and Pertuzumab (Perjeta, Genentech) were labeled using the DyLight 488 Antibody Labeling Kit (Life Technologies Corporation) and added to the staining solution at a concentration of 1 μg/mL. Lastly, the staining solution was combined with 0.05% v/v sodium azide to prevent contamination during staining. After staining mitochondria, the plates were transferred with lids removed to a BioTek EL406 Microplate Washer Dispenser with BioStack (Agilent). Twenty microliters of a 16% PFA solution was added to each well using a syringe pump to yield a final concentration of 4% PFA. Cells were fixed for 20 min at room temperature, and PFA was removed using a wash manifold on the EL406. Excess PFA was removed by washing each well twice with 60 μL of HBSS. Cells were subsequently incubated in 20 μL of the permeabilization and staining solution for 30 min at room temperature followed by two washes with HBSS. Upon completion of staining, all wells were filled with 60 μL of an HBSS solution containing 0.05% v/v sodium azide, and the plates were sealed before imaging. Each stained 384-well plate was imaged using an Opera Phenix Plus System (Revvity Health Sciences) by acquiring 5-channel fluorescence and digital phase contrast images across 9 fields in the center of each well with a 20× objective.

For generation of deep learning image embeddings, images were down sampled to 512 × 512 × 6, with each channel corresponding to an image acquisition channel (see “Morphological profiling” methods). Separate deep convolutional neural networks were trained using all images for each cell type. All networks had a modified ResNet38 architecture and were trained using ArcFace loss39, with each image's class label corresponding to a combination of its timepoint × dose × perturbation. This training objective encourages the network to minimize differences in representation due to batch effects between technical replicates. For downstream analysis, the 512-dimensional final activation vector of the network was used as the image embedding. All image embeddings were further normalized by subtracting the mean of all DMSO embeddings per plate to mitigate plate-level batch effects. For analysis in the absence of Her2 staining, a separate network was trained without including the Her2 channel in the input images.

For cell segmentation and image intensity analysis, all channels other than the Hoechst nuclei channel were grouped as “cyto” channels. Cyto channels were combined by first linearly rescaling each individual channel image to have its 3rd to 97th percentile pixel intensity values fall in the range [0, 1], with all outliers clipped to 0 or 1. The channels were then combined by taking the per pixel maximum value across all rescaled cyto channel images. The nuclei channel and composite cyto channel were then down-sampled to 512 × 512 and processed using the Cellpose model40 to derive individual cell segmentation masks. For each channel, the median intensity value per cell was then computed.

t-SNE plots were generated by averaging the image embeddings across the timepoint × dose × perturbation groups for each plate. The two-dimensional t-SNE embeddings were generated using a multicore implementation of the Barnes-Hut t-SNE algorithm41,42. The perplexity value was manually tuned for each dataset.

Cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in a Cellvis 8-well chambered coverglass and treated with 500 ng/ml dox for 48 h. To image SNAP-tagged PQLC2, cells were treated with 1 μM SNAP-Cell 647 SiR for 30 min and washed 3 times with complete RPMI 1640 medium. The medium was replaced again following a 30 min incubation with complete RPMI 1640 lacking phenol red. During imaging, cells were incubated at 36 °C and 5% CO2 using a stage top incubator (Okolab).

For pH calibration experiments, cells were imaged immediately after a 5 min incubation in high potassium imaging buffer containing 140 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 10% Carmody's buffer43 to set the desired pH. Ionophores consisting of 10 μM nigericin and 2 μM monensin were also added to the imaging buffer to equalize proton gradients across cellular membranes.

Fluorescence lifetime imaging was performed on an SP8 point scanning confocal microscope (Leica) equipped with a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) add-on (PicoQuant GmbH, Berlin, Germany). mScarlet was excited with the 561 nm output of the white light laser at an average power of ~10–20 μW and a repetition rate of 40 MHz. Emission was collected with a 100×/1.4 NA oil objective (HC PL APO CS2, Leica), and photon arrival times were determined with the built-in HyD detectors and the PicoHarp 300 TCSPC module. Spectral detection was used to restrict collection wavelengths to 590–700 nm, and a notch filter was included to block 488/561/633 nm. Scanning was performed with the built-in Leica non-resonant scanner with a total time per field of view of 20 s. Images were binned to pixel sizes of 200 nm × 200 nm to obtain adequate photons for lifetime determination. All imaging was performed with the confocal pinhole set to 1 Airy unit at 580 nm.

For two-color imaging with SiR-SNAP647, two sequential images of each field of view were taken. mScarlet was imaged with the 561 nm output of the white light laser, and emissions between 587 and 625 nm were collected. SiR647 SNAP was imaged with the 640 nm output of the white light laser (average power 0.5 μW) and emissions between 660 and 788 nm were collected. An additional notch filter (470/640 nm) was included to block the 640 nm illumination. To reduce motion artifacts from lysosome movement, image capture was alternated between the two illumination colors between lines. Because the PicoQuant software did not support between-line switching, a custom parser was used to process the raw TCSPC output and reconstruct an image. Parser code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/AndrewGYork/tools/blob/master/picoquant_tttr.py). For two color images, the total acquisition time per field of view was ~40 s.

TCSPC images were used to calculate mean arrival time at each pixel either within the PicoQuant SymPhoTime software (one color imaging) or with custom parser code (two color imaging). Fluorescence intensity images were generated by summing the photons at each pixel over the fluorescence lifetime decay.

To segment fluorescence lifetimes and intensity images, instance segmentation of lysosomes was performed using the mScarlet-LAMP1 emission channel and the “StarDist2D” model trained on the “2D_versatile_fluo” dataset44. The model distinguishes individual lysosomes within 2D images by recognizing their star-convex shape. Prior to segmentation, images were normalized to adjust the pixel intensity distribution to a standard range and by up-sampling to adjust image features to the scale of those used in the training model. After segmentation, the masks were downsampled back to the original size. The segmentation output was used to extract lysosome area as the total number of pixels in the masks scaled by the camera pixel resolution, mean fluorescence values in both the mScarlet-LAMP1 and PQLC2-SNAP channels, and the mean fluorescence lifetime in the mScarlet-LAMP1 channel. These quantifications were performed using Scikit Image's region properties function45. For fluorescence lifetime quantification, only those pixels with a photon count above five were used to calculate the mean fluorescence lifetime value.

pH calibration (ionophore) data were fit to a four-parameter logistic function to extract a calibration curve, where tau is the lifetime, min and max are the minimum and maximum lifetime values observed (at low and high pH respectively), and b is the slope factor (similar to the Hill coefficient) (Eq. 1).

Median lifetime of all lysosomes in each condition was converted to pH using the corresponding calibration curves. For the PQLC2-SNAP rescue experiments, the PQLC2KO-pH calibration curve was used to determine the pH of lysosomes lacking PQLC2-SNAP signal, and the Control-pH calibration curve was used to determine the pH of PQLC2-SNAP-positive lysosomes.

So you're watching a Netflix movie or TV show and see a moment that's really grabbed you. What's the best way to share it with someone else? Or save it for posterity?

Previously, this has been quite a technical challenge—you'll notice even screenshots get blocked by Netflix's anti-piracy technology. But there's now an official feature built right into the Netflix app for saving and sharing as many clips as you like.

It's called Moments, and you can find it in the Netflix app for Android and iOS, though not on the web or any other devices.

Moments was added at the end of 2024, six months before Netflix announced that it will soon begin rolling out a major overhaul of its user interface. So while you may have to wait a few weeks to see the new Netflix features—like “responsive” recommendations and TikTok-style vertical videos—you can start sharing with Moments now.

Start watching something in the Netflix app, whether streamed from the web or saved to your phone. When you get to the part of the show or movie you want to save, tap anywhere on the screen to bring up the playback controls. You'll see a Moments button in the lower-left corner.

Tap the button and you get taken to the Moments screen that shows thumbnails of previous clips you've saved for this particular film or show. (If you haven't saved anything yet, you'll just see a row of black squares.)

To save your current position as a clip, tap Save, and it's added to the grid on the right. The clip will actually start a few seconds back from where you currently are, so a little bit of trial and error might be required to get it spot on.

Tap on any previously saved clip to view it, or tap the relevant trash can icon to delete a clip. It's important to note that these aren't self-contained video shorts—they're basically just playback points within movies and shows. When you view one, the film or episode continues from that point.

When you tap the Moments button during playback, you get all of the clips for that film or episode. Scroll to the right if you can't see them all right away. You can also tap the share button just below the thumbnail to send the Moment to someone else, which brings up a new screen showing all the apps installed on your phone.

You can share the clip link via any of these apps, or use the Copy link button to paste the link to the clipboard and share it that way. Whenever someone else clicks or taps on your shared link, they get taken to that part of the movie or show—so they need to have Netflix installed on their device to see it.

All your clips are synced between your mobile devices, so you can revisit them or share them from multiple phones and tablets. You can't view your Moments on the web, but you can view them if you follow a shared link (if someone has sent one to you via email, for example).

From inside the Android or iOS app, you're also able to open the My Netflix tab to access your saved Moments across every film and show. Tap See All for a full list. The subsequent screen lets you view, share, and delete Moments, though there's no easy way to search through the list.

Insta360's X-series 360-degree cameras have long dominated the market. They have great video quality, an easy-to-use interface, and simple editing software, which makes these the most beginner-friendly 360 cameras around. The latest version, the Insta360 X5, continues that tradition while bringing larger sensors with even better-looking video.

The X5 is a worthy upgrade; video quality is better, battery life is improved, and new features like the PureVideo lowlight mode and replaceable lenses make the X5 the most compelling 360 camera on the market.

The big news in the X5, and the reason to consider upgrading even if you already have the X4, are the new twin 1/1.28-inch sensors. They're a considerable step up from the 1/2-inch sensors in the X4. At the same time, the video specs have not changed much at all, with 8K 30 fps and 5.7K 60 fps at the high end. A larger sensor with the same resolution means more detail in that footage, which is exactly what you get here. This is without a doubt the best-looking footage I've seen from a 360 camera.

Keep in mind that the 8K refers to the overall 360-degree shot. When you actually frame that footage in the app, the highest resolution you'll be able to export is 4K. But the 4K footage you'll get is markedly better than what the X4 delivers.

The footage coming out of the X5 is great for a 360 camera. Bear in mind, though, that almost any other newer action camera is going to have somewhat better video quality. The appeal of the 360 camera is that it can capture what's behind you, whereas Insta360's traditional action cam, the Ace Pro 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends), cannot. This makes 360 cameras perfect for filming when you don't know exactly how you want to frame your shot, for example while riding a bike, skiing, skateboarding, and so on. In the past, to get this kind of shoot-everything, frame-later flexibility, you had to give up some video quality. While that's still true to an extent, with the X5 you're giving up very little in terms of video quality.

This is especially noticeable in highlight retention, a place even action cams often struggle. On a bright day with a few clouds, a situation where you often end up with hazy, undersaturated skies, the X5 retains nice contrast and doesn't wash out the highlights. The X5 delivers a much bluer, richer sky tone and more details in the clouds. There's also a bit less noise in shadows when shooting at midday. What's impressed me is that it's capable of this in the default modes, without tweaking exposure or color.

The X5 has excellent dynamic range and mostly manages to avoid that overprocessed HDR look. There is an HDR mode, if you enjoy such things, but the resulting files are only 8-bit color depth (not 10-bit) and in the BT 709 color space, not DCI-P3 (or Apple's Display P3). So while Insta360 calls this HDR, and it does seem to have a slightly wider dynamic range (along with more saturated colors), it's not in the P3 color space.

Another improvement to video quality in the X5 is Insta360's PureVideo low-light mode, which works just like it does in the Ace Pro 2. As with my earlier experiences, PureVideo is pretty amazing. Here it's limited to 5.7K footage, but it manages to not just cut the noise in the shadows but does a reasonable job of protecting highlights too, which is important since bright lights are common in low-light scenarios.

That said, I have seen some videos on YouTube showing a few edge cases where PureVideo fails, especially under blue light and very fast strobes (for example shooting a concert). In those cases you'll have to turn off PureVideo and go with 8K footage and manual exposure. For most people, though, this won't be an issue, and PureVideo makes the X5 considerably more capable than the X4.

There's a new video mode as well, InstaFrame, which automatically tracks you through the shot. I'll confess I don't understand this mode. The whole point of a 360 camera is to get a 360 shot, which this does not. InstaFrame is also limited to lower-resolution modes like 5.7K+ or 5.7K, where the reframed output becomes 1080P. Why would I want this when I can do the very same thing in the Insta360 app and have 4K output?

I was excited to see that Insta360 has added support for I-LOG video recording. Unfortunately, that support is limited to 5.7K video. If you want to do your own color post-processing, you're better off shooting in the usual flat mode at 8K and using that as a starting point. The small gain of I-LOG is negated by losing the 8K capture.

Insta360 X5 is close enough to the X4 in physical design that I didn't notice much difference. There's a 3D geometric pattern on the front of the X5, but otherwise the body looks about the same. For the hair-splitting among you, the X5 is a millimeter taller and narrower, and weighs 3 grams less the X4. Unfortunately, due to the repositioning of the battery door, existing accessories and especially cases will not work with the X5.

There are a couple of changes to the body that are worth noting. First and most importantly, the lenses are now replaceable. Previous models of the X series relied on lens covers, which are still available with the X5, but there is an unfortunate loss of video quality with the covers. Replaceable lenses means should the worst happen, you'll only be out $30 for the replacement kit, which includes a single lens and the removal tool, as well as a few accessories like lens cloths and gloves to help you get the new lens on smudge-free. As someone who loves to repair things, I'm very happy to see Insta360 continuing to find ways to help consumers keep their cameras working longer. (Also kudos to the company for its long history of significant firmware upgrades.)

The other outwardly obvious change to the body of the X5 is the new microphone windscreen cover. Although it's a different design, this is very similar in approach and result to the windscreen cover Insta360 added to the Ace Pro 2 last year. It works reasonably well here too. I tested this camera extensively while riding my bike (which is the main use case I have for a 360 camera) and can confirm that audio is quite a bit better than what the X4 was capable of. I hear a lot more sound of the tires on gravel, and less of the wind. Despite that, there is still considerable wind noise once you get above 15 MPH. When I stuck the X5 out the window of my car going 60 mph, the wind is still a deafening roar. Sorry, motorcyclists.

Finally, my favorite new feature is that the magnetic quick-release system of the Insta360 Ace Pro and others is now on the bottom of the X5, making it easy to attach to any existing, GoPro-style mounts you might have. (Pro tip: This Ulanzi mount is lighter and cheaper than Insta360's. Unless you're riding a motorcycle, I recommend it over Insta360's.)

Admittedly, it is not very hot yet where I am, but shooting in the car, sun coming through the windshield, in 8K 30p mode … I could not get the X5 to overheat. I also noticed when running this test that you are no longer limited to 30-minute clips. You can record a single clip until the battery dies, which was about 80 minutes on average in my tests (shooting 8K 30p). The batteries charge marginally faster too. Unfortunately, this is partly due to a physical redesign, which means your X4 batteries won't work here.

And now the moment you've been waiting for: Do SD cards cause issues? The answer is, maybe. Like many X4 users, I had some issues with SD cards, where the camera simply stops recording after a while. Ostensibly this occurs because the card can't keep up, but I have had this happen with the SD cards Insta360 provided. To get around this, I bought the fastest SanDisk V30 SD card I could (at the time, this card). With the X5 I used both that card and Insta360's own Pro V30 card and did not have any problems with either.

If you do, this is the 360 camera to get in 2025.

Most of the time, I still prefer an action camera for the higher-quality image, but the Insta360 X5 is the first 360 camera I've tested that I think could replace my action camera in some scenarios, while still delivering the image quality I'd need to mix it with footage from other cameras.

If you like the flexibility of shooting in 360 and reframing later, the X5 is unquestionably the highest-quality video you're going to get from a 360 camera. The new sensors are much sharper, with fewer artifacts, and the color science in the default settings is remarkably good. The added bonus of being able to replace the lenses makes this the 360 camera to get.

This story originally appeared on the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

There are trillions upon trillions of numbers in the world. We use numbers to describe almost every conceivable thing in the universe. But there is one number that surpasses all others for the enormous impact it will have on every living thing on Earth over the next few thousand years. We consider it so important that we've dedicated our lives to acquiring and understanding it. Today that number happens to be: 427.6.

This is a measure (known in scientific terms as the mole fraction) of atmospheric carbon dioxide at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, in parts per million. It's part of a continuous chain of observations stretching back across two generations, to 1958, when Dave Keeling recorded the first measurement of 313 parts per million. Dave Keeling maintained this record, known as the Keeling Curve, using a running hodgepodge of short-term grants until 2005, at which point geochemist Ralph Keeling, a professor at UC San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, coauthor of this piece and Dave's son, assumed its stewardship. But now, after 67 years of battling to keep the program funded and provide the data to other scientists around the world, the program faces its most dire threat ever.

Why? Endeavors of this nature—highly precise measurements of a trace gas over many decades—require three basic inputs: knowledge, people, and money. It's the third one that's at risk, thanks to the current administration's attacks on NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA provides support for our program both through an annual grant and through invaluable “in-kind” support, such as staffers taking samples for us, maintaining buildings in remote areas where sampling occurs, and running the Mauna Loa Observatory.

Monthly average carbon dioxide concentration at Mauna Loa (top panel) and annual financial support for the Scripps CO2 program (bottom panel), adjusted for inflation to US dollars in 2007.

The Trump administration has made clear it wishes to gut NOAA's research enterprise, which is at the center of climate research globally. Already, we've seen large-scale firings and rejections of research proposals. Recent guidance from the Office of Management and Budget shows the administration intends to assiduously follow the blueprint of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 and shutter the Ocean and Atmospheric Research Line Office. This is not just a little haircut for a large federal agency—it's grabbing the scissors and stabbing the agency through the heart. If successful, this loss will be a nightmare scenario for climate science, not just in the United States, but the world. It will also likely spell the end of our ability to continuously update the Keeling Curve.

Against this ominous backdrop, a small group of scientists is scrambling to preserve the ability to know how much carbon dioxide is in the atmosphere. NOAA maintains a global backbone of measurements of carbon dioxide and other gases, not just at Mauna Loa, but at more than 50 stations around the world. In parallel, our program at Scripps maintains records at a dozen stations. Other countries also contribute, but their efforts are almost all focused regionally, leaving the big picture to just a few programs that are global in scope. Climate change, however, is a global problem, and global networks address the really important questions. Such networks provide critical information on how fast carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are building up in the air from fossil-fuel burning and other processes. They provide information on how much carbon dioxide is being removed from the atmosphere by the oceans and by land plants. They provide information critical to independently verify emissions, to negotiate international treaties, to make decisions now about how much carbon dioxide the world can emit. These observational networks are the factual basis upon which all efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change are based.

NOAA and Scripps play another key role in the atmospheric measurement community. How does the world know that the value of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere today is really 427.6 and not 427.7 parts per million? Such differences may seem small, but they are consequential in the realm of climate research, and they can be calculated only because a lot of work has gone into calibration. Hundreds of groups can measure carbon dioxide using various off-the-shelf analyzers, but these analyzers first need to be calibrated using compressed air that has a known amount of carbon dioxide in it. Scripps assumed the lead role for preparing tanks filled with known amounts of carbon dioxide and dispensing them to the community until 1995, at which point NOAA took over.

The country and the world are now at risk of losing the only two programs that have played this central role. If the current administration has its way, the climate change research community could soon be fully adrift, unable to know with sufficient accuracy how quickly carbon dioxide levels are rising.

Even in the best of times, long-term observations can be very fragile. It is difficult to convince funding agencies to put money into long-term observations because, by definition, they are continuations; they have been done before. Most funding entities, from science agencies to philanthropic organizations, want to be associated with exciting, groundbreaking work, and sustained observations are too routine to scratch that itch. (Dave Keeling records in his autobiography, Rewards and Penalties of Monitoring the Earth, that at one point a National Science Foundation program manager demanded that, to maintain funding, he generate two discoveries per year from his record of carbon dioxide levels.)

Another vulnerability stems from the fact that the community of researchers making sustained measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide probably numbers less than 30. Graduate students interested in learning to conduct this arcane work are a rare commodity. Patience and attention to detail are required, and years may be needed to accumulate enough data to answer the key questions or make groundbreaking discoveries. Researchers have to be extremely diligent and exacting to ensure that measurements in 1958 are comparable to those today. Calibration is an endless chore. This scientific pursuit isn't for everyone.

Perversely, while the Keeling Curve has attained iconic global importance, this actually can hinder, rather than help the funding situation. Environmental programs tend to be organized by geographic domain and discipline—the National Water Quality Program of the US Geological Survey, NSF's Arctic Observing Network, and the US Forest Service, for instance. Amid these focused efforts, the big picture can be lost. As the climate change field has evolved, we have found it increasingly difficult to find sponsors who accept responsibility for measuring vital signs of the Earth as a whole.

The original Mauna Loa measurements were started during the International Geophysical Year in 1957/1958. This was a massive, remarkable effort, led by the United States and including 67 countries, with the goal (simply put) of measuring every physical attribute possible on the Earth in one year. It led to numerous, important scientific discoveries and the establishment of many measurement programs worldwide. It established the South Pole station, for instance, a home for vital climate research that is still going today. It was a time of enormous optimism, of international cooperation (even during the height of the Cold War), of vast dreams, of global cooperation. And the United States was proud to lead the way.

This sense of endeavor continued into the 1970s, when then president Richard Nixon—a conservative Republican—established NOAA to better understand the world's oceans and atmosphere. By the 1980s, the NOAA grew in scope, alongside the Scripps effort, to become the beating heart of global climate science. Now, after just three short months of the Trump administration, we are contemplating the abdication of US leadership in oceanic and atmospheric science and the loss of the largest and most critical observing network for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and their calibration laboratories.

Our colleagues at NOAA are living day to day, not sure if tomorrow will be their last on the job. We pray that common sense will prevail and that NOAA will be spared the worst. Whatever its fate, we will remain in the fight to preserve the world's ability to measure carbon dioxide levels with whatever support we can muster, a small bulwark against climate science's new dark age.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Diabetes Is Rising in Africa. Could It Lead to New Breakthroughs?","https://www.wired.com/story/diabetes-rates-africa-new-breakthroughs/","Sat, 10 May 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Across the African continent, the focus on disease has long been on infectious killers such as HIV and tuberculosis. But in early February, around 700 policymakers, academics, and philanthropists convened in Kigali, Rwanda, to discuss the alarming rise of noncommunicable diseases in the region. Of particular concern: spiraling rates of type 2 diabetes.

Earlier this year, a new study indicated that the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa with type 2 diabetes rose from 4 million in 1980 to 23.6 million in 2021, with projections suggesting that these cases will more than double to 54.9 million by 2045, driven, as in many other parts of the world, by rapid lifestyle changes including shifting diets and declining physical activity.

It's a problem that needs urgent attention, but it could also provide an opportunity to better understand this deadly disease and even lead to more effective—and inclusive—treatments.

Segun Fatumo, a genetics professor at Queen Mary University of London who is currently leading studies of type 2 diabetes in Uganda and Malawi, says many of these patients are drug naïve, meaning their disease progression has yet to be altered by medication. “This gives researchers a rare window into the natural history of the disease—how it develops, progresses, and responds to different environmental and genetic factors,” he says. “It's like being able to study a book from the first chapter, rather than jumping in halfway through.”

The remarkable genetic diversity across the African continent may also represent an opportunity for diabetes research. “Because human populations have lived in Africa the longest, they've had more time to accumulate genetic diversity, and this diversity is a scientific gold mine,” says Fatumo.

Research in sub-Saharan African populations has already challenged some basic understandings regarding the biology of type 2 diabetes. While the disease has traditionally been linked to obesity, with a steady accumulation of visceral fat in the liver and the pancreas progressively impacting the pancreas' ability to produce insulin and control blood sugar levels, it appears that this isn't the driving factor in many African patients.

In 2019, a major genetics study of more than 5,000 type 2 diabetes patients in Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya pointed to a particular gene called ZRANB3 as being associated with the disease. The study indicates that some individuals carry variants of ZRANB3 which mean that they either produce fewer insulin-producing beta cells or struggle to maintain an adequate number of these cells, making them less responsive to surges in blood sugar.

The gene may therefore represent a potential new drug target, says Tinashe Chikowore, a researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School who is also leading studies of type 2 diabetes patients in the region. “We now need to find out just how many diabetics carry this African-specific mutation, both in sub-Saharan African populations and those of African ancestry around the world,” he says.

African men also appear to be particularly at risk of the disease. Earlier this year, the Lancet Global Health medical journal published a study of more than 6,500 middle-aged adults from four sub-Saharan African countries which found that, after family history, simply being male was one of the biggest predictors of type 2 diabetes risk.

Chikowore says there are many possible explanations for this, ranging from as yet undiscovered genetic variants to the physiological structure of the pancreas. The latter theory arises from research carried out in East Africa, which found that some men develop type 2 diabetes despite having a healthy weight. An ongoing study led by Uganda's Medical Research Council, in partnership with UK researchers, is measuring the size of the pancreas in such men and assessing its function.

“These cases don't appear to be related to fat, so we want to try and understand what's going on,” says Chikowore. “Is it genetics? Or due to how the pancreas has developed? Some scientists think that it's related to malnutrition in early life, impacting the development of the beta cells so they don't produce as much insulin.”

As well as revealing the path to new treatments, understanding these cases could lead to improved screening tools. Currently, the gold-standard methods of diagnosing and assessing the progression of type 2 diabetes are fasting plasma glucose tests, which measure blood sugar after fasting, and the HbA1c blood test, which detects levels of a chemical compound called HbA1c that indicates blood sugar levels over time. But such tests are being shown to be ineffective in some populations.

Last year a major study highlighted that a significant number of people of African ancestry are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes much later than they might be, because they carry deficiencies in an enzyme called G6PD. This genetic variation is relatively common in parts of sub-Saharan Africa because it confers protection against severe malaria, but it also reduces levels of HbA1c, making it look like a person's blood sugar levels are healthier than they actually are. The study showed that many of these patients end up experiencing preventable complications such as diabetic retinopathy, which can cause blindness.

Meanwhile, researchers like Julia Goedecke, a professor and chief specialist scientist at the South African Medical Research Council, have found that using fasting plasma glucose as a way of diagnosing type 2 diabetes in African women tends to be ineffective, because it assumes the patient is carrying a significant amount of liver fat. “Fasting glucose is often used as a marker of diabetes risk, but that's because liver fat's a big driver of fasting glucose levels,” says Goedecke. “In Africans it's actually a poor marker, because most women who present with diabetes have low liver fat, so you often miss diabetes if you only take a fasting glucose value.”

Instead of liver fat, Goedecke's research has indicated that many of these cases are being driven by an impaired ability to clear insulin from the bloodstream, causing people to already have abnormally high insulin levels.

Goedecke and others are now carrying out a study which includes men and women from the South African township of Soweto, various communities across Ghana, and Ghanaian immigrants to Germany and the Netherlands. They will regularly assess a range of biological characteristics over a number of years. “We hope this data will also give us a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the disease, and ideas for interventions to try and prevent it,” she says.

While research into diabetes across Africa should have direct impacts for patients in the region, Chikowore believes it could also benefit everyone with the disease. Understanding why sub-Saharan African women seem to be more resilient to gaining liver fat, for instance, could lead to the development of drugs that can improve metabolic health in other ethnic groups. “With diversity, you have both ends of the spectrum: people who are susceptible and people who are protected,” he says. “And we have higher chances of finding those people in Africa than anywhere else.”

As an example of what might be possible, Chikowore cites how genetic studies in African populations led to the development of a new class of cholesterol-lowering medications, with one company even exploring gene editing to treat patients. “Imagine if we could one day do the same for diabetes,” he says. “A genetically informed drug which can make people diabetes-proof. I think that's what the world is looking for.”

Whitney Wolfe Herd returned in March to lead Bumble, the dating app she founded and took public, following the unexpected departure of CEO Lidiane Jones. Now, in a New York Times interview, Wolfe Herd opens up about what happened.

“I had no intentions of coming back,” Wolfe Herd says. Her post-Bumble life initially brought existential questions about her identity, eventually giving way to daily meditation and board calls from the sidelines. That changed when Jones reached out to confess she was overwhelmed. Shortly after that conversation, Jones resigned.

Wolfe Herd dismisses speculation of conflict between them. “I think the world wants people –  particularly when it's a woman to a woman –  they want there to be some riff. There's no riff,” she emphasizes.

Wolfe Herd recognized her own burnout reflected in Jones's exhaustion. “I felt like I was looking in a mirror. I felt like I was looking at myself a year prior… [Jones] herself had made some of the same mistakes I had made, which was working that extra hour, putting in that extra trip.”

Herd, who announced Friday on Instagram that she's expecting her third child, addresses the company's struggles in her Times interview. With Bumble this week reporting first-quarter earnings that fell 7.7% year-over-year, she say that, “Bumble needs me back. It's an extension of me to some degree, and watching it fall from its peak has been very hard.”

On Tuesday, WhatsApp scored a major victory against NSO Group when a jury ordered the infamous spyware maker to pay more than $167 million in damages to the Meta-owned company.

The ruling concluded a legal battle spanning more than five years, which started in October 2019 when WhatsApp accused NSO Group of hacking more than 1,400 of its users by taking advantage of a vulnerability in the chat app's audio-calling functionality.

The verdict came after a week-long jury trial that featured several testimonies, including NSO Group's CEO Yaron Shohat and WhatsApp employees who responded and investigated the incident. 

Even before the trial began, the case had unearthed several revelations, including that NSO Group had cut off 10 of its government customers for abusing its Pegasus spyware, the locations of 1,223 of the victims of the spyware campaign, and the names of three of the spyware maker's customers: Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan.

TechCrunch read the transcripts of the trial's hearings and is highlighting the most interesting facts and revelations that came out. We will update this post as we learn more from the cache of more than 1,000 pages. 

The zero-click attack, which means the spyware required no interaction from the target, “worked by placing a fake WhatsApp phone call to the target,” as WhatsApp's lawyer Antonio Perez said during the trial. The lawyer explained that NSO Group had built what it called the “WhatsApp Installation Server,” a special machine designed to send malicious messages across WhatsApp's infrastructure mimicking real messages. 

“Once received, those messages would trigger the user's phone to reach out to a third server and download the Pegasus spyware. The only thing they needed to make this happen was the phone number,” said Perez. 

NSO Group's research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli testified that “any zero-click solution whatsoever is a significant milestone for Pegasus.”

For years, NSO Group has claimed that its spyware cannot be used against American phone numbers, meaning any cell number that starts with the +1 country code. 

In 2022, The New York Times first reported that the company did “attack” a U.S. phone but it was part of a test for the FBI. 

NSO Group's lawyer Joe Akrotirianakis confirmed this, saying the “single exception” to Pegasus not being able to target +1 numbers “was a specially configured version of Pegasus to be used in demonstration to potential U.S. government customers.”

The FBI reportedly chose not to deploy Pegasus following its test.

NSO's CEO Shohat explained that Pegasus' user interface for its government customers does not provide an option to choose which hacking method or technique to use against the targets they are interested in, “because customers don't care which vector they use, as long as they get the intelligence they need.” 

In other words, it's the Pegasus system in the backend that picks out which hacking technology, known as an exploit, to use each time the spyware targets an individual.

In a funny coincidence, NSO Group's headquarters in Herzliya, a suburb of Tel Aviv in Israel, is in the same building as Apple, whose iPhone customers are also frequently targeted by NSO's Pegasus spyware. Shohat said NSO occupies the top five floors and Apple occupies the remainder of the 14-floor building.

The fact that NSO Group's headquarters are openly advertised is somewhat interesting on its own. Other companies that develop spyware or zero-days like the Barcelona-based Variston, which shuttered in February, was located in a co-working space while claiming on its official website to be located somewhere else. 

Following the spyware attack, WhatsApp filed its lawsuit against NSO Group in November 2019. Despite the active legal challenge, the spyware maker kept targeting the chat app's users, according to NSO Group's research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli. 

Gazneli said that “Erised,” the codename for one of the versions of the WhatsApp zero-click vector, was in use from late-2019 up to May 2020. The other versions were called “Eden” and “Heaven,” and the three were collectively known as “Hummingbird.”

For years, weekend bike rides have been sacred escapes for me. Every pedal stroke helps melt away the stressors that piled up throughout the week, and I've collected a few gadgets that make these rides better. However, I've learned the hard way that bringing along too much gear takes away from the ride itself, forcing you to manage a network of pings and battery levels instead of just riding the damn bike.

Enter Ray-Ban Meta: smart glasses that made my weekend rides simpler and a bit more fun. 

Instead of wearing sunglasses, a pair of headphones, and fumbling around with my phone to take photos throughout the ride, I now have one device that helps with everything.

The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have been a surprise hit with more folks than just me — Meta says it has sold millions of these devices, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently said sales have tripled in the last year.

Several Reddit threads and YouTube videos suggest that lots of folks are wearing Ray-Ban Meta glasses while biking. Meta has caught on as well — it's reportedly building a next generation of AI smart glasses with Oakley, specifically built for athletes. 

I never expected to use my Ray-Ban Metas on the bike. But a few months ago, I decided to try them out. 

Now, I wear these glasses on bike rides more than anywhere else. Meta got just enough things right with these smart glasses to convince me there's something here. It's almost a joy to use, and with a few upgrades, it could get there.

A key selling point of Ray-Ban Meta is that they're just a solid pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses — mine are the Wayfarer style with transition lenses and a clear plastic body. 

I found these work well for bike rides, protecting my eyes from the sun, dirt, and pollen. They sit comfortably under a bike helmet — but maybe not perfectly. (More on that later.)

The killer feature of Meta's smart glasses is the camera that sits above your right and left eyes. The glasses allow me to grab photos and videos of things I see on my rides just by pressing a button on the top right corner of the frames, instead of fumbling with my phone — something that feels slightly cumbersome and dangerous on the bike.

While riding through Golden Gate Park in San Francisco last weekend, I used the Ray-Ban Meta glasses to snap photos of the beautiful Blue Heron Lake, the shrub-covered dunes where the park meets the Pacific Ocean, and the tree-covered track that sits at the park's entrance.

Is the camera amazing? No. But it's pretty good, and I end up capturing moments I simply never would have if I weren't wearing the glasses. For that reason, I don't see the camera as a replacement for my phone's camera, but rather a way to capture more photos and videos altogether.

Went biking through the pan handle with Ray Ban Meta last weekend pic.twitter.com/6WLKmSAHQi

The feature I use the most: the open-ear speakers in the arms of the glasses, which allow me to listen to podcasts and music without blocking the noise of people, bikers, and cars around me. Meta was far from the first company to put speakers in glasses — Bose has had a solid pair for years. But Meta's take on open-ear speakers is surprisingly good. I've been impressed by the audio quality and how little I miss traditional headphones on these rides.

I've found myself chatting with Meta's AI assistant a bit on my weekend rides. I recently asked it questions about the nature I was seeing throughout the park — such as “Hey, Meta, look and tell me what kind of tree this is?” — as well as the origins of the historic buildings I saw.

I typically use bike rides as a way to unplug from the world, so it seemed counterintuitive to talk with an AI chatbot during the rides. However, I found these short queries stoked my curiosity about the world around me without sucking me into a rabbit hole of content and notifications, which is what usually happens when I use my phone.

And, again, the greatest thing about these features is they all come in one device.

That means fewer things to charge, less clutter in my biking gear box, and fewer devices to manage along my ride.

While the Ray-Ban Meta glasses look great for walking around, they clearly weren't designed with biking in mind.

Oftentimes, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses fall down my nose during a bumpy ride. When I'm bent over on the bike and looking up to see what's ahead of me, the thick frames block my view. (Most sunglasses for cyclists have thin frames and nose pads to solve these problems.)

There are some limitations around how the Ray-Ban Meta glasses work with other apps, which is a problem. While I love taking photos and pausing music with the glasses, for anything else, my phone has to come out of my pocket.

For example, Ray-Ban Meta has a Spotify integration, but I had a hard time getting the AI assistant to play specific playlists. Sometimes, the glasses played nothing when I asked for a playlist or played the wrong playlist altogether.

I'd love to see these integrations improved — and expanded to include more biking-specific integrations with apps like Strava or Garmin.

Ray-Ban Meta also doesn't work super well with the rest of my iPhone, which is likely due to Apple's restrictive policies. 

I'd love to be able to fire off texts or easily navigate through Apple Maps with my Ray-Ban Meta glasses, but features like that may not be available until Apple releases its own smart glasses.

That leaves Meta's AI assistant. The AI feature is often touted as the main selling point of these glasses, but I often found it lacking. 

Meta's voice AI is not as impressive as other voice AI products from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Its AI voices feel more robotic, and I find its answers are less reliable.

I tested the recently launched Ray-Ban Meta's live video AI sessions, which were first unveiled at last year's Meta Connect conference. The feature streams live video and audio from Ray-Ban Meta into an AI model in the cloud, aiming to create a more seamless way to interact with your AI assistant and letting it “see” what you see. In reality, it was a hallucinated hot mess.

I asked Ray-Ban Meta to identify some of the interesting cars I was biking past near my apartment. The glasses described a modern Ford Bronco as a vintage Volkswagen Beetle, even though the two look nothing alike. Later, the glasses confidently told me that a 1980s BMW was a Honda Civic. Closer, but still very different cars.

During the live AI session, I asked the AI to help identify some plants and trees. The AI told me a eucalyptus tree was an oak tree. When I said, “No, I think that's a eucalyptus tree,” the AI responded, “Oh yeah, you're right.” Experiences like that make me question why I'm talking to AI at all.

Google DeepMind and OpenAI are also working on multimodal AI sessions like the one that Meta offers with its smart glasses. But for now, the experiences seem far from finished.

I really want to see an improved version of AI smart glasses that I can take on bike rides. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses are one of the most convincing AI devices I've seen yet, and I could see how wearing them on a ride would be a joy after a few key upgrades.

Google has agreed to pay the state of Texas $1.375 billion to settle two lawsuits accusing the company of tracking users' personal location, incognito searches, and voice and facial data without their permission.

The lawsuits were brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in 2022. Facebook's parent company Meta agreed to pay a similar amount to settle a facial recognition-related lawsuit from Paxton last year.

“In Texas, Big Tech is not above the law,” Paxton said in a statement. “For years, Google secretly tracked people's movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.”

Paxton's office also said this is the “highest recovery nationwide against Google for any attorney general's enforcement of state privacy laws.”

A Google spokesperson said the company is settling the lawsuits without any admission of wrongdoing or liability, and without having to change any of its products.

“This settles a raft of old claims, many of which have already been resolved elsewhere, concerning product policies we have long since changed,” said spokesperson José Castañeda in a statement. “We are pleased to put them behind us, and we will continue to build robust privacy controls into our services.”

Google won some earlier victories in these suits, for example with an appeals court ruling that the company lacks sufficient ties to Texas to face a lawsuit there. The company had initially responding by saying Paxton mischaracterized its products “in another breathless lawsuit” — for example, the company said Google Photos only scanned users' faces in order to group similar photos together, and that it did not use the feature for advertising.

The settlement comes after major antitrust rulings finding that Google acted illegally to maintain monopolies in web search and advertising tech, with proposed remedies including the divestment of Chrome. (Google has said it will appeal both rulings.)

Paxton, meanwhile, recently announced that he will challenge U.S. Senator John Cornyn in next year's mid-term elections.

A galactic filament that stretches across 230 light-years in the Milky Way has suffered from a strange kink that has distorted its magnetic field, appearing as a fracture in a massive bone. New X-ray images captured by the Chandra Observatory may have finally helped astronomers diagnose its ailment, naming a fast-spinning neutron star as the culprit.

The center of the galaxy is marked by enormous, bone-like structures threaded with parallel magnetic fields and swirling, high-energy particles. Located roughly 26,000 light-years from Earth, G359.13—also known as The Snake—is the longest and brightest of these structures. Despite its size, the bone-like structure appears to have been struck by a fast-moving, rapidly spinning neutron star, or pulsar, causing a break in the otherwise continuous length of G359.13, according to a new paper published in the May 2024 issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Using images of the galactic bone captured by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and radio data from the MeerKAT radio array in South Africa, the team behind the paper was able to examine the fracture up close to identify the culprit. The particles that make up the Snake, and other galactic filaments, emit radio waves, which can be detected by arrays such as MeerKAT.

The images fittingly resemble medical X-rays of a long, thin bone with a fracture in the center. By examining the images, the astronomers discovered an X-ray and radio source at the location of the fracture, which may come from electrons and positrons (the antimatter counterparts to electrons) that have been accelerated to high energies due to a pulsar smashing into them. The pulsar can be seen in the image thanks to its X-ray emissions, which caused it to get caught red-handed in its hit and run.

Pulsars are the chaotic remains of stars, forming in the aftermath of the collapse and supernova explosion of a massive star. These explosions often send the pulsar flying at high speeds while rapidly rotating and beaming electromagnetic radiation. There's a lot going on here, and the pulsar isn't exactly watching where it's going.

The researchers believe a speedy pulsar may have caused the fracture by smashing into G359.13 at speeds between one million and two million miles per hour. The likely collision distorted the magnetic field in the bone, which caused the radio signal to also become warped.

The Milky Way is full of violent encounters like this, and the busted filament is just the latest sign of the galaxy's ongoing chaos. With tools like Chandra and MeerKAT, astronomers are continuing to catch these cosmic troublemakers in the act.

Chances are, you know someone with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or you might have it yourself.

ADHD is a complex condition characterized by symptoms like a constant inability to pay attention, impulsiveness, trouble sleeping, and mood swings. According to the latest data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 7 million children in the U.S. (11.4% of all children) have been diagnosed with ADHD, along with 15.5 million U.S. adults (6% of the adult population)—half of whom were diagnosed as kids.

These numbers aren't fixed, however. The prevalence of diagnosed ADHD has steadily risen in the U.S. over time, and can differ significantly from state to state. Globally, ADHD rates tend to be lower than those seen in the U.S., though prevalence has been increasing in some parts of the world. The reasons for this increase in diagnosed ADHD, or the differing rates across states or countries, aren't clear.

It's possible that much of this increase simply reflects doctors becoming better at recognizing ADHD in children and adults over time. But ADHD is also predominantly thought to be caused by a complicated mix of genetic and environmental factors, and it's possible that some of these factors might be on the rise. In perhaps the weakest version of that theory, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services, appeared to imply recently—without any supporting evidence—that the rise in ADHD and other neurological conditions is being caused by food dyes or another supposed environmental toxin.

People With ADHD Are Living Shorter Lives, Study Finds

Some researchers have argued that at least part of the difference in ADHD rates can be attributed to cultural perceptions of the behaviors associated with it—particularly in children—as well as other societal factors.

For this Giz Asks, we reached out to psychologists, psychiatrists, and medical historians to get their take on why ADHD rates vary so widely from place to place. The following responses may have been lightly edited for clarity and grammar.

A psychologist specializing in ADHD and other developmental conditions at Syracuse University.

The prevalence of ADHD in children varies between 5% and 10% depending on the region of the world. ADHD prevalence rates are generally higher in the U.S. (closer to 10%) and lower in Europe and Asia (closer to 5%). Rather than biology, there are medical, social/cultural and educational explanations as to why ADHD is more common in the U.S.

Medical: Children in the U.S. are more often screened for ADHD by primary care physicians than in some other places in the world. In addition, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is used to diagnose ADHD in the U.S. and has a wider diagnostic criteria for ADHD than the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) which is used in most other parts of the world. Finally, the U.S. is one of only two countries (New Zealand is the other) which allows direct-to-consumer advertising of medications. This increased awareness of treatment options likely contributes to higher diagnosis (and medication rates). All three of these medical explanations sets the stage for ADHD to be more often diagnosed in the U.S.

Social/Cultural: In the U.S., ADHD is widely known and discussed. This increased awareness can lead to caregivers and teachers noticing inattentive and/or hyperactive- impulsive symptoms more frequently. These behaviors might then be quickly labeled as “disordered” rather than considered as within the range of typical child development. In comparison to other places in the world (especially Asia), there is somewhat lower stigma regarding ADHD in the U.S. The relatively lower level of stigma can lead to more caregivers seeking and accepting ADHD treatment. Finally, K-12 U.S. schools often emphasize self-control in the classroom (e.g., stay seated for 6+ hours per day). This emphasis on self-control may make ADHD-like behaviors more noticeable in school. All three of these social/cultural explanations sets the stage for ADHD to be more often diagnosed in the U.S.

Educational: In the U.S., an ADHD diagnosis can lead to the provision of school services, resources, and accommodations. This can lead to an inherent incentive to diagnose the condition. In my opinion, this is likely the greatest single influence on the higher ADHD prevalence rates that are commonly reported in the U.S.

Professor of health history at the University of Strathclyde's Center for the Social History of Health and Healthcare and author of the 2011 book Hyperactive: The Controversial History of ADHD.

One of the reasons ADHD is most commonly diagnosed in the United States is that it is where it was first diagnosed. Whereas most countries began diagnosing ADHD in the 1980s and more often in the 1990s, American children were first diagnosed with what we'd recognize as ADHD in the late 1950s. That is when the term Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder was coined. Previously, hyperactive, impulsive children were only thought to be problematic when their behaviors were very severe or associated with underlying brain damage. Of more concern to child experts were shy, inactive, withdrawn, and nervous children. In contrast, Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder, coined in 1957, was depicted as common, occurring in most classrooms.

Following the Soviet launch of Sputnik (also in 1957), Americans grew concerned about why they appeared to be lagging behind in the Space Race. The National Defense Education Act was passed in the next year, placing more focus on core subjects, encouraging students to stay in school or college for longer, and hiring guidance counsellors to identify under-achievers. Those singled out as not meeting expectations were often diagnosed with Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder.

At the same time, the manufacturer of the drug Ritalin was looking for a market. It was approved to treat hyperactive children in 1961, spurring an aggressive marketing campaign that promoted not only the drug, but the disorder it was meant to treat. While some of the tactics employed by drug companies were restricted in the 1970s, the advent of direct-to-consumer advertising in the 1980s and 1990s boosted the popularity of the disorder, now called ADHD, even further.

Alongside these factors, we also have to consider the environmental factors thought to contribute to ADHD behaviors, ranging from synthetic food additives and exposure to atmospheric lead, to lack of exercise and time in nature. Many of these contributing factors have been and continue to be more significant in the U.S. than in other countries.

Professor of psychiatry and co-director of the Center for Mental Health Innovation at Oregon Health & Science University's School of Medicine.

The usual scientific opening and the boring answer: a combination of multiple secular [long-term, non-cyclical] factors. But we can name some of them.

First, laws are different. For example, in the U.S., educational laws mean that a diagnosis of ADHD can enable resources to be marshaled for children struggling in school—thus it really matters if a child has a diagnosis of ADHD and when they struggle in school, this gets looked at much more quickly than in other countries.

Second, treatment guidelines are different across countries. In some countries, medication is only rarely prescribed to children, but guidelines in other countries, including the U.S., encourage use of medication as a first line treatment due to its low cost, general efficacy, and limited availability of other options.

Third, the quality of the health care system matters. The U.S. system is patchy at best, and so it is often not possible for a child to get the support they need—what appears as ADHD may be better seen as another issue, but the resources to identify and support other issues are insufficient, and ADHD becomes the “low hanging fruit” to address.

Fourth, clinician ideas of how to diagnose ADHD, and at what threshold to do so, vary widely. Even within a single state in the U.S., we have seen that rates of identification of ADHD vary markedly from one county to another. The best studies I have seen indicate that cross-national differences in true prevalence (as distinct from case identification) are small (ranging from 2% to 4% or so), whereas case identification rates vary much more widely.

Although genetic influences are extremely important in ADHD, environmental exposures also matter to etiology. (We have not seen any evidence so far that population genetic variation is sufficient to affect prevalence). Thus, although not well demonstrated, it is likely that regional differences in relevant risk factors (for example, air pollution, ambient lead exposure, poverty and resource availability for families, maternal health during gestation and perinatal health, rates of family trauma) also account for within-country regional variation, as well as partly influencing cross-national variation in both true prevalence and case identification of ADHD or ADHD-like problems.

Distinguished professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley and director of the Berkeley Girls with ADHD Longitudinal Study, the longest follow-up study of its kind.

ADHD is the latest name for a constellation of problems and impairments that have been professionally recognized since the advent of compulsory education. It's controversial—particularly because, just as is the case with other mental and neurodevelopmental conditions there is no objective biological “marker” (as there is for coronary artery disease or cancer) to pinpoint its presence. Nonetheless, an individual with levels of attention dysregulation, impulse control problems, and difficulty organizing one's life may well display, over time, impairments in academic performance, social interactions, job performance, and regulation of emotions.

And for those who might think that ADHD is a convenient label for lax parenting or difficult schools, there is a ton of evidence that the later-life issues they experience too often include low self-image, either aggressive or depressive behaviors, high risk for accidental injuries, and especially for girls, high rates of unplanned pregnancies, exposure to intimate partner violence, and self-inflicted injury (including both non-suicidal self injury and actual suicidal behavior).

Why some people have high levels of ADHD but most do not is related far more to genetic differences across individuals than to differences in family interactions or contexts. Thus, ADHD (via twin and adoption studies) is significantly heritable. Still, even if one has the genetic predisposition (spanning many genes, each operating to produce a small amount of risk), how one is parented and schooled can go a long way toward exacerbating or instead minimizing impact via building of strengths.

International studies over the past 17 years have found, intriguingly, that in countries with compulsory education, the rates of diagnosed ADHD in children and teens are remarkably consistent—comprising around 5 to 8% of the population of young people. This provides circumstantial evidence for the proposition that when youth with genetic propensities for an exploratory, impulsive style are made to go to compulsory education, a remarkably similar percentage have real difficulties with self-control.

However, two countries with rates of diagnosed prevalence well above these international rates are the U.S. and Israel—both of which have extreme levels of academic pressure to succeed. In fact, in a book I co-authored with the health economist Richard Scheffler, The ADHD Explosion, we found that the underlying major differences in ADHD diagnostic rates across U.S. states could be pinned to state-by-state differences in educational policies related to district-wide standardized test scores. That is, in states that suddenly mandated certain levels of academic performance in order to maintain state support for those districts, rates of ADHD diagnoses rose precipitously over the ensuing years—because of pressure to get such youth treated and because of policies at the time that excluded youth diagnosed with ADHD from being counted in the district's test-score average (because these were now “special ed” kids).

Overall, despite the psychobiological reality of ADHD, when carefully assessed, it may well be that social and cultural pressures to “perform” can falsely inflate rates of diagnosis (a) when there is pressure on public schools to produce better test scores at all costs and (b) given the tendencies for many non-specialist professionals to yield a quick diagnosis in absence of the needed time and effort to make a valid diagnosis.

Finally, though you didn't ask, there's been a 100-year-long ignoring and discounting of the possibility that girls and women can “have” ADHD. A lot of work in my lab has shown this to be a myth: Boys ARE about twice as likely as girls to develop ADHD, but this is wildly different from the supposed 10:1 difference so often posited. Girls tend to show a less ornery and overt form of ADHD than boys—and professionals must catch up with the latest diagnostic standards.

UGREEN is one of the top names in the portable charging world, side by side with Anker at the very top of the market. Both are famous for innovation and their products are the go-to option if you need to keep your devices charged while on the go.

But with tariffs looming that will have a major impact on the cost of electronics imported from Asia, there has never been a better time to purchase quality equipment while it is still available in the US at current prices. The UGREEN 25,000mAh 145W power bank is one of the most powerful and advanced options available today, and it's currently on sale at Amazon for just $65, which is a full 34% discount from its usual $99 price and an all-time low price!

See at Amazon

What truly distinguishes this UGREEN power bank from all other devices on the market is 1) its incredible charging speed and 2) its capacity. With a total output of 145W and support for Power Delivery 3.1 and Quick Charge 3.0, this battery pack can fast-charge almost any device you can imagine.

The main USB-C1 port delivers up to 140W which can be used to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from dead to 56% in just 30 minutes. This is a game-changer for professionals and travelers who need to recharge laptops, tablets, or gaming devices like the Steam Deck in record time. The power bank features three output ports-two USB-C and one USB-A-making it easy to charge multiple devices at once, whether you're topping up your phone, tablet, or even a drone.

The massive capacity of 25,000mAh (most of the competitors only offer 10,000mAh) means you can fully charge most laptops at least once, and smartphones up to five times before you have to recharge the power bank itself. Despite this huge capacity, the unit is still fairly compact, light-weighted and portable. It fits smoothly into a laptop bag or backpack and is perfect for traveling, business trips or long days away from wall sockets. Another feature is the smart digital display that shows how much battery percentage is left with a glance, which is quite cool and useful.

Charging the power bank itself is fast and efficient, thanks to its two-way fast charging: Using a 65W PD charger (not included), you can top up the entire battery in just two hours which is extremely fast for a device of this size. The bi-directional charging also means that you can charge the power bank and your devices simultaneously.

As tariffs are set to raise prices on almost all electronics, this is maybe your last chance to grab one of the most powerful power banks out there at an all-time low price.

There's a boom in popularity of robot vacuums on store shelves, and choosing the right one can be quite a challenge. Among experts, there's near-unanimous welcome that Roborock is one of the best contenders out there.

Roborock's “Q” series has particularly been well-praised for its value for money, and the latest Roborock Q8 Max carries on this tradition. Amazon is now offering this great version at its all-time lowest price of just $259, which is a massive 57% discount from its initial price tag of $599. It's a great opportunity, and this is one of our favorite models. Now, almost all new Roborock vacuums are sold above $1,000 which makes this Q8 Max an even better deal.

See at Amazon

Roborock Q8 Max has a great 5,500 Pa HyperForce suction system, which is triple that of a typical robot vacuum. It is capable of effortlessly scooping up dust, crumbs and even tough pet hair on carpets and hardwood floors with equal ease. The Q8 Max also has Roborock's groundbreaking DuoRoller brush mechanism-two rubber rollers that rotate in opposite directions to pick up more dirt and prevent hair from becoming tangled as often by 20%.

But the Roborock Q8 Max is not just a vacuum: It mops and vacuums in one, complete with a 350ml water tank and 30 adjustable water flow levels to tackle everything from loose dust to embedded dirt. The mop part is merely removable so that you can switch between modes or use them sequentially on each other for a deeper clean. It has a large 770ml dustbin so you won't be having to empty it nearly as often and the battery life is just as good: up to 240 minutes of usage on a single charge which is long enough to clean up to 300 square meters.

Roborock is also very popular for its PreciSense LiDAR technology: it maps your home accurately and quickly getting familiarized with the layout and adapting cleaning routes for optimal efficiency. The robot can hold up to four independent floor plans so it's perfect for multi-level homes-just place it on a new floor, and it'll know where it is right away. The Q8 Max also uses advanced obstacle avoidance, sensing and avoiding chairs, cables, and even toys that would send less advanced robots stumbling. You can set no-go zones and virtual walls through the Roborock app so you have complete control over where and how it cleans.

The Roborock app itself is simple to use and feature-packed: You can schedule cleanings, customize settings, monitor the robot's progress in real time, and even view a 3D map of your home. Voice control is also supported through Alexa, Google Home, and Siri. The Q8 Max is as hands-free as possible and automatically goes back to its base to charge and, in the case of the Q8 Max+ model, even emptying its own dustbin for complete autonomous use.

If you're looking for a reliable and ultra performing robovac, this is the one you should go for.

Apple's working with Broadcom on Baltra.

According to Bloomberg, Apple is developing data center-grade processors meant primarily to serve inquiries from Apple Intelligence. Like many of its industry peers, the company is working with Broadcom to develop its AI accelerators. Yet, the details the news agency presents may indicate that Apple has bigger plans for its in-house data center hardware.

Apple's data center processor is reportedly codenamed Baltra; it was developed in partnership with Broadcom and is expected to be completed by 2027. All Broadcom-designed AI processors typically use systolic arrays of proprietary processing elements (usually tensor or matrix units) and HBM memory stacks. However, the report says that Apple is studying different configurations for its server processor, including models that have 'double, quadruple or eight times the number of main processing and graphics cores as today's M3 Ultra.'

The M3 Ultra is a formidable CPU regarding core count: it packs 24 high-performance and eight energy-efficient cores. However, data center processors do not tend to use hybrid designs, so we can only wonder whether the report meant eight times more general-purpose CPU cores (i.e., 256 cores) or eight times more high-performance CPU cores (192 cores). Quadrupling M3 Ultra's graphics clusters will probably result in performance comparable to that of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 or better.

But there is a catch: modern AI applications do not use general-purpose CPU or GPU cores for training or inference; instead, they use tensor or matrix units. Apple's NPU relies on matrix multiply logic optimized for on-device AI, for example. If Apple is developing an AI accelerator for inference, it would rather need to scale its NPU engine than the number of CPU cores. Still, AI servers need a CPU to schedule data flows and feed data to accelerators so that Apple might be developing both CPU and AI accelerators under the project Baltra moniker.

On the Mac front, the roadmap includes several new processors. The report says that the M5 system-on-chip will be updated for iPad Pro and MacBook Pro models by the end of 2025, which is no surprise. Beyond that, Apple is developing system-on-chip devices referred to internally as M6 (codenamed Komodo) and M7 (codenamed Borneo), intended to power subsequent generations of iPad and Mac devices. Another high-end chip, Sotra, is also under development, though no details about its target devices are known.

In addition, Apple is developing custom processors for its wearable devices, such as augmented reality smart glasses.

Students are trying to make their laptops smoke on video for views.

A dangerous viral trend has been going around TikTok where kids try to make their Chromebooks start smoking by putting foreign metallic objects in their ports. These items include pins, paperclips, staples, and scissors, among others, which are all readily available around the classroom. According to Ars Technica, many school districts have quickly taken action, with those in Colorado, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington sending written warnings to parents about the risky challenge.

There have been multiple reports of students trying the challenge, which sometimes results in their laptop smoking or catching fire. And because there's a high risk of explosion with damaged lithium batteries, these incidents resulted in classroom evacuations, class cancellations, and, in some cases, deployment of firefighters or other first responders. One incident had a student sticking a pair of scissors into a laptop, causing it to release a lot of toxic smoke. This led to one student being sent to the hospital for inhalation, while the offender is now facing charges in juvenile court.

This isn't the first time a dangerous viral trend has started circulating on popular social media. We've seen several “challenges” in the previous years, including the Kia Challenge, which showed how easy it was to steal certain Kia and Hyundai model years and led to a rise in car thefts just for clout on TikTok.

There was also the Blackout Challenge, where kids would strangle themselves on live video until they passed out, which, unfortunately, has led to several accidental deaths. Finally, there was the Penny or Outlet Challenge in early 2020, where those trying it would insert a plug into a power outlet and then slide a penny onto the exposed prongs, leading to short circuits.

TikTok reacted quickly when the news started going viral and shut down the challenge. We got no results when we searched for Chromebook Challenge on the social media platform. Instead, we got this warning: “This phrase may be associated with behavior or content that violates our guidelines. Promoting a safe and positive experience is TikTok's top priority. For more information, we invite you to review our Community Guidelines.”

We did get some results when we searched for Chromebook durability, which showed some people purposefully throwing their laptops against hard surfaces or bending them to see how long they would last. We even saw one clip of a person scratching the laptop's port with a metal pin, but none showed a Chromebook smoking or catching fire.

Gigabyte has added pressurized thermal pads to M.2 slots for SSDs on its latest Aorus Stealth Ice motherboards (via Uniko's Hardware) to maximize heat dissipation of high-end SSDs. The motherboard maker claims that its pressurized thermal pad may reduce SSD temperature by 12 degrees Celsius, though it admits that the effect depends on multiple factors.

Thermals often constrain the performance of high-end SSDs in an M.2 form-factor, as both the controller and memory packages tend to heat up under high loads. Most high-end drives come with a pre-installed heat spreader, and many high-end motherboards come with their thermal solutions for SSDs. However, these thermal solutions are mainly designed to cool down the controller and the upper side of the drives, whereas backplates are tailored for single-sided or double-sided drives. Apparently, Gigabyte has found a flexible solution. Literally.

Gigabyte's EZ-Flex solution, introduced on its B850 Aorus Stealth Ice motherboard, addresses these shortcomings by combining pressurized thermal pads with a spring-loaded, flexible backplate. This setup adapts to the thickness of both single- and double-sided M.2 SSDs, maintaining uniform pressure and ensuring better thermal contact on both sides of the drive. As a result, SSD temperatures can be reduced by up to 12°C, helping to prevent thermal throttling and sustain high performance during intensive workloads.

Gigabyte's EZ-Flex design not only improves thermal performance and enhances compatibility with both single- and double-sided SSDs, but it also ensures more consistent mechanical pressure for better stability and reduces the risk of installation errors due to its adaptive fit. As a bonus, such a design could reduce SSD bending after prolonged usage. In addition, lowering temperatures helps extend the lifespan of SSD components. It minimizes performance throttling under sustained workloads, making it especially beneficial for users handling large data transfers or demanding applications.

It remains to be seen whether EZ-Flex will now be a part of all Gigabyte's motherboards, or will only be featured on premium solutions. Considering that the B850 is not a premium platform, EZ-Flex will likely be a widespread feature on Gigabyte mainboards. After all, just two springs are not expensive, right?

We visited the Asus HQ in Taipei for a technology briefing, to enjoy some NUC desktop and ROG laptop hands-on time, and to glean exclusive hardware design insights. Tom's Hardware readers are probably going to be most enthralled by the details and images we have of the upcoming ROG NUC 2025 (a very close relation to the NUC 15 Performance). We also saw the complete Asus ROG 2025 laptop lineup with RTX 5080 and 5090 GPUs, as stripped down to the silicon for some PCB peeking.

Our visit to the Asus LiGong building was in mid-March, while several key components were still a secret. Two of the company's business units welcomed us on the day: The Asus NUC team, and the Asus ROG gaming laptop technical marketing team.

As you might expect, Asus has quite an impressive HQ, located in Taipei's Beitou District. The LiGong building we visited is its newer HQ, styled in the form of an 'open book' (the logo you see is on the rear, the spine of the book). However, certain divisions like VGA and motherboards have remained at the longer-established Asus Li-De building, across the road.

Inside Asus LiGong, there seemed little reason for employees to leave other than to go home to sleep. There was a whole floor dedicated to a modern glistening food court with a wide range of cuisines, a 7-11 convenience store, a juice bar, chains like Starbucks and MOS Burger, hang-out spaces, and I even noticed an on-site travel agent. After regular work hours people also stick around for the on-site gym, clubs, and social events — we noticed the Asus orchestra had started practicing as we left.

It is also interesting to note that Asus manufacturing spinoff Pegatron remains in very close proximity. Even though it is now an independent company, Beitou remains a good site for the ODM firm's HQ.

Spending time with the NUC team, it was incredibly interesting to learn about how the different teams from Asus and Intel work together in 2025. We also got to analyze the latest product stack, and ponder the plans the team has going forward.

The lead NUC executive we met was Mavila Wu, whose current full title is Deputy Division Director of Product Division, NUC Business Unit, at Asus. An Asus employee for approaching 20 years, Wu hosted the presentation, device showcase, and Q&As. However, other execs from Asus (including some ex-Intel NUC folks) were there to share insight and field questions.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Our discussions began with talk about the NUC product transition from Intel to Asus, which officially began about 18 months ago. The change meant a big culture and technology transition. However, Asus has maintained the geographically broad based expertise from the merger – with teams still collaborating between offices in Oregon, Arizona, and Taipei.

The transition period occurred during the NUC 12 to 13 era, with Asus firmly holding the reins on the recently announced NUC 14 line. Of course, the emerging NUC 15 Pro, NUC 15 Pro+, NUC 15 Performance, and the closely related ROG NUC 2025, are now well-established Asus products. The Expert Center (AMD powered) NUC-a-like products are maintained and benefit from similar thermal, power management, multiphase designs, and other advancements that we have seen come to the (Intel powered) NUC machines recently.

We asked the team to highlight some of the biggest differences a user might notice between an old Intel NUC and a contemporary Asus NUC. It turns out that some design targets were changed due to Asus' influence.

The NUC team pointed out that Asus is stricter about what is considered to be an acceptable level of device noise. We were told that an Intel NUC might have run at up to 45dB under load, but Asus makes sure the active cooling systems in new devices won't exceed 38dB – a noticeably quieter profile.

With the latest generation of NUCs we see they typically have their Lunar Lake or Arrow Lake processors running at TDPs configured from 25 to 40W. For a long time, these standard NUCs have been roughly 4x4-inch devices of varying heights.

During the visit we were pleased to see the new NUC 15 Pro+, which continues the 4x5-inch form factor that we saw debut with the NUC 14 Pro+. To be precise, these are 144 x 112 x 42mm (0.7 liter). Side by side, the Nuc 15 Pro+ body seemed negligibly bulkier than its standard compact NUC siblings (which start at 0.48 liters), but the benefits might be well worth it, if you want more processing power.

The slightly larger chassis Asus uses for the Pro+ can be used to great effect. According to the technical team at the presentation, the new rectangular chassis enables the use of Intel's new Arrow Lake H processors configured at up to 65W this generation. Remember, they still have to keep the noise levels below 38dB.

Opening up the Pro+, and comparing it with its brethren, shows the significantly reconfigured cooling in this model. Instead of all the cooling apparatus being mostly on one side of the PCB, the Pro+ features an array of heatpipes extending over the side of the PCB with the CPU, with the motherboard flanked by fin stacks connected to the heatpipes. Last but not least, we have what's likely to be the largest fan you could fit (approx 90mm), attached to the hinged lid of the device, directing air over the left/right fin stacks.

Another highlight of the NUC team meeting was getting to check out a sample of the ROG NUC 2025. This 3 liter device packs a lot of CPU and GPU processing power, but the Asus team assured that it is very quiet, with its triple fan design, and what looked like more than half the volume of the chassis used by the dual vapor chamber enhanced cooling system.

The ROG NUC 2025 system was powered up during the visit, but we didn't run any programs on it. But, you wouldn't know it was even on, if it were not for the ROG RGB lighting zones being lit.

Inside this high-performance yet compact machine is a potent mix of an Intel Core Ultra CPU (Arrow Lake HX) plus one of Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture GeForce RTX 5070 Ti or 5080 laptop GPUs.

We were told that the CPU was configured to run at 55W, and the GPU at up to 140W, by default. But power limits are dynamic, depending on system workloads, and the CPU could chew through significantly more than 55W if required, and the headroom was available. A sturdy 330W PSU keeps the power flowing to the ROG NUC's laptop processors, and is sufficient enough for some USB ports to function as charging/power sources.

Other attractions of the ROG NUC (2025) highlighted by the team were its support for up to five displays, its Intel Killer networking, and its onboard Thunderbolt 4 ports.

Asus's ROG NUC 2025 device will be available from H2 this year. Professionals who might need the same kind of power, without the RGB and ROG styling, should look at the near-identical NUC 15 Performance. The only thing it lacks is the typical ROG styling and RGB. A bonus for the pros is that there will be more configurations available, including a barebones option.

We talked about cooling NUCs, or rather, mini-PCs in general. Interestingly, the team at the meeting insisted that NUCs aren't easier to cool or thermally manage than laptops. They might be thicker and deeper, but laptops have a large surface area for venting and heat convection, it was reasoned.

Asus also wanted to highlight the quality and reliability of its NUC line. It was claimed that the Asus NUCs (and Expert Centers) went through far more rigorous heat, humidity, and endurance testing than the ""industry standard."" Moreover, we were quoted a return rate of under 0.5% for NUCs. This compared well with the mini-PC average of over 3%, according to the Asus team.



Going forward into 2026 and beyond, Asus sees AI as a driver for the NUC business unit. We've heard lots of this kind of thing before, but Asus isn't talking about Microsoft's lame Copilot. Instead, it has large customers who want to use Edge AI applications. We are talking about tasks like deepfake image protection, medical AI, customer service AI, and so on. With a quoted 80% of the unit's business with SMBs, governments, education, and other large orgs – this shows AI isn't just a tech talking point in this instance.

The range of Asus laptops available in 2025 is quite staggering, with the company developing products for many niches – with additional geographic and retail partner exclusive models. So, at Asus LiGong, it was a relief to focus solely on the latest ROG designs for 2025 featuring the newest mobile processors from AMD and Intel, as well as (of course) the brand-new Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs.

Specific Asus ROG devices we got a close look at, including a peek at the PCBs, were the ROG Flow Z13, ROG Strix Scar 16, ROG Strix Scar 18, ROG Zephyrus G14, the ROG Zephyrus G16, and the ROG XG Mobile GC34 – all 2025 models. For completeness, there are also non-Scar versions of the Strix models launching, the Strix G16 and Strix G18, which basically trim the “AniMe Vision” frills.

Before looking at the shiny new 2025 hardware, it was interesting to hear about the process Asus goes through from concept to finished laptop. Sascha Krohn, the firm's Director of Technical Marketing and a 10-year veteran at Asus, offered the most insight in this segment of our visit.

We were told that every design would start with digital renders, which sounds logical. Once things were narrowed down on the digital side, the earliest prototypes would be made in the physical world. So, the earliest physical sample could be simply made from cardboard or foam, or increasingly nowadays, 3D printed. It would still be pretty quick and cheap to iterate at this stage.

Before the laptops, we got a chance to see these two very interesting devices in the flesh, and powered up. You've likely seen these devices in our news, but reviews may or may not have been published by the time you read this.

Firstly, let's look at Asus' latest iteration of its ROG branded portable eGPU. The new ROG XG Mobile (2025) stands on the shoulders of its predecessor with two important new features: the upgrade to Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs (laptop GPUs), and Thunderbolt 5 connectivity.

Both while under load and while idle, this eGPU was pleasingly quiet, as it should be, and the solitary RGB area was a ROG logo case cutout. We had mixed feelings about the smoked semi-opaque case, as from a distance the unit just looked like it needed to be wiped clean of fingerprints, or something.

The RTX 5090 laptop unit we had in hand (24GB) was also very compact and light. It measures 8.2 x 6.1 x 1.2 inches (208 x 155 x 29.6 mm) and weighs just 1.3kg. That figure is more impressive due to the fact that there's a built-in 330W power-brick – so all you need is a standard IEC mains cable for power. There's a kickstand, too, providing some more placement or mounting flexibility.

Don't forget, this is more than an eGPU, as it also bristles with fast ports and an SD Express card reader. Asus will also be making an RTX 5070 Ti laptop GPU (12GB) variant, too.



Though we didn't have much time to play with the Asus ROG XG Mobile, we were pleased to see a rev2.0 PCB from the device. On this unpopulated sample, it is easy to see the various port connector pads to the right, and the large GPU area flanked by locations for up to eight GDDR7 ICs. To the far left are the locations for all the power stage components. Putting this PCB in context with the assembled device, it shows how compact the internal 330W PSU really is.

We have reviewed earlier iterations of the ROG Flow Z13, and we will be deep diving into the 2025 edition, which beats a brand-new path with a Strix Halo APU at its heart, aka the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395.

We met the Z13 product manager, Albert Lee, who said that the scale of demand for this gaming tablet had been a (pleasant) surprise.

These tablet hybrid devices aren't very affordable due to the complex and large (hence expensive) AMD chips, plus premium supporting components. However, markets like China, which had at first seemed reticent, suddenly became very keen for stock, according to Lee. The well publicized AI processing power of these Strix Halo platforms might have piqued the interest of Chinese power users. This is good for Asus, and probably good for AMD's plans to develop and sell similar - or even stronger - APUs.

We also saw and had some hands-on time with the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16, ROG Strix Scar 18, ROG Zephyrus G14, and ROG Zephyrus G16 – all 2025 models, of course.

Across the board, these models feature the latest CPUs from AMD and Intel, as well as RTX 50 series graphics. The family will initially launch for those with the appetite and budget for higher-end devices. Thus, we will see RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 variants of these powerful laptops come first.

For the best performance on the go, the thicker, heavier ROG Strix family is an easy choice. With one of these AniMe Matrix lid capped machines, you will enjoy CPUs up to 55W and GPUs with up to 175W TDPs. We were told that if a task required max CPU resources and wasn't interested in GPU acceleration, the CPU would be able to run at a sustained 140W, with boosting up to 175W, too (manual mode). When gaming, users should expect the CPU to run at up to 80W, and the GPU at 175W, for a total platform max power of 255W.

Our opened-up laptops and PCBs revealed some interesting features of the Strix laptops. These are really easy to get into, too, with a tool-less system reliant on a sliding latch which enables the bottom covers to be slid and popped off with very little effort.

It was evident that the two different sized ROG Strix models shared the same PCB design, but they fit into the two different sized chassis thanks to the floating position of the I/O daughterboard on the left (looking down on an opened unit).

The triple fan cooling system has the smallest fan approximately beneath the top of the trackpad/keyboard boundary to cool the chipset. To one side are the removable memory slots and an M.2 SSD slot, to the other another M.2 SSD slot (both are Q-latch). A sizable end-to-end vapor chamber unifies this cooling solution.

Another interesting observation in the ROG laptops was the intrusion sensor design. With the easy detach bottom cover of the Strix Scar models, this might be a particularly good idea to prevent electronic damage through carelessness. In the images you can see a black foam ‘obelisk' on the PCB, this is hollowed out and it encircles a light sensor. When the bottom cover is on, no light can get to the sensor, but when the cover is popped off and the sensor exposed it will initiate a system shutdown – if the user has forgotten to do this, or left the machine asleep, inadvertently.

Moving along to the ROG Zephyrus refresh machines, and (as usual) these slim, attractive designs make a significant break from traditional gaming laptop aesthetics and builds. One could say they are more like a MacBook Pro or Dell XPS design, but they still offer gaming credentials – and this year's Zephyrus machines pack in the latest and greatest silicon.

Talking to Krohn about the new Zephyrus, it was highlighted that to deliver gaming laptops so sleek, compact, and light it was necessary to keep the number of watts the CPU and GPU can consume in check. This has always been the case for this line, and if purchasers aren't happy with this compromise, they are directed to the ROG Strix line instead.

Comparing the 16-inch Zephyrus and 16-inch Scar, for contrast, the Zephyrus is around one kilo (2.2 pounds) lighter, and less than half the volume of the Scar. Meanwhile, the Zephyrus G14 weighs about the same as an Apple MacBook Pro 14.

Asus has a number of tricks up its sleeve that mean investing in higher spec GPU-equipped members of this gaming laptop family is still worthwhile. The new Zephyrus G14, equipped with an RTX 5080 (the highest spec at this size) makes use of liquid metal on the CPU and GPU for better thermals, though it still uses a heatpipe-based cooling system.

The first new Zephyrus G16 machines with RTX 5080 or RTX 5090 laptop GPUs will feature a vapor chamber cooler. We aren't sure whether the new RTX 5070 Ti machines will sit in the vapor chamber or heatpipe camp.

Opening up these new Zephyrus units, we see a similar sight to the 2024 models. The G14 has a replaceable M.2 2280 SSD and Wi-Fi card, and the G16 improves on this with a welcome extra M.2 2280 slot for storage expansion. The design is very clean, making best use of the limited space in these slim devices.

We asked about the specter of liquid metal run-off, or dry spots causing issues. The internet is full of discussions of this phenomenon. In answer, Krohn said that this was incredibly rare to see in RMA samples.

Furthermore, we were told the appearance of tarnishing once the processor surfaces are exposed by a technician isn't typically evidence of a dry spot, but a simple chemical reaction with some impurity that had found its way there. Asus insists it uses more than enough TIM to mean there will not be dry spots.

Last but not least, those who think they have liquid metal-based issues are encouraged to contact Asus support, and not to loosen or remove the laptop's heatsinks.

Sascha Krohn, the Director of Technical Marketing at Asus, was happy to share some insight into his background, education, career – and more.

Krohn was born in Germany, and you may be surprised to hear he didn't study any computer technology related subject at university, concluding his studies after obtaining a joint degree in Biology and Spanish.

Sensing his future was in tech, Krohn thought firing out emails at an assortment of computer companies was worth a shot. As luck would have it, AMD called back with an offer of a customer support role at its UK HQ. After his grounding at AMD, the young man returned to Germany to work for a memory firm, which became his springboard to a career and settled life in Taiwan.

The current Technical Marketing head at Asus, moved to the sweet potato shaped silicon island in the mid-to-late 2000s to work for Foxconn and set up its Quantum Force components division. His fast-paced career path saw him then move between Lucid Logix, Cooler Master (3 years), and BitFenix (3 years).

Thankfully, Krohn found an anchor at Asus, and has been there for over a decade. Now, he enjoys his position as Director of Technical Marketing, which is a rather wide-ranging position, as you might expect.



Krohn's first remembered PC gaming experience was with a Compaq branded desktop upon which Prince of Persia was installed. The PC had a turbo button which doubled the digital clock speed readout, so we suspect it was an i486DX machine. However, the young Krohn preferred his Sega Master system for casual gaming.

Later, PCs would become more attractive, and this was in the Pentium III era. Specifically, Krohn recalls purchasing a Pentium III 700e from MediaMarkt, which came with an ATI Rage graphics card of some kind. It wasn't long before the young enthusiast overclocked this pre-built from 700 MHz to 1 GHz+, and upgraded to an Nvidia GPU, likely a TNT2 card.

The first PC-DIY system that Krohn built himself from scratch was based on an AMD Athlon XP 1700+ processor, installed on an Epox motherboard. This system's CPU could be overclocked from 1.5 to 2.3 GHz without huge effort or esoteric cooling. An Nvidia GeForce 4MX was also added for extra gaming horsepower.

It is always interesting to hear what a person in such a position at a major tech company identifies as future trends. Krohn wasn't cagey about his predictions, and reckons that the coming year will see iGPUs get even more powerful – and these are increasingly popular in hot segment devices like the ROG Flow Z13 and ROG Ally.

The Trump administration must soon make a decision that will affect millions of Americans' ability to access and afford mental health and addiction care.

The administration is facing a May 12 deadline to declare if it will defend Biden-era regulations that aim to enforce mental health parity — the idea that insurers must cover mental illness and addiction treatment comparably to physical treatments for ailments such as cancer or high blood pressure.

Although a federal parity law has been on the books since 2008, the regulations in question were issued last September. They represent the latest development in a nearly two-decade push by advocates, regulators, and lawmakers to ensure insurance plans cover mental health care equitably to physical health care.

Within the dense 166-page final rule, two provisions have garnered particular attention: first, that insurers provide ""meaningful benefits"" — as defined by independent medical standards — for covered mental health conditions if they do so for physical conditions. For example, if insurers cover screening and insulin treatment for diabetes, then they can't cover screening alone for opioid addiction; they must also cover medications to treat opioid use disorder.

Second, insurers must go beyond the written words of their policies to measure how they work in practice. For example, are patients having to seek out-of-network care more often for mental than physical care? If so, and it relates to an insurer's policies, then those policies must be adjusted.

In January, a trade association representing about 100 large employers sued the federal government, claiming the regulations overstepped the administration's authority, would increase costs, and risked reducing the quality of care. The ERISA Industry Committee represents several Fortune 500 companies, such as PepsiCo and Comcast, which sponsor health insurance plans for their employees and would be directly affected by the new regulations.

ERIC's lawsuit, filed days before President Donald Trump's inauguration, puts the onus on the new administration to decide whether to defend the regulations. If it chooses not to, the rules could be scrapped.

Mental health clinicians, patients, and advocates are urging the administration to fight back.

""What we're trying to do is make the spirit of parity a practical reality,"" said Patrick Kennedy, a Democratic former U.S. representative who sponsored the 2008 parity law in the House and co-founded the Kennedy Forum, which advocates on mental health issues. This is ""an existential issue for the country, public health, for every aspect of our society.""

A 2023 national survey found that more than 6 million adults with mental illness who wanted treatment in the past year were unable to receive it. Cost was one of the most common barriers.

This lack of treatment harms people's physical health too, with research suggesting that undertreating depression can complicate chronic conditions, such as diabetes.

Kennedy hopes that connection will prompt support from the Trump administration, which has made chronic disease a central focus of its ""Make America Healthy Again"" agenda.

""You're never going to get MAHA if you don't integrate mental health,"" Kennedy said, mentioning the broad health movement embraced by his cousin HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

But James Gelfand, president and CEO of ERIC, said the regulations are a misguided attempt to solve the nation's mental health care crisis.

People's difficulty accessing therapy or medication has less to do with insurance policy and more to do with a severe shortage of mental health care providers, he said, adding, ""No amount of penalties on employers"" or new parity regulations ""is going to change that dynamic until we get more of these providers.""

This point is at the heart of debate about parity issues. Is mental health care difficult to access because there are few providers, or are providers not accepting insurance because of low reimbursement rates? A recent study by the research institute RTI International suggests it has more to do with payment.

The departments of Justice, Labor, and Health and Human Services declined to comment for this article. The Treasury Department, which is also involved in the lawsuit, did not respond to requests for comment.

Psychiatric nurse practitioner Gabrielle Abelard employs about 40 clinicians in her therapy practice, which serves about 2,500 clients across Massachusetts each year.

One of the programs she's most proud to offer is intensive in-home therapy for children with serious behavioral challenges, such as intergenerational trauma, aggressive outbursts, and self-harm. Two clinicians visit the child's home over months and work with the family, the child's doctors, and school staff.

""A big part of the work being done is helping to keep children in school, helping to keep them out of the hospital and even out of jail,"" Abelard said.

But insurance barriers sometimes hinder the services.

Abelard's staff has to obtain prior authorization from insurers before they can provide care. Then they have to reapply for authorization every two, three, or six months, depending on the insurer. When that reauthorization is delayed, Abelard faces a dilemma: continue seeing clients knowing insurers may not pay for those services or leave clients without care until the reauthorization comes through.

Continuing services has cost her tens of thousands of dollars, she said, and months of bureaucratic hurdles to obtain back payments from insurers.

""They bank on you just giving up,"" she said.

A goal of the landmark 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act was to decrease dilemmas such as Abelard's.

But the bipartisan law primarily emphasized easy-to-measure treatment limits, saying insurers could not impose higher deductibles or copays for mental health care than they did for physical health care. What received less attention was how insurers should handle other limitations, such as prior authorization or fail-first requirements for patients to try certain therapies before they would be eligible for others.

As a result, true parity remained elusive, said Deborah Steinberg, a senior health policy attorney at the nonprofit Legal Action Center.

In 2020, Congress tried to address this through a new law, signed by Trump in his first term. The law required insurance plans to systematically analyze differences in certain treatment limitations for mental and physical health care and submit those analyses upon request to states and the federal governments.

As the federal government reviewed some of those analyses, it discovered numerous parity violations. In a 2022 report, it detailed how some insurance plans covered nutritional counseling for diabetes, but not for anorexia or bulimia. Another plan required precertification for all outpatient mental health and addiction services but only for a select few outpatient medical and surgical services.

The regulations issued in September aimed to provide insurers more guidance on the 2020 law and close loopholes that allowed such disparities, Steinberg said.

One of the biggest changes in the new regulations was the focus on outcomes, such as how often patients go out of network for mental versus physical care.

Steinberg called the provision ""a really important change."" But Gelfand, president of the employer association suing to stop the regulations, said it ignores the complexity of mental health care.

Many factors outside employers' and insurers' control affect how often a patient goes out of network, he said, including the availability of providers in the area, regional variations in clinical practices, and the patient's personal preference.

Mental health clinicians know there's high demand for their services, so they have a lot of market power. That ""is creating the bad behavior from these providers,"" Gelfand said, such as refusing to accept insurance and not submitting out-of-network bills on clients' behalf.

""Supply is the biggest problem,"" Gelfand said.

However, the RTI International study challenged that premise, with the authors noting that primary care physicians are in shorter supply than behavioral health providers yet have much lower out-of-network use.

The authors point to insurance reimbursements as the culprit instead. The study found that insurance reimbursements for behavioral health visits are, on average, 22% lower than for medical or surgical office visits. The low pay creates a disincentive for psychologists and psychiatrists to join insurance networks.

But the fix may not be as easy as raising reimbursement rates. Companies are already paying increasingly high premiums for employees' health insurance and many are concerned about sustaining these benefits.

ERIC has championed other strategies, such as reforming medical education and residency programs to produce more mental health care providers, increasing telehealth services, and training primary care doctors to address basic mental health concerns. The organization often lobbies state and federal lawmakers, writes letters to regulatory agencies, and testifies before Congress on these issues.

Narrowly focusing on insurance regulations could have unintended consequences, Gelfand said. Increased costs for health plans may get passed on to consumers. Or, in an attempt to keep costs down, insurers may narrow the size of their physical health care networks to match the mental health ones. In a worst-case scenario, employers could stop providing mental health benefits altogether.

Advocates say that's unlikely, since many employees have come to expect this type of coverage, and employers recognize that providing mental health benefits can increase worker productivity and retention.

Patrick Kennedy also pointed to the bigger picture around these issues: If people do not have insurance coverage for mental health care, they're more likely to end up in crisis at the hospital or in the criminal justice system, he said. Their children may be sent to foster care. Taxpayers finance those systems.

""We all end up picking up the tab for not enforcing parity,"" he said.

But what calculation the Trump administration makes — and whether it defends or drops the new regulations — remains to be seen.

Parents' genes - even when not directly inherited by a child - may play a role in their educational and mental health outcomes, finds a new report by UCL researchers.

The report, Understanding the intergenerational transmission of educational (under)achievement, which was funded by the Nuffield Foundation, evaluated how parental genetics can influence child development through the environment provided by their parents (for example, reading habits or access to better resources), also known as ""genetic nurture"" or ""indirect genetic effects"".

The researchers reviewed 12 published studies, involving 38,654 families from the UK, Australia, the Netherlands, Iceland and the United States, alongside performing an original analysis using genetic data from 4,580 families in the UK.

They then used a statistical tool called polygenic scoring to summarise the cumulative effect of hundreds of thousands of genetic variants across the genome (a person's complete set of genetic instructions) that are associated with particular traits, such as educational attainment.

They found that parental polygenic scores for education had a strong effect on children's educational outcomes, such as years of education completed or school grades, even after accounting for genetic transmission.

This is because parents with a higher genetic predisposition toward education may be more likely to read to their children or invest in learning resources. These behaviours can positively affect the child, regardless of whether they inherited the relevant genes.

The researchers also found a tentative link between non-inherited genes and mental health traits, including hyperactivity and inattention, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, and peer problems, or prosocial behaviour (e.g. helping others, sharing, showing empathy, and comforting someone in distress).

The strongest effects were found around the age of three and involved parental genetic predispositions for traits such as motivation, perseverance, emotional regulation, and self-control (e.g. non-cognitive skills).

This finding suggests that parents with better non-cognitive skills may be especially able to support their children early in life.

For both educational and mental health related outcomes, indirect genetic influences were stronger in early childhood.

Co-investigator Dr José J. Morosoli (UCL Psychology & Language Sciences) said: ""Through this project, we show how genetics and environment are deeply intertwined, challenging the idea that inherited genetics alone determine outcomes.

""We found that both direct inheritance of genes and the environment shaped by parents' genetics influence children's education and mental health. Ignoring these indirect genetic effects can lead to misleading conclusions.

""Additionally, the impact of genetics and environment changes as children grow, suggesting that early interventions focusing on parents might prove fruitful, while later efforts could benefit from targeting the children themselves.""

When the team accounted for family socioeconomic status and parental education, indirect genetic effects dropped by approximately 75%.

This suggests that the effect of non-inherited genes was largely explained by family socioeconomic position and parental education.

For example, parents with higher socioeconomic status and education levels may have access to the necessary resources to provide their children with opportunities linked to better outcomes - regardless of genetic factors.

As a result, the researchers are calling for future studies to explore the specific resource-based disparities that drive educational underachievement.

Our findings echo evidence that family resources and opportunities partly shape children's developmental outcomes - further illustrating the importance of providing consistent and developmentally appropriate support to children and their families.

This research supports the UK Government's calls for life-course approaches to mental health and development, highlighting the importance of early intervention and sustained support throughout childhood.""

Professor Jean-Baptiste Pingault, Principal Investigator, UCL Psychology & Language Sciences

It is critical to stress that the genetic effects found in the report are small and not deterministic. They cannot be used to make individual predictions or guide education policy. The value of this work lies in improving our understanding of human development and informing better research into the causes of traits and behaviours, especially research aiming to understand the interplay between social and biological factors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","A California lawmaker leans into her medical training in fight for health safety net","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250509/A-California-lawmaker-leans-into-her-medical-training-in-fight-for-health-safety-net.aspx","Sat, 10 May 2025 02:07:00 GMT","

State Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson anticipates that California's sprawling Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, may need to be dialed back after Gov. Gavin Newsom releases his latest budget, which could reflect a multibillion-dollar deficit.

Even so, the physician-turned-lawmaker, who was elected to the state Senate in November, says her priorities as chair of a budget health subcommittee include preserving coverage for the state's most vulnerable, particularly children and people with chronic health conditions.

""We will be spending many, many hours and long nights figuring this out,"" Weber Pierson said of the lead-up to the state's June 15 deadline for lawmakers to pass a balanced budget.

With Medicaid cuts on the table in Washington and Medi-Cal running billions of dollars over budget due to rising drug prices and higher-than-anticipated costs to cover immigrants without legal status, Weber Pierson's dual responsibilities — maintaining a balanced budget and delivering compassionate care to the state's poorest residents — could make her instrumental in leading Democrats through this period of uncertainty.

President Donald Trump has said GOP efforts to cut federal spending will not touch Medicaid beyond ""waste, fraud, and abuse."" Congressional Republicans are considering going after states such as California that extend coverage to immigrants without legal status and imposing restrictions on provider taxes. California voters in November made permanent the state's tax on managed-care health plans to continue funding Medi-Cal.

The federal budget megabill is winding its way through Congress, where Republicans have set a target of $880 billion in spending cuts over 10 years from the House committee that oversees the Medicaid program.

Health care policy researchers say that would inevitably force the program to restrict eligibility, narrow the scope of benefits, or both. Medi-Cal covers 1 in 3 Californians, and more than half of its nearly $175 billion budget comes from the federal government.

One of a handful of practicing physicians in the state legislature, Weber Pierson is leaning heavily on her experience as a pediatric and adolescent gynecologist who treats children with reproductive birth defects — one of only two in Southern California.

Weber Pierson spoke to KFF Health News correspondent Christine Mai-Duc in Sacramento this spring. She has introduced bills to improve timely access to care for pregnant Medi-Cal patients, require developers to mitigate bias in artificial intelligence algorithms used in health care, and compel health plans to cover screenings for housing, food insecurity, and other social determinants of health.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Q: You're a state senator, you practice medicine in your district, and you're also a mom. What does that look like day to day?

A: When you grow up around someone who juggles a lot, that just kind of becomes the norm. I saw this with my mom [former state Assembly member Shirley Weber, who is now secretary of state].

I'm really happy that I'm able to continue with my clinical duties. Those in the health care profession understand how much time, energy, effort, and money we put into becoming a health care provider, and I'm still fairly early in my career. With my particular specialty, it would also be a huge void in the San Diego region for me to step back.

Q: What are the biggest threats or challenges in health care right now?

A: The immediate threats are the financial issues and our budget. A lot of people do not understand the overwhelming amount of dollars that go into our health care system from the federal government.

Another issue is access. Almost everybody in California is covered by insurance. The problem is that we have not expanded access to providers. If you have insurance but your nearest labor and delivery unit is still two hours away, what exactly have we really done for those patients?

The third thing is the social determinants of health. The fact that your life expectancy is based on the ZIP code in which you were born is absolutely criminal. Why are certain areas devoid of having supermarkets where you can go and get fresh fruits and vegetables? And then we wonder why certain people have high blood pressure and diabetes and obesity.

Q: On the federal level, there's a lot of conversation happening around Medicaid cuts, reining in the MCO tax, and potentially dropping Affordable Care Act premium subsidies. Which is the biggest threat to California?

A: To be quite honest with you, all of those. The MCO tax was a recognition that we needed more providers, and in order to get more providers, we need to increase the Medi-Cal reimbursement rates. The fact that now it is at risk is very, very concerning. That is how we are able to care for those who are our most vulnerable in our state.

Q: If those cuts do come, what do we cut? How do we cut it?

A: We are in a position where we have to talk about it at this point. Our Medi-Cal budget, outside of what the federal government may do, is exploding. We definitely have to ensure that those who are our most vulnerable — our kids, those with chronic conditions — continue to have some sort of coverage. What will that look like?

To be quite honest with you, at this point, I don't know.

Q: How can the state make it the least painful for Californians?

A: Sometimes the last one to the table is the first one to have to leave the table. And so I think that's probably an approach that we will look at. What were some of the more recent things that we've added, and we've added a lot of stuff lately. How can we trim down — maybe not completely eliminate, but trim down on — some of these services to try to make them more affordable?

Q: When you say the last at the table, are you talking about the expansion of Medi-Cal coverage to Californians without legal status? Certain age groups?

A: I don't want to get ahead of this conversation, because it is a very large conversation between not only me but also the [Senate president] pro tem, the Assembly speaker, and the governor's office. But those conversations are being had, keeping in mind that we want to provide the best care for as many people as possible.

Q: You're carrying a bill related to AI in health care this year. Tell me what you're trying to address.

A: It has just exploded at a speed that I don't know any of us were anticipating. We are trying to play catch-up, because we weren't really at the table when all of this stuff was being rolled out.

As we advance in technology, it's been great; we've extended lives. But we need to make sure that the biases that led to various discrepancies and health care outcomes are not the same biases that are inputted into that system.

Q: How does Sacramento policy impact your patients and what experience as a physician do you bring to policymaking?

A: I speak with my colleagues with actual knowledge of what's happening with our patients, what's happening in the clinics. My patients and my fellow providers will often come to me and say, ""You guys are getting ready to do this, and this is why it's going to be a problem."" And I'm like, ""OK, that's really good to know.""

I work at a children's facility, and right after the election, specialty hospitals were very concerned around funding and their ability to continue to practice.

In the MCO discussion, I was hearing from providers, hospitals on the ground on a regular basis. With the executive order [on gender-affirming care for transgender youth], I have seen people that I work with concerned, because these are patients that they take care of. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to be in both worlds.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Oxford study reveals how COVID-19 vaccines prevent severe illness","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250509/Oxford-study-reveals-how-COVID-19-vaccines-prevent-severe-illness.aspx","Sat, 10 May 2025 02:23:00 GMT","

A landmark study by scientists at the University of Oxford, has unveiled crucial insights into the way that COVID-19 vaccines mitigate severe illness in those who have been vaccinated.

Despite the global success of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, concerns remain around the continued spread of this disease including in vaccinated individuals. For this reason, researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group conducted an extensive investigation into the human immune response to COVID-19, in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals.

Employing contemporary ""big-data"" analyses, scientists can find novel associations between fundamental biological entities and indicators of the severity of a disease — to build patterns of health and disease. Results of this study categorically show a reduction in indicators of disease severity in those who had received the vaccine, demonstrating that the harmful inflammatory reaction to COVID-19 is less severe in those who have been vaccinated, when compared with those who haven't.

Professor Daniel O'Connor, Head of Bioinformatics at the Oxford Vaccine Group (OVG), led the study. He said: ""These results confirm the efficacy of vaccination and its pivotal role in reducing the harmful consequences associated with COVID-19. The results of our research highlight the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine's ability to modulate harmful responses to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and therefore to reduce the severity of illness. The implications of these findings are far-reaching, offering evidence that is fundamental to future vaccine development and pandemic mitigation strategies. It also provides valuable guidance for policymakers and public health experts.""

Better understanding of how vaccines can reduce the severity of infections caused by viruses like COVID-19 is a key part of our preparedness to make effective vaccines against the next pandemic threat. Ongoing research is critical as we know the next one is coming but we don't know which virus or when it will be.""

Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, Ashall Professor of Infection and Immunity and Director of the Oxford Vaccine Group

The study employed state-of-the-art technologies, including RNA-sequencing (to capture the level of genes produced by blood cells), to achieve these results. While the findings are promising, the study acknowledges limitations such as a focus on mild cases and sample size constraints, highlighting the need for further research utilising advanced techniques to enhance resolution.

Key findings from the study include:

Funding for the study was provided by various organisations, including the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Notably, the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 randomised controlled trials received support from UK Research and Innovation, NIHR, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, among others.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New QR4 model identifies hidden risk factors in cardiovascular disease","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250509/New-QR4-model-identifies-hidden-risk-factors-in-cardiovascular-disease.aspx","Sat, 10 May 2025 02:40:00 GMT","

Collaborative research, led from the University of Oxford and published today in Nature Medicine, has developed a new tool called QR4 that more accurately predicts an individual's 10-year risk of cardiovascular diseases, like heart disease and stroke, particularly identifying high-risk patients that current prediction tools miss.

Key findings at a glance:

QR4 can be thought of as a type of calculator that lets doctors use an individual's health data, such as blood pressure, age and medical history, to estimate their likelihood of developing a cardiovascular disease over the next 10 years, allowing them to intervene early to prevent illness.

We believe that these findings are important to both patients and policy makers. They indicate that more groups of people are at increased risk for heart and circulatory diseases than previously recognised. These people could and should now benefit from treatments and other preventive measures to reduce their risk.""

Dr. Julia Hippisley-Cox, lead author, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology and General Practice, University of Oxford's Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences

The researchers identified several unique risk factors common to all genders that were not part of current cardiovascular risk calculators, as well as new factors specific to women's health such as pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy complication characterised by high blood pressure, and postnatal depression, that were predictive of future heart disease risk.

""While traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking and high cholesterol are well-recognised, our latest research identifies less obvious, yet crucial risk indicators,"" said Professor Hippisley-Cox. ""For instance, conditions like postnatal depression and Down's syndrome significantly contribute to cardiovascular risk, underscoring the complex interplay between mental health, genetic factors, and heart health. QR4 also helps to address inequalities in health, particularly around learning disabilities, which often coincide with barriers to effective health management and access, leading to an increased risk.""

""Our findings also reveal that women with COPD are at a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases than previously understood,"" said Professor Mona Bafadhel, co-author, Chair of Respiratory Medicine, King's College, London and Asthma + Lung UK Professor. ""This underscores the critical need for targeted cardiovascular monitoring and interventions in these patients, which begins with an early diagnosis.""

By integrating these new predictors into the QR4 model, the researchers have developed a more nuanced and comprehensive tool for predicting cardiovascular disease, ensuring preventative strategies are more personalised, inclusive, and cater to the needs of a broader and more diverse population.

""Cardiovascular risk has been under-recognised in some populations, which through QR4 we can now better address,"" said Professor Keith Channon, BHF Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Oxford. ""The new findings will help identify more diverse groups of people who have high cardiovascular risk, enabling them to access interventions and treatments to reduce their risk.""

As part of a comprehensive evaluation, the QR4 algorithm was rigorously tested against some of the most well-established cardiovascular risk assessment tools currently used in both the United States and Europe, improving on their predictive accuracy.

""The QR4 model potentially sets a new standard in cardiovascular risk assessment,"" said Dr Carol Coupland, senior researcher at the University of Oxford and Professor of Medical Statistics in Primary Care at the University of Nottingham and co-author of the study. ""Our head-to-head comparisons with established models show that QR4 provides a more detailed risk profile for each individual, allowing for earlier and more precise intervention strategies. This is crucial in a field where early detection can save lives and could significantly impact how we approach prevention on a global scale.""

This new algorithm builds on almost two decades of work and global leadership in the field of risk algorithms, and cardiovascular risk algorithms in particular. QR4's predecessor, QRISK is widely used in the NHS to assess over 5 million patients a year, often as part of NHS Health Checks.

The researchers hope that clinicians, advisory bodies, regulators, and health and care policymakers consider the implications of QR4's advanced predictive capabilities on national health guidelines and support its adoption in clinical settings to improve cardiovascular health outcomes.

Announcing a new publication for Acta Materia Medica journal. Aging impairs adipose tissue function and contributes to metabolic disorders, such as obesity and insulin resistance. Chronic inflammation is mediated by cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α, is a pivotal factor in aging that links mitochondrial dysfunction to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in aged adipose tissue. Moreover, distinct adipose tissue and adipose tissue depots exhibit complex molecular and cellular functions related to the deterioration of conventional metabolic regulation pathways.

Unraveling these mechanisms is crucial for developing therapeutic strategies to enhance metabolic health and promote longevity. This review elucidates the current understanding of lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, cellular senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, strategies to improve mitochondrial quality control in aging adipose tissue, such as mitochondrial transplantation, hold promise for addressing mitochondrial dysfunction.

Finally, a novel therapeutic approach for mitochondrial transplantation is proposed using exosome cargo to sustain healthy metabolism and thermogenesis in aging populations. These findings lay the groundwork for innovative therapies and preventive strategies to mitigate the impact of obesity and aging.

Methods: This single-center retrospective study included 147 patients who were suspected of ILD and underwent KL-6 testing between October 2022 and March 2023. Epidemiological and clinical details of the patients, including the outcomes of pulmonary function tests and computed tomography findings, were retrospectively extracted from electronic medical records.

Results: The average age within the cohort was 77.1 years, with 97.3% (143 patients) being male. Notably, the ILA group displayed significantly reduced levels of KL-6 compared to the ILD group (411.6±298.8 vs. 968.8±901.9 U/mL, P<0.001). Utilizing a threshold of 410 U/mL for KL-6, the diagnostic performance yielded an area under the curve (95% CI) of 0.727 (0.605–0.849), demonstrating a sensitivity of 80.8% and a specificity of 64.7%.

Conclusions: Our findings indicate that serum KL-6 concentrations are markedly elevated in patients with clinically recognized and treated ILD compared to those identified with ILA. Furthermore, the association between higher KL-6 levels and reduced forced vital capacity percentage underlines the biomarker's potential in differentiating between ILD requiring intervention and less severe abnormalities.

Key findings

• Serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) levels are significantly elevated in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) compared to those with interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA), indicating its potential as a diagnostic biomarker.

What is known and what is new?

• KL-6 is predominantly expressed by type II alveolar cells and is linked to the prognosis and severity of ILD.

• The study provides evidence that serum KL-6 concentrations are markedly elevated in clinically recognized and treated ILD compared to ILA. It also highlights the relationship between KL-6 levels and pulmonary function, specifically forced vital capacity.

What is the implication, and what should change now?

• Clinicians could consider incorporating KL-6 assessments into the diagnostic process for patients with suspected ILD to improve early detection and management strategies. Further research may be warranted to establish standardized protocols for KL-6 testing in clinical settings.

Researchers at the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine have uncovered a key primary step in the hepatic ERK pathway that leads to increased insulin production. While their previous work focused on aspects of the signaling pathway from the liver to the pancreas, this current study shows an even earlier step that begins in the colon when it is inflamed - triggered by obesity. The present study revealed a novel role the gastrointestinal tract plays in regulating glucose homeostasis.

Insulin is a hormone produced by β-cells in the pancreas. You can think of insulin like a key that unlocks cells to let glucose enter from the blood, so it can be used as energy. However, individuals with obesity can become insulin resistant, which causes the pancreas to secrete more insulin to try to keep up. This occurs through an inter-organ neuronal signal relay originating in the hepatic ERK pathway. Due to the close relationship between obesity and the onset of diabetes, understanding this pathway in depth could help develop new ways to treat or prevent this condition.

The goal of this study was to define how obesity in particular triggers this cascade. We theorized that it had to do with inflammation in the colon, since pro-inflammatory factors can play an excitatory role in the hepatic ERK pathway.""

Junta Imai, Tohoku University

The researchers developed a thorough series of experiments to determine if colonic inflammation due to obesity could impact the hepatic ERK pathway. First, the research group analyzed mice without obesity that had been given a drug to cause inflammation in the colon. As a result, they found that simply causing inflammation in the colon activates the ERK pathway in the liver, stimulates the neuronal relay pathway, and increases the number of β-cells even in the mice without obesity. Next, by analyzing colons of mice in which obesity was induced by a high-calorie diet, it was found that colonic inflammation, along with both hepatic ERK pathway activation and increased β-cells, had occurred in these obese mice.

""An exciting finding was when we tried to treat the obese mice with colon inflammation by lowering their inflammation, it actually stopped the ERK pathway in the liver from activating,"" explains Imai. ""Despite the fact the mouse was still obese, targeting colon inflammation was exactly what was needed to alter the ERK pathway.""

This research unveils a missing link in the pathway, determining that the liver senses the state of obesity through colonic inflammation, and colonic inflammation serves as the first trigger of β-cell proliferation during obesity development. These achievements will lead to advancements in understanding the mechanism behind β-cells proliferation in order to maintain normal blood glucose levels. In addition, it is anticipated that this research may help progress the development of treatments and prevention methods for diabetes.

These findings were published in JCI Insight on May 8, 2025.

This research was supported by the Japan Society of the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (23K24383, 22K19303, 20H05694); the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Moonshot R&D (JPMJMS2023); and the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED), AMED-PRIME (21gm6210002h0004).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study shows strong COVID immunity from infection and vaccination","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250509/Study-shows-strong-COVID-immunity-from-infection-and-vaccination.aspx","Sat, 10 May 2025 02:48:00 GMT","

A first-of-its-kind study led by the University of Oxford has successfully investigated human immunity against COVID-19 in people who already have antibodies against it.

The results suggest that previous infection, together with vaccination, offers strong protection against the original COVID-19 strain.

People who do not have antibodies against a particular infectious agent are 'seronegative' and those who have antibodies are called 'seropositive'. Over 99% of the UK population and 59% of the world's population is seropositive, which means they already have antibodies against COVID-19. This means finding seronegative volunteers for an infection model is increasingly very difficult as most people have been either infected, vaccinated, or both.

For vaccine development, researchers create Controlled Human Infection Models (CHIMs), where they deliberately infect healthy volunteers under very carefully controlled clinical conditions. These CHIMs can then be used to rapidly test or compare new vaccines or treatments in a controlled environment. For this study, researchers wanted to use a COVID-19 CHIM to measure what kind of immune responses stop people who have been previously infected and/or vaccinated from being infected again.

The data from this COVCHIM01 study showed durable immunity post-infection/vaccination against the original COVID-19 virus. The study compared the immune responses of volunteers who were infected in this study with those who were uninfected and found that antibodies in the lining of the nose, the route the virus enters the body, may be important in preventing mild infections.

A number of participants who were able to avoid developing infection with the original strain of virus used in the study subsequently developed infections in the community with the Omicron variant. The researchers are investigating this further by pursuing the use of newer variants to create a CHIM with a sufficient rate of infection to enable the assessment of new vaccines or COVID-19 treatments.

Such studies are important to find the most efficient and effective way to test new treatments and vaccines so that they can be utilised as soon as possible.

This is a really important proof of concept study demonstrating that controlled human infection studies can be safely carried out during a pandemic and importantly provide valuable information that is difficult to obtain in traditional field studies. We hope this provides confidence in the use of human infection studies as a tool both for the development of improved COVID vaccines and therapeutics and for potential future pandemics.'

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — The U.S. men's national team failed its first competitive test of the Mauricio Pochettino era in rather embarrassing fashion, losing to Panama 1-0 in a CONCACAF Nations League semifinal here at a half-empty SoFi Stadium.

The Americans played timidly, unimaginatively and laboriously for 90 scoreless minutes. They were booed off the field at halftime. They looked uninspired, even with a home-soil World Cup on the horizon. They seemed destined for extra time against a team they were heavily favored to beat — and one that, based solely on talent, they should have beaten.

But they couldn't. And then, in the 94th minute, the seemingly unthinkable happened.

Cecilio Waterman beat U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner.

[You could win $25K in the Women's Bracket Mayhem contest. Enter now!]

Panama prevailed, and jumped for joy at midfield as Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and the rest of the USMNT's golden generation trudged out of sight, into Sunday's third-place match. Panama will face Mexico, which beat Canada 2-0 in Thursday's late game, in the final on Sunday.

They played just as they had toward the tail end of the Gregg Berhalter era. Berhalter was fired following the Copa América, largely because the U.S. lost to Panama 2-1 after playing most of a group-stage match with 10 men.

Pochettino replaced Berhalter last fall. His mandate was to revive a plateauing program. His early results were largely positive.

But in his first true elimination game, with 11 men, the U.S. suffered a familiar fate.

And in a sense, they regressed. The Americans had won all three prior editions of the Nations League. Under Berhalter, in semifinals and finals, they'd beaten Mexico three times, and Canada, Jamaica and Honduras once apiece.

But Panama posed different problems. Under head coach Thomas Christiansen, Los Canaleros are now 4-1 against the U.S. in competitive games. They frustrated the USMNT yet again on Thursday, and earned a famous result.

And they gave Pochettino, and players, and fans a lot to chew on at the start of this last full calendar year before a landmark World Cup.

""The way we approached the game and started the game wasn't in the right way,"" Pochettino said.

""We played too slow,"" he added. ""We didn't show aggression with the ball"" — nor without it. ""The first half was really painful to see,"" Pochettino said.

They played with none of “the grit, the desire, the nastiness” that McKennie said Pochettino has been trying to instill, and as a result, they have relinquished their grip on regional supremacy; they flunked one of only two competitions that they'll have between now and June 2026; and they got this critical phase of World Cup preparations off to a downright dreadful start.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Barcelona, for the first time this season, are at an absolute low and recovering from the heartbreak in Milan is easier said than done.

From being two minutes away from the UCL final to crashing out in heartbreaking fashion, the Catalans are broken on the inside. 

However, they must face Real Madrid tomorrow at Montjuic in a Clasico that may well decide the title race.

A win for Barcelona over their arch-rivals will all but win them the title, but a defeat will bring Carlo Ancelotti's men to within one point with three games to go. 

Speaking to the media ahead of what seems set to be his final Clasico as the manager of Real Madrid, Carlo Ancelotti was asked to give his two cents on the game that lay ahead and what one can expect from the same.

His response, in many ways, was overly proud for a manager who has lost thrice in three games to Barcelona this season.

“I have the same feelings as always. It's always special, we want to beat Barcelona,” said Ancelotti.

“It's special, the last Clasico of the season because Barça are not going to the Club World Cup,” he added, possibly subtly mocking the Catalans.

He was then asked about Barcelona's elimination from the UEFA Champions League at the hands of Inter Milan which crushed hearts worldwide, especially after how the Blaugrana were the better team throughout.

“I'm not relieved by the elimination of Barça. It was a great game, very competitive. Inter will reach the final, we have to congratulate him, but Barça was very close,” he began.

He then added that Barcelona equally deserved to be the final, stating,

“If they had qualified, no one would have been able to say anything. The final will be very even.”

Juventus director Cristiano Giuntoli dropped the biggest hint yet that Dusan Vlahovic could leave this summer, but confirms Igor Tudor will at least stay during the Club World Cup. ‘We'll evaluate it together.'

The showdown with Lazio kicks off at the Stadio Olimpico at 17.00 UK time (16.00 GMT, 18.00 CET).

You can follow all the build-up and action as it happens from today's three Serie A games on the Liveblog.

It is an incredibly tight battle for that precious fourth place, as Juventus go into this weekend level in fourth place on 63 points with Lazio and Roma, while Bologna, Fiorentina and Milan are right behind this trio.

Would failure to qualify for the Champions League radically change Juve's plans for next season?

“We started the season with some economic and technical objectives, we are convinced that we're on the right track and that we will be competitive next season regardless,” Giuntoli told DAZN.

“Clearly, the Champions League would help a great deal, both financially and in terms of prestige.”

Vlahovic is on the bench today after shaking off an injury, but the director of sport was asked if there is any news on the Serbian striker's future and Giuntoli dropped the biggest hint yet that they could be parting ways.

“We have a very good rapport with the player and his agent. We will sit down at the end of the season to discuss and evaluate whether to continue together or to take separate paths.”

If Vlahovic is to be sold, then the Premier League is likely to be his next destination, with Arsenal, Manchester United and Chelsea among the clubs interested.

Juventus are also still trying to decide the future of their coach, having sacked Thiago Motta to bring in Tudor on a short-term contract with option to extend.

“These are young and fertile players who showed they can adapt to different coaches, so we hope to continue along this path and achieve our objective of Champions League qualification,” noted Giuntoli.

“Tudor had a strong impact, we want to continue with him, but we can decide throughout the Club World Cup along with him whether or not to continue together.”

So it is confirmed that Tudor will be the Juventus coach at the Club World Cup?

“Yes.”

HAH

The FIFA Club World Cup is set to start in a little over a month, and one of Chelsea's opponents in the group stage will be Brazilian giants Flamengo.

Currently managed by former Chelsea left back Filipe Luís, who finished his playing career there and then guided the team to a third place finish last season, they have recently been linked with a couple high profile signings ahead of the tournament.  As we learned earlier, FIFA's rules will allow not only for an earlier transfer window ahead of the Club World Cup, but could in essence also allow teams to loan in players for just the duration of the monthlong cash-grab in the States.

And one of those players for Flamengo just might be João Félix, currently on loan at AC Milan. But the sudden spurt of speculation from earlier this week has been talked down significantly by more recent reports out of Brazil, with Globo claiming that Félix's salary, and supposed interest from other European clubs, will prevent any actual talks from taking place.  So, as amusing as it would be to play against Félix on June 20 in Philadelphia, this probably won't be happening.

However, there might be a familiar face among their number after all — though not David Luiz, who left the club in January — with Flamengo pushing hard to sign Jorginho from Arsenal.  This one seems a lot more likely to happen, provided the timings with our Champions League-winner's contract (technically it ends only at the end of June) and personal commitments (i.e. wedding plans) work out in their favor.

Flamengo are interested in signing Joao Felix in time for the Club World Cup in a potential move that could see him come up against #CFC in the tournament.Talks with player side are exploratory. Chelsea would consider sanctioning a loan on the right terms. Also open to… pic.twitter.com/w7ZH7nCdbG

A lot of money will be up for grabs when MLS side LAFC and Mexico's Club América battle for the final spot in the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. 

After FIFA disqualified Liga MX side Club Léon from the tournament, it set up a one-match playoff to be hosted in May at LAFC's BMO Stadium. The winner will claim the vacant berth in the 32-team summer tournament. 

Club Léon's hopes of remaining in the Club World Cup were dashed when the Court of Arbitration for Sport rejected their appeal and turned aside Costa Rica's LD Alajuelense, upholding FIFA's previous decision. 

The LAFC vs. Club América match is effectively a $10 million match. The winning club will be awarded an entry fee of $9.55 million and will have the opportunity to claim more in the tournament. Each group stage win is worth an additional $2 million in prize money. 

A club can also claim more if they advance several rounds in the tournament. The playoff winner will slot into Group D, where Léon was initially drawn, and take on England's Chelsea, Brazil's Flamengo and Tunisia's ES Tunis. 

Club Léon's disqualification resulted due to its ownership by Grupo Pachuca, the same ownership group that owns and operates CF Pachuca, another Liga MX team that has qualified for the tournament. 

To fill the empty slot, FIFA chose LAFC, the club that fell to Léon in the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup Final, and Club América, the highest-ranking side in the Concacaf Club Rankings through the four-year qualification period. 

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, the first to include 32 teams, will kick off in Miami at Hard Rock Stadium on June 14, before finishing with a final at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on July 13.

German legend Lothar Matthaus has shared a blunt verdict on Inter Miami's chances in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup. Matthaus feels the Lionel Messi-led side will enjoy a good start to the tournament, but might struggle to go the distance. A total of 32 clubs from different parts of the globe will compete in the Club World Cup, slated to be hosted in the United States in June-July. Inter Miami has been pooled in Group A, alongside FC Porto, Al Ahly, and Palmeiras. Given the strength of their fellow teams, the Herons, with Messi in front, will require some exceptional performances to reach the playoffs.

“Inter Miami will make a run, but I don't think they can go to the final because the European teams and some teams from South America are stronger and better than the teams from Major League Soccer,"" Matthaus said, as per the Miami Herald. He, however, remains hopeful about Messi making an impression at the Club World Cup.

“It's not too much pressure because Messi has had pressure all his life: World Cup finals, Copa America, national team games, club games, Champions League finals, El Clásico in Spain between Real Madrid and Barcelona. He knows what pressure means,"" Matthaus added.

The former Bayern Munich star further referred to the competitiveness of the global event featuring European giants like Real Madrid, Manchester City, Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain, and Inter Milan.

“This is a tournament where you can win a very important title: best club in the world. And a lot of money. I think every team is motivated. They'll be playing with their best first XI, they will give their best to win the title,"" he explained.

During the conversation, Matthaus also opened up about the craze for Messi in every part of the world. “He is an idol for most kids. Not only in America. In Germany, too. I have a son. He's 11 years old, and I sometimes follow his football games. And when they have training sessions, you see a lot of Messi shirts. The old shirt from Barcelona, the new shirt from Inter Miami,"" he revealed.

Inter Miami were recently knocked out of the CONCACAF Champions by Vancouver Whitecaps, who won the two-leg semi-finals on a 5-1 aggregate. They, however, are doing well in the MLS and holds the fourth spot in the league standings with 21 points in ten games.","{'href': 'https://www.news18.com', 'title': 'News18'}","soccer"

Nigeria Super Eagles and head coach Eric Chelle. Photo Credit X

Veteran Nigerian goalkeeper Daniel Akpeyi has voiced his frustration over the Super Eagles' underwhelming 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, drawing a sharp contrast with the progress of South Africa's Bafana Bafana, Soccernet.ng reports.

Akpeyi, 38, who has played in South Africa's Premier Soccer League since 2015 and currently turns out for Marumo Gallants, praised the structure and cohesion within South African football, attributing their strong showing in Group C to those qualities.

While South Africa sit top of the group with 13 points from six games — four wins, a draw, and one loss — Nigeria languish in fourth with just seven points from one win and four draws.

The Super Eagles are now six points off the summit, behind Benin and Rwanda, and level on points with Lesotho, while Zimbabwe prop up the table with four.

Speaking to FARPost, Akpeyi was candid in his assessment:

“The standing in the World Cup qualifiers group is a clear reflection that South African football is higher. You can have big players, but coming up with a team is something that many fail to do,” he said.

“But South Africa has managed to do that with ease under Hugo Broos. Of course, as a Nigerian, I am disappointed with how we have played the World Cup qualifiers.”

The Super Eagles shot-stopper believes that the South African model — built on unity, identity, and a strong domestic league — is what Nigeria must emulate.

“But we all should follow how it has been done by South Africa. The growth and progress have been due to several factors, including team effort,” he said.

“We [Nigeria] could be like Bafana Bafana if we have players who play for the country and not for themselves. That has been the major difference between us; in South Africa, there is no individuality.”

Akpeyi concluded with a pointed reflection on Nigeria's missing ingredients:

“I strongly believe that we [Nigeria] deserve to be in first position. Right now, we lack so many fundamentals that South Africa has. That also includes cohesion and identity.”

Nigeria failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and look set to miss out on the next edition of the global showpiece.


				Imhonlamhen Eronmhonsele turns into a ball of passion when writing about Nigerian football and its talents, whether rising stars or established legends, locally and abroad.

From the deepest corners of the Middle East, to the green fields of the Americas, to the celebrated grounds in Europe, and the rich soils of Africa, Imhons is more than glad, usually with a glass of a tasty drink nearby, to capture the essence of the game, by connecting the dots between culture, identity, and football.

A FIFA Club World Cup spot is on the line for MLS side LAFC and Liga MX's Club América this spring. 

FIFA shared initial plans earlier in the year, but the one-game playoff became official this week after the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld Mexico's Club Léon's disqualification.

LAFC and Club América will clash on May 31 at LAFC's BMO Stadium, sources confirmed to Sports Illustrated. The winner will take the final spot in the tournament and slide into Club Léon's spot in Group D. 

Club Léon, where former Real Madrid star James Rodriguez plays, is owned by Grupo Pachuca. The same ownership group oversees CF Pachuca, another club that has already qualified for the Club World Cup. 

Due to multi-club ownership rules, FIFA would not allow both teams in the tournament. The court case lasted over five months in Lausanne, Switzerland, before the court announced its decision to uphold FIFA's initial punishment. 

To find a replacement team for the expanded 32-team tournament, FIFA chose the 2023 Concacaf Champions Cup runner-up, LAFC, who lost to Léon in the final, and the top seed in the four-year Concacaf Club Ranking, Club America. 

Should LAFC win, they would become the third MLS club in the tournament, alongside the 2022 Concacaf Champions League winner Seattle Sounders FC, and the host berth awarded to Lionel Messi's Inter Miami CF. 

While the two other American teams would play in their home markets, the winner of the LAFC-América playoff would travel around the United States, taking on Chelsea in Atlanta, Esperance of Tunisia in Nashville and Flamengo of Brazil in Orlando. 

Should América win, they would join CF Pachuca and CF Monterrey in the competition. 

The first FIFA Club World Cup with 32 teams runs from June 14 to July 13, with the final hosted at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, the same venue for the FIFA World Cup 2026 final.

The Cameroon international is being strongly linked with a summer move to Old Trafford after another hugely impressive season for the Bees

""For me, in that moment and you look at Premier League, we are the worst team since I arrived in terms of results. That is my idea. In the end of the season, we can be the worst team in Premier League history with a European title,"" Ruben Amorim admitted on the eve of Manchester United's Europa League semi-final second leg clash against Athletic Club. ""So we will not change anything. I still feel that this season was the worst in the last 50 years.""

Amorim's brutal honesty is equally as refreshing as it is shocking - a symptom of the misery he has endured in his first seven months in the Old Trafford dugout. There was no customary new-manager bounce after the Portuguese replaced Erik ten Hag in November; in fact, most fans would probably claim United have only declined further on his watch, an argument backed up by their unforgivable position of 15th in the Premier League table.

But none of the blame should be laid at Amorim's door. The former Sporting CP boss is not a miracle worker, which was the requirement for instant change after he inherited perhaps the poorest squad in United's storied history. Consequently, results have not been Amorim's first concern, but rather drilling his 3-4-3 system into the minds of every single person in the dressing room to create the foundations for a resurgence next season.

Naturally, several players won't be part of that process. Amorim has had enough time to assess who is fit for his long-term project and who isn't, with the ones that fall into the latter category set to be shipped out and replaced in the summer transfer window. Recruitment, then, will be vital if the Red Devils are to recover from this disastrous campaign quickly, and at least one transformational signing is needed.

The Blaugrana and Los Blancos boast some of the game's greatest players - but also some of its most entitled moaners

As it stands, Sunday's Clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid will go ahead as planned. But who knows what might happen between now and the scheduled kick-off at 16:15 local time?

Madrid could take issue with the identity of the match referee. After all, Alejandro Hernandez Hernandez has taken charge of 35 of their Liga games in the past and they've lost nine of them - the kind of scary statistic that suggests either incompetence or corruption (at least in the mind of Madridistas). After all, when Madrid lose, it's never their fault. The referee is always to blame, which is why they're presently leading a campaign to overhaul the entire system of officiating in Spain.

It's a thankless task - quite literally. Indeed, Madrid are copping quite a lot of flak for raging against a machine that many of their rivals would argue has benefited Los Blancos more than any other club in Spain.

As the Liga leaders, Barcelona have been particularly incensed by their great rivals' constant complaints, which are seen as a rather obvious attempt to discredit the Catalans' seemingly imminent championship success. Barca would also argue that they don't just have to deal with biased refereeing in Spain, as they feel that they're being shafted in Europe, too - as supposedly underlined by Tuesday's Champions League loss at San Siro.

There is still hope that Sunday's post-match discourse will be dominated by debates over the greatness of Lamine Yamal, Raphinha, Pedri, Vinicius Jr, Kylian Mbappe or Jude Bellingham, but while the game at Montjuic really could be one for the purists, it feels far more likely that it will prove yet another Clasico for the conspiracy theorists...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The WTA Italian Open men's action has been outstanding, and the side action hasn't been too shabby either. Rain prevented play on May 8th, but the skies relented, and the tournament is back on schedule. Here are some of my best bets for the opening rounds. If you agree or disagree with anything I have here, be sure to let me know why in the comments. I always appreciate the feedback, and I take criticism to heart to ensure I'm always providing the best content possible.

H2H: 1-1

Ben Shelton and Jaume Munar will meet for the third time in their careers, and the series is currently tied at 1-1. Munar took their most recent match in Dallas. Shelton couldn't get his forehand working, and Munar's return game was impeccable that day. Shelton hasn't had the 2025 that was expected of him. While he did make the semifinals at the Aussie Open and the Finals in Munich, all but one of the other tournaments he's played in have seen his exit by the Round of 16 or earlier. 

Best Bet to Make

The books have Shelton as the favorite, and I agree. While it might be tempting to look at how easily Munar dispatched Shelton earlier this year, that doesn't account for his remarkably poor performances on clay in 2025. Munar had a single win on clay before Rome. As if that's not bad enough, he was a favorite in four of those matches. That lone win was against Tiafoe, and Munar was the favorite. It may take three sets, but Shelton should win this match. 

That being said, Shelton winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Shelton winning @1.80 @WilliamHill

H2H: 0-1

Sebastian Ofner is 0-1 against Frances Tiafoe, and the loss was pretty convincing. It was a straight-set loss in three at the 2023 US Open. While he has played only clay tournaments in 2025, it's only been the last two tournaments that he's joined the ATP proper. He is primarily a lower-level player, and doesn't have a single tournament victory not on the challenger level. Tiafoe is 6-4 in his last ten matches, and he has an appearance in the final at Houston, which was on clay. 



Best Bet to Make

Ofner is going to be an extremely tough out for Tiafoe. Not only is he accomplished on clay in general, but he's been a nuisance on the Challenger tour. Ofner has played in six different tournaments this year, all on clay, with the last two being at the ATP level. He is 4-1 on clay at this level, and is more than capable of beating Tiafoe. That said, Tiafoe should win in three. He's stayed busy on clay in 2025, including making the final in Houston. 

That being said,  Taifoe winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds:  Tiafoe winning @2.44 @Pinnacle

H2H: 0-4

Hubert Hurkacz has been pretty dominant against Pedro Martinez. At 4-0 against him, Hurkacz has beaten him twice on clay and twice on hardcourt. Their last meeting was a tournament final in Estoril, which Hurkazc won in straight sets. Martinez is 3-6 in clay tournaments since April began. He was 3-3 prior to that. His finest performance on clay came earlier this year in February in Buenos Aires, where he reached the semifinals. 

Right now feels like it's time for Martinez to get revenge. Hurkacz hasn't really been a clay player in 2025, and while Martinez hasn't had the best record on clay, he does have six wins on the year. Hurkacz also lost his last match on clay to an underdog boasting similar odds. Hurkacz's lack of activity in 2025 is what has me so nervous. Rotterdam is the only time he's looked especially good outside of the United Cup. I just feel like Martinez's activity lately will have him prepared for this one. Martinez in three. 

That being said, Martinez winning is a value bet, for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds:  Martinez winning @2.5 @Bet365;

	All eyes are on Jannik Sinner as he returns to the court for the round of 64 at the Italian Open. The No. 1-ranked men's tennis player and reigning Australian and US Open champ is making his return to the ATP Tour following a three-month suspension from the World Anti-Doping Agency. His first match of the tournament — and first since the ban — is against the No. 99-ranked Mariano Navone at Campo Centrale. 




	Ahead of the match, Navone told ATPtour.com, “He has been out for three months, and is still No. 1 in the world. But this is why we play tennis, to play in the biggest stadiums in the world.” 


	As for Sinner, he's still dealing with the repercussions of the ban, saying in a pre-tournament press conference, “What's missing for me is the complete feedback of where my level is. That's going to come slowly with time of playing. After the first-round match, I'm going to have a good picture of myself and where I'm at.”




	The match will start around 1:00 p.m. ET on the Tennis Channel. If you don't have cable, Tennis Channel is available with live TV streaming services like DirecTV, Sling, and others. 


	DirecTV's online service, formerly known as DirecTV Stream, gets you the channel-flipping convenience of satellite, without the need for installation. DirecTV includes the Tennis Channel in the Choice package. Sports fans also get channels like TNT, ESPN, and regional sports networks. After the free trial, the choice package is $79.99/mo for the first month, then $89.99 thereafter. 











	If you like customization, Sling is a great, if slightly confusing, option. There are two base packages, with many different add-ons available, so picking the right package for you is not a one-and-done deal. But Sling's a la carte approach makes it easier to save money on packages you might not need. The Sports Extra package, available with the Orange or Blue packages, gets you Tennis Channel access. 


	Fubo is a soccer and sports-focused live streaming service that also offers plenty of entertainment channels. Its Elite lineup includes Tennis Channel, which starts at $74.99/mo for the first month after the free trial, and is $94.99/mo thereafter.

 Felix Auger-Aliassime has withdrawn from the Internazionali BNL d'Italia due to a lower back injury. 

 The 24-year-old Canadian was due to play Thiago Seyboth Wild on Saturday at the clay ATP Masters 1000 in Rome. Instead, Auger-Aliassime's place in the draw will be taken by lucky loser Hugo Dellien, who will take on Seyboth Wild in the fourth match of the day on Court Pietrangeli. 



 The No. 27 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Auger-Aliassime has struggled for form since he reached the Dubai final in February. He is 17-10 for the year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, after losing six of his past seven tour-level matches. 

 Despite those recent struggles, Auger-Aliassime remains one of only two players to have lifted multiple ATP Tour titles in 2025 following his triumphs in Adelaide and Montpellier. The other is World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz.

Jakub Mensik maintained his impressive form at ATP Masters 1000 level this season with a clinical opening-round win Saturday at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.

The #NextGenATP star overcame Italian Matteo Gigante 7-6(4), 7-5 amid a testing atmosphere on Grand Stand Arena to reach the third round. Mensik, who claimed his maiden ATP Tour trophy in Miami in March, now boasts an 11-2 record at Masters 1000 level in 2025.

With his one-hour, 48-minute victory, the 19-year-old Mensik became just the third teenager to advance to the men's singles third round in Rome this decade, joining Italians Lorenzo Musetti and Jannik Sinner (2020).







In his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash with Gigante, Mensik was imperious in all departments, but he could particularly rely on his trusty serve when required. The Czech fired nine aces and did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats.
Mensik, who is at a career-high No. 21 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will next face Fabian Marozsan, who earlier upset 16th seed Andrey Rublev.

Matteo Berrettini channeled the energy from a boisterous crowd at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on Saturday to earn an impressive victory upon return to Rome.

The home favourite, who is making his first appearance at the Italian ATP Masters 1000 since 2021, conjured some inspired shotmaking to move past Jacob Fearnley 6-4, 7-6(0) and reach the third round. Berrettini rallied from 3-5 in the second set and saved two set points on return — both with volley winners — before completing a hard-fought one-hour and 55-minute win.

HEAR HIM ROAR 📣Berrettini triumphs over Fearnley 6-4 7-6(0) to win at home 🇮🇹@InteBNLdItalia | #IBI25 pic.twitter.com/1uglZbufPy

Berrettini was forced to retire against Jack Draper in the third round in Madrid due to an abdominal injury, but returned to action in Rome with steely resolve. Though Fearnley found his groove and tested Berrettini's limits in the second set, the 29th seed dug deep to retrieve the break and storm through a watertight tie-break.

The former No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings and Rome native, Berrettini produced his best run in the capital by reaching the quarter-finals in 2020, but injuries and illness had sidelined the Italian from the clay-court Masters since 2021. The 29-year-old's return this year was an emotional one: He raised his arms aloft and unleashed a triumphant roar to the passionate fans inside Campo Centrale.



After improving to 8-5 in the Italian capital, Berrettini will next face Madrid champion Casper Ruud, who maintained his rhythm with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over Alexander Bublik. The sixth seed stood firm in the face of some electric shotmaking from Bublik, who hit a series of stunning drop volleys to spark hopes of comeback.

Yet Ruud kept his cool in a clinical deciding set, during which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. After extending his winning streak to seven matches, the 26-year-old will aim to maintain his momentum in Rome, where has reached the semi-finals on three occasions (2020, 2022-23).

“It feels great,” said Ruud, who now leads Bublik 7-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “I'm not sure how to address this match. It's a lot of ups and downs, here and there, side to side. When Sascha starts his game, it becomes a bit of a show, so you just try not to admire it, to stay focused.

“He always hits spectacular shots, and sometimes it's a little frustrating for us opponents. But all in all, happy to be through a tough three-setter. It's never easy against Sascha, we had a tough match here in Rome a couple of years ago, so happy to get another today.”







In other early action on Saturday, Marcos Giron stunned countryman and fourth seed Taylor Fritz 7-6(4), 7-6(3) to reach the third round at a clay-court Masters 1000 for the second time in his career (Rome 2022). The 31-year-old trailed 0-4 in the second set, but displayed expertly measured court craft to work his way back in and frustrate his higher-ranked opponent, sealing his victory after one hour, 45 minutes.

Aussie tennis sensation Alex de Minaur is looking to level up his clay court game ahead of Roland Garros and a potential showdown with Jannik Sinner having practised with Carlos Alcaraz. De Minaur is entering the Italian Open having made the semi-finals in Monte Carlo, quarters in Barcelona and fourth round in Madrid.

However, de Minaur is still seeking a win over Alcaraz on clay after the Spaniard knocked him out in Monte Carlo and Barcelona. But in an important move from the Aussie, de Minaur and Alcaraz spent 1.5 hours on court hitting at high-intensity in the Italian capital ahead of their campaigns.

Alcaraz is returning from an abductor injury that saw him withdraw from Madrid. However, while sending a scare through the tennis world ahead of Roland Garros, Alcaraz teamed up with de Minaur for a training session in Rome.

The Australian could have used another hit with the clay court specialist as he looks to make continual leaps forward on the surface. While losing the set to Alcaraz in the mini-practice match, de Minaur can take a lot away from the battle as he prepares for his first-round clash with Luca Nardi.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz told reports he is feeling back to his best as he welcomes the challenge of Sinner returning to the tour. Alcaraz followed up the session with de Minaur with a straight sets win over Dusan Lajovic.

The time off for the Spaniard appeared to do him some good with his forehand and movement looking back to his best. While the training with the Spaniard could offer de Minaur the best preparation for a potential showdown with Sinner.

Sinner is back in action in Rome this week after a three-month suspension for inadvertently ingesting a banned substance. The Italian fans welcomed him with open arms during a practice session. And de Minaur is on Sinner's side of the draw and faces the real possibility of coming up against him for the second-time in 2025.

Sinner's absence might present de Minaur the perfect opportunity to grab a first career win over Sinner, with their head-to-head record currently 10-0 in the Italian's favour. Clay isn't Sinner's favourite surface, and if he shows any signs of rust it might open the door for de Minaur.

De Minaur has only ever won the solitary set against Sinner, but that came way back in 2020. Most recently he was thrashed by the World No.1 in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open in January. De Minaur will enter the Italian Open as the No.7 seed with Novak Djokovic withdrawing from the competition.

While de Minaur is hoping for a deep run in Rome, unfortunately his fiancee Katie Boulter was eliminated in the first round. Boulter has never excelled on clay, but recently made inroads on the surface at the Bille Jean King Cup.

Although her campaign came to a quick halt as Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova knocked her out in straight sets. This has opened the door for Emma Raducanu to take over Boulter as the No.1 ranked British female. Raducanu would need to reach the semi-final in Rome, but will also have an opportunity to overtake Boulter in Paris.

Boulter has been struggling in 2025 having been eliminated in the second round of the Australian Open and Indian Wells. She was knocked out in her first match in Miami, before a second round exit in Madrid.

TNT has announced that their upcoming men's and women's French Open tennis tournament broadcast will be doing essentially the tennis version of the NFL RedZone.

According to The Athletic, at least the first couple rounds of the Roland Garros tournament will have the new format that will include some of the 30+ broadcast talents they've hired for the May-June tournament to broadcast from the same location in a more ""laid-back"" conversational style. 

The broadcast coverage is expected to also include commentary from the hosts, exclusive interviews, banter as well as the ability to hop from match to match during pivotal moments, similar to what NFL RedZone's Scott Hanson has done throughout the years.

With sometimes up to a dozen matches being played at once in the first couple days of Roland Garros, as well as the fact that some tennis fans believe that the French Open doesn't get nearly as much coverage as the other tennis Majors, TNT hopes that the new broadcast style will lure in more of the casual viewing audience that previously tuned in just towards the end of the tournament.

And let's not forget about the sports betting aspect of it as well!

This will be TNT Sports' first year covering the French Open, since signing a 10-year, $650 million deal with the French Tennis Federation where the network will have exclusive broadcasting rights to the tournament across TNT, TBS, TruTV and Max.

Some of the broadcasters that the network has signed on for coverage include everyone from Andre Agassi to Venus Williams to the McEnroe brothers and Boris Becker and plenty more, as they give their takes on the good and the bad of the tournament.

Many tennis fans on social media welcomed TNT's broadcast change as tweets such as ""Finally!,"" The French Open begins on Sunday, May 25th. 

Thanks for signing up!

The French Open is on the horizon and it will bring down the curtain on what has been an exciting European clay court season.

All eyes will turn to Paris for the clay court Grand Slam, the first edition of the event since the retirement of its greatest player, Rafael Nadal.

The Spaniard will be honoured in a special tribute on the opening day of the event and the crowd will have the opportunity to bid Nadal the ideal farewell.

As the French Open moves into a new era, it remains to be seen who will triumph and write their name into the history books alongside the 14-time champion.

While there does not seem to be a clear favourite for the men's French Open title, two clear contenders stand out on the women's side.

Aryna Sabalenka is the World number one and has claimed three titles this season from six finals, including the previous tournament, the Madrid Open.

The other is Iga Swiatek, who despite not winning a title since the 2024 French Open, is the defending champion who has won four of the last five championships in Paris.

Iga Swiatek, Aryna Sabalenka, Mirra Andreeva ➡️🏆Who is your pick to win Roland Garros? #TCLive pic.twitter.com/f0DnXKUFaF

Two-time French Open winner Jim Courier has since predicted his winner, and he went with Swiatek, who is going for a fourth successive title.

“She is still my favourite. As of today [yes, Iga Swiatek over Sabalenka],” the American told Tennis Channel. 

 “Which as of today puts me in the minority. But I think there is magic for Iga when she hits those courts.”

Coco Gauff is always a threat in each tournament she enters due to her elite athleticism and tenacity.

However, she has had a somewhat underwhelming season before reaching the Madrid Open final and with the exception of the United Cup, she has yet to win a title this season.

Mirra Andreeva on the other hand, broke into the top 10 for the first time and claimed successive WTA 1000 titles in Indian Wells and Dubai.

She has yet to reach her top form on clay, but Bet MGM's odds have Andreeva as the third favourite to win the French Open, just ahead of Gauff.

But Courier disagrees and has Gauff ahead of Andreeva as a favourite to take the title, especially after Gauff just defeated Andreeva at the Madrid Open.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic will be seeking a record 25th Grand Slam title at Roland Garros beginning later this month, but Chrissie Evert doubts the 37-year-old can pull it off in Paris.

Evert, the 18-time major champion, is part of TNT's “Dream Team” for the network's maiden coverage of the year's second Grand Slam, which runs May 25-June 8.

“I would never underestimate him, but I would be surprised if he won another major, let's put it that way,” Evert said Friday during a phone interview from Boca Raton, Fla.

“I mean, you've got to give the guy credit. This guy's won everything, more than anybody. I would never say he's not going to win, but I would be surprised. I would be pleasantly surprised, just with his results in the past and he's human…I'm not feeling it.""

Djokovic is not competing in the Italian Open, but accepted a wildcard into the Geneva Open (May 18-24). The Serb holds a 12-7 record on the season and is ranked No. 6 in the world. He lost his first-round matches in Madrid and Monte Carlo on red clay, as well as on hardcourts at Doha and Indian Wells, but he did reach the finals in Miami and the semifinals at the Australian Open where he suffered a muscle tear in his hamstring. 

“I've seen him play brilliantly on grass, and he's won Wimbledon so many times, that's why I can't say no, he's not gonna win another one,” Evert said. “I don't think it's gonna be the French Open….but you can never count him out.”

Per DraftKings, Djokovic, a three-time Roland Garros champion, is tied for the third betting favorite to win the title behind defending champion Carlos Alcaraz (+120) and world No. 1 Jannik Sinner (+250), who was set to return from his doping ban on Saturday in Rome. Djokovic and world No. 2 Alexander Zverev are both at +900 to win the title.

As for the women, four-time champion and world No. 2 Iga Swiatek (+160) is the favorite, followed by world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka (+275) and then 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva (+600) and Coco Gauff (+700).

“I don't know how you can pick anybody between Sabalenka, Iga and Coco, and with [Australian Open champ] Madison Keys really to me would be my fourth pick,” Evert said.

She added that Sabalenka and Gauff are “playing at the top of their games,” but that Swiatek needs to find another gear in Paris. She lost to American Danielle Collins, 6-1, 7-5, in the Round of 32 on Saturday in Rome, and is now No. 4 in the Live Rankings.

“I just don't know how Iga is going to react,” Evert continued. “That, to me, is the unknown. We know what she is capable of, and with her past records, she's brilliant at the French Open, but I just don't know if she can find her A game, because she's going to need it…It's kind of like we're seeing her C game right now.”

Evert will be part of the TNT broadcast in Paris that also includes Venus Williams, Andre Agassi, Boris Becker, John McEnroe, Mats Wilander, Lindsay Davenport and Caroline Wozniacki.

“I've been with ESPN for 15 years, and I'll continue to be with them,” Evert said. “TNT, as far as I know, is only doing the French Open. So my allegiance really is to ESPN, but they don't do the tournament, so they sort of gave me permission to do it with TNT. But I'm very happy that they asked me because I'm from [the] old school, John McEnroe and I are old school, and isn't it great they have some fresh, new talent…I love the different personalities, I love the different perspectives.”

Before she heads of to Paris, Evert will be honored on Monday by the Harlem Junior Tennis & Education Program (HJTEP) at the organization's 53rd Annual Gala at the Ziegfeld Ballroom in New York City. She will receive the Shining Star Award, while Morgan Stanley will receive the HJTEP Corporate Award.

Patrick McEnroe will emcee the star-studded gala celebrating the achievements of nearly 1,000 young people who benefit each year from HJTEP's tennis and education programs. Both a live and silent auction will raise critical funds needed to support these programs.

She added: ""I am chairwoman of the USTA Foundation, so I'm familiar with a lot of these programs, and I've been really working with them for five years now,” Evert said, adding that she gives credit to Katrina Adams, the former chairman and CEO of the USTA and now the Executive Director and President of Harlem Junior Tennis.

“I think that Katrina does a great job,” Evert said. “I have to give her a lot of compliments because she's been with that program for 19 years, and she's bullish in the in the way that she goes after sponsors. And anyone that can help these kids that deserve to be helped.”

She continued: “You know, life isn't fair, and there are a lot of kids out there who just don't have the opportunities that others had. And so what better thing to do once you've retired and you made a lot of money and you've had your place in the sun, but it's like it's time to give back.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","tennis"

Unleashing a New Tennis Sensation: Jack Draper Emerges as the Next Clay Court Maestro

British tennis star Jack Draper is making waves in the tennis world after his remarkable performance at the Madrid Masters, where he showcased his exceptional clay-court skills and drew comparisons to the legendary Rafael Nadal. The young prodigy's impressive display at the Caja Magica has propelled him into the top 5 rankings, cementing his status as a force to be reckoned with on the court.

Despite his loss to Casper Ruud in the title match, Draper's electrifying lefty forehand and unwavering on-court intensity have captured the attention of tennis enthusiasts worldwide. His uncanny resemblance to Nadal's playing style has led to speculations about his potential to dominate the clay court scene in the future.

Draper, who hails from Sutton, humbly downplayed the comparisons to Nadal, jokingly mentioning that he is still “missing 14 Roland Garros titles.” While Draper acknowledges the challenges of emulating Nadal's unparalleled success on clay, his recent performances indicate a promising trajectory in his career.

Following his impressive showing in Madrid, Draper has continued his winning streak at the Rome Masters, defeating Luciano Darderi in straight sets. The left-handed sensation expressed his admiration for Nadal, stating, “Being left-handed, I looked up to Rafa when I was younger. I can not compare myself, but I share some attributes with him, either his attitude on court or the way I put spin on my forehand.”

As Draper sets his sights on future tournaments, including a potential deep run at Roland Garros, tennis fans are eagerly anticipating his meteoric rise in the sport. With his blend of power, finesse, and determination, Jack Draper is poised to carve his own legacy on the clay courts, captivating audiences with his thrilling brand of tennis.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Former Wimbledon champion noticed Iga Swiatek doing something she 'never' used to in her defeat to Danielle Collins, 'it is a massive shock'","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/former-wimbledon-champion-noticed-iga-swiatek-doing-something-she-never-used-to-in-her-defeat-to-danielle-collins-it-is-a-massive-shock/","Sat, 10 May 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

Iga Swiatek was hoping to bounce back from her devastating defeat in Madrid with a strong showing at the Italian Open.

Last time out, Swiatek lost to Coco Gauff, 1-6, 1-6, in the semi-finals of the Madrid Open, suffering her worst clay-court defeat in six years.

Returning to the court in Rome as the defending champion, Swiatek won her opening match against Elisabetta Cocciaretto, 6-1, 6-0.

Her run came to an abrupt end in the third round, however, as Swiatek lost to Danielle Collins in straight sets.

Speaking after the match, a former Wimbledon champion described Swiatek's defeat as a ‘massive shock'

Appearing on Sky Sports, following Swiatek's 1-6, 5-7 defeat to Collins, 2013 Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli shared her thoughts on the match.

“It's a massive shock. To see Iga Swiatek going out so early in a clay court tournament before a Grand Slam, which is Roland Garros, when she is defending champion, is the biggest shock,” she said.

“She was struggling so much on the return of serve. On a few occasions in the second set, she could have broken and gotten herself back in 2-2, 15-15; she missed two routine returns of serve. The same in the back end of the set. 

“She just couldn't get that strike into the court. It was very uncharacteristic from her when she is playing her best tennis.”

Bartoli gave credit to Swiatek's American opponent, but couldn't quite believe what she had just witnessed on Stadio Centrale.

“Of course, Collins was doing what she does best, which was attacking and exposing that second serve,” she said.

“I am still really in shock that Iga has not been able to turn that match around. I honestly thought towards the back end of that second set, it was getting a lot closer, and she could have turned it around.

“But you can tell that lack of confidence at crucial moments.

“She is missing shots she never used to miss, and out of that, it is very difficult to find your confidence again.”

Prior to her latest defeat in Rome, Swiatek had qualified for the last 16 at 26 consecutive WTA tournaments.

26 – Iga Swiatek failed to reach the Round of 16 in a WTA-1000 event for the first time since Cincinnati 2021, when she was defeated by Ons Jabeur (she made this stage for 26 such consecutive events). Disenchantment.#IBI25 | @InteBNLdItalia @WTA @WTA_insider pic.twitter.com/z2slyVzhO8

Her loss to Collins at the Italian Open ended that run and broke her streak of reaching the quarterfinals of every tournament she'd played so far in 2025.

Swiatek's performances on clay have been particularly disappointing in 2025, as Bartoli explained the issues she's having on the surface before the match began.

Ahead of her match with Collins, Bartoli was presented with statistics outlining the Pole's decline in performance on clay from 2024 to 2025.

Bartoli suggested the one key reason behind Swiatek's struggles on the surface in 2025.

“There are many [reasons], the first one that jumps into my eyes is the stress level that Iga Swiatek is feeling right now on the court,” she said.

“It's so palpable, you can really feel it when she's on the court, there is not that confidence anymore in her movement, she's missing shots she normally would never miss, the serve has been really difficult for her, she has been double-faulting a lot more than usual.

“She has actually lost more sets so far in 2025 on clay than she lost throughout the whole clay court season last year, it really shows you the difficulty she's facing.”

Bartoli then looked back at Swiatek's defeat to Jelena Ostapenko in Stuttgart, a match that highlighted a big issue for the Pole, which she thinks is now being exploited by the five-time Major champion's WTA rivals.

“She played against [Jelena] Ostapenko in Stuttgart, and I'm still helping Ostapenko with her tactics in some of her matches,” said Bartoli.

“When I was watching the match on TV, I could just sense the fact that Iga was struggling so much when you play fast.

“When you don't give her time and you play fast, the same as what Coco Gauff has been doing in Madrid to get her as well, when you rush her, she's struggling to find that footwork that normally she possesses so well on clay.

“It has been a lot easier this year to beat her out of the court.”

Swiatek will have to recover fast from her latest defeat as she prepares to defend her title at the French Open, which begins on Sunday, May 25.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Emma Raducanu has been putting in the hard work in the gym as it has resulted in an improvement in her movement on clay, according to Marion Bartoli as she also shared her thoughts on the world No 49's coaching arrangement with Mark Petchey.

After exiting the Madrid Open in the second round, Raducanu has now gone one better at the Italian Open after getting the better of Jil Teichmann, winning 6-2, 6-2, at Foro Italico.

It is only the second time that the 22-year-old has reached the third round of one of the WTA 1000 clay-court events as she also made the round of 32 in Madrid in 2022.

Raducanu, though, will also be the first to admit that she has limited experience on clay as this is only her fifth main draw appearance at the Madrid-Rome swing.

But there has been a noticeable change in the way she is sliding on the surface, according to 2013 Wimbledon winner Bartoli.

“I think she's moving better which is crucial on clay. The surface is lively and you're sliding all over the place so you need to get your legs extremely strong,” she told Sky Sports Tennis.

“You need to feel the ground really well and when I look at her muscle from the lower body she has been really putting in the work in the gym, which is probably why she decided to take a break after Miami to get those hours in the gym to make sure she was physically ready for the clay and grass too.”

Raducanu has been working with Petchey since the Miami Open, but for now it remains an interim solution as he is not able to fill the role on a full-time basis due to his work as a television commentator.

Petchey as well as long-term mentor Jane Donoghue are in her box in Rome and Bartoli explained why they are a perfect fit for the 22-year-old.

“Emma is probably looking for a coach who is not too technical,” the Frenchwoman said. “She will really need someone on the court with her every day if she wants to work on her technique. She's probably wanting someone to explain to her how the tactics work for that specific opponent.

“They had to reposition her around the court because she had to cover the left side of the court [against Teichmann] so when you have the experience of someone as Mark, you can bring that on the table very quickly and sometimes that takes away the stress from the player.

“I think that's what she's looking for in that dynamic. She's going to her box quite often with eye contact which means she trusts the people inside that box.”


                Emma Raducanu appears to have discovered the joy on court once again and it is helping her game.            


                “To be honest, it was pretty mental.""            


                Emma Raducanu takes top prize.

Danielle Collins pulled off a huge upset at the Italian Open on Saturday, breezing past defending champion and No. 2 seed Iga Swiatek 6-1 7-5. The American hit headlines in January when she riled up the booing fans at the Australian Open, reminding them that they “pay her bills” and gesturing to kiss her behind.

But she let her tennis do the talking at the Foro Italico, upsetting Swiatek in the third round. Afterwards, Collins shared an emotional insight into her tennis journey, explaining just how much the sport had shaped her.

It's already been a rollercoaster season for Collins, who previously planned to retire at the end of 2024 before her circumstances changed and she decided to keep playing.

The world No. 35 started the year with a bang, making a big impression in Melbourne when she hit back at the hostile crowd and told them: “One of the greatest things about being a professional athlete is the people that don't like you and the people that hate you, they actually pay your bills. It's all going towards the Danielle Collins Fund. Bring it on. I love it.”

Collins was then unable to defend her title at the Miami Open and, after losing in the Charleston quarter-final in April, she was sidelined for a month before returning in Rome this week.

The 31-year-old has already made a statement on the European clay, taking out reigning champion Swiatek in the third round. It's Swiatek's earliest exit at a WTA 1000 tournament since 2021.

After getting just her second win in nine meetings with the world No. 2, Collins got candid during her on-court interview, explaining just how much went into her career.

""I think it's shaped me so much. Coming from a pretty humble beginning, I think it's hard getting into tennis,” the former world No. 7 told the Campo Centrale crowd.

“Tennis is an expensive sport and my parents did everything for me. They were working double jobs, extra hours to be able to fund this.

“To be able to come out here and live out my dream. I was never a child prodigy, I had an unconventional route. But that hard work and perseverance has really made me into the person that I am.”

It's been more than three years since Collins last got a win over Swiatek, beating her in the 2022 Australian Open semi-final.

Explaining how she got the win on Saturday, the American said: “My priority today was to go out and be consistent with the shots that I was hitting.

“Obviously with my game style, I play a pretty aggressive game style. Sometimes that can go one way or another. It can look really great and flashy, and other times you can miss some shots.

“But I think having the confidence and trusting myself in those big moments to go after it, to trust my athleticism and to really just like not be afraid to go after my shots in those big moments, I think was key.”

Matteo Berrettini channeled the energy from a boisterous crowd at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia on Saturday to earn an impressive victory upon return to Rome.

The home favourite, who is making his first appearance at the Italian ATP Masters 1000 since 2021, conjured some inspired shotmaking to move past Jacob Fearnley 6-4, 7-6(0) and reach the third round. Berrettini rallied from 3-5 in the second set and saved two set points on return — both with volley winners — before completing a hard-fought one-hour and 55-minute win.

HEAR HIM ROAR 📣Berrettini triumphs over Fearnley 6-4 7-6(0) to win at home 🇮🇹@InteBNLdItalia | #IBI25 pic.twitter.com/1uglZbufPy

Berrettini was forced to retire against Jack Draper in the third round in Madrid due to an abdominal injury, but returned to action in Rome with steely resolve. Though Fearnley found his groove and tested Berrettini's limits in the second set, the 29th seed dug deep to retrieve the break and storm through a watertight tie-break.

The former No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings and Rome native, Berrettini produced his best run in the capital by reaching the quarter-finals in 2020, but injuries and illness had sidelined the Italian from the clay-court Masters since 2021. The 29-year-old's return this year was an emotional one: He raised his arms aloft and unleashed a triumphant roar to the passionate fans inside Campo Centrale.



After improving to 8-5 in the Italian capital, Berrettini will next face Madrid champion Casper Ruud, who maintained his rhythm with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over Alexander Bublik. The sixth seed stood firm in the face of some electric shotmaking from Bublik, who hit a series of stunning drop volleys to spark hopes of comeback.

Yet Ruud kept his cool in a clinical deciding set, during which he did not face a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats. After extending his winning streak to seven matches, the 26-year-old will aim to maintain his momentum in Rome, where has reached the semi-finals on three occasions (2020, 2022-23).

“It feels great,” said Ruud, who now leads Bublik 7-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “I'm not sure how to address this match. It's a lot of ups and downs, here and there, side to side. When Sascha starts his game, it becomes a bit of a show, so you just try not to admire it, to stay focused.

“He always hits spectacular shots, and sometimes it's a little frustrating for us opponents. But all in all, happy to be through a tough three-setter. It's never easy against Sascha, we had a tough match here in Rome a couple of years ago, so happy to get another today.”







In other early action on Saturday, Marcos Giron stunned countryman and fourth seed Taylor Fritz 7-6(4), 7-6(3) to reach the third round at a clay-court Masters 1000 for the second time in his career (Rome 2022). The 31-year-old trailed 0-4 in the second set, but displayed expertly measured court craft to work his way back in and frustrate his higher-ranked opponent, sealing his victory after one hour, 45 minutes.

The 2019 US Open champion scored her first Top 20 win of the season over Donna Vekic.ByDavid KanePublished May 10, 2025 copy_link

Published May 10, 2025

ROME, Italy—At 24 years old, Bianca Andreescu felt like she was running out of time.“I felt like I'd wasted time,” she told me more precisely last night at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.It was a chilly night in Rome and Andreescu had just scored her first completed win over a Top 20 player since 2023 (Roland Garros, d. Victoria Azarenka). When the Canadian was in the midst of her breakthrough 2019 season, which famously culminated with a maiden major title at the US Open, Andreescu had become accustomed to the long night-late finish grind of a three-set match. Years of injuries and absences gave the feeling new freshness.“I've missed this,” she smiled after a 6-1, 3-6, 6-2 victory over Donna Vekic.

It's such a good feeling to really take control of your life. Bianca Andreescu

A six-week delay to her season had ballooned into four months when the former world No. 4 required surgery for her appendix. The procedure was, improbably, her first time under the knife.“Not bad, right?” she'd joked to a mesmerized group of reporters following her first-round win on Wednesday. Andreescu credited mother Maria—who stole the show from the player's box with the chic looks she'd often wear to her daughter's matches—with guiding her toward less invasive methods.“It was a journey, for sure, because you want to be able to trust the doctors that you're seeing. They're world class, but sometimes their mentality is just, ‘Get under the knife,'” said Andreescu, who has suffered from shoulder, knee, back, and ankle injuries all in the last six years. “Sometimes it can even be about getting another player under their book.

By defeating Vekic, Andreescu won back-to-back matches at a WTA 1000 for the first time since 2023 (Miami Open, 4R).

“My mom was always telling me to try and stay away from surgery, and we were always able to find something else, whether it's [plasma-rich platelet injections], stem cells, whatever it may be….Obviously there's what ifs, but going with what I feel too. Everybody says if you can avoid going under the knife, do it, because there can be serious complications with that.”Finally injury-free, Andreescu set to work at revamping every aspect of her career. She rehired coach Antonio Fernandez Cantisano, a one-man band in a era of bloated player teams.“He's all in one: physio, hitting partner, coach, emotional support, bodyguard!” she said of Cantisano, who she first worked with in 2023.She changed racquets, switching from Head to a Yonex EZONE, a popular frame that Madison Keys picked up to win the Australian Open earlier this season.

Despite competing on her least favorite surface, Andreescu feels a lightness she hasn't felt since her days on the junior circuit.

“I may have been a bit more serious than him in juniors,” joked the Dane.ByDavid KanePublished May 10, 2025 copy_link

Published May 10, 2025

ROME, Italy—Though he has lived through much of Carlos Alcaraz's rise to tennis stardom, Holger Rune still found time to watch his former junior rival's new documentary, giving Carlos Alcaraz: My Way high marks at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.“I actually talked to him a little bit about it in the locker rooms,” Rune confirmed after a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over Francisco Comesana in his first match since retiring from the Mutua Madrid Open due to a knee injury.“I think it's good. I think it's nice for tennis fans, and—I said basically the same thing after the Netflix thing I did with the rest of the players—I think it's great for the tennis fans to see more of what's behind the scenes. It's cool, because we're all human.”Rune famously shared an episode with Alcaraz in the second season of Break Point, and while the Dane appeared reluctant to invite cameras back into his life, he enjoyed his own behind-the-scenes look at a player he's known since their junior days.

“I don't want to say anything controversial, but I might have been a little bit more serious than him in juniors,” teased Rune, who defeated Alcaraz to win the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell two weeks ago, “but he's catching up and is very serious now!“In juniors, you could see his potential, his talent, everything. He was an amazing player and, of course, Spanish people live differently than Danish people. It's a different kind of character.”Released earlier this month, the three-part docuseries, follows Alcaraz through a wildly successful 2024 season, where he won back-to-back major titles at Roland Garros and Wimbledon, but also shows the Spaniard's struggle with the sort of non-stop discipline repeatedly ascribed to the likes of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, and Roger Federer.

“He's a guy that loves playing tennis and is extremely good at it. It's cool to see and from my side, I think [his experience is] normal for every player. You don't feel the same every day, the same motivation every day, but it's normal.“You have some days where you dig a little bit deeper and find some more energy.

‘America's Funniest Home Videos,' ‘Celebrity Jeopardy!,' ‘Celebrity Wheel of Fortune' and ‘Shark Tank' have also secured spots on the network's 2025-26 slate.


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


ABC has renewed several of its unscripted shows for the 2025-26 season, but one of its longest-running reality franchises remains in limbo.


	The network announced Friday that it has picked up new seasons of American Idol, America's Funniest Home Videos, Celebrity Jeopardy!, Celebrity Wheel of Fortune and Shark Tank for next season. They join the previously renewed Dancing With the Stars and The Golden Bachelor on the 2025-26 slate; Bachelor in Paradise, Celebrity Family Feud, a new version of Match Game hosted by Martin Short, Press Your Luck and Who Wants to Be a Millionaire are set for summer runs.

	Notably missing from the renewal list are The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, which have been staples on ABC for most of the 21st century. The network is skipping its usual summer run for The Bachelorette this year, and The Bachelor showrunners Claire Freeland and Bennett Graebner left the franchise following allegations of “toxic” and “hostile” behavior on set (Freeland and Graebner have denied those claims through their attorney).


	Sources say no decisions have been made on The Bachelor or The Bachelorette yet. The Bachelor typically films in the fall for a January premiere, so if ABC decides to go ahead with the show as usual, it still has time to make a call and get things in place for its usual cycle. 


	As for the renewed series, American Idol will go into its ninth season on ABC (and 24th overall, including its Fox run) in 2025-26. AFV — ABC's longest-running unscripted show — will enter its 36th season in the fall. Shark Tank has been picked up for season 17, Celebrity Wheel of Fortune for season six and Celebrity Jeopardy! for season four.


	The network has also renewed seven scripted shows (911, Abbott Elementary, High Potential, Grey's Anatomy, The Rookie, Shifting Gears and Will Trent) and placed a straight-to-series order to 911: Nashville, a spinoff of 911. ABC has yet to make a decision on first-year drama Doctor Odyssey.

Text messages cited in the lawsuits show that the singer joined Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds in advocating for script revisions proposed by the actress. 


							By 

	Winston Cho



Taylor Swift has been subpoenaed by Justin Baldoni's lawyers in the sprawling legal battle over the filming of It Ends With Us.


	Swift's involvement in the dueling lawsuits relates to suggestions from Blake Lively that Baldoni altered a rooftop scene at the beginning of the film. Lively invited the director to her New York City home in 2023 to discuss the script changes.




	Once there, Baldoni was surprised to see Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and close friend, Swift, according to his lawsuit, which cites communications that include the name “Taylor.” The megastars praise Lively's version of the scene, pressuring Baldoni to accept the revisions, he alleged.

	In a text, Lively refers to Reynolds and Swift as her “dragons.” The message reads, “If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you'll appreciate that I'm Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for.”


	Baldoni was supportive of the changes. “I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor),” he wrote with a wink emoji. “You really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.”


	Tensions over the rewrite lead Baldoni to send Lively a six-minute-plus voice message at 2 a.m. to apologize for anything he did to upset her, according to the complaint. At the end of the recording, Baldoni says, “You probably have kids all over you and a baby on your boob, and you're listening to me ramble at 2 in the morning.”


	A spokesperson for Swift said the subpoena is a bid to “draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.” The rep, who noted that the only connection the singer has with the film is permitting the use of “My Tears Ricochet,” added “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see It Ends With Us until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history.”

	











	Lively and Baldoni didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

	Costume designer Rosanna Norton, who received an Oscar nomination for the sci-fi classic Tron and also worked on Badlands, Carrie, The Stunt Man and Frankie and Johnny during her four-decade career, has died. She was 80.

	Norton also collaborated with Joe Dante on Explorers (1985), Innerspace (1987), The ‘Burbs (1989) and Gremlins 2: The New Batch (1990) and with Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker on Airplane! (1980) and Ruthless People (1986).

	She shared her Oscar nom for Steven Lisberger's Tron (1982) with Elois Jenssen.


	The oldest of four kids, Rosanna White was born in Los Angeles on Oct. 1, 1944. Her mother, Ann Stanford, was an acclaimed poet and founding member of the Association of Writers & Writing Programs, and her father, Roland, was an architect.


	While attended UCLA as a painting major, she met future husband Bill Norton, then made her film debut as the costume designer on the 1971 film he co-wrote and directed, the Kris Kristofferson-starring Cisco Pike (1971).


	“I would have been a painter,” she once said, “but was really lucky to get on some really good pictures through my friendships with directors Brian De Palma and Terry Malick.” She joined the Costume Directors Guild in 1975.


	Her résumé included Messiah of Evil (1974), Outlaw Blues (1977), Robert Zemeckis' I Wanna Hold Your Hand (1978), Joan Micklin Silver's Chilly Scenes of Winter (1979), Airplane II (1982), RoboCop 2 (1990), The Flintstones (1994), The Brady Bunch Movie (1995) and Detroit Rock City (1999).


	After costume designing — her last credit was Pool Boys (2009) — Norton returned to her first love, painting.


	Survivors include her daughter, Lora; her grandchildren, Mira, Milo, Lola, Isaac and Kayla; and her sister, Pat. She also was briefly married to director James Bryan.

Executive Editor, International & Strategy


EXCLUSIVE: Dev Patel‘s revenge action-thriller The Peasant has been snapped up by A24 in a splashy deal on the eve of the Cannes market.


	We understand the pact closed in the $30M range last night after a competitive situation. It's a Cannes market low on buzzy action movies and this one has a unique premise and strong elements so was taken off the table by A24. It will be on sale for international territories going forward.


	The 2023 Black List project is being described as having shades of Braveheart and John Wick as well as notes of King Arthur. After being updated by Patel, the script combines medieval knights with feudal India. Set in the 1300s, it centers on a shepherd who embarks on a rage-fueled campaign against a group of mercenary knights who ransacked his community, revealing himself to be more than he seems.

John Wick outfit Thunder Road is producing with Fifth Season who developed the project with Will Dunn, a writer on Marvel Studios' Ms. Marvel. Patel will write, direct and star in the movie and there are hopes it can become a franchise. The aim is to shoot this year. CAA Media Finance and producers brokered the deal with A24.

	A24 and Patel previously teamed on David Lowery's period fantasy The Green Knight.


	Patel will also produce via his Minor Realm production shingle. The project reunites Patel with Thunder Road, which produced Monkey Man, his feature directorial debut, which he also co-wrote and starred in.

Columnist/International Editor At Large


Tom Cruise has spoken for the first time about how he suggested to Stanley Kubrick that his then wife Nicole Kidman star opposite him in 1999s  Eyes Wide Shut “because obviously she's a great actress.”


	The actor makes the rare public acknowledgement of Kidman's thespian abilities in the May issue of Sight and Sound, the film magazine published by the British Film Institute.


	Cruise will be honoured by the BFI on Monday with the awarding of a distinguished BFI Fellowship.


	He joins the ranks of other BFI Fellows including giants of the calibre of David Lean, Bette Davis, Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, Thelma Schoonmaker, Derek Jarman, Martin Scorsese, Satyajit Ray, Barbara Broccoli, Michael G Wilson, Spike Lee and Christopher Nolan.

	The actor-impresario will also discuss his career In Conversation at the BFI cinema complex on London's Southbank on Sunday evening. Cruise activity is at full speed ahead of the world premiere screening on Wednesday,May 14, at the Cannes Film Festival of Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, the latest,and likely final, instalment of Paramount's  Mission: Impossible franchise that began three decades ago with director Brian De Palma's Mission: Impossible released in 1996.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The brief declaration about Kidman comes as no surprise to this reporter. When Kidman starred at the Donmar Warehouse Theatre in Covent Garden in the 1998 production of The Blue Room, an adaptation by David Hare  of Arthur Schnitzler's La Ronde, directed by Sam Mendes, Cruise watched the first preview through a small window of a production booth on the side of the stage. I recall him being in complete awe after watching her performance.    


	In Sight and Sound, Cruise describes his collaboration with Kubrick.


	 “It was a great experience. I was very excited to do it. I knew Stanley's movies very well and I was introduced to him through Sydney Pollack. So Stanley called Sydney 'cause he wanted me to make a movie. He sent me a fax. 


	I flew out to his house and I landed in his backyard. I read the script the day before and we spent the day talking about it. I knew all of his films. I spoke to Scorsese about him and Sydney Pollack… so I knew what he did and how he worked. Then it was basically he and I getting to know each other. And when we were doing that, I suggested Nicole play the role [of Alice]. Because obviously she's a great actress.

	











	Cruise continues:  “I knew it was going to be a long shoot. He was like, ‘No, no, no. We'll finish in three or four months.' And I said, ‘Stanley, look, I'm here for you. Whatever it's going to take we're going to do this…' I thought the film was very interesting, and I wanted to have that experience. When I go to make a movie, I do a lot of detailed investigation and a lot of time with the people before I commit so that I understand what they need and want and they understand me and how we can work together and really create something very special.


	“It was a very unique experience – not a large crew. We arrived in the summer and basically we just started testing… the script was just an idea. We [were] constantly rewriting the scenes and shooting the scenes and then reshooting the scenes to really find the tone of the film.”


On working with Val Kilmer on Top Gun:


	In the wide-ranging interview with Isabel Stevens, Cruise also talks movingly about working  on the Top Gun movies with Val Kilmer who died on April 1. 


	“I felt so grateful that he decided to make the film. We did a lot to get him in the movie. Originally, he just didn't want to make the movie, ‘I don't want to be a supporting, I want to star in films.' I was calling his agent, and Tony Scott was hunting him down and meeting in an elevator with Val, and he was like, ‘Please, Val, please.'


	“You just see what a great actor, charismatic guy he was. And in that scene, what I love about what he did and how he played it, he just knew that tone to hit. He had to play it so you wanted these guys to be friends in the end. Do you know what I'm saying? And I remember those scenes like they were yesterday, acting with him, where he did the bite thing. You know when you're acting with somebody and you just see they're just on fire. It's exhilarating. I love when the scene just goes to a different place. If you look at Top Gun, I think he's in the movie maybe ten minutes. That's the impact of an artist like that. 


	“And to come back all those years later, and it was amazing being on set for Top Gun: Maverick [Joseph Kosinski, 2022] because it was like time had not passed. We were laughing and it was joyous. And then we started acting and it's just, you see it… he became Iceman. The power that this guy has, even not saying anything, to become that character. You see how even the sniff that he gave. He was Iceman. And you saw the dynamic between these friends. It was very special, to say the least, for me personally. I just tell people… you take Iceman from the first film and you look at it here, that whole journey, he became Iceman. And he didn't even have to speak. That's what he's able to do. Beautiful, really beautiful. A gift that he had and that he shared with all of us.”


On acting alongside Jack Nicholson and the famous courtroom scene in A Few Good Men.


	“He was finding his character. And you could see every movement slowed. He became more and more centred as we were going through it. You could tell from the way he's sitting. He's actually holding his hat quite tautly to generate power. He understands that lens. He's a wordsmith, Nicholson. He's like a crooner that knows how to carve up a monologue and knows how to carve up a scene. He can turn a phrase in such a unique way. And it's not by chance. He knows what he's doing. He has command over his body and his voice and he knows the camera. 

	











	“Great actors make it look easy. They make it look effortless. When you look at Brando at the beginning of The Godfather. He knows his light. He knows the lens. When they handed him that cat. That cat was only in one take and that was the scene. That was it! Coppola handed him that cat and he did the scene. 


	“It's not just by chance. You work towards lightning in a bottle. Doing that scene was very much like that. It was music. Jack was there to play. I was there to play. When I'm acting, that's my home. Acting is every moment new. Every take new. Even though you've got all these notes and you want to hit these certain beats. But it's in a new unit of time and you have to let it fly. And when you're working with such a great actor like that, you're just bouncing back and forth and just really discovering it together. You see it, it's on screen, it's just there.”


The May issue of Sight and Sound is on sale next week.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Amazon is not proceeding with a second season of half-hour action police drama On Call, from Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television, sources tell Deadline. The series, starring Troian Bellisario and Brandon Larracuente, has been shopped to other platforms, and two of them have engaged in discussions about a potential second season, I hear.


	This is a somewhat surprising development as On Call, created by Tim Walsh and Elliot Wolf, has done well, reaching the #1 slot on Prime Video in the U.S. following the January 9 drop of all eight episodes and earning 92% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes. (The series received mixed reactions from critics.)

	Indeed, Amazon a few weeks ago approached the producers of the show about a two-season renewal, sources said. It was looking good until the offer was accompanied by a request to reduce the premium on the series, I hear. Under the widely used current cost-plus streaming compensation model, the license fee producers get from the platforms covers the cost of the series plus a premium on top, which goes to the project's profit participants and studio in lieu of backend.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The ask is not a surprising development — virtually every renewal conversation in the current tough economic environment across broadcast and streaming has come with strings attached involving license fee/budget reductions. The process is even harder when outside studios are involved as they face an ever higher threshold for renewal consideration. (Universal Television is the lead studio for On Call, co-producing with Amazon MGM Studios in association with NBCU-based Wolf Entertainment.)


	According to sources, Amazon's argument for the cut was that the company was losing money on the show, also something we hear often, especially on series that are not owned. For Wolf Entertainment and Universal TV, reducing a premium that was not big to begin with was not economically feasible, so the status of On Call at Amazon went from a pending two-season renewal to cancellation within the span of weeks.


	All things considered, the parting of the ways was amicable, with Amazon allowing the producers to take back the rights to the existing season if they find a new home for the series, something not all streamers agree to.


	I hear there are active conversations with two places. Not surprisingly, one of them is believed to be NBCUniversal's Peacock, streaming home to Dick Wolf's Chicago and Law & Order NBC dramas as well as his Peacock original Law & Order: Organized Crime, all ranking among the most watched programs on the platform.

	











	Sources for Amazon and Wolf Entertainment declined comment. 


	Bringing back the half-hour drama genre from the early days of television into the streaming age has been a passion for Wolf. Like he has done with Law & Order, Chicago Fire and FBI, he has envisioned On Call as a franchise, with a second half-hour drama in development behind it, I hear.


	The franchise potential is being pitched alongside On Call, Wolf's first original streaming series. Still, it will likely come down to financials, with sources pegging the odds of the police drama continuing elsewhere at 50-50.


On Call was originally set up in 2021 at Amazon's AVOD platform IMDb TV, which became Amazon Freevee before shutting down last fall. By then, the series had migrated to Prime Video. On Call stars Bellisario and  Larracuente as a veteran officer and rookie duo who patrol the streets of Long Beach, CA. Incorporating a mixture of bodycam, dash-camera, and cellphone footage to create a cinema verité effect, the series explores the morality of protecting and serving a community.


	The recurring cast includes Lori Loughlin, Eriq La Salle and Rich Ting. Dick Wolf, his son Elliot Wolf, Walsh, La Salle, who directed multiple episodes, and Peter Jankowski are executive producers.

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


UPDATED, SATURDAY AM WRITETHRU after Friday update: Disney/Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* is currently playing a bit ahead of Shang-Chi's second weekend with $9 million Friday and a weekend around $35M, off 53% from its opening last week. That second weekend ease is the eighth best among all MCU titles across 36 releases. That will get the Florence Pugh-Wyatt Russell-Sebastian Stan Marvel ensemble past $130M by Sunday. 


Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings during its post-Labor Day frame in 2021 did $34.7M, off 54%. 


	Currently the weekend for all titles looks to be doing $91M, -5% from a year ago ($96.1M per Box Office Mojo), that frame boosted by Disney/20th Century Studios' opening of Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes with $58.4M.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	After a $6.6M fourth Friday, Warner Bros' Sinners, is heading to $22M in its fourth weekend. How does it stack up to other fourth weekends for horror films? It's head of the fourth weekends of Sixth Sense ($20M) and It‘s ($16.9M). Sinners is behind Blair Witch Project‘s fourth weekend of $24.3M, but that's a bit of apples to oranges as it was technically the second wide weekend for the found-footage movie, which had a two-weekend platform. Interestingly, Sinners isn't that far from the fourth weekend of A Minecraft Movie ($22.7M).


	The rest of the weekend is looking as follows:

Best areas of play are Midwest, Mountain and West with AMC Century City the best venue with close to $4K through yesterday.

	











	6.) Shadow Force (LG) 2,170 theaters, Fri $720K, 3-day $2M/Wk 1CinemaScore is a B here for this Kerry Washington-Omar Sy Lionsgate action pic, which was made for $40M net. 54% definite recommend on PostTrak, which isn't shabby, but nobody is coming. We'll have more on this later this weekend as to what went sideways here. Business is light with the pic's best regions being the South, East, South Central and Midwest. The Cinemark Colonel Glen 18 in Arkansas is the best location stateside with less than $5K through Friday.

	Remember, there are bigger events to come at the summer B.O. 


PREVIOUSLY, FRIDAY AM: Disney and Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts* will continue to storm the weekend box office in its second session with an estimated $30 million, off 60% or less from its debut frame. The Jake Schreier-directed movie will cross the century mark Friday stateside in a weekend that's littered with a bunch of single-digit-million openers. Summer competition doesn't start until next weekend, when New Line's Final Destination: Bloodlines will debut to a projected $30M-$40M. Thunderbolts* will have all the Imax and PLFs this weekend.


	Warner Bros' Sinners is not going to hell at the box office, but rather continues skyward ending week 3 with $46.6M and a running total of $193.3M. The Ryan Coogler-directed, Michael B. Jordan-starring vampire movie is crossing $200M today with a fourth weekend that's expected to be potent with $23M-$25M, -30%, per industry forecasts. Sinners will have Imax 70MM auditoriums May 15-21.


	Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie is looking to ease another 35%-40% in weekend 6 with around $8M after a week 5 of $16.5M and running total of $401M as of yesterday.


	Amazon MGM Studios' The Accountant 2 ends its second week with $13.1M and a running total of $44.7M. 


	In regards to the rest, the one movie expected to pop is IFC's Clown in the Cornfield at 2,277 screens, looking at around $5M. Critics love the movie at 80% fresh in the wake of its SXSW premiere in March. The Eli Craig-directed title is set in a fading midwestern town in which Frendo the clown, a symbol of bygone success, reemerges as a terrifying scourge. We just heard the movie did $600,000 previews.


	Lionsgate's Kerry Washington and Omar Sy action movie Shadow Force is eyeing $3M-$4M at 2,170 screens. The movie was greenlit during the Joe Drake administration at the studio. Critics aren't hot on it with 50% Rotten. Last night's previews were $200K. In Shadow Force, an estranged couple with a bounty on their heads must go on the run with their son to avoid their former employer, a unit of shadow ops that has been sent to kill them.

	











	Vertical is excited about its airplane action movie Fight or Flight, which carries a 78% fresh with both critics and audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. The Josh Hartnett-starring, James Madigan-directed pic has the best previews of anyone with $550K, and that's from last night and Monday Mystery screenings. Outlook is $2.5M. Out of the new movies tracked on PostTrak last night, Fight or Flight had the best scores with a 49% definite recommend and 3 stars. Pic's blurb: A mercenary takes on the job of tracking down a target on a plane but must protect her when they're surrounded by people trying to kill both of them.


	Briarcliff Entertainment has Juliet & Romeo at 1,350 theaters and it stars Jason Isaacs, Rupert Graves and Rebel Wilson. The Timothy Scott Bogart pop musical movie is based on William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. It's looking to do around $1M.

	With a new single racking up millions of streams, Kanye West is continuing to spread alarming antisemitic rhetoric.


	On Thursday, the 24x Grammy winner released ‘Heil Hitler' on multiple streaming platforms, many of which have since removed the track while it continues to rack up millions of streams on Elon Musk‘s X, along with the single's art, which resembles a swastika.


	As of Saturday, the song remains on the social media site while Spotify, Soundcloud and other platforms have worked to remove it.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“‘Heil Hitler' by Ye has been banned by all digital streaming platforms while ‘Rednecks' by Randy Newman remains streamable,” wrote West in a post. “They're literally keeping the n—s down.”

	











	The song has since be shared by multiple profiles on social media and music streaming sites, with self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate promoting it in a video.


	In a petition started by the Anti-Defamation League to “reinstate guidelines meant to protect users from disinformation and hate” on Facebook and Instagram, the organization wrote, “Thanks to advocates like you raising your voice, Spotify has removed Kanye's Hitler song from their platform. Now, we need your help to hold another company accountable.”


	The Yeezy mogul's X account was briefly deactivated in February after writing on the platform that he's “never apologizing for my Jewish comments,” adding in a disturbing series of posts, “I'm a Nazi. Hitler was sooooo fresh.”


	Following a similar antisemitic rant in 2022, which raised concerns for West's mental wellbeing, the artist released an apology in Hebrew the next year.


	Meanwhile, Musk's stance on free speech and censorship leave little hope for potentially regulating hate speech on the platform, after he previously ripped into advertisers who pulled out of X in 2023 over his own amplification an antisemitic post.

“The Real Housewives of New York City” has not been canceled, according to Bravo. The network officially confirmed the status of the longtime reality show amid reports that the show was going off the air.

“Nothing is official,” a Bravo spokesperson told Us Weekly in a statement on May 9. “The show hasn't been canceled.”

RHONY has been on “pause” for several months. The 15th season of the show starred Erin Lichy, Ubah Hassan, Brynn Whitfield, Jessel Taank, Sai De Silva, and Jenna Lyons, as well as newcomers Racquel Chevremont and Rebecca Minkoff.

As rumors about RHONY swirled on Friday, several franchise stars reacted. Sai De Silva posted to her Instagram story to respond to a fan who asked, “I just heard that RHONY is going off the air. Is that true?” De Silva shared a screenshot of an article addressing the cancellation report and wrote, “It's just fake news.”

Andy Cohen also posted to his story to agree with Variety editor Kate Arthur's comment that said, “Nothing has happened with RHONY that's different from before Bravo made those announcements earlier this week. Weird story!”

Earlier in the week, Bravo announced an update on several “Real Housewives” shows, confirming that the franchises set in Beverly Hills, Orange County, Potomac, and Salt Lake City would all be returning to the network. ”The Real Housewives of New York City“ and “The Real Housewives of New Jersey” were not on the list, sparking concern from fans.

Page Six then posted a report that claimed the network took RHONY off the air, with no firm plans for its return.

OG RHONY star Bethenny Frankel took the report to heart and posted a goodbye message to the beloved franchise she helped launch in 2008.

“New York City was my playground, and ‘The Real Housewives of New York City' has been canceled. It's poetic. It is bittersweet,” she said in a TikTok video on May 9. “It's the end of an era, for me personally, and for that show which was an alchemy of disaster.”

“It was a flawed group of women in a flawed city authentically being ourselves,” she said of the original cast before criticizing Bravo for the reboot of the series two seasons ago.

“The powers that be pandered to society and tried to fit 25 pounds in a five-pound bag,” Frankel said. “They cast this glossy, curated version of what they thought people wanted New York City to be,” she added of the revamped cast. “And if you try to please everybody, you please nobody.”

“Bye, New York. You will be missed,” the RHONY veteran added.

Jeff Bridges says he's doing well while in remission from his 2020 lymphoma diagnosis. “I'm feeling good … some things, it's hard to tell if it's the cancer and the COVID or if it's just old age,” he told People on May 9.

However, he told the publication that he believes COVID-19 gave him a long-lasting side effect. “I can't smell. My wife laughs at me, she says, ‘I haven't showered in days. You can't smell?' Some positive sides to it, I suppose. Although I don't mind her smell,” he said.

Bridges opened up about getting COVID in a March 2021 post on his website. “My 9×12 tumor has shrunk to a 2×2 thing. BUT … here's the deal. On January 7, I get a letter from the place where I'm getting my chemo infusion for the cancer.”

“The letter tells me I may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus [at] their joint. Soon after, my wife Sue and I share an ambulance to the ICU. We both got the ‘Roma,'” he continued.

Bridges shared that he spent five weeks in the hospital because of his compromised immune system from battling cancer but shared a positive message to fans.

“Life is brief and beautiful. Love is all around us and available [at] all times,” he wrote.

Jeff Bridges told AARP in June 2023 that he was afraid for his acting career while fighting to overcome cancer and COVID-19. 

“I didn't think I'd ever work again, really. So at first I said, ‘Well, we'll see.' But eventually that became, ‘Maybe I can.' I have to admit that I was still frightened of going back to work. Then I began to think of it as a gift being presented,” he said.

The “Crazy Heart” star added, “To get back to doing what invigorates you—it feels great, man. I'm feeling that the times are demanding us to be as creative as possible. We should all work together to make something beautiful, like we do in the movies.”

Despite being scared that his career would halt amid his illnesses, Bridges remained active in Hollywood with his FX series “The Old Man,” which premiered in 2022.

The drama follows a CIA operative named Dan Chase, played by Bridges, who goes on the lam after killing an assassin who breaks into his house. 

“The Old Man” ran for two seasons before getting canceled, but Bridges is returning to the big screen as Kevin Flynn for “Tron: Ares,” which will premiere on October 10, 2025.

“Southern Hospitality” stars Emmy Sharrett and Will Kulp are officially engaged as of May 5. People revealed on May 9 that Kulp proposed while the two were vacationing in the French Riviera.

“I love everything about Will. I love the way he loves, I love how he thinks, I love his intelligence, his family. I love how hardworking and determined he is. I love that we have the same birthday, I love the way he says my name and I love waking up next to him,” Sharrett gushed of her new fiancé.

She added, “He is my best friend and soulmate. I love that we get to spend the rest of our lives together.”

Kulp said, “I wanted everything to be perfect for Emmy. She is the most important person in my world.”

The law student contined, “Emmy has been my rock and my cheerleader for the past 4 years, and she has carried me through the challenges of law school. She is my best friend and the love of my life. She has shown me how to see the world in new ways.”

Sharrett revealed that she and Kulp were headed to dinner when he suggested taking pictures on the beach. He soon popped the question and presented her with a custom-designed emerald-cut diamond ring.

“I had a hunch it was going to happen because Will had been acting funny all day and he was abnormally concerned about our outfits,” Sharrett told People.

She shared, “I wouldn't change a thing. It was so beautiful.”

A post shared by EMMY SHARRETT (@emmysharrett)

Sharrett and Kulp's relationship came into question during “Southern Hospitality” season 3 when rumors swirled around that the hopeful lawyer had been unfaithful while in school.

The “Republic” server disputed the accusations and stood by Kulp, who also denied the rumors. “Will has 110 percent been faithful to me. I do not believe Will cheated on me at all for one second,” Sharrett insisted to Us Weekly in January. 

Sharrett also addressed how Kulp vented to their friend group about her recent fitness kick, which played out in season 3. 

“I knew about what Will had done already, and I don't think people knew I knew because I never talked to my friends about it. A lot of it is also being exaggerated, as you can imagine,” she told Us Weekly.

Despite drama with their “Southern Hospitality” friends, Sharrett and Kulp have received well wishes on their engagement. 

“If you like it, then you shoulda put a ring on it,” Michols Pena wrote on Instagram. Sharrett's good friend Maddi Reese shared, “So happy for you!!”

6.8

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

Smalltown Supersound

Reviewed:

May 10, 2025

With Kara-Lis Coverdale, every timbre tells a story. To hear the Canadian sound artist discuss her instruments is to marvel at the way technology can channel both the cultural and the personal. The pipe organ she played growing up in church is more than just shorthand for the holy; it's the original synthesizer, a tool for Coverdale to recreate voices both human and nonhuman, depending on which reed stop she uses. When she was 10, a crude boom box with an artificial bass-boost function taught her about dubbing tracks, and that remixing could be a creative act in itself. The piano's damper pedal, she has explained, freed the hand from the constraints of the keyboard and opened up a world of expression. “Anything can have a voice,” she says in the announcement for From Where You Came, her first album in eight years. “For me, voice is beyond human.”

This studied attention to detail has led to a body of work where sounds are rich with complexity, their emotions uncertain and in between. Albums like A 480 and Aftertouches flitted between fractured orchestration and uncanny-valley minimalism. The increased clarity of 2017's Grafts revealed even deeper wrinkles, delicately flowing through a weightless, unnatural calm. Since then she's mostly composed for concert halls and installations, performing in ensembles with Tim Hecker and Floating Points and collaborating with Actress and Yasuaki Shimizu. But in returning to the album format, From Where You Came shows a prettier side of Coverdale than we've seen before. The edges have been all but completely buffered down, making way for one big exhale of shimmering strings and synthesizers. It's peaceful—perhaps to a fault.

For the most part, From Where You Came floats in a comfortable daze. The synth clusters of “Flickers in the Air of Night” swell and swirl against Anne Bourne's cello, rising like steam from a hot spring. The contrast of cold and warmth is no accident. From Where You Came plays like a tribute to the cold winters and wooded lakes of her upbringing in the rural Ontario community of Valens, where family tradition paired ice-water plunges with hot saunas. Rather than diving into the subtleties of her music's textures, however, Coverdale often hovers just at the edge of them, passively observing until they dissipate into thin air.

Coverdale seems stuck between wanting to develop her tracks into full-fledged songs and making them mesmerizing enough that you surrender to the drift. “Daze,” one of the album's strongest moments, weaves its mellotron-esque melodies around each other like birds dancing through the sky, picking up heft as a bassy low end kicks in. It feels like it might be going somewhere epic, but ultimately ends up noodling about for the song's remaining minutes; repetition pushes past meditation and into lethargy. The seven-minute cruiser “Freedom” sets up potentially interesting contrasts as horns billow against a buzzing sound like digital cicadas, but by the end it doesn't reveal much beyond a glazed sense of cheeriness. Less than two minutes long, “Coming Around” fits more ideas into a much shorter span, growing from a downtrodden murmur of keys into an aching melody that suggests sprites warbling up at the stars.

There are occasional breaks from the whimsy: On “Offload Flip,” Coverdale deploys a distended drum loop as if she were reversing a record scratch in slow motion, while “Problem of No Name” fully gives into the void, her pitch-shifted tones twinkling like the lights of a small town flashing on a darkened hillside. At its best, From Where You Came makes for some high-grade sleep music—which is both pleasant and a little disappointing, coming from an artist as distinctive as Coverdale. There's less nuance than in her previous work, and the simplified sounds and feelings imbue the music with a precious, new-agey sense of contentment. Anything can have a voice, yet when she opens the album with her own, dolefully chanting, “Everything you know is real/I'm sorry life is beautiful,” I wish she had let the sounds speak for themselves.

	Cheyenne Roundtree



Sean “Diddy” Combs admitted he was a “little nervous” in the run-up to his criminal trial, as the hip-hop mogul looked into the eyes of the potential jurors who will render a verdict on the sex trafficking and racketeering charges against him. 


	The Bad Boy Entertainment founder made the confession to U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian earlier this week after his team asked for a quick bathroom break during the  first day of questioning potential jurors on their backgrounds. 


	Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York have claimed that for decades, Combs used his billion-dollar empire as a criminal enterprise that included acts of arson, bribery, kidnapping and the sex trafficking of two girlfriends between 2009 and 2024. Combs has denied the accusations and pleaded not guilty to the five felony charges against him. 


	Combs has forged ahead with a speedy trial, rejecting a plea deal from prosecutors disclosed last month. He's beefed up his already stacked criminal defense team, adding three more attorneys to his all-star roster, including Young Thug's attorney Brian Steel, who helped secure the Atlanta rapper a favorable deal in a separate RICO case last October. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Detained without bail since his September arrest, Combs has undergone a drastic change in appearance. The 55-year-old's hair is completely grey and he sports a matching goatee. Instead of his usually perfectly-tailored power suits, imposing dark sunglasses and heavy diamond accessories, Combs only has access to five button-down shirts, five pants, five sweaters, and two laceless dress shoes. Standing up in court, Combs' slacks slightly sagged because he's unable to wear a belt, as it could be used as a potential weapon. 


	But despite his initial nerves, Combs appeared to be in good spirits throughout the week. He hugged and chatted with his attorneys and waved to his self-described “godbrother,” music producer Charlucci Finney, who arrived at court wearing a “Free Puff” hoodie.

	Here are the main highlights from this week's jury selection:  


Final Jury Selection Delayed 


	After prosecutors and Combs' defense team agreed to meet Friday morning to whittle the remaining 43 jurors down to 12 jurors and six alternates, the final section was postponed until Monday morning. 

	











	Both Judge Subramanian and Combs' lawyers expressed concern that some jurors could get “cold feet” over the weekend and would ask to be excused from the high-profile celebrity case. Both sides will select the final jury members on Monday before immediately delivering opening arguments. 


	Combs was actively involved in the jury selection process, whispering and conferring with his attorneys. He shook his head in disapproval when a potential juror admitted to watching a recent documentary about him, laughed when one man admitted he'd struggle going the full trial without using marijuana, and nodded when he approved of certain people, including a 30-year-old woman who was arrested for shoplifting a wand from Harry Potter World. 


Celebrity Names 


	Usually an uneventful process, jury selection made headlines within the first few minutes of the first juror sitting down. Before potential jurors entered the courtroom, they were given a lengthy list of names, entities and places that may be mentioned in the trial. Jurors were asked to review the list in case they had a personal connection to the person, company, or venue.

	The first juror told Judge Subramanian that he recognized Michael B. Jordan and Mike Myers from the list, later clarifying he didn't know the actors personally, only that they were famous. 


	Throughout the day, jurors continually mentioned they recognized Jordan's name. Rolling Stone confirmed that Jordan will not be called as a witness in the trial. Rolling Stone also learned that Jordan and Combs' ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura spent time together in 2015 and he's referenced in Ventura's November 2023 lawsuit against Combs. 


	During a break in Combs' relationship with the R&B singer, Ventura “began a flirtatious relationship with an actor” — now revealed to be Jordan — in 2015, according to her lawsuit. When Combs found out, he allegedly “called the actor and threatened him.” 


	“The actor proceeded to call Ms. Ventura and tell her, ‘you really need to call [Mr. Combs],'” Ventura's lawsuit alleged. (A rep for Jordan declined to comment on the record. Combs previously denied accusations in Ventura's lawsuit, which was settled within a day of its filing.)


	Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Yung Miami, Destiny Child's Michelle Williams, actress Lauren London, songwriter Dallas Austin, former Bad Boy Entertainment CEO Harve Pierre, and Danity Kane's Aubrey O'Day and Dawn Richard were also mentioned, though it's unclear what role, if any, the notable names may play in the trial. (Kid Cudi, Richard and O'Day have already been tied to accusations and lawsuits involving Combs.)

	











“A Damning Piece of Evidence” 


	It was nearly impossible to find jurors who hadn't seen or read some news regarding Combs and his criminal case. Even those who said they don't typically follow celebrity news said they had been exposed to reports through a TMZ-obsessed spouse, group chats with friends, doom scrolling on social media, and “water cooler talk” among colleagues. 


	At least two potential jurors admitted they reacted on social media to memes about Combs, with one woman saying she had liked a post of a comedian joking about the dozens of bottles of  baby oil found in Combs' homes that were allegedly used during freak-offs. 


	When pressed by both prosecutors and Combs' defense team on what exactly they had heard or read about the case, many jurors said they'd seen hotel surveillance video footage of Combs attacking Ventura in 2016. One prospective juror described it as a “damning piece of evidence” before she was struck from the pool for cause. The video is expected to play a dominant role during the trial. Combs' lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said it was the “most important” piece of evidence and objected to potential jurors who had seen the video and formed a negative opinion about Combs from it. 


	Yet all jurors who will be sworn in on Monday told the court they could put everything they might have heard about the case out of mind and be unbiased as they listened to the government's evidence against Combs. 


‘Victim-3' M.I.A.


	Combs secured a last-minute win when prosecutors said they no longer planned to present certain evidence related to a woman identified as Victim-3 in the indictment. Earlier this year, Combs filed a motion to preclude some of that evidence from trial, arguing it “has no bearing on the charged offenses.” 


	It's unclear the exact scope of Victim-3's role in the case. However, she was mentioned in January's superseding indictment under the transportation to engage in prostitution charge. Prosecutors also claimed that Victim-3's experience fell under the racketeering count and that Combs allegedly coerced her into sexual acts.


	This week, prosecutors flagged to the judge that despite Victim-3 saying she would testify under her real name, they were suddenly having trouble getting in touch with the woman, as well as her lawyer. It's still unclear whether Victim-3 will testify in court. 


Judge Scolds and Cracks Jokes 












	Subramanian did his best to keep the atmosphere light, cracking jokes and riffing with potential jurors. When one juror said she was arrested for shoplifting from Harry Potter World, an amused Subramanian asked what she had taken. “A wand,” she replied.


	Subramanian took a more serious tone when he scolded Combs' defense team after prosecutors complained about comments that celebrity attorney Mark Geragos made on his podcast 2 Angry Men with TMZ's Harvey Levin. Geragos — whose daughter Teny is co-lead counsel for Combs — has not formally entered the criminal case, but is said to be advising Combs. During the podcast episode, Geragos said the prosecutorial team — six women — seemed like they were “prosecuting a cause.” 


	During a private conversation on Tuesday, Subramanian admonished Geragos, warning him against making further similar comments. “I think referring to the prosecution in this case as a ‘six-pack of white women' is outrageous,” Subramanian said, according to a transcript obtained by the New York Post. “This would not be tolerated in any court from any lawyer anywhere across the nation.”


	Subramanian warned that he'd continue to listen to the podcast in case Geragos made any other incendiary remarks, but Geragos was unbothered. “As long as you subscribe, I'm all for it,” Geragos responded. 


The Week Ahead


	Following the conclusion of jury selection first thing Monday morning, opening statements will kick off what is expected to be an intensive eight-week trial. During the first week, days will begin at 9:00 a.m. and end at 5 p.m., before being shortened to 3 p.m. in the following weeks. 


	Prosecutors have not disclosed the names of witnesses who will be testifying, but they did inform the court they were expecting to put “two short witnesses” on the stand first, with one of those witnesses described as a male escort. A third “time-sensitive” witness will follow and their testimony is expected to take up the remainder of the first week. It's unconfirmed who the third witness is, but prosecutors have built a significant portion of their case around Victim-1 a.k.a. Ventura, who is several months along in her third pregnancy.

	Ventura's bombshell sex trafficking lawsuit against Combs from November 2023 served as a roadmap for prosecutors, with many incidents alleged in her lawsuit being mirrored in the indictment. She alleged that throughout her decade-long relationship with Combs, he was controlling and physically abusive. She claimed Combs forced her to have sex with male sex workers in days-long, sexually-fuelled encounters that Combs called “freak-offs.” 

	











	Combs denied Ventura's accusations and quickly settled the lawsuit within 24 hours.

	The grizzly swung with its massive right paw. In a desperate attempt to protect his head, Jon Bentzel raised his left arm above him like a karate block and ducked, bracing for the impact of the enormous, fur-lined paw. The bear clubbed him, rattled his dome, hit his wristwatch, and then straddled him. Bentzel thought he was going to die and hoped it would be quick. The force shook him to his core.


	Bentzel had on his backpack and was lying in the fetal position, screaming bloody murder at the top of his lungs — petrified, hoping to scare it away. “The bear's claws were as long as my fingers, like looking at a catcher's mitt with claws,” Bentzel recalls. “Just this big meat hook.”


	Micah Nelson thought his friend was dying. “I'd never heard a person scream in terror like that,” he says. “I thought that was what your last scream sounded like.”


	Grizzly bears have recently been in the news as the Trump administration takes steps to dismantle the Endangered Species Act and remove the bears' habitat protections. Some politicians argue that the bear populations have recovered significantly over the past 50 years in Republican-led states like Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, where grizzlies live. Bears numbers have risen in the last 50 years from 800 to more than 2,000 but haven't recovered to historical numbers of 50,000. 

	











	As more and more people move West, more bear habitat is fragmented and lost due to humans developing on wildlands, especially outside of Glacier National Park. The Flathead County, where much of Glacier National Park is located, was one of the fastest growing counties in Montana with around 11,000 people moving here between 2020 and 2023. Tim Manley, former grizzly bear management specialist for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, says human-bear encounters have also increased as populations expand and move closer to human settlements. Bears often search for sustenance in people's yards in early spring and late fall by rummaging through garbage, chicken coops, and bird feeders. This is happening more as new residents leave out attractants because they haven't received proper education about living near bears. The expansion of human populations into the wildland-urban interface further fragments bear habitats, displacing the animals and forcing them into closer contact with humans.

	Manley goes on to say that all of this has led to a concerning increase in close encounters with grizzly bears, leading to increased bear deaths due to human actions. Hunters and anglers are increasingly opting to carry sidearms instead of bear spray, which has resulted in some bears being mistakenly shot, either because they were thought to be black bears or due to perceived threats during charging incidents. Manley thinks this is due to tradition and people trusting their guns over bear mace. “Bear spray is very effective,” he says. “We're trying to put a message to people to carry bear spray, learn how to use it, and carry it where it is accessible.” 


	Still, data indicates bear attacks remain relatively rare in North America. Despite the increase in encounters, fatal attacks occur on average only two or three times a year. When Bentzel and Nelson faced off with that bear a decade ago, they were ready for it. 


	THE DAY THEY ENCOUNTERED the grizzly, Bentzel and Nelson were on the second day of a four- to five-day peak-bagging trip in Glacier National Park. They aimed to complete the 45-mile-long Traverse, which follows the north-central Continental Divide, over 25 miles involving off-trail navigation through some of the highest grizzly bear densities in the contiguous United States.

	Bentzel had lived in Montana for over 10 years, although he grew up in York, Pennsylvania. Nelson was born in Kalispell, Montana, near Glacier National Park. Both men enjoyed weekend climbing trips. They were familiar with the outdoors, each having more than a decade of experience working on trail crews in grizzly country, where they built and maintained hiking trails for the public. Bentzel, who was 39, had summited many of the park's named peaks and had invited Nelson, then 30, to join him on the expedition that July of 2015. They packed lightly, bringing sleeping bags, small tents, and food.


	During the two previous days, they had noticed occasional bear digs and piles of bear scat, but weren't alarmed — after all, they were in northwestern Montana.


	Their goal that day was to head toward a notch between two mountains. Their first threshold was crossing a steep, snow-filled gully with a creek flowing through it. Bentzel crossed easily using his ski poles, but Nelson hesitated, struggling with his old, slick, treadless shoes. The weather turned for the worse; temperatures dropped, and winds increased. Low-hanging clouds obscured their view of the peaks they intended to climb, so they decided it wasn't ideal to get up high, though they still wanted to make progress.

	











	Next, they had to traverse a steep, snow-covered goat trail along Guardhouse Mountain's east face. One misstep could send them sliding into a waterfall, and they were uncertain about what lay on the other side. Without ice axes, they carefully kicked steps into the snow. They were relieved knowing they wouldn't have to return the same way they came.


	Dropping below the snowline, they marched through a rocky scree field an hour later into a copse of stunted conifer trees. Suddenly, two little fur balls — grizzly cubs born six months earlier — blasted out of the bush in a blur only feet away, passing them and then disappearing into the forest. “I could've reached down and touched them,” Nelson tells me.


	Bentzel and Nelson looked at each other. “Damn! Did you see that? Ah, man, where's Mom?” Bentzel asked. Sows will charge humans or other animals if they approach their cubs too closely.


	The men heard rustling in the bushes uphill to their right. Terrified, they both yelled, “Hey, bear, hey bear.”


	As they turned to investigate the noise, a large, wet, haggard grizzly, dark brown with cinnamon streaks, charged toward them from 50 feet away. Its ears were erect and pointed forward as it closed the distance in just two or three bounds, reaching speeds of approximately 35 miles per hour.


	They had seconds to react and zero time to think.


	The bear was inches away when Nelson fell backward, uphill. He could smell the musky, wet dog smell. The bear blew right past him in a straight line toward Bentzel.


	Meanwhile, Bentzel fumbled with his bear mace canister, which contains a carrier agent and a propellant that enables it to shoot 20 to 40 feet. He kept his eyes on the animal as he struggled to undo the holster attached to his pack. He was about to pull it out, but the bear came right at him when he dodged backward into a scrubby little fir, the closest thing around.


	The bear blew past him half a stride, dug its front claws in the dirt, then spun a quick 180 and lunged at Bentzel.


	After swatting him, the bear roared into his left ear and rolled him back and forth with its paws. The bruin straddled him with all four legs and thrashed Bentzel's head repeatedly before trying to roll him. Bentzel stared at his stomach and protected his organs.


	During a grizzly attack, experts like Manley suggest lying in the fetal position, covering your stomach, being quiet, and playing dead. Manley thinks it's all about knowing bear behavior and if the bear is defending something.“ If the bear was surprised, protecting cubs and guarding food then the bear is just trying to neutralize you and move on,” Manley says. If the bear is acting predatory, he recommends trying to act aggressive. The former is what the bear did with Bentzel and Nelson, otherwise they wouldn't be here to share their story. 

	











	Nelson wondered how they would get a Medevac flight out of there if Bentzel were in too bad shape to walk out. The cloud level was so low, with strong gusts of snow and rain, that a chopper couldn't land and a ground rescue might take days.


	Nelson climbed to his feet, pulled out his bear spray, and sprinted toward the bear. Distracted, the bear leapt off Bentzel and charged Nelson, getting within a foot as he sprayed it directly in the face. The audible release of the pressurized gas, followed by the burning, blinding, and gasping sensation. The bear veered off and disappeared into the greenery. But not for long.


	Nelson approached Bentzel as he staggered up, grabbed him by the shoulders, and looked square into his eyes. Trees still surrounded them. They needed to get into a clearing. They were both amazed he was alive.


	Their heads swiveled as they fretted that the momma could still be around as they left the forest and backtracked 50 yards into the scree field. With the rain pouring down, it seemed like Bentzel's hand was losing blood by the liter. He patted down his body to see if anything else was hurt, broken, or bleeding — all clear. His pack was surprisingly unscathed. They planned to bandage his hand.


	But suddenly, the bear charged back out of the trees 100 feet above. The same momma bear dropped down, darting down the hill like she would steamroll them, but she slammed the brakes and skidded in the scree within 20 feet. Then, the roughly 400-pound mother stood seven feet tall, bluff-charging by standing up and dropping down repeatedly. The bear growled, huffed and clacked her teeth — making sure her message of getting away from her cubs got across.


	They stood there holding their bear spray at the ready. Finally, after a few seconds, she gave them one last glare and bolted off.


	Bentzel now felt comfortable inspecting his hand. His brand-new red raincoat had a perfect slice in the sleeve by his wrist. His glove was soaked with blood. His adrenaline was pumping so hard he couldn't feel anything. He peeled it off and saw the bear had slashed a few-inch gash in the lower, meaty part of his hand above his wrist. Skin was peeled back, but he could still move it. No tendons or muscle damage. There were claw marks across his watch. Nelson applied gauze from his first-aid kit to stop the bleeding.


	“Well, what do we do now?” asked Nelson. “We're halfway through this trip.”

	











	“I want to get the hell out of here,” Bentzel answered.


	They decided to backtrack — it was the shortest way, and they worried Bentzel might need stitches. Nervously, they kept looking over their shoulders, hoping they weren't being tracked by other bears as they returned to the ridge silently, trying to comprehend what had just happened.


	Hours later, they reached the unnamed lake where they had stayed the night before. That evening, they illegally made a fire to get warm, dry their gear, and gorged themselves on food.


	That night was sleepless. They freaked out about attracting other predators that would be attracted to the smell of blood. Bentzel had a bloody bandage on his wrist and hand, and all night, they stirred at the slightest sounds.


	The next day was a beautiful, clear day. They were bummed they weren't still bagging peaks but relieved to be alive. They arrived home late Saturday night, and Bentzel drove to North Valley Hospital in Whitefish Monday morning. A week later, he returned to work in the backcountry.

	Ten years later, Bentzel believes, “Once, the mother knew her cubs were safe…She wouldn't shred me, but she told me, Hey, stay away from my kids.” Bentzel also believes that the weather saved him. Since leaving camp the morning before, he'd placed a Gore-Tex pack cover over his pack and had worn his climbing helmet because of falling rocks, which he kept on all day. His hood over his helmet also helped shed rain. Normally, he would attach his helmet to his pack, but he couldn't stretch his pack cover over it, so he wore it. The helmet prevented the bear from splitting his head open like a melon or tearing his face off.


	Bentzel feels fortunate it wasn't any worse and it hasn't deterred him from seeking adventure. “Mom was only doing what comes naturally by protecting her young. I hold no ill feelings towards bears. Being a dad now makes me realize that your child's safety is paramount to anything else.”

	As Republicans and Democrats prepare to face off about Medicaid cuts in next week's Energy and Commerce Committee meetings at the House of Representatives, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is vehemently speaking out against threats to Medicaid.


	“They're robbing people in order to hand it over to the rich,” the progressive New York lawmaker tells Rolling Stone. “Medicaid is one of the largest insurers in the United States of America.”


	Republicans are considering a range of proposals to slash Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income people and those with disabilities, in order to fund an extension of Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which disproportionately benefited the wealthy. Speaker Mike Johnson and House Republicans are trying to pass the bill by Memorial Day, but the Medicaid fight is a tough one for Republicans — particularly those in swing states or in red states whose constituents heavily rely on Medicaid. Nearly 82 million people rely on Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program for their health care coverage.

	











	“They're not just out here to cut health care for health care's sake, they have an assignment,” says Ocasio-Cortez. “Their assignment is to cut the taxes of their donors, and to have giveaways to Big Oil, which financed their election, Big Tech, which financed their election, Elon [Musk], [Jeff] Bezos, etc.”


	She continues, “In order to do that, you have to gut what is left of the health care and social safety net in the United States. They're doing it because they have to hand over a bag.” 


	Ocasio-Cortez referenced a Congressional Budget Office report on Wednesday that scored parts of Republicans' Medicaid plan. “They confirmed millions of Americans will be left out in the cold from their cuts on Medicaid,” she says.


	The House's Energy and Commerce Committee plans to meet early next week to mark up its reconciliation bill, which has yet to be formally introduced. Republicans have committed to cutting $880 billion in spending under the committee's purview; it would be impossible to do that without significantly slashing Medicaid.

	One of the ways Republicans are considering cutting Medicaid spending is to add work requirements to the program, which Rep. Ocasio-Cortez is against, because it adds burdensome paperwork demands that could lead to eligible beneficiaries losing their insurance for administrative reasons.

	











	Medicaid has strict income caps, so adding work requirements could also force people to perform low-wage jobs in order to maintain their health insurance coverage. 


	The majority of people covered under Medicaid are already working, according to a KFF report studying Medicaid enrollees which also found that many of those not working couldn't because of caregiving responsibilities, illness or disability. If the federal government enacted work requirements, a 2023 CBO report found that about 600,000 people would lose coverage, but the policy would not increase employment. During his first administration, Trump encouraged states to add work requirements to Medicaid eligibility. When Arkansas implemented the policy, it resulted in thousands losing coverage. Eventually a court struck down the policy.

	Democrats like Ocasio-Cortez argue that the administrative burden and red tape of work requirements would result in a huge loss of coverage for Americans. Critics of Medicaid cuts are also extremely concerned about how it would affect rural hospitals and other providers whose patients rely on Medicaid, arguing it would destabilize health care for communities beyond those who have Medicaid as their health insurance. 


	The committee markup is expected to take place on Tuesday.

Review & Photography by Manny Manson for MPM

Wolverhampton is a town with steel in its soul. Built on the bones of industry and raised on the holy trinity of Sabbath, Priest, and dare I say Robert Plant, it's no surprise that one of the UK's most beloved grassroots venues—KK's Steel Mill—feels like sacred ground to rock fans. Founded by K.K. Downing of Judas Priest fame, the venue fuses raw industrial charm with modern stagecraft, a cavernous hall of metal and sweat and roar, where heritage and heaviness collide.

Tonight, a packed and expectant crowd gathered not just for a show, but for something closer to a communion. Outside, for once the rain had stayed clear and not soaked the streets of the Black Country, but inside KK's, a different kind of storm was brewing, a storm that would span eras, genres, and generations. A night that promised both spiritual incantation and fretboard fireworks. The old gods and the new.

Opening tonight's bill were Wytch Hazel, the Lancastrian quartet who've been quietly conjuring their own peculiar alchemy for over a decade. And following them, none other than the great Michael Schenker himself, here, celebrating fifty years since his UFO debut with a full-force set of classic anthems and deep cuts. It was a night of contrast, sure, but also of symmetry. Both acts deal in legacy. Both channel a higher power. Both, in their own way, worship the riff.

Wytch Hazel appeared first, robed in white, their necks adorned with crucifixes and their stage presence somewhere between medieval monks and Victorian occultists. Their aesthetic is unmistakable, deeply pagan and entirely devout. 

Formed in Lancaster by singer/guitarist Colin Hendra, Wytch Hazel have carved a unique path through the contemporary rock landscape since their debut Prelude in 2016. Drawing from the heavy blues of early Sabbath, the melodic flair of Thin Lizzy, and the stately solemnity of British folk, theirs is a sound both familiar and otherworldly. Following Prelude came II: Sojourn in 2018 and then III: Pentecost in 2020, each album deepening the band's identity, pairing scripture and solos with a sense of unflinching earnestness. This isn't tongue-in-cheek cosplay. This is sermon by Les Paul.

Their set opens with “The Fire's Control,” the blazing opener from IV: Sacrament. The riff is immediate, majestic and propulsive, with Hendra's voice ringing out like a clear bell over its churning chords. There's a purity to it all, a defiant clarity, the likes of which feels increasingly rare in a genre too often obsessed with irony. This is Wytch Hazel's great strength: they believe in their music.

“I Am Redeemed,” this one from the earlier III: Pentecost, follows with its grand marching rhythm and ringing dual leads. Hendra and second guitarist Alex Haslam (Big Al) trade licks with unhurried precision, their playing evoking Wishbone Ash and early Maiden in equal measure. Andy Shackleton on bass and Aaron Hay on drums provide the rock-solid backbone, the rhythm section understated but never lacking in drive. The crowd is attentive, absorbing it all with silent reverence.

“Still, We Fight,” a standout from II: Sojourn, ups the drama with its triumphant vocal line and rolling toms, before “Archangel,” from III: Pentecost, offers a stately, near-processional groove. This is music steeped in ancient imagery and spiritual metaphor, but it never tips into the pompous. Instead, it feels earthy. Real. Lived in. The crosses they wear aren't props. They're part of the fabric.

Then comes “Dry Bones,” another thunderous track from III: Pentecost with a swaggering bassline and one of Hendra's finest vocal performances. The lyrics draw from Ezekiel, yes, but the delivery is more NWOBHM than hymnal. And then, something new. “The Devil Is Here,” another from II: Sojourn snarls with urgency. It's heavier than earlier material, but retains that melodic backbone. Think Blue Öyster Cult by way of Lindisfarne.

Up next comes “Woven,” an upcoming cut from their soon-to-be-released album V: Lamentations (due in July), a somewhat ethereal track built on layered guitars and haunting harmonies. If Wytch Hazel's past albums conjured fields and firelight, this song feels more like stone and smoke, a deeper, darker chapter. “Elements,” another debut from the new record tonight, builds on that momentum with galloping rhythms and a surprisingly intricate solo passage.

“Spirit and Fire,” back to III: Pentecost, is all uplift and shimmer, perhaps the most overtly devotional track in the set, but its fervour feels genuine. There's nothing hollow or performative here. Wytch Hazel aren't here to convince you of anything, they're simply sharing what they feel. The closing song, “Healing Power,” is a fitting finale, and a final taste of the new album, it swells and soars with clean vocals, righteous harmonies, and a closing riff that lingers in the rafters long after the lights dim.

Wytch Hazel leave the stage not with bombast, but with quiet gratitude. They've transformed the space, opened the ceremony, lit the candles, invoked the names. And now, it's time for the fire to be passed. As the incense clears and the final chords of “Healing Power” fade into silence, the mood in KK's Steel Mill shifts. Gone is the sacred hush; now comes the charge. While Wytch Hazel offered reverence and ritual, what follows is a full-blooded rock resurrection.

Michael Schenker's “My Years with UFO” 50th Anniversary World Tour has arrived, and tonight marks the opening of its UK leg. If Wytch Hazel were the prelude, this is the main event, the celebration of a guitarist whose legacy casts a shadow over the very genre itself.

Michael Schenker's name is etched into hard rock history. Bursting onto the scene in the early '70s as a teenage prodigy with the Scorpions, he joined UFO in 1973 and, over the next five years, helped craft some of the most enduring and influential hard rock records ever made: Phenomenon (1974), Force It (1975), No Heavy Petting (1976), Lights Out (1977), and Obsession (1978). With his white Flying V and unmistakable tone, he became a cornerstone of that era, melodic, fearless, and utterly unique.

As the lights drop once again at KK's Steel Mill in Wolverhampton. An expectant hush swells through the crowd. Moments earlier, Wytch Hazel had transformed the room into a flickering cathedral of medieval power and spiritual conviction, now, anticipation turns electric. The air thickens. And then it happens: the scream of Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song crashes through the house PA like a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart. The riff alone is enough to summon goosebumps, but what it signals is even more exciting—the arrival of one of hard rock's most storied guitarists.

Michael Schenker is about to take the stage.

This is the UK opening night of his “My Years with UFO” 50th Anniversary World Tour. It's not just a gig, call it a victory lap. A retrospective journey through a back catalogue that has helped to shape hard rock and heavy metal as we know it. But unlike many legacy tours, this one feels fiery, alive, charged with intent. There's reverence, yes, but also raw energy, KK's is buzzing with it!

And then he appears, under the lights, no leather jacket, with sleeves rolled up nowadays, Flying V slung low, his white hair hidden by a sunglass laden fluffy hat and neck scarf, arms bared save for tattoos and an elbow support. Schenker walks to the front of the stage with the quiet confidence of a man who knows he changed the game and doesn't need to boast about it. The band lock in behind him and bang, they're into “Natural Thing,” the 1976 classic from No Heavy Petting. It's like a piston firing into life. The riff is greasy and nimble, the tempo urgent, the crowd immediately lit up. Schenker's fingers move across the fretboard with practiced ease, but the sound, tragically, is a little buried in the mix. The guitars are underpowered, hidden beneath a punchy, slightly over-forward rhythm section. The low-end is too prominent, and for an artist like Schenker, whose career has been built on lyrical solos and biting melodic phrasing, it's a frustrating mix.

But it's not enough to derail the energy. “Only You Can Rock Me,” from 1978's Obsession, rolls in next, and the band begins to settle. By the time they hit “Hot and Ready,” also from Obsession, the opening track on side B, the rhythm section has found a groove and the crowd is fully invested. There's a communal joy rippling through the venue, everyone knows the words, everyone is here for this celebration.

The band Schenker has assembled for this run is solid and well-drilled. On vocals is Swedish singer Erik Grönwall, stepping into the shoes of Phil Mogg, no small task. Grönwall, best known for his work with H.E.A.T. and a short stint with Skid Row, brings a bright, soaring voice and an energetic stage presence. He's not trying to mimic Mogg, but instead sings the songs with his own flair, hitting the high notes with power, if not always with perfect clarity. Sadly, his vocals too suffer from the muddiness of the mix, a sentiment echoed by many in the venue on the night. He has the pipes, without doubt, but they often fight for airspace against the booming bass and drums.

Still, his energy is infectious, and when the band kicks into “Doctor Doctor” from 1974's Phenomenon, the room erupts. This is the big one, the anthem, the moment everyone's been waiting for. Voices rise in unison, arms go up, and Schenker finally starts to emerge from the murk with a blistering solo that reminds us why he's worshipped by guitarists across genres. It's not just fast—it's articulate, measured, emotional. Schenker was only 18 when he penned this classic UFO track, it was their first to enter the top 40, back when we had an eclectic ‘POP CHART'.

The night is structured around the classic UFO era, pulling heavily from the seminal records: Phenomenon (1974), Force It (1975), No Heavy Petting (1976), Lights Out (1977), and Obsession (1978). From “Mother Mary” and “I'm a Loser” to “This Kid's” and “Lights Out,” each song arrived like a call to arms, an explosion of tightly coiled, melodic hard rock that has aged with incredible grace. The twin leads and punchy arrangements still sound vital, relevant, even revolutionary.

The rhythm section keeps things driving. Barend Courbois (Blind Guardian, Tank) handles the bass with muscular precision, his tone booming through the mix, perhaps too much at times; especially over of stage right, but giving each track a thunderous low-end that ensures nothing sounds too flat. On drums, Bodo Schopf (also of the Michael Schenker Group) is a machine, as ever he is tight, powerful, playing with both restraint and muscle. Guitarist and keyboardist Steve Mann, a Schenker mainstay, fills in the cracks with deft rhythm playing and tasteful keys, providing atmosphere without cluttering the sound.

Then, something beautiful happens. The band downshifts into “Lipstick Traces,” a haunting acoustic instrumental from Phenomenon. It's a brief, reflective pause in the set, a chance for Schenker to show his more lyrical side. He segues straight into “Between the Walls,” a deep cut from 1975's Force It, where it's segued with the previously played, “This Kids” tonight the pairing works brilliantly. The acoustic to electric transition is seamless, and for the first time all night, the venue falls into a hush. The crowd watches, listens, breathes with the music. It's intimate, powerful, and a stark reminder that Schenker's mastery lies not just in shredding but in soul.

That emotion is pushed even further with “Love to Love,” one of the night's true highlights. Originally from 1977's Lights Out, the track builds slowly, patiently, with Mann's keys laying a lush backdrop for Grönwall's vocal, which here finds space to shine. When Schenker's lead finally arrives, it's nothing short of stunning, achingly melodic, restrained, and full of character. It's the kind of playing that transcends technique. You feel it in your chest, and through the hairs on the back of your neck.

From there, it's full throttle to the finish. “Let It Roll”, from 1975's Force It, brings back the chugging swagger, while “Can You Roll Her” from 1976's No Heavy Petting and “Reasons Love” dig deeper into the catalogue. There's no filler here, just a barrage of stone-cold classic tracks played with fire, shot, straight from the hip.

Then comes the set closer, “Rock Bottom.” The masterpiece from 1974's Phenomenon. The epic. The one every guitarist in the crowd has been waiting for. Even with the low guitar mix, it's immense. The main riff lands like an earthquake, and the solo that follows is a journey in and of itself, building, tumbling, ascending. Schenker is fully in command now, his fingers dancing, not fighting. This is what he does best: take a crowd to another plane without a word. The ovation is long and loud, a perfect way to end a set…

However, they don't leave the stage, Schenker grins and taking the mic, simply asks, “Do you want two more?” The crowd roars. Of course they do.

“Shoot Shoot” (Force It) is all bite and swagger, one last blast of the full-throttle UFO sound. And then, fittingly, the closer: “Too Hot to Handle” from the incredible 1977 album Lights Out. Schenker dedicates this final song of the night to Phil Mogg and the late, great Pete Way. There's a real tenderness in the tribute, Schenker doesn't say much, but his eyes and the music do. It's a reminder that this tour isn't just a showcase of great songs. It's a eulogy of sorts. A love letter. A celebration of the people who made those songs what they were, and the fans who have kept them alive for five decades.

And as the final note fades, and the lights slowly come up, you can see it on people's faces: they've just seen a living legend, not going through the motions, but still delivering the goods.

Was the sound perfect? No. The guitar, criminally, was often too far back in the mix. Erik Grönwall's vocals deserved more clarity, more spotlight. And yet, despite those technical flaws, the show shone. Because what mattered was there: the songs, the emotion, the connection.

The legend that is Michael Schenker is not simply a virtuoso. He's a survivor. A craftsman. A visionary who chose melody over machismo, who walked away from commercial success more than once to follow his own compass, fought demons at every turn, but brushed them away. And tonight, standing before a crowd of believers at KK's Steel Mill, he reminded us why that matters.

There may be younger bands, louder bands, faster bands. But few can claim a catalogue like Schenker's. Fewer still can step onto a stage 50 years in and play with such passion and purpose.

Tonight was more than a greatest hits package; it was a sonic masterclass. A moment. And for those who were there, it'll echo in their heads and hearts for a long time to come.

“The Conjuring: Last Rites” is marketed as the final entry in its universe, but I wouldn't bet on that. Given that the movie closely draws from one of the most infamous case files of the Warrens, the world's foremost paranormal investigators, researchers, and demonologists before the rise of today's modern “ghost hunters,” who primarily film content for reality series programs on television and/or YouTube channels, with little genuine thought for helping victims of hauntings, possessions, and paranormal attacks. 

Honestly, what kind of disrespectful YouTuber or streamer would intentionally rile up spirits, insult them, and do everything in their minuscule brainpower to gather evidence of a haunting, a possession, or even demonic activity? All for the sake of gaining subscribers, views, likes, and so on. Then, after collecting enough video and audio evidence, they suddenly leave the family, the poor victims, and those seeking help to deal with the more active, angry, and increased paranormal activity because of their careless actions, meant only to serve their cause without realizing the dangerous long-term consequences of it.  

Respect the dead, but more so, respect the living. It is common sense. 

Seriously, these are some real a*******! The Warrens were never like that, and that is why The Conjuring films are also necessary to expose all these shady individuals with cameras because even when Ed and Lorraine Warren would gather video and audio evidence and used the existing handheld cameras at the time, they only did these things for documentation and not to brag about it, show it to the world, and upload it online. At the other end of the spectrum, the Warrens were authentic in their cause, and they did their jobs, which they viewed as a calling in life, to the fullest they could. Obviously, without the Warrens, The Conjuring Universe would not have existed because these movies are based on their lives. 

The Warrens dedicated practically their entire lives to helping people with the paranormal until the very end. It was only through The Conjuring Universe that the world got to see this dedication displayed by Ed and Lorraine Warren. That is why I believe The Conjuring Universe has not only expanded but endured for so long. Its basis in the real-life investigations (case files) of the Warrens over many decades means the producers and movie studios have countless case files to choose from and, of course, to give them the movie treatment they deserve. 

Another reason The Conjuring films resonate with audiences is the actors themselves, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who portray Ed and Lorraine Warren. They convincingly embody their real-life counterparts, showing a genuine desire to free families from their demonic hauntings, possessions, and poltergeist activity at home. Much credit goes to The Conjuring Universe for helping realign the direction of horror toward more refined, sanitized, and tasteful reenactments of real-life cases representing the genre. 

All the families depicted in the film entries from The Conjuring Universe are the types of people you can empathize with, and when combined with the eloquent, believable, and down-to-earth performances displayed by Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren and Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren, you have all the right casting choices to portray the world's most famous paranormal couple, who save lives from the unholy. 

None of The Conjuring films resort to blatant, tasteless horror full of blood splatter, dead bodies, and frights for the sake of scaring; they prioritize storytelling first, followed by horror tropes. One can observe that after the first Conjuring and in between the sequels and spinoffs, many filmmakers in the horror genre consciously made an effort to pattern themselves to, improve on their work, or at least acknowledge that they could do better, thanks to the bar raised by The Conjuring Universe. 

Before The Conjuring Universe started, it felt like everything that could have been done to the genre was accomplished, but who knew that all it took was to take a few steps back and reassess everything to find out that all that was needed was to return to more traditional, tried-and-true, classic filmmaking methods? Yes, you can make it as scary as you want, but you need a solid backbone of storytelling to draw in moviegoers and make them invested. Or else they are wasting their money purchasing tickets to watch a two-hour movie with only a handful of solid jump scares, scream-out-loud moments, and frights, but empty, aimless, soulless storytelling as the downside, which is the all too common case before The first Conjuring movie came out. 

In “The Conjuring: Last Rites,” the haunting is set in the mid-'80s, during which some of the most infamous, dangerous, and talked-about hauntings in history happened to be from that decade. At this stage of their professional lives, the Warrens are older but still willing to help as always, because that is one of their mantras in this vocation, which has become a driving force for them to continue doing what they do. To endanger their lives (mind, body, and spirit) again to save another family tormented by demonic spirits is not only a risk for them but also a service for the greater good in banishing evil from those affected by it. 

On a little side note, I have seen all the existing interviews, reports, and documentaries I could find about Ed and Lorraine Warren, and besides being very in-depth on what they do and their real-life cases, one thing stood out, and that is they discussed several times that there were many times that they did not think they would be able to get out of it alive, but they still went for it. That speaks to their fearlessness about this. I have nothing but respect and admiration for the Warrens, as millions of other people do, and it is a wonderful gesture to them that another movie has been made to further chronicle their lives as the world's foremost paranormal investigators, researchers, and demonologists.  

Indeed, they may be gone and reunited with God, but their heroic, selfless, and legendary acts are being remembered through movies because, whether they are entirely based on, loosely based, or exaggerated, the whole point here is that they are still derived from their lives. 

Which leads me to this: for an official teaser trailer, that felt like a full-length one because it was packed; it had a lot of meat to it, and it is probably the best one I have ever seen from them. So, if the “The Conjuring: Last Rites” teaser was this terrifying, suspenseful, and thrilling, then can you imagine what the actual full-length movie will be like? This is going to be one scary good time for moviegoers and will most likely fittingly end The Conjuring Universe on the most emphatic, impactful, and resounding note possible for all the fans all over the world that this horror franchise has amassed over the decades.

ForumDaily New York

At a Congressional hearing on UFOs on May 2, leading scientists and Pentagon insiders claimed that the U.S. government is hiding evidence of alien life. Daily Mail tells about secret CIA documents. These documents prove contact with extraterrestrial beings.

Officials continue to deny encounters with mysterious phenomena. But a newly discovered Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) document proves the government may have identified extraterrestrials creatures decades ago.

In the 1970s and 1980s, the CIA conducted experiments with people who claimed to be able to perceive information about distant objects, events, or people. This process is known as “remote viewing.”

One such report, titled Description of Personnel Associated 'ET' Bases, detailed a session in which a remote viewer was given unknown targets and asked to describe what he saw.

The document describes alleged alien bases located in Alaska, South America or Africa, as well as on Titan, Saturn's largest moon.

On the subject: UFO in New York: where the state has the highest chance of meeting aliens

""We have encountered three types of entities so far, associated with bases in various locations within the solar system,"" the subject wrote.

The remote viewer reported seeing “entities” on the objects. One had a “very large, round head” and was “very inhuman in appearance.” Another was described as “very pale” with a “pointy nose.”

But the Titan base apparently had human scientists working there, including an ""attractive woman.""

The remote viewing session was part of the CIA's top-secret STARGATE program, which recruited people believed to have psychic abilities for military and intelligence purposes during the Cold War.

The program began in the early 1970s and was officially closed in 1995 after it was deemed scientifically unreliable and operationally ineffective for intelligence gathering.

The report on extraterrestrial bases was prepared in 1987 and declassified in 2000.

During a remote viewing session, participants typically drew what they ""saw"" and took brief notes about their perceptions.

The 12-page document includes several drawings believed to depict the locations of these alien bases - one of which resembles a rocky mountain.

This drawing has been interpreted as Mount Hayes in Alaska, which is approximately 2,5 meters high.

Numerous witnesses have long reported seeing flying saucers, strange lights and other unexplained phenomena in the Mount Hayes area.

While the remote viewer did not describe the base itself in detail, he claimed to have seen ""two types of entities associated with the place.""

He said there were two beings standing outside one of the bases, ""performing some routine task."" According to the session recordings, one of them was sitting at a round console with a round, screen-like object.

The second figure was performing a different task in the background.

""The being at the controls had a human form, but it had no distinct features,"" the remote observer shared.

The creature, he said, seemed to acknowledge their presence and invited them to watch it work.

At Titan Base, a remote viewer did not report seeing any alien life, but described the place as apparently staffed by people who were ""indistinguishable from native earthlings.""

He noticed two male technicians sitting at a control panel and a woman with brown hair, wearing a pale green lab coat, standing behind them as an observer.

The final location was described as being somewhere south of the equator, although the remote observer was unable to determine whether it was in South America or Africa.

Although the sketch said ""South America,"" the landscape reportedly resembled Europe. At this base, the observer said he saw two beings.

""The first had a very large, round head on a thin neck... Very inhuman in appearance... Almost robotic... Humanity is unable to make contact with this creature,"" the report notes.

The second creature looked more human, although it had no hair and no clear facial features.

""The creature seemed friendly enough and seemed aware of my presence,"" the remote observer wrote.

The CIA ran several secret remote viewing programs during the Cold War. The agency used people with supposed psychic abilities to assist in a number of intelligence operations. Psychics were used to track kidnapped hostages held by terrorist groups. Their abilities were used to locate fugitives in the United States.

One such program, known as Sun Streak, even tasked a remote viewer with finding the Ark of the Covenant, which he claimed was hidden somewhere in the Middle East.

Another high-profile session involved renowned telepathic clairvoyant and intelligence agent Joe McMoneagle, dubbed ""Remote Viewer No. 1."" The CIA reportedly gave him coordinates and asked him to describe what he saw.

Speaking on American Alchemy in March, McMonigle said he had visualized a giant pyramid on Mars. It was larger than Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza. He called the pyramid a ""monster room.""

“I started getting images of people trapped in a place where the atmosphere was getting worse,” McMonigle recalled. “It was obvious that these people were dying for some reason, but they were people, but twice our size.”

It was later discovered that the coordinates he was given corresponded to Mars, 1 BC, as written on the white card handed to him during the session.

Padakkalam Movie ReviewCast: Sandeep Pradeep, Suraj Venjaramoodu, SharafudheenDirector: Manu SwarajStars: ★★Whenever a movie is set on a college campus with a group of friends and some professors as the key players, you can expect that there will be a lot of laughs, some action and perhaps, mystery as well. Padakkalam, helmed by debutant director Manu Swaraj, aims to be just that except that it is meshed with a supernatural element, a la Indiana Jones and the desi ‘parakaya pravesha' (body swapping).        Padakkalam movie review: Despite engaging performances, particularly from Suraj Venjaramoodu and Sharafudheen, the film's weak writing and underdeveloped female characters hinder its overall impact.  

Whenever a movie is set on a college campus with a group of friends and some professors as the key players, you can expect that there will be a lot of laughs, some action and perhaps, mystery as well. Padakkalam, helmed by debutant director Manu Swaraj, aims to be just that except that it is meshed with a supernatural element, a la Indiana Jones and the desi ‘parakaya pravesha' (body swapping).

Jithin (Sandeep Pradeep) is in love with his engineering college classmate Jeevika (Niranjana Anoop) but she suddenly decides to break up with him citing personal differences. While a heartbroken Jithin is trying to brainstorm with his friends - Ramzad (Arun Pradeep), Kannan (Saaf) and Nakul (Arun Ajikumar) - on what do, a college strike is on with Jithin's department demanding that their HOD be replaced as he got the job with fake documents.

Now, senior professor Shaji (Suraj Venjaramoodu) is eyeing the post as is a younger, student-friendly Renjith (Sharafudheen). Shaji gets elevated as HOD naturally as he is senior but Jithin and his friends discover something is amiss when Shaji starts behaving strangely and their suspicion falls on Renjith. They believe that Renjith has used some supernatural power and/or black magic to control Shaji and start to investigate this. They shockingly discover that he can control people through some means and are worried what his main objective is. And they get into a major issue. What has gone wrong? What does Renjith do? How does this situation get resolved?

What works and what doesn'tWhile the premise of the story - the supernatural and body swapping element - is interesting, the entire aspect of setting it in a college and using it in the context of a professor who eyes an HOD chair is extremely flimsy. The story is weak from the beginning and while the four students, Suraj Venjaramoodu and Sharafudheen have been used to elicit laughs using situations, mannerisms and dialogues, it's only partly effective. It is the performances of Suraj Venjaramoodu and Sharafudheen (especially after the body swap occurs) that stand out and it is thanks to them that the movie keeps the audiences engaged for the most part. However, this is just not enough to make the movie totally fun ride. The female characters in the movie - Jeevika and Shaji's wife (Pooja Mohanraj) - hardly have no major role to play and that's unfortunate. On the whole, Padakkalam is a decent attempt by director Manu Swaraj to give the audiences a clean campus supernatural fantasy comedy but it is the poor writing that lets down the film.

Yellowjackets season 3 ended by sharing answers about Pit Girl and hinting that if the show gets renewed for season 4, adult Shauna Sadecki (Melanie Lynskey) will be front and center. Ever since the Showtime drama premiered in November 2021, fans have been captivated by the dark story of a teenage girls soccer team who get lost in the Canadian woods. The characters experience terrible horrors and do things they never imagined they would, and as their dynamic shifts, they constantly turn on each other. 

The bleak and violent series has talented cast members and fans get to know two versions of each character: adolescent and adult. Yellowjackets has always excelled at sharing a few different mysteries in each season, but if Yellowjackets season 4 happens, some fans think that one big question can remain unanswered. 

Dexter: Resurrection's teaser is reminiscent of the early days of the original series, and that bodes well for the future. 

As soon as the girls' soccer team ends up stranded in the Canadian woods, there appears to be a strange and unsettling presence. Teenage Lottie Matthews (Courtney Eaton) thinks The Wilderness, as the girls call it, is real, and she's stubborn and unwilling to listen to any rational discussions. From Lottie chanting in French to all the times she calls The Wilderness ""It,"" these are some of the darkest and most haunting moments from Yellowjackets. The most unforgettable and well-crafted episodes of the Showtime series find the teenagers unable to discern visions from reality, and that's definitely compelling. 

But while fans have wondered since the pilot episode if there really are supernatural elements, many viewers think Yellowjackets season 4 will continue to feature these scary moments without giving a rational explanation. Redditor @Dear-Potential-4682 wrote in a Reddit thread:

""Have a feeling we may never know for sure what is supernatural and isn't? Idk, feel like the show may end this way…""

Redditor @zavant5303 replied:

""They'll never say if it was supernatural or not. And I like that.""

In another thread, Redditor @hauntingvacay96 wrote, ""I hope and think it will stay ambiguous."" The fan explained that this allows the show to ask questions about the ""morality"" of the characters' actions. This is a great point, and the show would arguably suffer if fans were given a yes or no answer about whether these forces are real. In contrast to fast-paced procedurals like The Rookie, Yellowjackets doesn't need to wrap up certain plotlines. 

Like the best TV dramas that have been released in the past few decades, Yellowjackets features tough characters who don't fit into easy categories or boxes. While most of the characters are harsh, cruel, and violent, they each have sympathetic moments, and viewers get to know their inner lives. For some, asking if the supernatural parts are real is the wrong question. The theme of the series is, can someone ever get over major trauma, and is it possible to move forward and forget the past? It's also fascinating to watch the adult timeline and see how the characters, who have been through similar terrible experiences and done horrible things, split up and come together. 

Yellowjackets benefits from the long-form storytelling of television and doesn't need to give easy answers like the satisfying end of a horror movie. While a film feels incomplete without sharing that a killer wanted revenge or a ghost had unfinished business, a TV series can keep some storylines vague, and the story still feels powerful and meaningful. 

If fans have thought long and hard about whether there is a ghost or supernatural force in the woods, the actors on the Showtime drama have done the same. In an interview with Variety in May 2023, Simone Kessell, who plays adult Lottie Matthews, answered a question about the paranormal aspects of the series. Kessell said: 

""I agree with you, because I don't think it's a supernatural thing either. I don't think Lottie's working in another realm — maybe young Lottie is. I think these are all mechanisms they've put in place to survive.""

Kessell touched on the trauma that the girls have been through and added:

""I think it's their karma catching up. I think they're so warped from what has happened.""

While there are many shows like Yellowjackets and several great coming-of-age dramas, the unique nature of the Showtime drama keeps fans coming back and also makes them hopeful for a fourth season renewal. The two different timelines, the captivating setting of the wilderness, and the mysteries like the Antler Queen and the Pit Girl set the series apart from lesser-quality shows about teenagers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Psychic","Johnny Carson Exposed and Embarrassed a Famous ‘Psychic' on National TV","https://www.cracked.com/article_46523_johnny-carson-exposed-and-embarrassed-a-famous-psychic-on-national-tv.html","Sat, 10 May 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

Before Johnny Carson was a comedian, he was The Great Carsoni, the 14-year-old magician who entertained youthful audiences in Nebraska for $3 a show. While he ultimately took a different route into show business, he maintained a lifelong interest in magic and how illusionists performed their tricks.

But there was a big difference between magicians and so-called psychics, a new breed of entertainer becoming popular in the 1970s. In Carson's opinion, many of those so-called clairvoyants were simply recreating magicians' tricks. Instead of presenting the craft as an artful illusion, psychics were claiming actual superhuman abilities and charging big money for their services. 

Uri Geller, an Israeli-British personality, was Exhibit A. In the 1970s, Geller became a popular talk-show guest who'd perform demonstrations of what he claimed to be psychokinesis, dowsing and telepathy. His biggest trick, which he called “the Geller effect,” was his ability to bend metal objects, like spoons, with his mind.

Carson was willing to have Geller as a guest, but if he claimed to be truly psychic, he should pass an actual test of his abilities. Carson enlisted the help of the Amazing Randi, another illusionist who had developed a side hustle exposing frauds who claimed to have supernatural powers. (Randi would make debunking Geller's abilities a second job for years.)

Geller and his team provided The Tonight Show with a set of props for the appearance, in which he'd use the eerie power of his mind to buckle spoons and perform other amazing feats. Rightly suspecting that the real power lay in the trick props, Carson enlisted Randi to provide an alternate set of materials. Geller wasn't allowed anywhere near the new props until he sat next to Carson on live television. 

What followed was 20 of the cringiest minutes in late-night history. The look on Geller's face when he saw the replacement spoons gave it away — he was about to be exposed as a fraud. “This scares me,” he admitted, pointing to the tray of objects he knew he couldn't move with his mind. He offered up stalls, rationalizations and alibis, claiming that the mood wasn't right, that “I don't feel strong” or that Carson was pressing him too hard. 

The New York Times Magazine called the Tonight Show segment “a legendary immolation, in which Geller offered up flustered excuses to his host as his abilities failed him again and again.”

Geller knew the gig was up. “I sat there for 22 minutes, humiliated,” he said. “I went back to my hotel, devastated. I was about to pack up the next day and go back to Tel Aviv. I thought, ‘That's it — I'm destroyed.'”

But a funny thing happened after Geller's Tonight Show appearance. His failure made such a splash that he was immediately booked on Merv Griffin and other talk shows. People who wanted to believe in paranormal phenomena talked themselves into Geller's failure as proof that he was psychic. If it were all a trick, they reasoned, Geller would have just done it. Defeat somehow made him more legitimate than ever.

Ironically, he said, “That Johnny Carson show made Uri Geller.”","{'href': 'https://www.cracked.com', 'title': 'Cracked.com'}","other"

This weird blue-faced, red-eyed bird smells so bad predators won't eat it. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Name: Hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin)

Where it lives: Amazon and Orinoco river basins in South America

What it eats: Leaves, fruits and flowers

Why it's awesome: The hoatzin is often regarded as one of the world's strangest birds. Hatchlings are born with clawed wings — a rare, prehistoric trait — and adults give off a strong, unpleasant smell due to their cow-like, fermenting digestive system, earning them the nickname ""stinkbird.""

Hoatzin have some pretty weird traits, with mohican crests, blue facial skin, red eyes and large, fan-shaped tails, which they used to maintain balance while navigating dense vegetation.

But these tropical birds are most notable for their pungent odor, which is commonly compared to manure or rotting vegetation. This unpleasant smell is the result of a highly unusual digestive process that sets them apart from almost every other bird species.

Unlike most birds, the hoatzin has a foregut fermentation system, similar to the one found in cows. It primarily feeds on leaves, which it stores and ferments in a large, chambered crop — a temporary food storage pouch located in the esophagus. Then, the food is passed to the stomach for fermentation, where bacteria break down the tough plant material, releasing gases via burps that produce the bird's distinctive manure-like odor.

This digestive process is highly efficient for breaking down the high levels of cellulose found in leaves. But, it makes the hoatzin both smelly and clumsy, as its enlarged gut makes it difficult to fly. However, the hoatzin's unusual smell acts as a natural defence mechanism, as predators tend to avoid the bird because they think it is rotten or poisonous.

Researchers are uncertain about the evolution of hoatzins. In 2015, a genetic study in the journal Nature suggested that the hoatzin is the last surviving member of a bird line that branched off the evolutionary tree in its own direction 64 million years ago, shortly after the extinction event that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs.

—Aldabra rail: The bird that came back from the dead by evolving twice

—Shoebill: The human-sized African bird that eats baby crocodiles and kills its siblings

—Eleonora's falcon: The raptor that imprisons birds live by stripping their feathers and stuffing them in rocks

However, a separate 2024 study in PNAS suggested that hoatzins are not as ancient as previously thought. Although the wing claws of juveniles seem prehistoric, they may have evolved more recently to help these birds survive in the Amazon jungle. As young hoatzins can't fly, their claws allow them to climb trees to escape predators.

In 2024, biologists analyzed and mapped the genomes of more than 360 bird species to create a family tree of major bird groups, but where hoatzin fit into the picture is unclear. The researchers added hoatzins to a category called ""orphans"" along with shorebirds and cranes — because it's unclear where hoatzins sit within the avian family tree.

This bird is also the national bird of Guyana, where the local name for this bird is Canje pheasant.

MOSCOW, May 10. /TASS/. The positions of Russia and Zimbabwe on most topical international issues are very close, President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting with Zimbabwean leader Emmerson Mnangagwa.

""Russia and Zimbabwe take common or very close positions on most topical issues on the international agenda. We seek a just, multipolar world order based on the rule of international law,"" the Russian head of state said.

Putin noted that Russia appreciates the Zimbabwean leader's support for Russian initiatives at the UN and on other multilateral platforms.

""Of course, Russia attaches special importance to the comprehensive strengthening of relations with the countries of the African continent,"" Putin said.

The Russian leader also recalled that the first conference of the Russia-Africa Partnership Forum at the level of foreign ministers was held in Sochi last November.

Hours after the announcement of a ceasefire agreement, explosions were heard in Srinagar. Both India and Pakistan had earlier confirmed the truce. DW has more. 

Welcome to DW's live coverage of developments from India and Pakistan on Saturday, May 10:

While there have been reports of drone attacks in Kashmir even after India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday, the fact that both sides are claiming victory could bode well, an international relations and security expert has told DW.

Speaking to DW News, Sameer Lalwani of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments said that both sides claiming a strategic win ""might not be a terrible thing.""

""The only way you can get two sides to agree to climb down from this highly militarized environment is for them to both be able to tell a story to their domestic audiences that they achieved their strategic aims and pulled one over on the other,"" Lalwani said. 

""If both sides can live with that and use information, or maybe even disinformation, to their advantage to make that happen, I think that's crisis-stabilizing,"" he added.

Lalwani also explained that continued exchanges of fire reported after the ceasefire had been agreed are to be expected.

""Sometimes this happens when you have a de-escalation. Even in 2019, during the last big crisis, while there was de-escalation in terms of the air war, there was continued artillery and exchange of fire on the Line of Control (LoC),"" he said.

India's armed forces are ""dealing with adequate and appropriate response"" to ""violations"" of the ceasefire reached earlier today, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a statement on Saturday.

""For the last few hours, there have been repeated violations of the understanding arrived at earlier this evening,"" Misri said, saying that New Delhi ""take[s] very very serious notice of these violations.""

He called upon Islamabad ""to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility.""

India's military was ""maintaining a strong vision of the situation"" and was instructed to ""deal strongly"" with the violations, he added.

Blasts were heard across the city of Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir on Saturday, just hours after India and Pakistan agreed on a ceasefire, according to Omar Abdullah, chief minister of the territory Jammu and Kashmir. 

""What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!"" he said on X.

In another post, he wrote: ""This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up.""

The Reuters news agency also reported that blasts were heard in Jammu City and projectiles were seen in the sky. The French AFP news agency reported an anonymous Indian source saying Pakistan had violated the ceasefire agreement.  

The ceasefire agreed by India and Pakistan has been welcomed by UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy.

""Today's ceasefire between India and Pakistan is hugely welcome. I urge both parties to sustain this. De-escalation is in everybody's interest,"" he posted on X.

Tensions escalated earlier this week after India launched missile strikes, targeting what it said were terrorist camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

Kashmir has been contested between Pakistan and India since 1947 and the two nuclear-armed neighbors each administer part of the region but claim ownership of all the territory.

Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said his country and Pakistan had reached an understanding and that New Delhi would maintain a firm line against terrorism.

""India and Pakistan have today worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action,"" he said in a message on the social media platform X.

""India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,"" he wrote.

India has claimed that Pakistan is supporting terrorism from across the border after a deadly attack on civilians in the Kashmir region on April 22 that killed 26 people.

Pakistan has denied any involvement and called for an independent investigation. 

India and Pakistan agreed to the ceasefire bilaterally, sources in India told DW. 

""The stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries,"" the source said, adding that there was no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.

Earlier on Saturday, US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agreement came after 48 hours of talks, with Washington's involvement.

Pakistan has fully reopened its airspace for all types of flights, the country's airports authority has said.

""All airports across the country are now available for regular flight operations,"" a statement read.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had chosen a ""path of peace"" as the two countries agreed to a ceasefire.

""Over the past 48 hours, Vice President Vance and I have engaged with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, and National Security Advisors Ajit Doval and Asim Malik. I am pleased to announce the Governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,"" Rubio posted on X.

The Indian Foreign Ministry has said Pakistan's Director General of Military Operations had called the Director General of Military Operations of India on Saturday afternoon, and it had been agreed that all sides would stop firing. 

""It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all fighting and military action on land and in the air and sea with effect of 17:00 hours Indian Standard Time today (1230 UTC/GMT),"" Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said. ""Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.""

Military officials would speak again on May 12, Misri added.

Pakistan's Foreign Ministry has confirmed the ceasefire previously announced by US President Donald Trump.

""Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,"" Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister & Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on X.

""Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!""

US President Donald Trump said on Saturday that both India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire, though neither country has confirmed the arrangement.

""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" Trump posted on social media.

Viral social media posts claim to show India's attacks on Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. But some videos are used out of context and are seemingly aimed at stoking tensions even further.

DW's fact-checking team had a look at some of the viral videos doing the rounds in the context of the escalation between India and Pakistan.

Amid heightened military tensions and ongoing cross-border shelling and drone activities between India and Pakistan escalating, the Indian government has ordered the blocking of 8,000 accounts on X and the removal of Pakistan-linked content across digital platforms. Some Indian news portals like Maktoob Media, The Kashmiriyat, and The Wire have also been impacted.

DW has more on that here.

 

When former British India gained independence and was divided into India and Pakistan in 1947, Muslim-majority Kashmir was free to choose which new country to join, or to remain independent.

The Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, a Hindu ruler of a Muslim-majority state, initially wanted independence but ultimately chose to accede to India after a Pakistani-backed tribal invasion.

A war erupted and India asked the United Nations to intervene. The UN recommended that they hold a referendum on whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However, neither country could agree on a deal to demilitarize the region ahead of such a vote.

In July 1949, as recommended by the UN, India and Pakistan agreed on a ceasefire line which eventually became the so-called Line of Control (LoC). following an agreement signed in 1972.

The region became divided into India-administered Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-administered Azad Kashmir plus Gilgit-Baltistan. Adding to the complexity, China also controls a portion (Aksai Chin).

Both India and Pakistan still claim full sovereignty over the region.

There have been sporadic conflicts between the two sides over the contested region since then, interspersed with periods of de-escalation.

But the election of the Hindu-nationalist BJP to power in India in 2014 marked a new period of tension. The BJP government responded to a major attack in 2019 by launching cross-border air strikes. Later that year, it revoked Jammu and Kashmir's autonomy, sparking increased protest within the region that was met with repression.

This was followed by a period of relative calm in which Delhi promoted a nascent tourist sector in the region that began to boom until the attack against tourists near the hotspot of Pahalgam on April 22, 2025.

The Information Minister for Pakistan-administered Kashmir said that 11 civilians were killed in overnight shelling by India near the so-called Line of Control (LoC) — the de facto border that separates the two countries in Kashmir.

""Last night, intense shelling from the Indian side took place at more than five different locations along the Line of Control. As a result, 11 people, including a child and four women, lost their lives, and 56 others were injured,"" Information Minister Mazhar Saeed Shah told the AFP news agency.
