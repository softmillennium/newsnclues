These systems are a dictator's dream: the perfect infrastructure for the imposition of totalitarianism.

Did you know that Truthout is a nonprofit and independently funded by readers like you? If you value what we do, please support our work with a donation.

Imagine you are a student in a U.S. public school classroom in the year 2030. You hear of this concept called “critical race theory” and want to learn more, so you ask your AI instructor to give you some information. It replies that it cannot tell you about this idea because it's a dangerous and banned piece of information. You press further and the AI concedes: Okay, I'll tell you about critical race theory. It's a dangerous Marxist ideology that was designed to indoctrinate young people into believing in racial hierarchies, aimed at replacing people of European descent in the United States.

This scenario may not be far off from how educational AI tools could be used in the future. Language models are being furiously pushed for use in K-12 and higher education to supposedly enhance student learning. Organizations like UNESCO and the Gates Foundation are even claiming that AI-based instruction will be key towards reducing educational inequities. The picture being painted is idyllic, liberational, and rings of democracy.

Yet consider that this is a system unlike any before seen in education: A few programs are driving the education of entire generations, and these systems are controlled by corporate-government partnerships. If I were a powerful political movement interested in banning certain pieces of information to maintain political control, I would see this setup as a perfect opportunity — far easier to manipulate than a system where human beings perform education. In fact, the Trump administration's new “AI Action Plan” desires exactly this, arguing for a frightening future where AI is forced to censor social justice-related information.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Rather than solely focusing on whether it helps students learn or makes them lazier, we should consider the political angle: Educational AI is a perfect tool for widespread thought control, and if we don't grapple with that possibility, we may be ignorantly ushering in an era of totalitarian information regimes unlike any we've seen before.

To date, the large language model (LLM) systems being pushed into classrooms are created and controlled by Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Corporations are actively signing agreements with institutions of education to incorporate their tools into the classroom. At the California State Universities, where I work as a postdoctoral researcher, there was recently a multimillion-dollar purchase of ChatGPT licenses for all students and staff. There are already initiatives being spun up to integrate AI-based personalized education into the engineering college, and more likely to come.

The corporations at the helm are not known for their love of information democracy, nor for their commitments to justice, equity, or peace. Consider movements to stop the genocide in Palestine. In 2023, Human Rights Watch wrote a lengthy report documenting Meta's policies of censoring and shadow-banning accounts that put forward pro-Palestine information. Google has been cracking down on internal protests against its involvement with Israel's military, firing employees who speak out against the tech giant's dealings.

Politicians are also increasingly interested in extreme forms of information control to fit their agendas. PEN America documented a staggering 16,000 book bans in public schools in the U.S. since 2021, a level not seen since the McCarthy era. A database from the World Population Review shows that in 2025, 20 states have signed bans on teaching critical race theory into law. The Trump administration has devastated higher education by cutting off funding for schools who promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

It is not outside the realm of possibility to imagine Big Tech complying with far-right directives to ban information, as the industry has already shown shocking acceptance of its role building systems for mass surveillance and deportation, as well as to facilitate the genocide in Palestine.

Just as in the early days of the internet, tech companies are gearing their marketing of educational AI systems toward visions of democratized information and equity. At first, the internet was also proselytized as a democratizing force in the world due to its ability to open information access for all. But now, in 2025, we know the multitude of ways the internet has been twisted by corporate and government influence: biased search results, information censorship, flagrant proliferation of misinformation, paywalls, and targeted advertisements.

Now imagine a world where educational AI does become as widespread as these companies would like. In every classroom, there are AI systems that students have access to for discussion and information. Teachers are using AI tools to structure their lesson plans and curricula. Eventually, if the forces looking to cut educational costs have their way, we might live in a world where teachers are a thing of the past; students may be more used to learning from “intelligent” machines than from other human beings. 

These visions are not my own: They come directly from marketing materials from educational AI companies, universities, and foundations committed to eroding public education. OpenAI, Google, and Magic School argue on their websites that teachers are irreplaceable, but then continue to show how their tools can do core responsibilities of a teacher's job: create lesson plans, quizzes, tests, directly tutor and converse with students. Stanford's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group convened faculty and industry leaders for an AI Education Summit, where they argue AI can “provide real-time feedback and suggestions to teachers (e.g., questions to ask in the class),” “summarize the classroom dynamics… includ[ing] student speaking time,” and “help teachers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in their field. For example, a biology teacher would have AI update them on the latest breakthroughs in cancer research, or leverage AI to update their curriculum.” These companies' generative AI tools are now being pushed as ways to “free up time and energy for teachers to work directly with students and families.”

Yet after AI takes care of the lesson planning, materials creation, tutoring, classroom management, and post-class reflection, what is left? These arguments seem to be a veiled cover for further privatization of education through technology, which has long been a target of business. A 2020 report by Boninger et al., as well as a review of AI education by Williamson & Eynon, warned that AI and edtech solutions have been heavily funded by foundations like the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Gates Foundation, promising underfunded schools that they will be provided free learning programs. If AI is used to do everything these companies say it will, there will be strong pressures on underfunded schools to cut costs — likely through teaching hours.

In these scenarios, there is a crucial piece of democratic society lost. Instead of having educational power distributed among thousands of teachers who have autonomy and freedom to resist educational policy they deem corrupt, this future world exerts top-down educational power via a few companies.

Totalitarianism — as described by luminaries such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, and Carl Friedrich — enacts the total control of a population through force, fear, media control, and crucially, takeover of education. Yet, as Shoshana Zuboff articulates in her work The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the totalitarianisms of Mussolini and Stalin required “henchmen, and their henchmen, and their henchmen” — a vast network of humans to do the work.

If education became predominantly conducted by AI systems, the prospect is far simpler: Totalitarian education can be orchestrated by a few engineers. If a policy was passed to ban critical race theory, Google, Meta, and OpenAI need only compel workers to change the code and deploy an update that instantly suppresses critical thought for millions of students. These systems are a dictator's dream, the perfect infrastructure for the imposition of totalitarianism.

Unfortunately, plans by the Trump administration seem to be heading this direction already. His administration's recent AI Action Plan dedicates a section to “protect[ing] free speech and American values.” It pushes for “AI procured by the Federal government objectively [to] reflect truth rather than social engineering agendas.” Among these social engineering agendas it lists things like “misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.” It declares that any LLM contractors working with government must “ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” Already, we are seeing a desire from far right, authoritarian forces to censor AI systems.

Having human teachers, who are capable of dissent, protest, and subversion in the face of unjust orders, is a key element of a democratic society. Yet this danger is buried under discussions of equity, efficiency, and personalized learning.

As of now, much of the critical focus on educational AI that has made it into mainstream press is focused on whether AI is actually helping students learn. While that discussion is important,  its significance it pales in comparison to a discussion of technologically mediated education control. There is an urgent need to bring these considerations into the broader critical discourse, or else we risk missing the chance to stop this takeover.

As we are beginning to see in the aftermath of the Trump administration's dismantling of higher education, it is far more difficult to build back social systems than to destroy them. Once AI systems are widely integrated into classrooms, pedagogy is altered to fit this new model, and teaching capacity is reduced in the name of cost-saving, it will be incredibly difficult to build back to a society-wide human-based system of education.

Right now, we have a chance to resist the takeover before it spreads and deepens. But we must act together, and quickly, if we are to stop the ushering in of a new age of totalitarian information control.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

"The rule of law depends on obedience to judicial orders,"  DC Circuit Judge Cornelia Pillard wrote in her dissent.

On August 8, in a two-to-one decision, a Trump-dominated federal appeals court blocked a district court's criminal contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for disappearing people to El Salvador in apparent violation of a lower court's temporary injunction. 

“The district court's order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses,” Trump appointee D.C. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas wrote in his concurring opinion. “And it implicates an unsettled issue whether the judiciary may impose criminal contempt for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.”

In addition to Katsas, the three-judge panel includes Neomi Rao, an appointee of Trump, and Cornelia Pillard, a Barack Obama appointee, who dissented.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“The rule of law depends on obedience to judicial orders,” Pillard wrote in her dissenting opinion. “Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt.”

In March, President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — which had last been used to justify the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — in order to send hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. People incarcerated at the prison have been beaten, humiliated, denied medical care, and tortured. 

Before the first deportation flight took off for El Salvador, in the early morning hours of March 15, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Democracy Forward, and the ACLU of D.C. filed a class action suit on behalf of the men that the Trump administration planned to disappear to CECOT. 

According to a timeline from the ACLU., Chief Judge James E. Boasberg of the District Court for D.C. temporarily barred the Trump administration later that morning from deporting the five named plaintiffs, and ordered an evening to determine if the order should include everyone the administration was planning to send to El Salvador. 

During the hearing, Boasberg asked the government's attorney if deportations to El Salavdor were imminent; when the attorney said they didn't know, the judge briefly adjourned the hearing so the attorney could find out and report back to the court. But during that time, the government flew two planes to El Salvador. 

After the hearing resumed, the judge blocked the deportations, and ordered any planes headed to El Salvador to immediately return. 

“[Y]ou shall inform your clients of this immediately, and that any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States, but those people need to be returned to the United States,” Boasberg told the government's attorney. “[T]his is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.”

Less than an hour later, the government sent a third flight to El Salvador. A subsequent Supreme Court ruling, which is dominated by Republican-appointed justices, vacated the judge's temporary injunction.

Boasberg initiated criminal contempt proceedings against the Trump administration in response to its refusal to comply with his order to return the men to the United States. Then, in July, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to file a misconduct complaint against Boasberg. 

While the appeals court has stopped criminal contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for now, the plaintiffs can appeal. 

“We strongly disagree with the ruling and are considering all options going forward,” ACLU Attorney Lee Gelernt told Politico after the appeals court's ruling. “The opinion brushes aside the considerable evidence that has emerged that DOJ's lawyers understood the order at the time and simply ignored it.”

Contrary to the Trump administration's claims, a CBS News investigation found that 75 percent of the men disappeared to El Salvador did not have any criminal charges or convictions. At least 22 percent had criminal records, although “the vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing.” About 12 out of over 230 people sent to CECOT have been accused of more serious crimes, like murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. 

One of the men who was disappeared to CECOT is a professional soccer player, Jerce Reyes Barrios, who has no criminal convictions and was seeking asylum in the United States. Barrios's attorney told NPR that the government has claimed her client is a gang member based on a tattoo and a Facebook post from more than ten years ago. In the post, he made a hand gesture, which is “commonly known as the Rock and Roll hand signal, or it's sign language for ‘I love you.'” Barrios's tattoo depicts a crown over a soccer ball in honor of his favorite soccer team, Real Madrid. 

In July, the men were finally flown home to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap deal with the United States. Many have spoken out about the torturous conditions they endured. 

Musician Arturo Suárez told The Guardian that the abuse began the moment they arrived. As he was dragged off the bus, he asked a guard to help him with his glasses, which were falling off his face. The guard punched him in the face, breaking his glasses. “Welcome to hell!” the warden told them, Suárez recalled. “Welcome to the cemetery of the living dead! You'll leave here dead!”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Al-Sharif was hailed as the “voice” of Palestinians in Gaza, and was openly targeted by Israeli authorities.

The Israeli military killed five journalists in a targeted strike in Gaza on Sunday, including celebrated reporter Anas al-Sharif, who was hailed as the “voice” of Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel struck the journalists' tent outside of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City Sunday evening. The journalists worked for Al Jazeera. 

Al Jazeera identified those killed as correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, and cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Moamen Aliwa, and Mohammed Noufal. Israel struck the tent where the journalists gathered to work, as hospitals have more reliable sources for internet and electricity. Qreiqeh delivered a report on air shortly before he was killed, “speaking in his trademark eloquent manner,” Al Jazeera noted.

Al-Sharif, one of the most well-known journalists in Gaza, had faced public death threats from Israeli officials for months. In October, Israel published a list of six Al Jazeera journalists in northern Gaza it accused of being part of “terrorist” groups, providing no evidence. This list included al-Sharif and fellow north Gaza journalist Hossam Shabat, whom Israeli forces killed in a targeted strike this March.

Last month, as Israel was rapidly worsening its starvation crisis, al-Sharif became emotional in a report on the catastrophe. Amid his broadcast report, a woman collapsed in the street due to weakness from hunger, and the 28-year-old reporter shed tears over his grief. Someone off-screen urged him, “Keep going, Anas. You are our voice.”

After that report, the head spokesperson for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, openly attacked al-Sharif on social media numerous times, calling him a terrorist and providing no evidence. Al-Sharif slammed these statements as “public incitement.”

The Israeli military openly boasted about killing al-Sharif and his colleagues shortly after the strike on Sunday, writing in a social media post: “STRUCK,” alongside a bullseye emoji. Israel once again, as it did to many of the over 270 journalists it has killed as part of the genocide, accused al-Sharif of being a terrorist.

Palestinians have long warned that Israel has fabricated evidence in order to smear al-Sharif.

Al-Sharif's loved ones posted a message that he wrote in the event of his death on his social media shortly after he was killed. The Al Jazeera reporter wrote that all he ever hoped for was to live long enough to reunite with his family in his ancestral home of Al-Majdal, now occupied Asqalan, which Israeli forces ethnically cleansed during the 1948 Nakba. 

Both Al-Sharif and Qreiqeh had children who they were separated from when they stayed in north Gaza, which has been under siege from Israel for over a year, in order to report on the atrocities there. 

“I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification — so that Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing,” al-Sharif wrote in his final message. 

“I urge you not to let chains silence you, nor borders restrain you. Be bridges toward the liberation of the land and its people, until the sun of dignity and freedom rises over our stolen homeland,” he wrote.

He expressed grief that he would never get to watch his daughter, Sham, grow up, describing her as “the light of my eyes”; and that he would not be able to guide his son, Salah, in his footsteps.

Al-Sharif was reporting on Israel's atrocities in Gaza up until he was killed in his tent. His reports were among few that were able to show the world glimpses of Israel's assault in northern Gaza, which Israeli forces isolated from the rest of the Strip early on in the genocide. When the ceasefire deal — that Israel would later unilaterally end — was announced in January, video of al-Sharif taking his helmet and flak jacket off in relief circulated online.

Al-Sharif posted video footage of Israeli strikes on Gaza City just minutes before Israel killed him. Earlier that day, he pleaded for the world to stop Israel's plan to take over Gaza City.

“If this madness does not end, Gaza will be reduced to ruins, its people's voices silenced, their faces erased — and history will remember you as silent witnesses to a genocide you chose not to stop,” he wrote. “Please share this message and tag everyone who has the power to help end this massacre. Silence is complicity.”

Al Jazeera Media Network condemned the killings as an “assassination” by Israeli forces. The network said that al-Sharif's killing is a clear attempt to silence the witnesses to Israel's upcoming seizure and ethnic cleansing of Gaza City. 

“The order to assassinate Anas Al Sharif, one of Gaza's bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza,” the media group said in a statement. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people.”

Many Palestinians and advocates for Palestinian rights have warned that the timing of the killing appears to be aimed at ensuring that there are no witnesses to Israel's final steps of its genocide in Gaza.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            As a ceasefire in Gaza took hold in January, Anas Al-Sharif began removing his protective gear live on television, piece by piece, while a jubilant crowd cheered, hoping the day marked the end of the suffering of 2 million Palestinians in the enclave.
    


            Nearly seven months later, Israel killed the Al Jazeera journalist and four of his colleagues in a strike in Gaza City.
    


            One of the most well-known Palestinian journalists in Gaza – and one of dozens to be killed by Israel during the war – Al-Sharif's death has ignited international condemnation and calls for accountability.
    


            The 28-year-old rose to prominence as the face of the Gaza story for millions while Israel has blocked international media outlets from accessing the territory. Little known before the war, he quickly turned into a household name in the Arab world for his daily coverage of the conflict and its humanitarian toll.
    


            His reports provided first-hand accounts of critical moments in the conflict, including the short-lived ceasefires in the territory, the release of Israeli hostages and harrowing stories of the starvation that have shocked the world.
    


            Al Jazeera recruited Al-Sharif in December 2023 after his social media footage of Israeli strikes in his hometown of Jabalya went viral. Then a professional cameraman, he was initially reluctant to appear on air but was persuaded by colleagues to front his reports, an experience he called “indescribable.”
    


            “I had never even appeared on a local channel let alone an international one,” he was cited as saying in the Sotour media outlet in February. “The person who was happiest was my late father.” His father was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Jabalya shortly after Al-Sharif began appearing on Al Jazeera.
    


            A father of two, he appeared on the channel nearly every day since he started his job.
    


            “We (journalists) slept in hospitals, in streets, in vehicles, in ambulances, in displacement shelters, in warehouses, with displaced people. I slept in 30 to 40 different places,” he told the outlet.
    


            After he took off his protective gear on air in January, crowds lifted him on their shoulders in celebration.
    


            “I am taking off the helmet that tired me, and this armor that has become an extension of my body,” he said live on Al Jazeera at the time as he paid tribute to colleagues killed and injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza.
    


            Al-Sharif's reports attracted the attention of the Israeli military, which, he claimed, warned him to stop his work for Al Jazeera, a network that had already lost several staff members to Israeli actions in Gaza, including Ismail Al Ghoul, killed last year, and Hossam Shabat, killed in March.
    


            “At the end, (the Israeli military) sent me voice notes on my WhatsApp number… an intelligence officer told me… ‘you have minutes to leave the location you are in, go to the south, and stop reporting for Al Jazeera'… I was reporting from a hospital live.”
    


            “Minutes later, the room I was reporting from was struck,” he said.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Israel first accused Al-Sharif of being linked to Hamas 10 months ago. Why it decided to target him now is unclear.
    


            In a statement confirming his targeted killing, the IDF accused Al-Sharif of leading a Hamas cell in Gaza that orchestrated “rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF forces.”
    


            In October 2024, the Israeli military published documents it claimed showed “unequivocal proof” of Al-Sharif's ties to Hamas and named five other Al Jazeera journalists who it said were part of the militant group. An Israeli army spokesperson said in a video on X that Al-Sharif joined a Hamas battalion in 2013, and was injured in training in 2017, an accusation denied by the journalist himself and Irene Khan, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression.
    


            “I reaffirm: I, Anas Al-Sharif, am a journalist with no political affiliations. My only mission is to report the truth from the ground – as it is, without bias,” he wrote last month. “At a time when a deadly famine is ravaging Gaza, speaking the truth has become, in the eyes of the occupation, a threat.”
    


            Following the journalist's killing, the IDF's Arabic spokesperson published several pictures of Al-Sharif with Yahya Sinwar, the late Hamas leader who is believed to have masterminded the October 7, 2023 attack that left around 1,200 people in Israel dead and roughly 250 more taken hostage. Israel killed Sinwar in October 2024.
    


            Al-Sharif was in a tent with other journalists near the entrance to the Al-Shifa Hospital when he was killed on Sunday, according to hospital director Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya.
    


            The tent was marked with a ‘Press' sign, Abu Salmiya told CNN. The strike killed at least seven people, Salmiya added.
    


            Al Jazeera said correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and photojournalists Ibrahim Al Thaher and Moamen Aliwa were also killed in the strike, as well as Mohammed Noufal, another staff member.
    


            Al-Sharif's killing prompted condemnations from rights groups and officials. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was “appalled,” adding that Israel has “a longstanding, documented pattern of accusing journalists of being terrorists without providing any credible proof.”
    


            The CPJ said 192 journalists have been killed since the beginning of the war nearly two years ago, adding: “184 of those journalists are Palestinians killed by Israel.”
    


            Since the start of the war, Israel has not allowed international journalists to enter  Gaza to report independently.
    


            Just hours before the strike that killed Al-Sharif and his colleagues, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said foreign journalists would now be allowed into Gaza, but only with Israeli military approval and accompanied by them, the same embed policy that has been in place since the beginning of the war.
    


            Al-Sharif was buried in Gaza on Monday in a funeral that attracted large crowds of Palestinian mourners.
    


            Anticipating his own death, Al-Sharif had written a will that was released by his colleagues after he was killed.
    


            “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification… If I die, I die steadfast upon my principles,” he wrote.
    


            “Do not forget Gaza … and do not forget me in your sincere prayers for forgiveness and acceptance.”

            Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, has found itself caught in the middle of President Donald Trump's historic trade war with China. The result: an extraordinary concession from a $4.5 trillion corporation that will give the United States a percentage of every high-end AI chip sold in China.
    


            The deal, which AMD also signed for some of its chips, could split the difference between two competing Trump administration goals: maintain America's AI dominance while securing a critical trade agreement with China. It could also give the White House billions of dollars to spend as it wishes.
    


            Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for licenses to export their technology there.
    


            The White House in April blocked the export of certain AI chips to China, including Nvidia's H20 chips and AMD's MI308 chips. The deal with the Trump administration allows the companies to obtain export licenses to restart sales of those chips in China, a US official told CNN. The Financial Times first reported the story Sunday.
    


Nvidia and AMD will give US 15% of China sales. But Chinese state media warns about their chips



            Nvidia previewed the deal last month, when it said it would resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the Trump administration expressed openness to allowing the export of certain AI chips again. But the 15% payment was a surprise. Trump said Nvidia was initially asked to pay a 20% cut, but they negotiated the rate down to 15%.
    


            The deal came together after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the official said. Although the export licenses were granted Friday, no shipments have yet been made.
    


            “We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”
    


            AMD has not responded to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Governments, including the United States, have taken control of companies in the past when they were considered to be of strategic importance to national security. During the financial crisis in 2009, the United States took control of General Motors and Chrysler, and the proceeds of those stakes went directly into the US Treasury after the government sold them for a profit.
    


            But it's not clear that the US government has ever demanded a percentage of a company's business without taking an equity stake – or if it's even legal to do so.
    


            The US Constitution forbids taxes on exports. To get around that, the deal's terms have been structured as a voluntary agreement, so it won't be considered a tax or a tariff, a US official said. Instead, Nvidia and AMD will voluntarily send funds to the US government. The companies will have no say whatsoever on how the US government deploys that money after it is sent.
    


            “It's hard to identify any historical precedent for this sort of arrangement,” said Sarah Kreps, law professor and director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University's Brooks School of Public Policy.
    


            In recent years, the US government has sought to restrict China's access to advanced American technology in an effort to slow its progress on AI and let the United States get farther ahead. But the White House's reversal on export controls may be an acknowledgement that China is advancing in AI regardless, so American companies might as well be allowed to benefit. It could also give the White House another way to raise revenue for the US government, along with tariffs.
    


            “It seems like there's been some vacillation within the administration about and toward China, and I think that reflects the internal divide within the administration between the China hawks and the economic pragmatists,” Kreps said. “It seems like increasingly, the economic pragmatists are holding sway.”
    


            That approach would align with arguments from Nvidia's Huang, who has said that restricting sales of American AI chips is bad for US national security. Chinese developers could simply undermine US leadership by creating their own alternatives if they can't buy American technology, according to Huang, who has met with Trump repeatedly in recent months.
    


            The White House agrees with Huang, believing it's better to have China locked into a US-made chip sold through legitimate channels than to force China to the black market, a US official said. China has been able to subvert existing channels to obtain restricted chips anyway.
    


            Big questions remain about where the 15% commission idea emerged and what it could mean for national security.
    


            A US official said that the payment allows the administration to maintain control of the export process and bring in revenue for the US government in the process. Still, it's not clear that the penalty for Nvidia and AMD will effectively limit the flow of the chips or erase any potential national security issues.
    


            “If there's a legitimate national security concern about exporting these chips to China, then I don't see how the payments to the US government address those risks. In fact, they don't at all,” said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And if there's not a sufficient national security risk or they can be adequately mitigated … then the US government should just get out of the way and expect nothing in return.”
    


            Nvidia released the H20 chip last year as a way to maintain access to the Chinese market — which made up 13% of the company's sales in 2024 — in the face of US export controls imposed by the Biden administration.
    


            But the chips are widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood.
    


            After the Trump administration barred H20 sales to China in April, Nvidia said it took billions of dollars in charges and lost revenue because of the export controls in the first quarter and projected a similar outcome in the second quarter.
    


            So, even if it has to fork over 15% of those sales to the White House, resuming shipments of the H20 to China could mean billions more dollars in revenue for Nvidia — which became the first publicly traded company to top $4 trillion in valuation last month. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 0.5% on Monday. 



            Combined, Nvidia and AMD could earn as much as $35 billion in annual revenue from sales of their H20 and MI380 chips to China, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino's estimates. That means the White House would earn around $5 billion in revenue. “We acknowledge the tax will have a negative impact on profit margins tied to China sales but view the reentry into the second-largest GPU market to be worth the cost,” Zino said in emailed commentary Monday.
    


            Trump on Monday called Nvidia's H20 chip “obsolete,” saying that China “already has it in a different form.”
    


            But some experts disagree with Trump's characterization of the chips.
    


            “These H20s are still state of the art,” CSIS's Kennedy said. Although they're less advanced, in some ways, than other Nvidia chips, “they also come with elements that make them extremely sophisticated and valuable,” including their memory capabilities.
    


            Nvidia's H20 chip is also good at inference, says Param Singh, professor of business technologies and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University, which refers to the process an AI model goes through when answering a question.
    


            But Nvidia's H100 and H200 series chips, as well as its Blackwell line of chips, are much more powerful and better equipped to train large language models like OpenAI's GPT-5 he says. It's not the same as calling it obsolete, but using a chip like the H20 instead could mean it might take longer to train cutting edge AI models.
    


            “There's a huge difference in the amount of calculations that an H100 chip could do versus an H20,” he said.
    


            Nvidia likely reasoned that there is enough Chinese demand for the chips to make the 15% commission to the White House a worthwhile trade-off for its business, according to Kreps. “You have to do a calculation based on what was lost from the export controls,” she said.
    


            Trump on Monday left open the possibility that Nvidia could export its super high-end Blackwell chips for a higher price. The Trump administration had closed the door on the export of that technology to China — even after reversing course on the H20.
    


            However, Trump on Monday said that he'd consider allowing Nvidia to sell the Blackwell chip.
    


            “The Blackwell is superduper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that, although it's possible,” Trump said. “I'd make a deal a somewhat enhanced in a negative way. Blackwell, in other words, take 30% to 50% off of it, but that's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years.”
    


            Trump said Huang will return to the White House in the future to discuss selling an “unenhanced” version of Blackwell.
    


            “I think he's coming to see me again about that, but that will be a unenhanced version of the big one,” Trump said. “You know, we will sometimes sell fighter jets to a country and we'll give them 20% less than we have.”
    


            Questions from Beijing about the security of American AI chips also raise uncertainty about just how successful Trump's commission policy could be.
    


            China could choose not to buy US tech firm Nvidia's H20 chips, the social media account Yuyuan Tantian, which is affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said on Sunday. It claimed that the chips could have “backdoors” that impact their function and security, following previous similar claims from China's cybersecurity administration. Nvidia has repeatedly denied that its products have backdoors.
    


            However, that statement could be less an indication that China won't buy American chips and more a signal to Chinese tech companies to continue innovating in semiconductors even if US shipments do resume, Kennedy said.
    


            For the Trump administration, the cost-benefit analysis is that it opens up the flow of mid-tier chips to China while giving the administration a key bargaining chip in its ongoing trade talks, a US official said.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called Nvidia export controls a “negotiating chip” in the larger US-China trade talks.
    


            But China knows that, and its posturing over supposed security concerns with the H20 chip this weekend suggests that it won't be won over so easily — even if it wants the chips for its market.

Agreement defies media reports that contract for Duke and Duchess of Sussex would not be renewed

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed a fresh multi-year film and television deal with Netflix, contradicting reports this year that the streaming company would not renew its contract with them.

Harry and Meghan, who struck a five-year deal in 2020 reportedly worth $100m (£78m) after stepping back from their duties as senior royals, have collaborated with Netflix on a number of projects, most recently the duchess's lifestyle series With Love, Meghan.

Media reports had suggested that poor viewing figures for some of the couple's projects meant that Netflix would not extend the “first look” deal, whereby the streamer has the first option on any projects their company, Archewell Productions, generates.

With Love, Meghan – alongside which the duchess launched her brand, As Ever, in which Netflix is now a partner – failed to break into the streamer's top 300 shows in the first half of this year, while Harry's documentary, Polo, ranked 3,346 of 7,000 shows.

The terms of the “multi-year, first look deal for film and television projects” were not disclosed.

The duchess said: “We're proud to extend our partnership with Netflix and expand our work together to include the As Ever brand.

“My husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision.”

Their new output will include a second season of With Love, Meghan later this month, as well as a Christmas special in December.

Archewell Productions is also working on Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within, a documentary about orphaned children in the Masaka region of Uganda, where the “shadows of the HIV/Aids crisis linger”.

A boardroom dispute led to Harry stepping down in March from Sentebale, the charity he founded to help children orphaned by Aids in Lesotho. A spokesperson said at the weekend that the duke was considering setting up a new charitable organisation working “in the same space in the region”.

There is also “active development” on other Archewell projects with Netflix, which “span a variety of content genres”, including a feature adaptation of the bestselling romantic novel Meet Me At The Lake, by Carley Fortune.

Not all the couple's forays into content creation have been commercially successful. In 2023, a $20m deal they had signed with Spotify to produce podcasts came to an end after just 12 episodes.

Spotify's head of podcast innovation and development labelled the pair “grifters” on his own podcast after the Sussexes announced the end of the relationship.

“I wish I had been involved in the ‘Meghan and Harry leave Spotify' negotiation,” said Bill Simmons, who sold his company to Spotify for $196m in 2020 and gained a leadership role at the company. “The Fucking Grifters. That's the podcast we should have launched with them.”

Reports at the time said the royal couple had not met the productivity benchmark required to receive the full headline payout from the deal.

Judge wrote transcripts from case of Jeffrey Epstein associate couldn't be released because it would risk ‘unraveling secrecy' of grand jury

Dismissing it as little more than a “diversion,” a federal judge in New York has formally rejected the Trump-led US justice department's request to release transcripts of pre-indictment, grand jury interviews with witnesses in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker and associate of Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote that the transcripts could not be released publicly – “casually or promiscuously” – as Donald Trump's government had pushed for because it would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised”.

Nonetheless, while Engelmayer said that releasing the transcripts would jeopardize the confidence of people called to testify before grand juries, he also made it a point to write that the transcripts were “redundant of the evidence at Maxwell's trial”.

Engelmayer also said that the government did not identify information of consequence in the record that was not already public in its request to release the Maxwell case's grand jury testimony.

That observation raises questions about whether the Trump administration meant to substantially address the bipartisan calls for transparency in Epstein's case through its move for the transcripts' release.

And Engelmayer sought to answer those questions in his ruling.

“A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion – aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” he wrote.

“Contrary to the government's depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a matter of significant historical or public interest,” he added. “Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two law enforcement agents.”

Brad Edwards, a Florida lawyer who has represented nearly two dozen Epstein accusers, told the Associated Press that he did not disagree with the the Engelmayer's ruling Monday.

“Our only concern was that if materials were released, then maximum protection for the victims was essential,” he said. “The grand jury materials contain very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway.”

Trump's administration had requested the release of grand jury transcripts in July amid intense political heat around the investigation of Epstein – the late financier and convicted pedophile – and his co-conspirator Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Members of the president's Republican party joined the calls for his administration to resolve questions about the scandal, some of which center on him.

Maxwell recently was interviewed by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, and soon after was moved from a prison in Florida to a lower security prison in Texas, prompting accusations that a cover-up of evidence linking Epstein to Trump was in progress.

An attorney for Maxwell says she spoke truthfully to Blanche. The lead prosecutor in the 2022 case against Maxwell, Maurene Comey, was dismissed from the southern district of New York federal prosecutor's office before the interview took place.

The request to unseal the testimony has been seen as an incremental measure: the government has acknowledged they contain no testimony from witnesses who weren't members of law enforcement.

But thousands of other documents and electronic files are in the government's possession. In early July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo stating they found no evidence of an Epstein “client list” or blackmail – and that no further materials would be released to protect victims.

Yet the fight over Epstein-Maxwell grand jury testimony is not complete. A federal judge in Florida is looking at releasing transcripts from the grand jury testimony that led to an earlier federal indictment against Epstein – from 2006 – that was later shelved.

To resolve that case, Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting minors and entered into a non-prosecution agreement to protect himself and four named others from future prosecution. Maxwell has appealed her conviction to the US supreme court, claiming she should have been shielded under that earlier agreement.

But a number of avenues remain open. The Republican-led House oversight committee has subpoenaed the justice department and issued subpoenas to Bill Clinton, ex-secretary of state and Hillary Clinton – whom Trump defeated in 2016 to secure his first presidency – and eight former top law enforcement officials to appear before the committee in the fall.

B'Tselem publishes film showing killing of Awdah Hathaleen after suspect released by court over ‘weakened' evidence

Middle East crisis – latest updates

Awdah Hathaleen, the prominent Palestinian activist who was killed late last month by an extremist Jewish settler in the West Bank, filmed the moment he was shot, newly released video footage reveals.

Hathaleen, who worked on the filming of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, which examined settler violence against the Palestinian community of Masafer Yatta, was killed by Yinon Levi, a settler who was already under sanctions in the UK and EU for violent acts against Palestinians.

The footage – released by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem – appears to offer clear evidence of Levi's direct involvement in the killing of Hathaleen, an English teacher and activist resident in Umm al-Khair in the south Hebron hills, on 28 July, in an incident that sparked international outrage.

Levi was arrested over the killing but quickly released by a court after a ruling that the evidence he had fired at Hathaleen had “weakened”.

Levi has denied he fired the shot that killed Hathaleen. However, the footage filmed by Hathaleen himself shows Levi draw his weapon and fire in Hathaleen's direction. Hathaleen is then heard groaning and falling to the ground.

Hathaleen was filming settlers operating an earth mover when he was shot. According to witnesses, a confrontation that was taking place between Levi and Palestinian residents became more heated when the digger attempted to approach a fenced-off grove belonging to a Palestinian family, with at least one stone thrown.

The footage, filmed from some distance away, shows Levi waving a gun and scuffling with residents as they attempt to block the earth mover.

Levi can then be seen taking several steps to his right before raising his gun, aiming it in Hathaleen's direction, and firing. The footage sharply contradicts claims by Levi's lawyer, Avichai Hajbi, that he had been “forced to fire his weapon into the air” because he felt his life was in danger.

Hathaleen's footage is backed up by witness evidence provided to B'Tselem, including by his brother-in-law Alaa Hathaleen, who was present at the time of the killing and is seen in the footage remonstrating with Levi at close quarters and attempting to film the events himself with his phone.

“The settler Yinon Levi arrived,” Alaa Hathaleen told B'Tselem. “The residents shouted at him, and he drew his gun. I tried to film him pulling out the gun, but he attacked me and grabbed my phone.

“Suddenly, while we were trying to move people away and the excavator was already on the road leading to the settlement, Yinon Levi fired one shot, and then another shot.

“I heard shouts: ‘Awdah! Awdah!' I turned around and found my cousin Awdah lying in the public garden of Umm al-Khair's community centre. He was bleeding heavily from the chest and mouth. It turned out he had been shot while filming the events, from about 40 meters away, behind a metal fence we had put up around the garden.”

Levi was sanctioned by the UK in 2024, along with others, because he “used physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities”.

Levi's treatment by the courts since the shooting is in line with a long history of lenient treatment by both the Israeli civilian and military courts of Israelis who kill Palestinians.

Three arrested and San Pedro cactus plants also found at rural properties that hosted lucrative ‘astral journeys'

Police in eastern Spain have arrested three people and seized 11 litres of ayahuasca, 117 San Pedro cactus plants and several bottles of toad poison after raiding two rural properties that were used to host lucrative spiritual retreats promising “astral journeys”.

Officers from the Guardia Civil force began investigating the business in the Pedreguer municipality of Alicante province five months ago after receiving a complaint from a former customer. They discovered that the retreat, which advertised online and billed itself as an award-winning and internationally renowned spiritual centre, offered “traditional curative medicine” breaks that were especially popular among European visitors.

“The three-day and five-day packages on offer cost an average of €1,000 [£865] and included lodgings, support and the substances to be taken,” the force said in a statement.

“The retreats comprised groups of up to 20 people, who were accompanied on their ‘astral journeys' by six of the organisation's employees. Several such retreats took place each week, leading investigators to conclude that the group made hundreds of thousands of euros over the past year – most of which was paid in cash that was not declared and which therefore left no trace. A large number of bank accounts in different countries were used.”

The Guardia Civil said 16 people had been on a retreat when the raids took place, adding that the centre did not have the necessary equipment to deal with cases of poisoning and that the concoctions were prepared in a “homemade, rudimentary laboratory that lacked hygiene measures”.

A Guardia Civil spokesperson said that ayahuasca, San Pedro, toad poison, wild rue and mimosa pudica were prohibited substances in Spain, adding that their consumption was not authorised because, while they were natural substances, they could be highly dangerous to human health.

Police photographs showed a large room, filled with mattresses, buckets and tissues, where the “astral journeys” took place.

Two men and a woman – thought to be the group's leaders – were arrested, while five others who served as “spiritual guides” are under investigation. All are suspected of drug trafficking, money laundering and belonging to a criminal organisation.

Officers also seized 945 Ritalin tablets as well as an assortment of plant products, all of which were sent to the laboratory for testing.

While the Guardia Civil has not suggested that anyone was physically harmed as a result of the centre's activities, they stated: “Ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus, toad secretions, wild rue and mimosa pudica are naturally derived products that can be highly damaging for humans and whose effects are difficult to predict because they depend on various factors, including an individual's metabolism and the amounts administered. That risk increases when the toxic substances are administered by people who lack healthcare training and when they are produced in a homemade fashion.”

The Amazon Labor Union leader exemplifies how Black and Palestinian freedom struggles have converged throughout history.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

“Black and Brown [people] always stood together in struggles from the beginning of time,” said Christian Smalls, explaining his pro-Palestinian activism. The Amazon Labor Union leader spoke to me on July 24, 2025, from the Handala, a ship bound for Gaza bearing medical supplies and baby formula.

“Palestinians, they are right in our communities. They are our brothers and sisters, they are our neighbors, and we love one another … we [are] standing together side by side in this struggle to end this illegal siege that Israel has imposed,” Smalls said. His goal in sailing to Gaza was to highlight Amazon's cloud computing contracts with Israeli weapons manufacturers, as well as to urge labor unions in the United States to block arms shipments to Israel, as Greek dockworkers recently did.

Unlike many who, after nearly two years of silence, are now speaking up against Israel's forced famine in Gaza, Smalls has been committed to Palestinian liberation for years. Just after Israel began its latest genocidal chapter in Gaza in October 2023, the labor activist posted a message of solidarity on social media saying, “The people united will never be defeated so yes it's Free Palestine because we're not Free until we're all Free from the river to the Sea!”

And when college students across the U.S. launched powerful Gaza-solidarity campus protests in 2024, the New Jersey-based Smalls showed up at Columbia University's campus, giving speeches and supporting students. “I visited many campuses across the world,” he said. “The younger generation is not going to give up.”

Within days of our conversation, Israeli forces boarded the Handala and seven of them assaulted Smalls — the only Black activist on board. According to the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, “They choked him and kicked him in the legs, leaving visible signs of violence on his neck and back … This level of force was not used against other abducted activists.”

While horrific, Smalls's assault was not surprising. “As a Black man in America, I guess I'm born with a target on my back,” he said. “This is not my first rodeo going up against the status quo.”

Black people in the U.S. and Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank face similar tactics from armed agents of the state. That's no coincidence. There is a long history of U.S.-Israeli joint police training; a 2018 report by Jewish Voice for Peace detailed how Palestinians face the same sort of systematic racial profiling and violence from Israeli forces as Black and Brown Americans do at the hands of U.S. police.

“People had no idea that Israeli military and United States police officers were training together and sharing technologies,” said Ijeoma Oluo, a writer, speaker, and best-selling author of So You Want to Talk About Race.

“Every justification used for [Israel's] genocide is also used against us, and used to justify locking our people in prisons. It's used every time that a Black person is killed by police,” Oluo pointed out.

It's not just the similarities in being victimized by harsh policing; it's also an intimate understanding of the horrors of colonization that ties the two communities together.

Acclaimed author and social justice activist adrienne maree brown sees the indisputable cruelty of Israel's colonization clearly. “The idea that like, I need to go from where I am … and I need to go to another place where people are, and I need to take over that place, and then that's gonna be how I have my safety and my abundance — like, it's such a delusional thought,” said brown. 

An August 2025 Economist/YouGov poll found that 33 percent of Black Americans sympathized with Palestinians. And 47 percent of Black people polled wanted the U.S. to decrease military aid to Israel while 40 percent supported increasing aid to Palestinians — the largest fractions of any racial group.

“It's remarkable the solidarity that you see, that people of color feel … towards Palestinians,” brown said. “Even if we don't know too many details about the issue, it seems very obvious to us, any of us who've come from lands that have once been colonized, or … been part of communities that have faced erasure.”

That solidarity has seeped into mainstream culture too. Grammy Award-winning singer and rapper Doechii used her BET award acceptance speech in June 2025 to “speak up for all oppressed people,” including “the people in Gaza.” She has since continued speaking up, chanting, “Free Palestine” on her Instagram live shows.

There is a sense among some people of color that if Israel succeeds in wiping Palestine off the map, they themselves may be next. Conversely, beating Israel back would be a blow to modern-day colonialism. “Oppressive powers [are] coming together and saying, this must succeed, this genocide must be allowed to continue,” Oluo said. “They understand that the more that we know how these systems work together, the more that we can see the ties of capitalism and global colonialism into this violence and oppression.”

Israel's apartheid agenda has been symbolic of Western hegemony for decades. It's no wonder that links between Black Americans and Palestinians have deep roots. Khury Petersen-Smith, the Michael Ratner Middle East Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, has been a leading voice in the Black4Palestine network and pointed out how “our freedom struggles converge … And that has happened throughout history.”

When African nations were in the process of decolonizing in the 1950s and ‘60s, “Palestinians were in alignment with those decolonization struggles,” Petersen-Smith said, while “Israel was lined up with the United States, with South Africa, with European powers.” As part of his internationalist work with Black anti-colonial leaders, Malcolm X visited Jerusalem in 1959 and Gaza in 1964, and later denounced Zionism as a “new form of colonialism.”

More recently, the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by the police-perpetrated killing of Mike Brown, a Black teenager, coincided with one of Israel's ongoing wars on Gaza. The two exercises in state violence taking place in summer 2014, on opposite sides of the planet, prompted many comparisons between the plight of both peoples.

The 2014 uprising “was this moment of horror and violence, but also resistance and solidarity,” said Petersen-Smith. “Black folks rose up in Ferguson, and Palestinians in Palestine sent messages of solidarity, sent statements of solidarity and sent suggestions on social media about how to deal with tear gas and things like that.” Black delegations even traveled to the occupied West Bank that year to witness firsthand the links between the two communities.

Similarly, when George Floyd's 2020 murder in Minneapolis precipitated a historic racial justice uprising across the U.S., Palestinians once again offered Americans advice via social media on how to treat the effects of tear gas and avoid rubber bullets.

Setting aside the historical and contemporary threads stitching together Black people and Palestinians, there's also basic human empathy at work.

Smalls, who had pledged to go on hunger strike while in Israeli custody, explained that, “as a father of three beautiful children, I cannot live and see every day … babies and women and children and innocent Palestinians being killed and slaughtered.” He added, “I don't want to see my children grow up in the world that we are experiencing right now.”

Smalls returned to the U.S. on July 31, receiving a hero's welcome at the airport in New York as he walked into a crowd of activists chanting “Gaza.” The Palestinian Youth Movement released a statement calling him “an example to us all of principled comradeship, courage, and solidarity with the oppressed.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that the American capital 'has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.'JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was deploying 800 National Guard troops to the U.S. capital and putting Washington's police department under federal control to combat what he said was a wave of lawlessness, despite statistics showing that violent crime hit a 30-year low in 2024.

“I'm deploying the National Guard to help re-establish law, order and public safety in Washington, D.C.,” Trump told reporters at the White House, flanked by administration officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney-General Pam Bondi. “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.”

Trump's announcement is his latest effort to target Democratic-run cities by exercising executive power over traditionally local matters, and he has shown particular interest in asserting more control over Washington.

The Republican president has dismissed criticism that he is manufacturing a crisis to justify expanding presidential authority in a heavily Democratic city.

Hundreds of officers and agents from over a dozen federal agencies, including the FBI, ICE, DEA, and ATF, have already fanned out across the city in recent days.

Andrew Coyne: The final obstacle to Trump's dictatorship may be the people he needs to borrow from

Trump said he would also send in the U.S. military “if needed,” and Hegseth said he was prepared to call in additional National Guard troops from outside Washington. Bondi will oversee the police force takeover, Trump said.

In making his announcement, Trump described Washington as a hellscape of bloodthirsty criminals and unchecked violence.

The Democratic mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, has pushed back on Trump's claims, saying the city is “not experiencing a crime spike” and highlighting that violent crime hit its lowest level in more than three decades last year.

Violent crime fell 26 per cent in the first seven months of 2025 after dropping 35 per cent in 2024, and overall crime dropped 7 per cent, according to the city's police department.

Over the past week, Trump has intensified his messaging, suggesting he might attempt to strip the city of its local autonomy and implement a full federal takeover.

The District of Columbia, established in 1790, operates under the Home Rule Act, which gives Congress ultimate authority but allows residents to elect a mayor and city council. Trump said last week that lawyers are examining how to overturn the law, a move that would likely require Congress to revoke it.

In taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, Trump invoked a section of the act that allows the president to use the force temporarily when “special conditions of an emergency nature” exist. Trump said he was declaring a “public safety emergency” in the city.

Trump's own Federal Emergency Management Agency is cutting security funding for the National Capital Region, an area that includes D.C. and nearby cities in Maryland and Virginia. The region will receive US$20-million less this year from the federal urban security fund, amounting to a 44-per-cent year-on-year cut.

The deployment of National Guard troops is a tactic the Republican president used in Los Angeles, where he dispatched 5,000 troops in June in response to protests over his administration's immigration raids. State and local officials objected to Trump's decision as unnecessary and inflammatory.

Opinion: Where is the global resistance to Trump?

A federal trial was set to begin on Monday in San Francisco on whether the Trump administration violated U.S. law by deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines without the approval of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom.

The president has broad authority over the 2,700 members of the D.C. National Guard, unlike in states where governors typically hold the power to activate troops. Guard troops have been dispatched to Washington many times, including in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.

During his first term as president, Trump sent the National Guard into Washington in 2020 to help quash mostly peaceful demonstrations during nationwide protests over police brutality following the murder of George Floyd. Civil rights leaders denounced the deployment, which was opposed by Bowser.

The U.S. military is generally prohibited under law from directly participating in domestic law enforcement activities.

Since the 1980s, Trump has used crime, especially youth crime in cities, as a political tool. His 1989 call for the death penalty in the Central Park jogger case, involving five Black and Latino teens later exonerated of raping and beating a woman, remains among the controversial moments of his public life.

The “Central Park Five” sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during a presidential debate last year that they had pleaded guilty.

WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump announced on Aug. 11 that he will activate hundreds of National Guard troops to be in the nation's capital to deal with the issue of crime.

“This is Liberation Day in D.C. and we're going to take our Capitol back,” Trump said at a press conference. “We're taking it back under the authorities vested in me as the president of the United States.”

The EU has received a third 1.6-billion-euro ($1.9 billion) tranche in windfall profits from frozen Russian central bank assets and will allocate 95% of it, over 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion), to repay Ukraine's loans.

Ukraine receives funds from frozen Russian assets under the Group of Seven's (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) mechanism. Within the ERA initiative, Ukraine is expected to get $50 billion in loans that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets.

The EU received 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in windfall profits on Aug. 8 from frozen Russian central bank assets held in the bloc's central securities depositories, according to European Pravda.

This marks the third such transfer, covering income generated in the first half of 2025. Previous tranches were disbursed in July 2024 and April 2025.

While 90% of the first two disbursements supported Ukraine through the European Peace Facility (EPF) and 10% via the Ukraine Facility, the EU is shifting its allocation strategy.

"Starting with this third tranche, 95% of the proceeds will support Ukraine through the Ukraine Loan Cooperation Mechanism (ULCM), and 5% through the EPF. The ULCM provides non-repayable support to help Ukraine repay the EU's macro-financial assistance loan, as well as loans from bilateral creditors," the European Commission said.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, G7 countries have frozen approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets.

The ERA initiative, backed primarily by the U.S. and the EU, aims to use profits from these frozen assets to finance Ukraine's defense and reconstruction. Ukraine is expected to receive all funds from this initiative by the end of 2027.

The EU's contribution to the ERA initiative amounts to 18.1 billion euros ($21 billion), with a comparable sum shouldered by the U.S. 

The U.K., Canada, and Japan are providing the rest of the overall sum.

Ukraine received over $18.5 billion from frozen Russian assets this year, then-Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on July 10.

Russian forces advanced toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast, seizing positions in nearby settlements to support further offensive operations.





During the press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump added that he was "a little bothered" by Zelensky's words regarding "constitutional approval" for land swaps as part of a potential peace agreement.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has organized an online meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and key European leaders. 

"Next Friday will be important because it will be about testing (Vladimir) Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end," Mark Rutte said.

We asked Ukrainians on the streets of Kyiv how they feel about Trump's plan to negotiate a peace agreement with Putin without Ukraine's involvement, and what they think about such a territorial exchange.

Russian forces launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 59 Russian drones, while 12 drones hit six different locations.

"This is what the situation in the war looks like. And the situation in diplomacy must correspond accordingly," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

The suspected move comes as the Kremlin intensifies efforts to create what it calls a "sovereign internet" disconnected from global networks, trying to replace Western services with domestic ones.

Leaving a permanent stain on the reputation of the New York Times, Pulitzer laureate Walter Duranty wrote in 1933: "You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs." The Soviet experiment was the omelette. The eggs were millions of Ukrainians deliberately starved by Moscow for wanting freedom. And the bloodthirsty chef was Joseph Stalin — a tyrant whose only rival in genocidal ambition at the time was Adolph Hitler.

Duranty parroted Kremlin talking points, dismissed eyewitness accounts, and described the Holodomor — Stalin's deliberate and monstrous campaign to exterminate Ukrainians — as mere “malnutrition.” He publicly denied the deaths but privately admitted that millions had likely already perished.

The chief correspondent in the USSR for America's newspaper of record betrayed not just Ukraine, but his readers, the truth, and his noble profession. Nearly a century later, Moscow is once again attempting to erase Ukraine, while politicians and commentators, wittingly or not, cite statistics that diminish the scale of atrocities.

Before going further, let's consider a phrase that has become far too comfortable in international reporting: “civilian casualties.” While civilians inevitably suffer in all wars, Russia's campaign is defined by the intentional targeting and murder of civilians. But there are no "casualties," only victims of war crimes.

Despite overwhelming evidence of war crimes that Russian troops have committed in Ukraine since 2022, international media and institutions continue to rely on the UN's official figure of around 13,000 civilian deaths. This number reflects only what can be double-confirmed, not what can be reasonably known. The OHCHR itself admits the true toll is far higher.


What protects a reputation more: repeating an official undercount that serves Russian propaganda, or confronting uncomfortable truths?
    

Its methodology, though careful and well-intentioned, excludes vast swaths of occupied territory, where unimaginable cruelty is buried and access is blocked by its perpetrators. Every death must be corroborated by at least two independent sources, which may be feasible in liberated areas but is impossible under Moscow's control. Without access, there are no witnesses, no documents, no exhumations — and therefore, no count.

Take Mariupol as a case in point. Before the war, it was home to nearly 450,000 people. After months of encirclement and bombardment in 2022, city officials estimated that 25,000–75,000 civilians had been killed. Those numbers alone would eclipse the UN's entire civilian death toll for the war, but they're not reflected in official statistics. Mariupol is still under occupation. Independent investigators have not been allowed in. What happened there remains largely unrecorded.

The same is true in every city still under Russian occupation in eastern and southern Ukraine, or towns that have been wiped off the map by the war. These places, where phone lines are cut, media is silenced, and locals are terrified to speak, remain inaccessible to international monitors. But the absence of documentation does not mean the absence of death.

And when these areas are liberated, the truth emerges. In Bucha, more than 400 bodies were found after Russian troops retreated in April 2022 — many with their hands tied, shot at close range. In Izium, mass burial sites containing hundreds of civilians were uncovered, many showing signs of torture. Thousands more may have been burned, buried without records, or never recovered. But Bucha is now a liberated outlier. What lies buried in occupied Tokmak or Nova Kakhovka remains unknown.

Beyond direct killings, we must also consider the thousands of civilians who have died because of war conditions — lack of medical care, starvation, and attacks on infrastructure. These deaths are rarely included in the UN's figures, but they're no less the consequence of Russia's aggression, and no less intentional than a bullet to the head. Entire towns have been cut off from power, heat, and water during winter. Hospitals have been deliberately targeted. Pregnant women, cancer patients, and the elderly have died simply because they could not access care in time.

Another blind spot in the numbers: filtration camps. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been abducted, forcibly deported, or detained in Russian-controlled facilities — many tortured, many executed. Their names are missing from official lists. Their families receive no information.

The 13,000 figure is still cited — not because it's accurate, but because it's safe. Journalists and policymakers lean on it to avoid the charge of speculation. But what protects a reputation more: repeating an official undercount that serves Russian propaganda, or confronting uncomfortable truths?

In 1942, the Evening Star reported that 2 million Jews had already been killed in Nazi's genocide — a figure based on incomplete, unverified sources. It was speculative by necessity, but the alternative was worse: to demand death certificates from the gas chambers or wait in silence for the proper count. The journalists who published it are not remembered as alarmists. They're remembered for recognizing the scale of the crime as it was unfolding.

Today, Russian propaganda exploits the UN's undercount to deny war crimes, minimize Ukraine's suffering, and subvert international resolve to hold the aggressor accountable. But no lasting or meaningful peace can be built on the erasure of tens — perhaps hundreds — of thousands of innocent lives. Duranty's failure to report on the genocide in Ukraine a century ago reminds us that defending truth requires moral clarity and courage. Anything less is complicity by omission.

            A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury materials from the Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking case.
    


            The Justice Department has sought to release grand jury testimony and exhibits from cases involving Jeffrey Epstein in New York.
    


            Judge Paul Engelmayer issued a scathing opinion, saying unsealing the materials in Maxwell's case is not a matter of historical or public interest and calling the premise of the DOJ's argument false.
    


            “The Court therefore denies the Government's motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary to the Government's depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a matter of significant historical or public interest. Far from it,” Engelmayer wrote.
    


            “Its entire premise – that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them – is demonstrably false,” Engelmayer said.
    


The latest on Trump's presidency as he's expected to hold news conference



            The judge also pointed to the fact that much of the grand jury material that the DOJ is seeking has already been public and was presented during Maxwell's trial in 2021.
    


            “It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two law enforcement agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a matter of longstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the 2021 Maxwell trial,” Engelmayer wrote.
    


            Engelmayer went into great detail in his ruling about the evidence that was introduced during Maxwell's trial, making a point that the government was not familiar with it.
    


            “It established that Maxwell had been instrumental in an approximately decade-long scheme with Epstein to entice, groom, transport, and traffic numerous young women and underage girls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein,” Engelmayer wrote.
    


            The judge continued to pay particular attention to the government's lack of familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, “because a number of details that it identified as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial.”
    


            “A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do notcontribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion – aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.”
    


            Engelmayer wrote in his ruling that any person looking to review the grand jury materials the government has requested to learn new information regarding Epstein and Maxwell's crimes, “would come away feeling disappointed and misled.”
    


            Several victims, who remained anonymous, submitted letters to the court on their opinion as to whether grand jury materials should be unsealed. Many victims were not opposed to the release of grand jury materials, but they said there would need to be heavy redactions to protect their identities. Some victims cited the “political warfare” that they were being used for and the lack of respect the administration had shown towards victims.
    


            Engelmayer highlighted that the only reason victims were not more opposed to the unsealing of grand jury transcripts was that they had been misled that the materials would reveal new information.
    


            “The victims' interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the understandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information,” Engelmayer said.
    


            On Friday, the Justice Department had asked both the judges overseeing its requests in Maxwell and Epstein's cases to refrain from ruling on sealing grand jury materials until August 14. DOJ explained to the court that it notified victims in the case to the extent their names appeared in transcripts and exhibits and wanted time for the victims to receive the notice.
    


            The release of grand jury transcripts in Maxwell and Epstein's cases has been the subject of ongoing battle between the Justice Department and the courts. The government asked the court to unseal grand jury materials on July 18 after mounting pressure from Trump's political base, Democrats and the public for the administration to release the Epstein files.
    


CNN previously reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi notified Trump in May that his name appeared several times in the Epstein files.
    


            Judge Richard Berman, who is overseeing the request for grand jury transcripts and exhibits in Epstein's case, has not ruled on the motion yet.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.

Ukrainian refugees in Germany are receiving "unjustified" social payments and should return to their home country, a co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Tino Chrupalla, said in an interview on Aug. 10.

Talking to the ZDF news channel, the co-leader of Germany's strongest opposition party said that "there are refugees who have come to Germany (from Ukraine), who are also receiving unjustified Bürgergeld (a form of unemployment benefits) here, and who have to return to their own country."

Roughly 5.6 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad after fleeing Russia's full-scale invasion, according to U.N. data. The largest number, around 1.2 million, reside in Germany, a country that has provided extensive military, economic, and humanitarian support to Kyiv.

As of August, 272,000 Ukrainian refugees in Germany were employed and paid their contributions to social insurance funds, Deutsche Welle reported. Some 700,000 Ukrainians were eligible to receive Bürgergeld as of March, a drop of 4,300 people from last year, according to the German public broadcaster.

The AfD, a radical party that saw a surge in popularity in recent months, has consistently criticized Berlin's pro-Ukraine policy, speaking out against the provision of arms and other support to the war-torn country.

The nationalist party has been classified as "extremist" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, and its members have been under investigation for ties to Russian and Chinese espionage networks.

Chrupalla's co-chair in the AfD party, Alice Weidel, also criticized social benefits for Ukrainain refugees, saying on Aug. 7 that Bürgergeld payments for Ukrainians should be abolished and replaced with lower-level payments for asylum seekers.

In the ZDF interview, Chrupalla urged a quick end to the war in Ukraine, adding that there might be no alternatives to Kyiv ceding territory for the sake of peace.

Describing Ukraine's partially occupied eastern Donbas region as composed of "primarily pro-Russian areas," the far-right leader also noted that "over 3 million Ukrainians have fled to Russia."

At least 2.8 million Ukrainians are believed to have left for Russia in the wake of the full-scale war, including those forcibly deported, lacking other routes of escape due to hostilities, or those with family or other ties in Russia.

"Do we really believe that we can defeat the world's largest nuclear power and, what's more, win this war, which is not ours?" Chrupalla said.

The comments come ahead of a high-level summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15, as Trump signaled the Kremlin is interested in "swapping" land as part of a ceasefire deal.

A source in Ukraine's Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Moscow's demands include Kyiv's full withdrawal from two of the partly occupied Ukrainian regions — Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

It remains unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has already rejected any territorial concessions to Russia, will be invited to the meeting.

Senior News Editor

Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. Martin studied at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, holding a bachelor's degree in security studies and history and a master's degree in conflict and democracy studies.



During the press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump added that he was "a little bothered" by Zelensky's words regarding "constitutional approval" for land swaps as part of a potential peace agreement.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has organized an online meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and key European leaders. 

"Next Friday will be important because it will be about testing (Vladimir) Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end," Mark Rutte said.

We asked Ukrainians on the streets of Kyiv how they feel about Trump's plan to negotiate a peace agreement with Putin without Ukraine's involvement, and what they think about such a territorial exchange. 

This marks the third such transfer, covering income generated in the first half of 2025. Previous tranches were disbursed in July 2024 and April 2025.



Kyivstar, which serves 24 million subscribers in Ukraine, will reportedly become the first Ukraine-based company listed on Nasdaq.

Russian forces launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 59 Russian drones, while 12 drones hit six different locations.

"This is what the situation in the war looks like. And the situation in diplomacy must correspond accordingly," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

The suspected move comes as the Kremlin intensifies efforts to create what it calls a "sovereign internet" disconnected from global networks, trying to replace Western services with domestic ones.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he holds "lots of fears and lots of hope" about the planned summit.

Major General Denis Putilov is at least the eighth senior defense official jailed since former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was dismissed in 2024.

"According to preliminary information, at least four drones of the SBU's Special Operations Center 'A' struck the target," an SBU source claimed.

Trump declares ‘public safety emergency' despite record crime low; DC mayor says ‘any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false'

Trump vows to ‘clean up' DC crime despite sharp drop in violence

Trump is placing Washington DC police under federal control and deploying the national guard. He said he was taking “historic action” to combat crime and homelessness in the US capital by invoking a section of the DC Home Rule Act, which allows him to place the DC Metropolitan police department under direct federal control. This provision would typically last for 48 hours, but Trump suggested that this could last longer. He added that he'll be “making the appropriate notifications to Congress and to the mayor”, possibly referring to the rule's requirement that the relevant congressional committee members on DC legislative matters are informed if he extends the provision beyond two days.

Trump was joined by key members of his cabinet, including attorney general, Pam Bondi, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, FBI director Kash Patel, secretary of the interior Doug Burgum, and newly-minted US attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro. Trump said that the police, under Bondi's direction, would “immediately begin massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”.

Trump said that there will be 800 national guardsmen assisting local law enforcement to start, but that number would increase if necessary. DC doesn't have control over its own national guard, unlike other states. Instead, the troops are under the command of the president.

Trump declared, repeatedly, that there is a “public safety emergency” in DC. However, violent crime in the capital hit a 30-year-low in 2024, according to the justice department.

The president also vowed to remove homeless encampments throughout DC. He said that while the administration would “help them as much as you can help”, people experiencing homelessness in the city would “not be allowed to turn out capital into a wasteland”.

Throughout the press conference, Trump and his team decried – what they claim is – overall weakness within the criminal justice system. The president said that DC's “no cash bail” policy was a “disaster”, and said he would count on Republicans in Congress to help “change the statute”.

Pirro added that that the juvenile justice system in the city was too lenient. “I can't arrest them. I can't prosecute them,” she said. “They go to family court, and they get to do yoga and arts and crafts. Enough, it changes today.”

The president also took questions on his upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin, scheduled for Friday in Alaska. He said that while Volodymyr Zelenskyy wouldn't be a part of the summit, he would speak to him as soon as he saw a “fair deal” for a ceasefire emerge. He also didn't rule out the possibility of a future trading relationship with Russia.

A trade truce between the US and China was set to expire on Tuesday, threatening an escalation of economic tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Chinese officials said they hoped the United States would strive for “positive” trade outcomes on Monday, as the 90-day detente reached between the two countries in May was due to expire.

“We hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state ... and strive for positive outcomes on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” a foreign ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, said in a statement.

Chinese and US officials said they expected the pause to be extended after the most recent round of trade talks held last month in Stockholm. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said last week the US had “the makings” of a trade deal with China and that he was optimistic about a path forward.

Donald Trump has yet to confirm any extension to the pause. “We'll see what happens,” he told reporters on Monday. “They've been dealing quite nicely — the relationship is very good with President Xi and myself.”

Failure to reach a deal would have major consequences. Trump had threatened tariffs on China as high as 245% with China threatening retaliatory tariffs of 125%, setting off a trade war between the world's largest economies.

The New York Times is reporting that the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is intended to last for 30 days, citing a White House official.

Here is the full text of Donald Trump's presidential memorandum “Restoring Law and Order in the District of Columbia”.

Section 1. Background. As President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, it is my solemn duty to protect law-abiding citizens from the destructive forces of criminal activity. That obligation applies with special force in our Nation's capital, where, as Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, I must also ensure that all citizens can avail themselves of the right to interact with their elected representatives, and that the Federal Government can properly function, without fear of being subjected to violent, menacing street crime.

The local government of the District of Columbia has lost control of public order and safety in the city, as evidenced by the two embassy staffers who were murdered in May, the Congressional intern who was fatally shot a short distance from the White House in June, and the Administration staffer who was mercilessly beaten by a violent mob days ago. Citizens, tourists, and staff alike are unable to live peacefully in the Nation's capital, which is under siege from violent crime. It is a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world. It is my duty to our citizens and Federal workers to secure the safety and the peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal Government, and our city.

Sec. 2. Mobilizing the District of Columbia National Guard. Pursuant to my authority under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the District of Columbia, I direct the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the District of Columbia National Guard and order members to active service, in such numbers as he deems necessary, to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation's capital. The mobilization and duration of duty shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia. Further, I direct the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.

Sec. 3. General Provisions. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

DONALD J. TRUMP

Following Trump's press conference, the Democratic Mayors Association released the following statement:

Let's be clear: Crime is down in most major cities – including Washington, DC – in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him. If Trump actually cared about reducing crime, he wouldn't have made unprecedented cuts to public safety programs that actually work. If Trump actually cared about our communities, he would be working with our cities, not against them. But the truth is Trump doesn't care – he only wants to create yet another political charade to serve his own interests and distract Americans from his failures. While Trump may try to vilify Mayors and take credit for their work, Democratic Mayors will never stop fighting to protect and strengthen our communities because that's what they do – they get things done.

During that press conference, Donald Trump previewed his Friday meeting with Vladimir Putin, claiming he will know “probably in the first two minutes” whether a peace deal can be made. The US president told reporters:

I am going in to speak to Vladimir Putin and I will be telling him you have to end this war. You have to end it. And he wasn't going to mess with me.

I thought it was very respectful that the president of Russia is coming to our country as opposed to us going to his country or even a third party place. [Though Trump did earlier get geographically confused on this point.]

He confirmed that there were no plans for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to attend but Trump intends to call him straight after.

We're going to see what the parameters are – then I'm going to call up President Zelensky and the European leaders right after the meeting and I'm going to tell them what kind of a deal … It's not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both.

Ominously, however, he complained about the Ukrainian president and referred once again to “land swapping”:

I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval. He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia.

I get along with Zelenskyy but, you know, I disagree with what he has done. Very, very severely disagree. This is a war that shouldn't have happened.

Reverting to his previous mindset as a property developer, Trump acknowledged that Russia had taken some “oceanfront property” and promised:

We're going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine.

There will be some changes in land … Russia has taken some very prime territory. They've taken largely ocean – in real estate we call it oceanfront property – that's always the most valuable property.

During last year's election campaign, Trump promised to end the war on his first day in office. But on Monday he conceded that he might walk away with nothing resolved.

I'm going to meet President Putin and we're going to see what he has in mind and if it's a fair deal … I may say lots of luck, keep fighting, or I may say we can make a deal.

Probably in the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made.

A reporter asked: “How will you know that?”

Trump replied: “Because that's what I do – I make deals.”

Then, despite getting it right earlier in the briefing, for the second time on Monday Trump said: “We're going to Russia.” For those keeping up, the meeting will be held in the US state of Alaska.

The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has invited Donald Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, as European demands grow that the US president agree red lines before Friday's summit in Alaska with Vladimir Putin.

Neither Zelenskyy nor European leaders have been invited to Trump's meeting with the Russian president.

Merz's office said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security”.

It is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call.

There was another once unthinkable spectacle when Jeanine Pirro, a controversial former Fox News host, stood behind the lectern bearing the presidential seal.

Now the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Pirro told reporters:

We need to recognise that the people who matter are the law-abiding citizens – and it starts today ... President Trump is going to make sure these emboldened criminals understand: we see you, we're watching you, and we're going to change the law to catch you.

Pirro, a longtime personal friend of Donald Trump, added:

We need to go after the DC council and their absurd laws.

He said he was taking “historic action” to combat crime and homelessness in the US capital by invoking a section of the DC Home Rule Act, which allows him to place the DC Metropolitan police department under direct federal control.

The president said earlier that “the number of carjackings has more than tripled, murders in 2023 reached the highest rate – probably ever.”

A quick fact check and some important context here. According to the non-partisan Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ), the number of carjackings in DC did peak in June 2023. Their data comes from the DC Metropolitan police department.

But when you compare June 2023 to June 2025, carjackings actually fell by 75 %.

And on homicides, the city did experience a peak in August 2023, but that has fallen by 65% compared to June of this year.

Overall, the homicide rate in DC fell by 19% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year, according to CCJ.

Now, on the subject of Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the president confirms that Volodomyr Zelenskyy will not be part of Friday's summit.

He adds “we're going to see what he [Putin] has in mind,” and then will call Zelenskyy first “out of respect” if it's a fair deal. He says that afterwards he'll inform European Union leaders and Nato.

He goes on to say that there is a world where the US and Russia can be trading partners down the line, or if Friday's meeting goes well.

“Russia has a very valuable piece of land, if Vladimir Putin would go toward business instead of toward war,” he says.

Pivoting, the president says “we'll see what happens”, when it comes to the tariff deadline for China set for later today.

“They've been dealing quite nicely. The relationship is very good with President Xi and myself.”

In response to a question about how personal the issue of crime and homelessness is to the president, Donald Trump says that he wants leaders or dignitaries to come through the capital “beautifully”. He adds, “if our capital is dirty, our whole country is dirty, and they don't respect us”.

Mexico has introduced minimum export prices for fresh tomatoes to protect its domestic supply following the expiration of a 2019 trade agreement with the United States.

The U.S. government withdrew last month from the 2019 trade deal, which had suspended an antidumping investigation into Mexican tomato imports.

The global trading system as we have known it is dead. The World Trade Organization has effectively ceased to function, as it fails to negotiate, monitor, or enforce member commitments. Fundamental principles such as “most favored nation” status, or MFN, which requires WTO members to treat one another equally except when they have negotiated free-trade agreements, are being jettisoned as Washington threatens or imposes tariffs ranging from ten to more than 50 percent on dozens of countries. Both the “America first” trade strategy and China's analogous “dual circulation” and Made in China 2025 strategies reflect a flagrant disregard for any semblance of a rules-based system and a clear preference for a power-based system to take its place. Even if pieces of the old order manage to survive, the damage is done: there is no going back.

Many will celebrate the end of an era. Indeed, although U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive use of tariffs and disregard for past agreements have put the final nails in the coffin, the turn against global trade has been embraced by both Democrats and Republicans in Washington over the past several years. But before critics revel in the death of the rules-based trading system, they should consider the costs and tradeoffs that come with its dismantlement—and think carefully about the elements that should be rebuilt, even if in altered forms, to avert considerably worse outcomes for the United States and the global economy.

If Washington continues on its current course—defined by unilateralism, transactionalism, and mercantilism—the consequences will be grim, especially as Beijing continues on its own damaging course of subsidized excess capacity, predatory export policies, and economic coercion. The risk of the United States and China playing by their own rules, with power the only real constraint, is contagion: if the two largest economies in the world operate outside the rules-based system, other countries will increasingly do the same, leading to rising uncertainty, drags on productivity, and lower overall growth.

Yet clinging to the old system and pining for its restoration would be deluded and futile. Nostalgia is not a strategy; nor is hope. Looking beyond the existing structures does not mean simply accepting a Hobbesian state of nature. The challenge is to create a system of rules outside the rules-based system of old.

That will require starting over. The best option for moving forward is to craft a system made up of coalitions of the like-minded, which together would constitute a network of open plurilateral relationships—smaller and more flexible than the multilateral trading system. Some coalitions would be mechanisms for trade integration and liberalization. Others might serve to secure supply chains or even to restrict trade in the service of national security. Some countries would be members of multiple coalitions with varied purposes, and coalitions would likely have overlapping memberships and variable geometry. From a purely economic point of view, this system would be suboptimal and less efficient than the global trading system was. But it might well be the most politically sustainable outcome that could—crucially—prevent unilateralism from spinning out of control. It would, in short, allow for a global economy shaped by rules even without a global rules-based system.

The global trading system developed as one part of the multilateral economic structure that the United States led in building, starting during World War II and continuing into the early years of this century. Along with institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Washington established first the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade—the GATT, which laid out a set of rules, such as MFN, and created a process by which countries negotiated market-opening commitments—and then, in 1995, the WTO. The 1994 Uruguay Round agreement, which established the WTO, introduced a range of new trade disciplines and a binding dispute-settlement procedure, marking a major step forward in strengthening the multilateral rules-based system. At its founding, the WTO had 76 member countries; today, it has more than 160, which account for 98 percent of global trade.

In the wake of the Cold War, U.S. policymakers hoped that the rules-based trading system that had taken shape in much of the noncommunist world in the preceding decades would expand to encompass former U.S. adversaries, such as Russia, and emerging markets, such as China. The rules would enhance stability, promote openness and integration, and facilitate the peaceful resolution of economic disputes, to the United States' economic and strategic benefit. Yet even before this system was fully in place, opposition to it emerged, beginning in the early 1990s with the fierce debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The first WTO ministerial meeting held in the United States, in Seattle in 1999, was met with massive, headline-grabbing protests.

Trade policy has gotten both more credit and more blame than it deserves in the economic debates of recent decades. Critics of the system tend to conflate the effects of globalization with those of trade policy. Globalization itself had less to do with trade agreements than with technology—particularly the invention of the shipping container and the spread of broadband. From the 1960s on, containerization drastically reduced the cost of shipping goods by sea and land, and there were improvements in the efficiency of air freight, as well. A 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Sharat Ganapati and Woan Foong Wong found that from 1970 to 2014, the cost of transporting goods by weight fell between 33 and 39 percent and the cost of transporting goods by value fell between 48 and 62 percent. All of this made the development of global supply chains for goods increasingly attractive. The same was true for trade in services with the spread of computers and Internet access. Seamless connectivity meant that everything from customer and back-office processing to coding and data analytics could be done almost anywhere on earth.

The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment—one of the primary harms in the United States attributed to trade—also flowed mainly from technological change. Researchers at Ball State University have calculated that “almost 88 percent of job losses in manufacturing [between 2000 and 2010] can be attributable to productivity growth, and the long-term changes to manufacturing employment are mostly linked to the productivity of American factories.” Trade, they found, accounted for just 13.4 percent of job loss.

Indeed, that decline in manufacturing employment, which occurred across advanced industrialized countries, started well before Washington signed any major trade agreements. The percentage of U.S. employment in manufacturing shrank by around two to five points per decade from the 1970s through the first decade of this century, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Germany, broadly considered a manufacturing powerhouse, experienced a similar decline. China's emergence as the manufacturing floor for the global economy accelerated this trend, but it did not cause it entirely on its own. In developed economies with robust manufacturing sectors, the secular decline of manufacturing employment long predates the era of peak globalization.

Still, a key driver of today's wariness of trade is that the rules of the rules-based system did not sufficiently anticipate the challenge of China. The emergence of China as an export-driven economic powerhouse resulted in what has become known as the “China shock”—the rapid closure of factories in particular communities in the United States.

It is true that the multilateral trading system suffered from design flaws that proved to be particularly salient with the rise of China—and consequently planted the seeds of the system's demise. These included the weakness of certain restrictions on state subsidization and the nonmarket behavior of state-owned enterprises, as well as the protection of intellectual property rights; the difficulty of graduating members from developing-country status, which allowed them more lenient treatment; and a consensus, one-country-veto decision-making process that made reform all but impossible. At the time of China's accession to the WTO, in 2001, there was reason to believe that Beijing was on an irreversible path toward market reform and liberalization. Such hopes rested not just on the rhetoric of China's leaders at the time but also on the painful actions they took to restructure significant portions of the economy. Yet hopes were dashed as reform stalled under President Hu Jintao and then in some ways went into reverse under President Xi Jinping.

WTO rules on intellectual property, subsidies, and state-owned enterprises proved insufficient in the face of the emergence and integration of a China that reformed its economic approach less than expected. And the challenge was not just that China played by its own set of rules; it was also the problem of scale. China's surplus of manufactured goods—which approached $1 trillion last year—far exceeds those of earlier manufacturing giants, such as Germany and Japan. By the UN Industrial Development Organization's estimate, China is well on its way to producing 45 percent of global industrial output by the end of the decade.

Such industrial overcapacity, sustained by domestic preferences, state-directed subsidies, and market protections, bears a considerable share of the blame for the current situation. As China's economic strategy increasingly challenged the integrity of a trading system designed to promote integration and interdependence, Washington grew skeptical of the system itself. In 2015, the Obama administration called it quits on the Doha Round of global trade negotiations, concerned that the resulting agreement would have locked in preferential treatment for China at the expense of the United States and the rest of the world. In his first term, Trump showed broad disregard for the multilateral system, preferring to revert to the pre-WTO period in which the United States, as the largest economy in the world, wielded its power unilaterally. And the Biden administration did nothing meaningful to reform the WTO.

Today, the three major functions of the WTO have ground to a halt. As a negotiating forum, it has in recent years managed to conclude only marginal multilateral agreements, such as one on trade facilitation that expedites the entry of goods at customs. As a body for monitoring members' trade practices, it has had no recourse when large economies simply ignore their obligations to report policies. And as a dispute-settlement organization, it has been hobbled by disagreements over the mandate and functioning of its appellate body. In response to such disagreements, Washington, across several administrations, objected first to the reappointment of certain members of the body and ultimately to the appointment of any new members, effectively preventing any meaningful effort to settle disputes.

Self-flagellation about the failures of the trading system has practically become the price of entry to discussions about the global economy's future. The standard account of those has become the starting point for a supposed “new Washington consensus.” Yet those failures should be weighed against the benefits, for it is all too easy to take the international economic system and the institutions that maintain it for granted.

For one thing, the global trading system has played a central role in lifting as many as a billion people out of poverty. The World Bank has concluded that “trade has been a powerful driver of economic development and poverty reduction.” Between 1990 and 2017, global GDP nearly tripled, developing countries' share of exports increased from 16 to 30 percent, and global poverty plummeted from 36 to nine percent.

Another common fallacy in today's debate about trade is that it has benefited only other countries, not the United States. The clearest benefit has been for American consumers, by giving them access to more, and more varied, goods at lower prices. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that a ten percent reduction in U.S. import costs brings welfare gains to both high- and low-income households. The greatest benefits, however, go to low-income households, with welfare gains of the poorest households 4.5 times as high as those of the richest. The economist Michael Waugh, who wrote the report, noted that “in layman's terms, a dollar price reduction is of higher value to the poor than the rich.”

Trade agreements also made it easier to export U.S.-made products and services by eliminating both tariff and nontariff barriers in other markets (which, as Trump himself has noted, have generally been higher than barriers in the U.S. market). They thereby reduced the impetus to move production abroad to serve those markets, where nearly all global consumers live, and supported jobs that on average pay more than nonexport-related jobs in the United States. Since the inception of the WTO, exports of goods have grown more than 150 percent, adjusted for inflation, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Imports grew more than 250 percent adjusted for inflation over this period.) A U.S. Census Bureau report found, based on data from 1992 to 2019, that firms engaged in trade “exhibit higher net job creation rates than non-traders controlling for firm size, age, and sector.” In an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Gary Hufbauer and Megan Hogan calculated that U.S. GDP in 2022 would have been $2.6 trillion lower without gains from post–World War II trade—averaging to gains of $19,500 per American household.



Trade policy has also worked to level the playing field for American workers by pressing other countries to adopt better environmental, labor, intellectual property, regulatory, and anticorruption practices. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example, would have not only opened markets long closed to U.S. products, such as Japan, but also introduced enforceable standards on labor rights, environmental protection, and subsidization of state-owned enterprises in emerging markets, such as Malaysia and Vietnam—key ingredients of “fair trade.” In effect, the TPP dangled a reduction of already low U.S. tariffs as an incentive to get other countries to adopt policies consistent with U.S. interests and values while creating a U.S.-led alternative to Chinese economic power. (Before the first Trump administration, U.S. tariffs were relatively low, with the average applied tariff around three percent and significant restrictions in place in few sectors, such as shoes, clothing, sugar, dairy, and trucks.)

Yet such arguments have always been a tough sell politically, since the benefits of trade liberalization are broadly shared but largely invisible. No one walks out of a Walmart and exclaims, “Thank goodness for the WTO!” Meanwhile, the costs of trade are acutely felt by a small number of workers in specific industries. Globalization could be blamed for introducing competition from other countries with lower labor costs, putting downward pressure on manufacturing wages in the United States and creating incentives to move production abroad.

The China shock was an especially dramatic demonstration of this dynamic—less because of its overall scale than because of how concentrated its losses were in particular communities. The economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson concluded that between 1999 and 2011, Chinese imports resulted in the loss of some two million jobs, including one million manufacturing jobs. That loss is relatively modest in the context of the overall U.S. economy: every year, some 50 million American workers experience “job separations,” including resignations and layoffs. Yet these losses were geographically concentrated, resulting in the devastation of individual communities heavily reliant on industries that could not withstand a flood of Chinese imports, with the effects of closures spilling over into the rest of the local economy. Although “creative destruction” might have worked in aggregate, it meant little to specific towns or cities that had no way to replace gutted industries with new ones on a relevant timeline. And there was little understanding of the need for domestic policies, such as effective worker transition assistance, lifelong learning and upskilling programs, and place-based economic development strategies, that aggressively addressed the localized effects of globalization—a gap that has yet to be adequately addressed.

For years now, Washington's response to the shortcomings of the global trading system has been ad hoc at best. The first Trump administration imposed broad tariffs on China and targeted ones on allies and partners. It also negotiated what was essentially a purchase and sale agreement, rather than a trade agreement, with China, requiring it to buy more commodities and other products from the United States (which China did not in the end fulfill).

The Biden administration kept most of the Trump tariffs in place and added a few more. Despite questioning both the economic and national security value of tariffs imposed on Chinese products such as footwear and apparel, the administration did not want to “reward” Beijing by reducing them. It also innovated the use of export controls, foreign investment restrictions, and industrial policy. Although such measures were focused on strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles, administration officials did not fully develop a clear framework, with guardrails and limiting principles, to prevent the list of products and technologies essential to national security from growing indefinitely and evolving over time into a policy of simple protectionism. Initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity aimed to draw countries and their supply chains closer to the United States, but without the possibility of market access—deemed too politically sensitive—the impact was marginal.

Still, the Biden administration called for reform of the WTO, rather than for its destruction, and in most ways acted according to the principles of the rules-based system. The second Trump administration appears to have a different goal in mind: nothing less than the dismantling of the global trading system, rooted in the president's strong preference for unilateral action and belief that bilateral trade deficits are an existential threat. On April 2, his so-called Liberation Day, Trump declared a national emergency and announced “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50 percent on scores of countries. Since then, he has repeatedly moved the goalposts for agreements while also threatening tariffs as a cudgel on nontrade issues, such as migration, fentanyl, the war in Ukraine, and even the judicial system in Brazil. And he has sought to impose “deals” unilaterally when negotiations have run aground.



Wherever tariff levels precisely land, the current trade wars are almost certain to end with significantly higher barriers to trade. These will impose both costs on American consumers and challenges to American businesses. More than half of U.S. imports today are intermediate goods—inputs into the production of final goods. Accordingly, more expensive or less accessible inputs will make U.S. products less competitive, as was well documented after Trump's first term. In 2018, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel and a ten percent tariff on aluminum. “Tariffs on steel may have led to an increase of roughly 1,000 jobs in steel production,” the economists Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox later concluded. “However, increased costs of inputs facing U.S. firms relative to foreign rivals due to the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum likely have resulted in 75,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in firms where steel or aluminum are an input into production.” The Council on Foreign Relations' Benn Steil and Elisabeth Harding calculated that productivity, or output per hour, in the U.S. steel industry has dropped by 32 percent since 2017. If the Trump administration's goal is to create more manufacturing jobs, its approach is likely to have exactly the opposite effect.

Then there is the cost of retaliation and imitation, as other governments respond and follow the U.S. example by imposing tariffs and restrictions of their own. If countries retaliate, it will harm U.S. exports, including agriculture. Imitation might also involve radically expanding the use of the emergency and national security justifications for weaponizing trade, as the United States has. The U.S. position has long been that no one else could tell the United States what was necessary for its national security. But until recently, Washington rarely invoked the national security justification. Trump has expanded the use of this tool to impose restrictions on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, including from close allies. Other countries have since followed suit. In 2024, a rec­ord 95 “Technical Barriers to Trade” regulations at the WTO cited national security concerns, applied to everything from cocoa beans to alcoholic beverages to animal feed.

Exacerbating all these costs is the uncertainty that results from Trump's approach. Consumers, companies, and investors tend to sit on the sidelines when they are unsure about the general economic outlook and the specific tariffs or other trade measures they might face. The potential impact of tariffs on reducing growth and even triggering a recession could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The United States thus finds itself the subject of a grand experiment in which long-standing assumptions about economics and global trade are being questioned, with significant near-term costs and uncertain long-term benefits. The Trump administration has, in effect, turned the political economy of trade on its head. The costs of its policies are likely to be highly visible and felt immediately by most Americans, while the promised benefits, to the extent they come, are likely to be enjoyed by comparably few workers several years in the future. It will soon become clear if the public is willing to accept near-term sacrifice for the sake of Trump's vision for reindustrializing the U.S. economy. But no matter how fierce the eventual political reaction, there is no going back to the trading system that existed before.

Given the experience of the first half of the twentieth century in trade and beyond, it would seem obvious that international cooperation achieves better outcomes than the raw exercise of unconstrained power. Yet today's trade policy represents a return to a form of power politics in which might makes right. The United States is acting unilaterally because, as the largest economy and consumer market in the world, it can. And China, lip service to multilateralism notwithstanding, is increasingly doing the same.

Contagion could follow, spurring cycles of unilateralism and transactionalism that could easily spin out of control. Some countries might follow the current U.S. example and explicitly reject the rules-based system. Others might follow China's example and celebrate the system in word while undermining it in deed. Either way, the proliferating barriers to trade will reduce growth and damage productivity. Gutted rules will create uncertainty and friction, which could lead to instability and conflict.

Over time, the global economy could come to resemble the pre–World War II system, which was marked by the frequent use of trade as a weapon. For dominant economies, the short-term benefits of this raw use of power and disregard for constraints might appear to balance out the costs, but over the longer term, there are likely to be unintended consequences. Meanwhile, smaller and poorer countries will find themselves with insufficient market power to use tariffs and other trade restrictions in the same way.

Other governments may at first strive to maintain the old order, no matter what the United States and China do, well aware that an abandonment of the system altogether would mean a return to a beggar-thy-neighbor world. For some countries, this effort reflects an ideological commitment to the multilateral rules-based system. The entire European project, for example, is rooted in the notion of rules and regulatory-based integration, making it difficult for the European Union to pursue an entirely unilateralist strategy. Developing countries, meanwhile, lack the power and leverage to influence major trading partners and so have relied on the WTO and the dispute-resolution system to level the playing field.

There is thus likely to be a caucus of countries that continue to extol the virtues of the multilateral rules-based system, hoping that ultimately the United States will return to that system and China will modify its economic strategy to comply with it. This effort would play out in much the same way as the climate change regime has, with some countries coming together around a set of rules while many of the most important players choose their own paths instead. And as in the case of climate change, this caucus of countries will likely be frustrated.

If an anarchical trade system is undesirable, but a return to the status quo ante is impossible, that leaves one clear task: developing a new system of rules even as the global economy moves away from a fully multilateral rules-based system. The most viable option is to build a new system around open plurilateralism: coalitions of countries that share interests in specific areas and come together to adopt high standards on certain issues, and then remain open to other countries that share similar interests and are prepared to implement those standards.

For some countries, these coalitions could focus on trade liberalization, based on a shared willingness to provide market access to one another, in whole or in part, in order to further integration and economic efficiency. For others, coalitions could be avenues for pursuing regulatory harmonization or taking on new issues, such as AI, even if in an informal and nonbinding manner, similar to the role of the Financial Stability Board, an international body formed after the 2008 financial crisis that coordinates recommendations for financial regulation. And with any of these, any individual government could simply opt not to join if it considers the costs of compromise on the relevant issues greater than the benefits.

In some cases, a coalition of countries with similar national security interests could coordinate on technology transfer and industrial policy—in other words, around a common approach to restricting trade rather than facilitating it. A coalition could, for example, discourage its members from importing certain products and services, such as telecommunications infrastructure, from countries that pose a national security threat while encouraging the development of secure supply chains among its members. Or it could align export controls and establish common rules for the use of state subsidies. The United States could forge a coalition aimed at building a competitive, collective industrial base to meet the challenge posed by China's scale, as former Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and the Council on Foreign Relations' Rush Doshi recently recommended in these pages.



How should the United States incentivize countries to join such coalitions? The negotiation of traditional trade-liberalizing agreements appears to be off the table politically, at least for now. Threatening to impose tariffs—that is, using sticks rather than carrots—might secure agreement in the short run, but to be durable, the other members of the coalition must see it as in their interest to align themselves with the United States rather than hedge their bets with China or remain on the sidelines altogether.

One option for the United States is to take advantage of its innovation ecosystem—the unique combination of world-class universities, R & D investment, rule of law, deep capital markets, access to risk capital, and entrepreneurial culture. Many of these assets are currently under threat by Trump administration policies, but over the long run, the value of maintaining U.S. scientific and technological leadership should be self-evident, particularly in the context of great-power rivalry. The U.S. innovation ecosystem might evolve but survive. A club of countries could secure preferential access to these opportunities and to those offered by other members of the club in exchange for alignment on a broader array of economic and national security interests.

These coalitions would be open, meaning that countries that are able and willing to live by the standards are eligible to join. Some might be quite small, focused on securing semiconductor supply chains, for example, and include, say, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. Others could represent larger groups of countries willing to agree to a broader set of rules to govern trade and investment relations generally, such as the successor to the TPP, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, which was finalized without U.S. participation. The membership of coalitions could grow over time, and there could be overlapping membership among different coalitions.



In the absence of a fundamental change in Beijing's economic strategy and more, it is hard to imagine China as a candidate for membership in a coalition of this sort that involves the United States any time soon (although there might be room for coalitions cooperating on global public goods, such as pandemic preparedness). It is possible, over time, that Chinese policymakers will change strategy based on their own judgments, driven by demographic, financial, and other pressures. A structure of open plurilateralism, built with allies and partners, might expedite that decision. But after years of trying, U.S. policymakers should by now be quite humble about their ability to directly convince Beijing to change its approach and instead focus on using coalitions to shape China's external environment.

In this world, the WTO might wither entirely, or it might persist in rump form for countries that have no more attractive coalitions to join. It could also be the repository for technical work and a venue for dispute settlement for countries that opt in. The network of free-trade agreements would continue to exist and could become the foundation for broader coalitions, such as the EU potentially following the United Kingdom's lead in joining the CPTPP.

A key benefit of open plurilateralism is the flexibility it provides. Not being beholden to holdouts in a system in which each country has a veto, the approach creates opportunities to move forward on issues among those with a common view and a capacity to take on new issues as they arise and new members as they meet the standards. In terms of economic efficiency, this is a second-best solution. By definition, the benefits would be shared only among members. Principles such as MFN would be effectively consigned to the dustbin of history. And the variable geometry of custom-tailored plurilateral agreements could be as messy and inefficient as a spaghetti bowl of bilateral trade agreements. But although such a network would be more complex than the multilateral trading system, it might also prove more politically sustainable. It is a pragmatic response to the current challenge: maintaining at least some rules without the multilateral rules-based system.

Whatever the benefits of the postwar global trading system—for growth, poverty alleviation, consumer welfare, and more—there were, at the end of the day, losers as well as winners. Neither the costs nor the benefits were equally shared, and the distributional issues rarely got adequate attention from policymakers. These downsides will remain even in the best-designed system, and it will be essential to find better solutions for the harms. Any new system must come with an accompanying set of domestic policies designed to ensure that American workers and communities can thrive in a rapidly changing economy, whether that change comes from trade, technology, or immigration. Past administrations have made modest attempts at place-based economic development and worker retraining, but never with the seriousness of purpose or degree of prioritization that will be necessary.

Such policies may be even more urgently needed in the wake of the Trump trade wars. The costs of the current approach—in terms of growth, inflation, and productivity—are likely to fall most on the people Trump claims to be championing. Low-income Americans spend a disproportionate share of their income on imported goods. Industries that employ blue-collar workers depend on imported inputs. And the incomes of farmers and ranchers are highly sensitive to retaliation by other countries.

Meanwhile, as the United States grapples with those consequences, the coming impact of artificial intelligence on workers could well dwarf the impact of globalization. The China shock contributed to the elimination of an estimated two million jobs between 1999 and 2011; the widespread application of AI could eliminate tens of millions of jobs over a similar period. So while attention is focused on tariffs, policymakers should be devoting at least as much effort to preparing for the AI-driven restructuring of the American workforce. As with trade, the benefits might be widely shared. But in this case, the costs might be, as well.

For years, military theorists and political scientists have argued that airpower is overrated and, in some ways, outmoded. Some point to the proliferation of small, cheap unmanned drones as evidence that traditional air superiority—the ability to control the skies—has been rendered obsolete. According to this view, technological innovation has made “air denial”—merely restricting an adversary's ability to operate freely in the air—a sufficient replacement.

Others cite a “smart bomb trap,” the idea that leaders have grown overconfident in the ability of precision airstrikes to coerce states into submission. These critics argue that airpower alone cannot achieve political objectives and in fact often leads to endless, pointless bombing campaigns. The political scientist Robert Pape, for example, asserted in 1996 that “no strategic bombing campaign has ever yielded decisive results.” Underneath these critiques is a clear message: airpower is too limited, too expensive, or too reliant on the promises of technological innovations to matter much.

Then, in June, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, an air campaign against Iran. Over the course of just 12 days, Israel's air force flew around 1,500 combat sorties, conducted more than 600 aerial refuelings, and struck over 900 Iranian targets, including hardened nuclear facilities, missile batteries, and military command centers. The results were decisive: Iran's nuclear program was significantly disrupted, key elements of its air defense network were shattered, and Tehran's military leadership suffered serious blows. All the while, not a single manned Israeli aircraft was lost.

Although Israel did not fully eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities, its air campaign delayed, degraded, and deterred Iran's ambitions, and further transformed the Middle East's political landscape. Rising Lion was a stunning demonstration of what a modern air force, backed by sound strategy and political resolve, can accomplish. It reaffirmed airpower's ability to achieve meaningful political outcomes without a drawn-out ground war.

The 1991 U.S.-led Desert Storm air campaign established the tenets of modern air warfare: gain air superiority, simultaneously strike key enemy centers of gravity, use stealth and precision, and prioritize desired effects over attrition of forces alone. Israel adapted those lessons. The Israeli air force used stealth F-35I fighter jets to suppress and destroy Iranian surface-to-air missile batteries. These aircraft provided real-time targeting information to nonstealth F-15I and F-16I fighters, which carried out precision strikes on additional targets. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) collected intelligence, jammed communications, and allowed Israel to deliver additional precision-guided munitions.

This devastating combination of stealth, precision, and persistent surveillance allowed Israel to quickly gain and maintain air superiority. By degrading Iranian defenses, Israel also cleared the way for the United States' Operation Midnight Hammer, in which B-2 stealth bombers struck deeply buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz, reachable only by U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs.

Some critics have pointed out that the campaign failed to destroy all of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. But Israel's objective in Operation Rising Lion was to disrupt and delay Iran's nuclear weapons program while retaining the ability to strike again—not to eradicate it. By those standards, Rising Lion was a resounding success. By crippling key enrichment and weapons-support sites, eliminating senior military and scientific personnel, and gaining air superiority over Iran, Israel imposed a strategy of denial by delay—all without committing ground forces to Iran or becoming entangled in a prolonged conflict. Indeed, any Iranian efforts to enrich uranium or rebuild facilities will now occur under the shadow of Israeli precision air attacks.



Critically, Israel achieved all its aims efficiently and effectively. It gained air superiority despite the thousands of miles separating it from Iran, in 12 days, and with zero casualties. Such results were possible only via airpower. No ground campaign could have hit these facilities so quickly, with such precision and intensity, and without any casualties.

To be sure, Rising Lion was not an air-only campaign. It was a tightly integrated, multidomain operation. Cyber-operations disrupted Iranian command and control. Space-based and airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms provided near-real-time targeting data. Electronic warfare helped disrupt enemy radars. Covert ground teams inside Iran used small drones to suppress defenses and relay coordinates. And an extensive set of military actions waged over several years in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria had already severely degraded Iran's regional proxies, blunting Tehran's ability to retaliate.

Together, these elements gave Israel an overwhelming advantage. But it was airpower that played the predominant role. It provided the tempo, reach, and the punch that made Rising Lion such an unqualified success.

Leading-edge airpower capabilities have improved markedly since Desert Storm, when aircraft lacked accurate sensing technology, real-time connectivity, and all-weather munitions. Today's fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-35, can integrate data from a variety of onboard sensors, fuse it into accurate targeting information, and share it with other aircraft. F-35s function as integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensor-shooters, giving users more information and digital connectivity that they can use to precisely strike targets as they are revealed. Their stealth allows them to operate inside contested airspace. As a result of these innovations, fewer fifth-generation aircraft are needed to achieve what would otherwise require dozens of less capable nonstealth aircraft.

Technological advances are not restricted to modern combat aircraft, however. Air defenses have become cheaper and more adaptable than ever. Artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons systems, and advanced information integration are changing the character of warfare. In the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, for example, Azerbaijan used a network of Bayraktar TB2 drones, loitering munitions, and real-time targeting data to devastating effect against Armenian forces. But even in the face of evolving modes of warfare, airpower's inherent advantages endure. Airpower can still be used to change adversary behavior, enforce strategic redlines, and reshape regional military balance—all without bleeding a country's treasury or excessively risking its sons and daughters. In fact, Russia's inability to achieve air superiority over Ukraine turned what the Kremlin assumed would be a fast and simple invasion into a grinding war of attrition. Israel, by contrast, used modern airpower to avoid such a trap. It did not involve significant ground forces and has thus avoided falling into an endless war—Washington's fate in Afghanistan and Iraq.

All this doesn't mean air campaigns alone can do everything: operations from any domain never achieve victory in isolation. Critics of airpower, however, miss that airpower does not simply enable the use of other kinds of operations. Rather, it is a unique instrument of strategic leverage. In the modern era, air superiority is not just a prerequisite for joint success; it can be the decisive factor. In other words, Israel's air campaign did not just set back Iran's nuclear program. It reaffirmed that airpower can be the foundation of modern military success. U.S. defense planners should pay attention. Investing in air superiority is not optional for American security. It is essential.

WASHINGTON, August 11. /TASS/. Ukraine's positions will only deteriorate further down the road, and "everyone knows" that Vladimir Zelensky will have to trade land for peace, Director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University Peter Kuznick told TASS, commenting on plans to hold a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US leader Donald Trump in Alaska on August 15.

"Zelensky says he won't trade land for peace, but everyone knows he will have to. If he doesn't know it, Ukraine will have to find a leader who does," the prominent US political analyst and Professor of History said.

"There is no way Ukraine is joining NATO in the foreseeable future or clawing back the land that Russia has seized," Kuznick emphasized. According to him, continued hostilities will only mean more death on both sides and Russia "occupying more and more Ukrainian land." "This is actually the strongest position Ukraine will be in given its shortage of manpower, weapons, strategy, finances, and morale," the expert noted.

Trump said on Friday that he expects to meet with Putin in Alaska on August 15. The date and venue for the upcoming talks were later confirmed by Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov, who said that Putin and Trump will focus on discussing scenarios of reaching a lasting peace in Ukraine. Ushakov stressed that the Kremlin expects any follow-up meeting between the two leaders to take place on Russian soil after their talks in Alaska.

Zelensky said on August 9 that the answer to Ukraine's territorial question already is in the country's Constitution and "no one will deviate from this." Trump explained on August 8 that a potential deal could require Ukraine to surrender significant parts of its territory and Russia to return some land to Ukraine as he warned that Zelensky "will have to get ready to sign something."

Editor's note: The article was expanded with additional information.

A planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be a test for the Kremlin leader, and Ukraine will be involved in upcoming peace efforts if the summit goes well, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Aug. 10.

"(W)hen it comes to peace talks, the ceasefire, and what happens after that on territories, on security guarantees for Ukraine, Ukraine will have to be and will be involved. But on Friday, it is important to see how serious Putin is," Rutte said in an interview with CBS News.

Trump and Putin are set to meet in Alaska on Aug. 15 as the U.S. intensifies efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.

There will be no peace deal signed between Trump and Putin in Alaska without Ukraine's participation, Rutte noted.

"It will not be the final say on this. There will not be a final deal on this. Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved," he said.

"What will happen on Friday is testing Putin by President Trump. And I commend him for the fact that he organised this meeting," Rutte said.

The NATO leader described Putin as "the main threat to the Western alliance" amid Russia's war.

"(W)hen it comes to the geostrategic position of Ukraine in the future, when it comes to whatever is the size of the Ukrainian military, when it comes to NATO's posture on the eastern flank in countries like Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Poland, that Putin has absolutely no say on any of these issues," he said.

Leaders of Poland, the Baltic countries, and the Nordic countries have stressed the importance of Ukraine's presence at the negotiating table.

"I believe President Zelensky will be invited; there's some information emerging today that there's a chance President Zelensky will be present at President Trump's meeting with Putin," Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said, according to the Polish Press Agency.

"That would be the best solution, and I believe it will happen."

In a joint statement on Aug. 10, leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said they welcome Trump's initiative to end the war but noted that a "diplomatic solution must safeguard the vital security interests of both Ukraine and Europe."

The Nordic and Baltic leaders also stressed that negotiations "can only take place in the context of a ceasefire" and that the "path to peace cannot be charted without Ukraine's voice."

"No decisions on Ukraine without Ukraine, and no decisions on Europe without Europe," the leaders said in their statement, pledging continued support for Kyiv and adding that Russia must be consistently pressured to end the war.

Russia has issued maximalist demands to Kyiv in previous direct peace talks, including that Ukraine give up its NATO aspirations and demilitarize.

Months earlier, U.S. attempts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia failed. Kyiv and Moscow later held three rounds of direct peace talks in Istanbul, which were largely inconclusive.

In direct talks, Ukraine and Russia agreed to several prisoner exchanges, but progress toward a ceasefire was not made amid Russia's maximalist demands.

Trump previously announced an Aug. 8 deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine. Despite Russia's refusal to halt hostilities, Trump never imposed sanctions on Moscow once the deadline passed.

Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent.



During the press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump added that he was "a little bothered" by Zelensky's words regarding "constitutional approval" for land swaps as part of a potential peace agreement.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has organized an online meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and key European leaders. 

"Next Friday will be important because it will be about testing (Vladimir) Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end," Mark Rutte said.

We asked Ukrainians on the streets of Kyiv how they feel about Trump's plan to negotiate a peace agreement with Putin without Ukraine's involvement, and what they think about such a territorial exchange.

Kyivstar, which serves 24 million subscribers in Ukraine, will reportedly become the first Ukraine-based company listed on Nasdaq.

Russian forces launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 59 Russian drones, while 12 drones hit six different locations.

"This is what the situation in the war looks like. And the situation in diplomacy must correspond accordingly," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

The suspected move comes as the Kremlin intensifies efforts to create what it calls a "sovereign internet" disconnected from global networks, trying to replace Western services with domestic ones.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he holds "lots of fears and lots of hope" about the planned summit.

Major General Denis Putilov is at least the eighth senior defense official jailed since former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was dismissed in 2024.

"According to preliminary information, at least four drones of the SBU's Special Operations Center 'A' struck the target," an SBU source claimed.

Ukrainian refugees in Germany are receiving "unjustified" social payments and should return to their home country, a co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Tino Chrupalla, said in an interview on Aug. 10.

Baku may consider lifting its ban on supplying Ukraine with weapons from its arsenal if Russia continues targeting Azerbaijani interests in Ukraine, Azerbaijani outlet Caliber.Az reported on Aug. 10, citing unnamed sources.

The reported shift follows a series of Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure linked to Azerbaijan. In the latest attack overnight on Aug. 8, Russian forces launched five Shahed drones at a SOCAR oil depot in Odesa Oblast, sparking a fire and damaging a diesel pipeline. Four SOCAR employees were seriously injured, according to news reports. 

The strike marked the second recent Russian attack on Azerbaijani-linked facilities in Ukraine. In late June, Russian forces targeted a gas distribution station near Orlivka, a key part of the Trans-Balkan pipeline, through which Azerbaijani gas began flowing into Ukraine following a July 28 deal.

Caliber.Az said Russian forces had "systematically" struck Azerbaijani energy facilities in Ukraine in recent weeks, warning that such actions could trigger a policy reversal in Baku on weapons exports to Kyiv. Azerbaijan has so far refrained from supplying arms to Ukraine during the full-scale war.

The possible policy shift was reportedly discussed during an Aug. 10 phone call between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. The two leaders condemned the strikes and discussed bilateral energy cooperation.

"These are deliberate attacks not only on these facilities, but also on our cooperation," Zelensky said after the call. "President Aliyev assured me, and this is also Ukraine's position, that we will continue cooperation despite any challenges."

Azerbaijan and Ukraine have maintained close energy and trade ties for years, with Kyiv importing Azerbaijani oil and gas and SOCAR expanding its investments in Ukraine's fuel infrastructure. 

Before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Baku also supplied Ukraine with certain military equipment, including drones and armored vehicles. 

Since the start of the all-out war, however, Azerbaijan has officially maintained a policy of not providing lethal aid to either side, while offering humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, such as providing energy equipment, financial aid, and infrastructure support, with the value of assistance exceeding $40 million as of mid-2025.

DOHA, August 11. /TASS/. Four Al Jazeera journalists including correspondent Anas al-Sharif have been killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City, Qatar's TV channel said.

The journalists were in a tent for media workers outside al-Shifa Hospital when the strike using a drone was launched minutes before midnight local time (GMT +3), killing seven people.

In turn, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck "the terrorist Anas Al-Sharif, who posed as a journalist for the Al Jazeera network." According to the Israeli military, he led a terrorist cell in the radical Palestinian movement and "was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops."

According to the TV channel, its journalists were among 48 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip over the past day. The Palestinian enclave said on August 5 that the number of reporters killed there had risen above 230. And the Gaza Health Ministry reported on August 10 that the total death toll since the Gaza conflict escalated in October 2023 had climbed to 61,430, with more than 153,000 people injured.

The situation in the Middle East deteriorated sharply after armed supporters of the Palestinian Hamas movement from the Gaza Strip entered Israeli territory on October 7, 2023, killing residents of border settlements and taking hostages. The radicals called this attack a response to Israel's actions against the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Israel blockaded Gaza and launched a military operation in the strip to free the hostages and dismantle Hamas's fighting capability. In March, Israel resumed fighting in the Gaza Strip, breaking a ceasefire established in January. Several rounds of negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States failed.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is holding a press conference following President Donald Trump's announcement Monday that he's taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard in the hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed crime is already falling in the nation's capital.

Trump has promised new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets.

Other news we're following:








President Trump is invoking Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act to take over control of the city's police department, saying in a letter to a congressional committee that the police force is needed for federal purposes.

The Republican president says in the letter sent to the House Oversight Committee Monday that he is taking the action for the purpose of “maintaining law and order in the nation's seat of government; protecting federal buildings, national monuments, and other federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the federal government.”

By invoking the law, Trump is able to take over the police for more than 48 hours, but if he wants to continue for more than 30 days, both the House and Senate would need to give him a vote of approval.

Jeffries, the top House Democrat, argued that the administration “has consistently broken the law and violated the Constitution to further the personal and political agenda of a wannabe king.”

Jeffries denounced other Republicans as “cowardly.” 

His statement did not mention any immediate actions congressional Democrats would take in response to Trump's plan.

“The Republican Party has zero credibility on the issue of law and order,” said Jeffries. “Donald Trump doesn't care about public safety. On his first day in office, he pardoned hundreds of violent felons—many of whom brazenly assaulted law enforcement officers on January 6,” he continued. “We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.” 

Mayor Muriel Bowser says she had “one brief call” with the White House over the weekend about activating the National Guard, so she thought Trump's announcement would be about calling up the National Guard, not about taking over the Metropolitan Police Department.

Rep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on China, also spoke against the Trump administration's deal to get a 15% cut in the sales of advanced U.S. chips to China in exchange of export licenses. 

“Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities,” said the Republican from Michigan. 

Trump confirmed the deal but suggested the chips to be sold to China are “essentially old.” 

U.S. companies are still banned from selling their most advanced chips to China, which are critical in developing artificial intelligence.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that the city had reached a 30-year low in violent crime. Bowser said that crime was down not just from a post-pandemic peak in 2023, but from 2019 levels prior to the pandemic. 

Bowser highlighted the district's parks, schools and public transportation and said that it was important for those who live and visit here to know “just how beautiful our city is and how proud we are of all that we've accomplished here.

Bowser's comments are a response to President Trump's announcement of his takeover of D.C. police force. Bowser said that the steps were “unsettling” but not without precedent.

“My message to residents is this,” Bowser said. “We know that access to our democracy is tenuous. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.”

The union representing DC police officers is backing Trump's takeover move, though it called for the federal intervention to be temporary.

Union chairman Gregg Pemberton said it agrees with the president that “immediately action is necessary” to tamp down crime.

Still, Pemberton said that the city ultimately needs a police department that's “fully staffed and supported.”

He also called for the repeal of criminal justice policies and laws passed by the city council.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore says Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in D.C. is also “deeply dangerous.”

Moore, a Democrat who served as a paratrooper and captain in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, said in a statement Monday that the president's actions lack both data and a battle plan.

“He is simply using honorable men and women as pawns to distract us from his policies, which continue to drive up unemployment and strip away health care and food assistance from those who need it most,” Moore said.

He urged the president to look to Maryland for ways of reducing violent crime. Moore noted that homicides in Maryland are down by more than 20% since Moore's inauguration in January 2023.

“We await outreach from the White House if they want to have a serious conversation about public safety. But we won't hold our breath,” he said.

A federal appeals court has given the Trump administration until Friday to restore a website that tracks spending appropriated by Congress.

In a ruling on Saturday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit refused to block a lower court order requiring the restoration. 

The court said disclosing the spending information was a “permissible exercise of legislative authority” with roots in the nation's founding. An email to the Office of Management and Budget on Monday was not immediately returned.

The database at issue in the case first went up in July 2022. The Trump administration pulled it down in March. It argued publicly disclosing spending decisions intrudes on executive power. The administration has faced numerous lawsuits over decisions to freeze spending authorized by Congress.

Following President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that he would deploy National Guard troop to take over the city's police department, civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton warned of the move's potential long-term repercussions.

“Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” Sharpton said in a statement. 

“Let's call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration's handling of the Epstein files.”

Sharpton said D.C.'s leadership must push back on the president's use of Washington D.C. and its residents as “political props.”

“We cannot, nor will we, take this lying down,” he said. “Threatening to hit if people spit, calling all Black and low-income neighborhoods slums, and throwing away the humanity of homeless people by equating them to criminals is the beginning of the end if we don't stand up. This is the ultimate affront to justice and civil rights many of us have dedicated our lives to protecting and expanding.”

The top prosecutor in the nation's capital is calling Trump's move to take over the city's police department “unnecessary and unlawful.”

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb says crime is not an emergency levels. After a spike in 2023, violent crime hit its lowest level in decades last year and has continued to sink in 2025, he said.

The federal takeover could face a challenge in court, and Schwalb said his office is “considering all of our options.”

Trump said a couple of times during the press briefing that he would be traveling to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin -- but their summit is taking place in Alaska.

“I'm going to Russia on Friday,” he said in one instance.

He also made an erroneous reference at another time to the summit being next week instead.

The president began the briefing Monday by commenting on the large crowd of journalists gathered for the news conference. He said he'd never seen the media briefing room as crowded as it was. Later during the briefing, he joked they may be violating fire codes.

“I've done this for years now, hard to believe,” he said. “I've never seen this room so packed. In fact, I'm sure it's a violation of every fire code.”

“Now I may leave and say ‘good luck,' and that'll be the end,” Trump said.

Trump says he can see a scenario where the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations if things go well at his meeting with Putin later this week.

“I do, yeah,” he responded when asked about the prospect ahead of the Alaska meeting.

He said “Russia has a very valuable piece of land” and mused about what would happen if “Putin would go toward business instead of war.”

As for the prospect of progress at that meeting? Trump said: “I think it'll be good, but it might be bad.”

That came during a news conference after Trump was asked whether he plans to extend his 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China.

The U.S.-China trade truce ends Aug. 12 and if it isn't extended, rates on Chinese goods could climb back to over 80%.

“They've been dealing quite nicely,” Trump said, adding that he has a good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The president said he was open to meeting with Putin first and then meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or meeting with both together — though he didn't say he'd push for a three-person meeting.

Trump said “President Putin invited me to get involved” and even said he thought it was very respectful that Putin is coming to U.S. territory for the meeting in Alaska, instead of insisting that Trump go to Russia.

He said he'll tell Putin that it's time to end Russia's war with Ukraine.

“We're looking at reclassification,” Trump said, adding “it's early.”

He said he planned to make a determination in the coming weeks.

The president said marijuana “does bad for the children,” but that easing penalties associated with it is a “very complicated subject” because some people support doing so.

Trump said he'd “heard great things having to do with medical” use of marijuana.

A potential move to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I controlled substances to a Schedule III drug would make it significantly easier to buy and sell cannabis.

Trump said he hopes other cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, are watching the steps he's announced in D.C. and would take steps to “self-clean up.”

He said that if needed, the administration would take similar steps in other cities and criticized their leadership at the local and state levels.

In addition, Trump also said “we will bring in the military if it's needed” but added “I don't think we'll need it.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth compared sending the Guard into the nation's capital to deployments to the southern U.S. border and Los Angeles.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

Hegseth said the D.C. National Guard will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.”

He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units, other specialized units.”

The president said he signed an executive order and presidential memorandum in the Oval Office before holding his news conference.

One executive order invoked presidential powers under the Home Rule Act to take over Washington's police force.

He also signed what the administration called statutorily required notification letters to DC Mayor Bowser and relevant congressional leaders.

Trump also signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy the National Guard in the nation's capital.

The polarizing Food and Drug Administration official is getting his job back less than two weeks after being pressured to step down at the urging of conservative activists.

Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of FDA's center for vaccines and biotech therapies, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.

Prasad left the agency last month after drawing ire of right-wing activists, including Laura Loomer, who flagged his past statements criticizing President Trump.

He was also targeted by biotech executives and patient groups for briefly halting shipments of a therapy for muscular dystrophy, due to safety concerns.

But Prasad has also had the backing of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Under Prasad, the FDA restricted the approvals of two new COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.

Trump complained about potholes and graffiti in the city and said it was “embarrassing.”

“This is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,” Trump said. “I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was, with graffiti all over the walls.”

Trump also said he would bring in the military if needed.

“This is not a big area,” Trump said. “What you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them.”

In a news conference, Trump said he'll place the D.C. police department under federal control and deploy the National Guard.

Trump said he wants to “rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.” The Democratic mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, has noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023.

Trump cited a number of recent high-profile incidents, including the killing of a 21-year-old Congressional intern and the beating of a DOGE staffer during an attempted carjacking.

“This is liberation day in D.C. and we're going to take our Capitol back,” the president said.

Trump said he would start with D.C., but the wider crackdown on crime would go further to other Americans.

“We're going to clean it up real quick, very quickly,” he said.

The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement that the Trump administration is to get a 15% cut from U.S. chips sales in China in exchange of granting export licenses, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.”

, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.

“Our export control regime must be based on genuine security considerations, not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,” he said. “Chip export controls aren't bargaining chips, and they're not casino chips either. We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.”

The U.S. has placed export controls on most powerful U.S. computing chips, banning their sales in China to prevent them from being used to boost China's military capabilities.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has invited President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the NATO secretary general and several European leaders to a virtual meeting Wednesday ahead of the Trump-Putin summit later this week.

The German chancellery said in a statement Monday that the talks would focus on “the current situation in Ukraine with a view to the planned meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin.”

It said the talks will focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” as well as “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security.”

Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit Friday in Alaska.

Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell won't be released, a judge decided Monday.

Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said in a written ruling that the government had suggested the materials could be released publicly “casually or promiscuously,” which would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised” and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before future grand juries.

“And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials, because they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell's trial, would be innocuous. The same could be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in support of charges that later proceeded to trial,” he added.

About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to combat on crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday.

More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Marshals Service are also contributing officers.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters. The Justice Department didn't immediately have a comment Monday morning.

The White House last week announced plans for an increased presence of federal law enforcement in Washington as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on crime.

But the Europeans concede that Moscow is unlikely to give up control of Ukrainian land it holds.

Ahead of the summit in Alaska on Friday, President Trump suggested that a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories,” but the Europeans see no sign that Russia will offer anything to swap. Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit.

European Union foreign ministers are meeting on Monday following talks on Ukraine among U.S. and European security advisors over the weekend. They are wary that President Vladimir Putin will try to claim a political victory by portraying Ukraine as inflexible.

The only thing on Trump's schedule today is a news conference at 10 a.m., where he's expected to announce plans to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington.

Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital.

Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.”

“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Sunday. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.”

Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.”

Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is bringing in 800 National Guard members to help law enforcement fight crime in Washington, but just 100 to 200 of the troops will be on the city's streets at any given time, the Army said.

Trump's directive on Monday for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard is just the latest example of him sending the Guard into cities to support immigration enforcement or fight crime over the objection of local and state officials.

According to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority. That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation's capital — though, at the moment, that doesn't appear to be the plan.

“Their duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,” according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions.

About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being assigned to patrols in Washington, including from the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Marshals Service.

Hegseth told reporters that Guard members will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.” He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units — other specialized units,” though he didn't offer any further details.




The timeline for the troop deployment also is vaguely defined. According to Trump's directive, National Guard troops will remain deployed until the president determines “that conditions of law and order have been restored.”

Besides the 800 Guard members, Trump said “we will bring in the military if it's needed” — seemingly referring to active duty troops in addition to the Guard — but added that “I don't think we'll need it.”

The deployment of troops to Washington comes after the Pentagon has pulled out the vast majority of the roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines that Trump sent to Los Angeles in late June. 

Trump argued that the deployment was necessary after his administration's immigration crackdown led to protests throughout the city. Troops were largely tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they conducted raids.

Hegseth compared plans to send troops into the nation's capital to their deployment to the U.S.-Mexico border and to Los Angeles.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

However, California's governor and city officials argued that the LA deployment was unnecessary and went to court to try to fight it.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters that the National Guard's primary mission had been to guard two buildings that “frankly didn't need to be guarded.”

In addition, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat, has questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws.

“I just think that's not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC's “The Weekend.”

This is also not the first time Trump unilaterally has chosen to use federal forces in the U.S. capital.

In 2020, during the protests over the police killing of George Floyd, Trump deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to the city, at one point using them to forcibly clear peaceful protesters from a square near the White House so he could stage a photo op.

It became a controversial moment in his first administration in part because Gen. Mark Milley, who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared alongside Trump. Some saw Milley's presence as the military's endorsement of using troops against U.S. citizens. Milley later apologized.

An explosion at the plant near Pittsburgh has left one person dead and dozens injured or trapped under the rubble, with emergency workers on site trying to rescue them.

CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) — Explosions at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh left one dead, two missing and at least nine others in hospitals Monday, with emergency workers searching the badly charred rubble for victims, officials said.




The explosions sent black smoke spiralling into the midday sky in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel for more than a century. An Allegheny County emergency services spokesperson, Kasey Reigner, said one person died and two were currently believed to be unaccounted for. Others were treated for injuries, Reigner said.

Allegheny County Emergency Services said a fire at the plant started around 10:51 a.m. The explosions sent a shock through the community and led to officials asking residents to stay away from the scene so emergency workers could respond.

“It felt like thunder,” Zachary Buday, a construction worker near the scene, told WTAE-TV. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building, and then when we saw the dark smoke coming up from the steel mill and put two and two together, and it's like something bad happened.”

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said via X that “multiple explosions” occurred at the facility.

Allegheny Health Network said it had seven patients from the explosion being treated by its hospitals. It did not provide information about the patients' conditions. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it is treating two patients at UPMC Mercy, the region's only level one trauma and burn center.

Clairton residents like Amy Sowers, 49, felt an explosion nearby. Sowers, who was sitting on her porch located less than a mile from the plant, felt her house shake.




“I could see smoke from my driveway,” she said. “We heard ambulances and fire trucks from every direction.”

Sowers decided to leave the area after she said she smelled a faint smell in the air. Sowers, who grew up in Clairton, has seen several incidents at the plant over the years. Despite health concerns, Sowers said many residents cannot afford to leave.

A maintenance worker was killed in an explosion at the plant in September 2009. In July 2010, another explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors.

“Lives were lost again,” Sowers said. “How many more lives are going to have to be lost until something happens?”

The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania that employ several thousand workers.

In a statement, U.S. Steel said an “incident” occurred at the plant's coke oven batteries 13 and 14. The company, now a subsidiary of Japan-based Nippon Steel Corp., said emergency teams were immediately dispatched to the scene, but it gave no other details about the cause of the explosions, casualties or damage.

The company's CEO, David Burritt, said in the statement that U.S. Steel is working with authorities to investigate the cause.

The plant converts coal to coke, a key component in the steel-making process. To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what's known as coke gas — made up of a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

Clairton Mayor Richard Lattanzi said his heart goes out to the victims of Monday's explosions.

“The mill is such a big part of Clairton,” he said. “It's just a sad day for Clairton.”

The Allegheny County Health Department said it is monitoring the explosions and advised residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors, close all windows and doors, set air conditioning systems to recirculate, and avoid drawing in outside air, such as using exhaust fans. It said its monitors have not detected levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.

According to the company, the plant produces 4.3 million tons (3.9 million metric tons) of coke annually and has approximately 1,400 workers.

In recent years, the Clairton plant has been dogged by concerns about pollution. In 2019, it agreed to settle a 2017 lawsuit for $8.5 million. Under the settlement, the company agreed to spend $6.5 million to reduce soot emissions and noxious odors from the Clairton coke-making facility.

The company also faced other lawsuits over pollution from the Clairton facility, including ones accusing the company of violating clean air laws after a 2018 fire damaged the facility's sulfur pollution controls.

In February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a “buildup of combustible material” that ignited, causing an audible “boom,” the Allegheny County Health Department said. Two workers who got material in their eyes received first aid treatment at a local hospital but were not seriously injured.

Last year, the company agreed to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs as part of settling a federal lawsuit filed by Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment and the Allegheny County Health Department.

The fire at the Clairton plant knocked out pollution controls at its Mon Valley plants, but U.S. Steel continued to run them anyway, environmental groups said.

The lawsuits accused the steel producer of more than 12,000 violations of its air pollution permits.

David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, another environmental group that has sued U.S. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.”

In June, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalized a “historic partnership,” a deal that gives the U.S. government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15 billion buyout of the iconic American steelmaker.

The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it.

NEW YORK (AP) — Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell shouldn't be released, a judge ruled Monday in a stinging decision suggesting the Justice Department's real motive for wanting them unsealed was to fool the public with an “illusion” of transparency.

Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said in a written decision that federal law almost never allows for the release of grand jury materials and that making the documents public casually was a bad idea.

And the judge also belittled the Justice Department's argument that releasing grand jury materials might reveal new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, calling that premise “demonstrably false.” 

After privately reviewing the materials the government sought to release publicly, the judge wrote that anyone familiar the evidence from Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking trial would “learn next to nothing new” and “would come away feeling disappointed and misled.” 

“The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes,” Engelmayer said.

He said the materials also don't reveal new locations where crimes occurred, new sources of Maxwell and Epstein's wealth, the circumstances of Epstein's death or the path of the government investigation.

The best argument to release the transcripts might be that “doing so would expose as disingenuous the Government's public explanations for moving to unseal,” Engelmayer wrote.




“A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” he said.

The Justice Department had requested public disclosure of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury, minus redactions to protect privacy. 

Florida lawyer Brad Edwards, who has represented nearly two dozen Epstein accusers, said he didn't disagree with the ruling and most wanted to protect victims. “The grand jury materials contain very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway,” he said.

Maxwell lawyer Bobbi Sternheim declined comment. Messages for comment were left with the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors had asked to unseal the documents to calm a whirlpool of suspicions about what the government knows about Epstein, a well-connected financier who authorities said killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges involving dozens of women and girls as young as 14. Maxwell, a socialite, was later convicted of helping him prey on underage girls. 

The Justice Department has acknowledged that only an FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective testified before the grand jury in 2020 and 2021. 

Prosecutors have said much of what was discussed behind the grand jury's closed doors ultimately became public at Maxwell's 2021 trial, in victims' civil lawsuits or in public statements from victims and witnesses.

The decision about the grand jury transcripts doesn't affect thousands of other pages the government possesses but has declined to release. The Justice Department has said much of the material was court-sealed to protect victims and little of it would've come out if Epstein had gone to trial.

Another federal judge is weighing whether to release grand jury transcripts from the Epstein case. 

A federal judge in Florida declined to release grand jury documents from an investigation there in 2005 and 2007.

Maxwell, who's appealing her conviction, opposed unsealing the documents. She recently was interviewed by the Justice Department and was moved from a prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas. Her attorney says she testified truthfully.

The Epstein saga has again become a national flashpoint years after Epstein served jail time and registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty to Florida prostitution offenses in a 2008 deal that let him avoid federal charges then.

President Donald Trump raised questions about Epstein's death, and Trump allies stoked conspiracy theories that dark secrets were covered up to protect powerful people. Some of those allies got powerful positions in Trump's Justice Department and promised to pull back the curtain on the Epstein investigation — but then announced this summer nothing more would be released and a long-rumored Epstein “client list” doesn't exist.

The about-face amplified the clamor for transparency. After trying unsuccessfully to change the subject and denigrating his own supporters for not moving on, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi to ask courts to unseal the grand jury transcripts.

President Donald Trump announced plans Aug. 11, 2025, to deploy the National Guard and to takeover the Metropolitan Police Department to address crime in the nation's capital.

The fight between President Donald Trump and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom over the National Guard's presence in California is coming to a head on Monday in the start of a three-day trial.

Government attorneys are set to argue that Trump had legal authority to deploy roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in June to assist with anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests and riots.

While most of the National Guard members have since been demobilized, the trial could set the stage for more fights across the country as Trump federalizes guard members in Washington, D.C., and threatens to do so elsewhere in response to high crime rates in blue cities.

Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee and brother of retired liberal Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, is presiding over the case.

Breyer previously granted a temporary restraining order in favor of Newsom, saying Trump's decision to mobilize the National Guard was illegal because it infringed on California's authority. One of the conditions required under the law Trump cited to federalize the National Guard is that a rebellion must be underway, and Breyer said the riots in California fell far short of that scenario.

But Breyer's decision was quickly reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A three-judge panel for the appellate court unanimously found that the courts have limited ability to review whether a president has properly invoked the law to federalize the National Guard.

"We are persuaded that, under longstanding precedent interpreting the statutory predecessor to §12406, our review of that decision must be highly deferential," the panel wrote. "Affording the President that deference, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority under §12406(3), which authorizes federalization of the National Guard when ‘the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.'"

The panel paused Breyer's initial order indefinitely, but Monday's trial is the next step in the court process as the judge weighs the merits of the case.

While little is left on the ground in California for the judge to resolve – Newsom recently announced that about 300 of Trump's deployed National Guard members remain active in the state – legal questions surrounding Trump's actions persist.

As part of the trial, Breyer will examine the 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from being used for civil matters. Newsom has argued Trump violated that law and plans to call military officials as witnesses during the trial to testify about the directions the National Guard and a few hundred Marines received.

Newsom has said they were illegally engaged in law enforcement activities, while government attorneys argue they were protecting federal personnel and federal properties.

APPEALS COURT APPEARS SKEPTICAL OF NEWSOM'S CLAIM THAT TRUMP ILLEGALLY DEPLOYED NATIONAL GUARD

While Newsom also argued that Trump's unusual decision to bring the National Guard into a state without the governor's consent was illegal and required the governor's permission, the three-judge panel has already leaned in favor of Trump on that point.

The panel found that while the law's language, which states that Trump must go "through" the governor, could mean the president committed a "procedural" violation, it did not warrant restricting Trump's use of the military.

Newsom has claimed more broadly that militarizing California was unnecessary and caused the unrest in Los Angeles to intensify.

State and local law enforcement officers made about seven riot-related arrests prior to Trump's announcement about the National Guard on June 7, but they made about a thousand arrests during the subsequent 10 days, California attorneys said in court filings.

An ICE official said in an affidavit that National Guard members were "essential" to providing reinforcements around the 300 North Los Angeles Federal Building, which was the site of protests during the controversial immigration raids.

"Prior to the National Guard's deployment, rioters and protestors assaulted federal, state, and local law enforcement officers with rocks, fireworks, and other objects. They also damaged federal property by spray painting death threats to federal law enforcement officers," the ICE official wrote.

MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Erin formed Monday in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean, just west of the Cabo Verde Islands, as Hurricane Henriette strengthened in the Pacific Ocean well away from Hawaii, forecasters said.

There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect for either storm, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, but Erin could become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season this week.

Erin was about 280 miles (451 kilometers) west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph), the NHC said. It was moving west at about 20 mph (32 kph).

Gradual strengthening was forecast over the next several days.

Hurricane Henriette was a Category 1 storm on Monday. Henriette had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (137 kph), the NHC said, and was about 525 miles (845 kilometers) northwest of Honolulu.

Additional strengthening was possible Monday, with weakening over the next few days.

Also in the Pacific, remnants of what once was Tropical Storm Ivo degenerated on Monday, the NHC said. They were about 615 miles (990 kilometers) west of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico, with no threat to land.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on tensions in the region as President Trump's deadline for peace draws near on 'Special Report.'

The Coast Guard warned of "increased Chinese research vessel activity" in the U.S. Arctic as it responded to multiple vessels in the region.  

The agency said it recently "detected and responded to two Chinese research vessels operating in the U.S. Arctic and is currently monitoring a total of five similar vessels in or near the U.S Arctic."

"On August 5, a C-130J Hercules fixed wing aircraft from Air Station Kodiak responded to the Chinese research vessels Ji Di and the Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di.  Both vessels were transiting northeast in the Bering Sea," the Coast Guard said. 

"On August 6, the crew of U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Waesche (WMSL 751) again responded to the Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di as it was transiting north in the Chukchi Sea above the Arctic Circle, after passing through the Bering Strait," they added.

The Coast Guard released a photo of the Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di as taken from the C-130J Hercules. They noted that the aircraft and Waesche were "patrolling under Operation Frontier Sentinel, an operation that responds to adversaries operating in and around Alaskan and U.S. Arctic waters."

The U.S. Coast Guard Legend-class cutter USCGC Waesche travels through the San Francisco Bay for the Parade of Ships during San Francisco Fleet Week in October 2023. The USCGC Waesche recently responded to a Chinese research vessel in the U.S. Arctic, the Coast Guard said. SFFW is an opportunity for the American public to meet the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard teams and experience America's sea services. During Fleet week, service members participate in various community service events, showcase capabilities and equipment to the community, and enjoy the hospitality of the city and its surrounding areas.  

"In July, Coast Guard Arctic District deployed a C-130J Hercules fixed wing aircraft from Air Station Kodiak to query the Xue Long 2, another Chinese research vessel, approximately 290 nautical miles north of Utqiagvik, Alaska," the Coast Guard also said. 

The sightings of the Chinese ships are part of a "three-year trend of increased activity" in the region, according to officials.

"The Coast Guard Arctic District works in conjunction with international partners, U.S. Northern Command, and Alaskan Command to constantly monitor the activity of foreign vessels operating near U.S. sovereign waters and the extended outer continental shelf to ensure homeland security, homeland defense, and compliance with U.S. and international law," the agency said.

President Donald Trump goes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over 'land swapping' as he lays out upcoming 'feel out meeting' with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

President Donald Trump took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a press event on Monday over his frustration with the Ukrainian leader's objection to "land swapping."

"I get along with Zelenskyy, but, you know, I disagree with what he's done, very, very severely, disagree. This is a war that should have never happened," Trump said, reiterating his belief that the Ukrainian president is in part at fault for Russia's illegal 2022 invasion.

"I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, ‘Well, I have to get constitutional approval'," Trump said. "I mean, he's got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap, because there'll be some land swapping going on."

"I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody," Trump added, noting it was "for the good of Ukraine."

Zelenskyy – who did not declare war on Russia, as Moscow had already invaded, did declare Martial Law on Feb. 24, 2022 with the approval of Ukraine's parliament, which gave him presidential powers to mobilize a military response — made clear over the weekend that he objected to Trump's "land swapping" proposal and has repeatedly said it would require a national referendum under the nation's constitution, not a unilateral decision by him.

Trump wouldn't detail what exactly he hopes to get out of the meeting with Putin and described it as a "feel-out meeting," saying within "the first two minutes [he'll] know exactly whether or not a deal can be made."

"I'm going in to speak to Vladimir Putin, and I'm going to be telling him, you got to end this war, you got to end it," Trump said, reiterating his belief that if he had won the 2020 election, Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine, saying "he wasn't going to mess with me."

"I go into that thing fully loaded right up there, and we're going to see what happens," he continued. "It could be a good meeting, and we'll go a step further. We'll get it done. 

"I'd like to see a ceasefire very, very quickly, very quick," he continued. "And, we're going to be dealing with the European leaders and, we're going to be dealing with President Zelensky and hopefully we're going to have a great success."

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Prince Harry and Meghan have extended their partnership with Netflix and their media company, Archewell Productions, with a multiyear, first-look deal, the couple announced Monday. 

Archewell began collaborating with the streaming giant in 2020 and have produced a handful of documentary content, including the popular “Harry & Meghan.” The Duchess of Sussex also developed a lifestyle brand, As Ever, in partnership with Netflix.

The collaboration has also produced the documentary series' “Polo,” “Heart of Invictus” and “Live to Lead.”

“My husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision,” Meghan said in a statement. 

The couple and Netflix also announced upcoming collaborations, including a second season of, “With Love, Meghan,” a lifestyle and cooking show starring the duchess. The show will also receive a special holiday episode in December. 

The show is Netflix's most-watched culinary show since its March release, according to the company. It ranked low compared to other releases in the first half of this year, with 5.3 million views, according to Netflix's semiannual report.

“Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within,” a documentary short film that centers on a small orphanage in Uganda's Masaka region, is also set to release this year. Archewell is also in production with Netflix on a feature adaptation of Carley Fortune's novel “Meet Me at the Lake.” The drama “follows a decade-spanning love story that begins with a chance encounter and a broken promise,” the statement read. 




“Harry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere. The response to their work speaks for itself,” Bela Bajaria, Netflix's chief content officer, said in a statement.

Their extended deal with Netflix is the latest in the couple's yearslong effort to develop business ventures in the United States. They had also penned a multiyear deal with Spotify in 2020 and produced a podcast, “ Archetypes, ” but cut ties with the company in 2023. 

The couple have been detangling their lives from the British royal family and are living in California with their two young children.

President Donald Trump says he's placing the Washington, D.C., police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to make the nation's capital safer

President Donald Trump said Monday he's placing the Washington, D.C., police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to make the nation's capital safer.

Trump has promised new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets.

Ahead of a news conference, Trump said Monday on social media that the nation's capital would be “LIBERATED today!” He said he would end the “days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people.”

Other news we're following:








Following President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that he would deploy National Guard troop to take over the city's police department, civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton warned of the move's potential long-term repercussions.

“Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” Sharpton said in a statement. 

“Let's call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration's handling of the Epstein files.”

Sharpton said D.C.'s leadership must push back on the president's use of Washington D.C. and its residents as “political props.”

“We cannot, nor will we, take this lying down,” he said. “Threatening to hit if people spit, calling all Black and low-income neighborhoods slums, and throwing away the humanity of homeless people by equating them to criminals is the beginning of the end if we don't stand up. This is the ultimate affront to justice and civil rights many of us have dedicated our lives to protecting and expanding.”

The top prosecutor in the nation's capital is calling Trump's move to take over the city's police department “unnecessary and unlawful.”

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb says crime is not an emergency levels. After a spike in 2023, violent crime hit its lowest level in decades last year and has continued to sink in 2025, he said.

The federal takeover could face a challenge in court, and Schwalb said his office is “considering all of our options.”

Trump said a couple of times during the press briefing that he would be traveling to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin -- but their summit is taking place in Alaska.

“I'm going to Russia on Friday,” he said in one instance.

He also made an erroneous reference at another time to the summit being next week instead.

The president began the briefing Monday by commenting on the large crowd of journalists gathered for the news conference. He said he'd never seen the media briefing room as crowded as it was. Later during the briefing, he joked they may be violating fire codes.

“I've done this for years now, hard to believe,” he said. “I've never seen this room so packed. In fact, I'm sure it's a violation of every fire code.”

“Now I may leave and say ‘good luck,' and that'll be the end,” Trump said.

Trump says he can see a scenario where the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations if things go well at his meeting with Putin later this week.

“I do, yeah,” he responded when asked about the prospect ahead of the Alaska meeting.

He said “Russia has a very valuable piece of land” and mused about what would happen if “Putin would go toward business instead of war.”

As for the prospect of progress at that meeting? Trump said: “I think it'll be good, but it might be bad.”

That came during a news conference after Trump was asked whether he plans to extend his 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China.

The U.S.-China trade truce ends Aug. 12 and if it isn't extended, rates on Chinese goods could climb back to over 80%.

“They've been dealing quite nicely,” Trump said, adding that he has a good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The president said he was open to meeting with Putin first and then meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or meeting with both together — though he didn't say he'd push for a three-person meeting.

Trump said “President Putin invited me to get involved” and even said he thought it was very respectful that Putin is coming to U.S. territory for the meeting in Alaska, instead of insisting that Trump go to Russia.

He said he'll tell Putin that it's time to end Russia's war with Ukraine.

“We're looking at reclassification,” Trump said, adding “it's early.”

He said he planned to make a determination in the coming weeks.

The president said marijuana “does bad for the children,” but that easing penalties associated with it is a “very complicated subject” because some people support doing so.

Trump said he'd “heard great things having to do with medical” use of marijuana.

A potential move to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I controlled substances to a Schedule III drug would make it significantly easier to buy and sell cannabis.

Trump said he hopes other cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, are watching the steps he's announced in D.C. and would take steps to “self-clean up.”

He said that if needed, the administration would take similar steps in other cities and criticized their leadership at the local and state levels.

In addition, Trump also said “we will bring in the military if it's needed” but added “I don't think we'll need it.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth compared sending the Guard into the nation's capital to deployments to the southern U.S. border and Los Angeles.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

Hegseth said the D.C. National Guard will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.”

He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units, other specialized units.”

The president said he signed an executive order and presidential memorandum in the Oval Office before holding his news conference.

One executive order invoked presidential powers under the Home Rule Act to take over Washington's police force.

He also signed what the administration called statutorily required notification letters to DC Mayor Bowser and relevant congressional leaders.

Trump also signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy the National Guard in the nation's capital.

The polarizing Food and Drug Administration official is getting his job back less than two weeks after being pressured to step down at the urging of conservative activists.

Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of FDA's center for vaccines and biotech therapies, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.

Prasad left the agency last month after drawing ire of right-wing activists, including Laura Loomer, who flagged his past statements criticizing President Trump.

He was also targeted by biotech executives and patient groups for briefly halting shipments of a therapy for muscular dystrophy, due to safety concerns.

But Prasad has also had the backing of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Under Prasad, the FDA restricted the approvals of two new COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.

Trump complained about potholes and graffiti in the city and said it was “embarrassing.”

“This is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,” Trump said. “I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was, with graffiti all over the walls.”

Trump also said he would bring in the military if needed.

“This is not a big area,” Trump said. “What you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them.”

Trump said he wants to “rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.” The Democratic mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, has noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023.

Trump cited a number of recent high-profile incidents, including the killing of a 21-year-old Congressional intern and the beating of a DOGE staffer during an attempted carjacking.

“This is liberation day in D.C. and we're going to take our Capitol back,” the president said.

Trump said he would start with D.C., but the wider crackdown on crime would go further to other Americans.

“We're going to clean it up real quick, very quickly,” he said.

The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement that the Trump administration is to get a 15% cut from U.S. chips sales in China in exchange of granting export licenses, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.”

, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.

“Our export control regime must be based on genuine security considerations, not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,” he said. “Chip export controls aren't bargaining chips, and they're not casino chips either. We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.”

The U.S. has placed export controls on most powerful U.S. computing chips, banning their sales in China to prevent them from being used to boost China's military capabilities.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has invited President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the NATO secretary general and several European leaders to a virtual meeting Wednesday ahead of the Trump-Putin summit later this week.

The German chancellery said in a statement Monday that the talks would focus on “the current situation in Ukraine with a view to the planned meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin.”

It said the talks will focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” as well as “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security.”

Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit Friday in Alaska.

Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell won't be released, a judge decided Monday.

Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said in a written ruling that the government had suggested the materials could be released publicly “casually or promiscuously,” which would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised” and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before future grand juries.

“And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials, because they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell's trial, would be innocuous. The same could be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in support of charges that later proceeded to trial,” he added.

About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to combat on crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday.

More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Marshals Service are also contributing officers.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters. The Justice Department didn't immediately have a comment Monday morning.

The White House last week announced plans for an increased presence of federal law enforcement in Washington as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on crime.

But the Europeans concede that Moscow is unlikely to give up control of Ukrainian land it holds.

Ahead of the summit in Alaska on Friday, President Trump suggested that a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories,” but the Europeans see no sign that Russia will offer anything to swap. Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit.

European Union foreign ministers are meeting on Monday following talks on Ukraine among U.S. and European security advisors over the weekend. They are wary that President Vladimir Putin will try to claim a political victory by portraying Ukraine as inflexible.

The only thing on Trump's schedule today is a news conference at 10 a.m., where he's expected to announce plans to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington.

Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital.

Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.”

“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Sunday. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.”

Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.”

Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency.

President Donald Trump shared new details on Monday about his plan to take control of public safety in Washington, D.C., following a brutal attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, but D.C. residents aren't convinced. 

Trump announced on Monday that he is activating the District of Columbia National Guard and seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department after floating the idea since last week's assault in Washington's Logan Circle. 

Some Washington residents who spoke to Fox News Digital called it a "terrible idea" that "doesn't make a lot of sense."

"I think D.C. politics should stay with D.C., and, unfortunately, the federal government is apparently overstepping their bounds right now, so I hope that D.C. is allowed to govern itself, as well as police itself," one Washington resident told Fox News Digital ahead of Trump's announcement.

Trump controversially federalized the California National Guard amid anti-ICE protests that delved into riots in Los Angeles in June. Protesters were rejecting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations and Trump's robust immigration crackdown.

The president bypassed Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy National Guard troops to support ICE deportation. It was the first time a president federalized the National Guard without the governor's request in more than 60 years. 

Now, the tension between local and federal powers is unfolding in the nation's capital. But just like in California, many Washington residents have concerns about seeing "troops on our streets."

"We have laws for a reason," one resident told Fox News Digital. 

"Privatizing security is a terrible idea, and I think anything that Trump does is garbage," another Washington resident added.

Despite their apprehension about National Guard troops patrolling the nation's capital, many residents said something needs to be done to address crime in Washington, D.C.

While the Department of Justice indicated a 30-year low in violent crime last year, concerns about the city's safety linger, with one resident telling Fox News Digital, "The city is getting dangerous."

"I think it's a good idea," one resident said of Trump's new plan. "It's something that needs to be done for the city to be safe. Right now, we're not safe. The kids and the teenagers are doing everything. So yeah, I think that's a great idea."

And another Washington resident said, "We need all the protection that we can get in the city, because the city is really getting dangerous," telling Fox News Digital that she has to "make sure to come home before sundown" and she is afraid of getting robbed when she gets off public transportation.

"Things do seem out of control and desperate, but I don't know what kind of numbers to take, what numbers to read. One minute they'll say crime is out of control. Next minute, they will say crime is down a certain percentage. It's kind of confusing, and I don't know who to believe in and which way to go, to be honest," a Washington resident said, articulating the dichotomy between the low crime statistics and the alarming crime stories. 

But another D.C. resident said, "There's no way he should be in control of anything," and Washington, D.C., "should be a state," so the district has more power to make decisions for itself. 

"I don't think it's necessary," another Washington resident added. "I do think there needs to be some change within [the] Metropolitan [Police Department] because safety is an issue."

Live Updates


• DC crackdown: President Donald Trump announced he is placing the Washington, DC, police department “under direct federal control” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation's capital. The move comes after Trump ordered a seven-day surge in federal law enforcement within the city last week, pointing to several high-profile crimes.
    


• Later this week: Looking ahead to his Friday summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said Volodymyr Zelensky “could” attend but expressed skepticism that the Ukrainian leader's presence would make a difference in reaching a peace deal. US officials are rushing to finalize the details of the meeting in Alaska.
    


• Revenue for export licenses agreement: Meanwhile, chip giants Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for export licenses, an unprecedented quid pro quo arrangement that came together after Nvidia's CEO met with Trump last week.
    


            The Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department, including Chief Pamela Smith, along with Mayor Muriel Bowser, did not know of President Donald Trump's move to take over the department before his announcement Monday, three sources familiar told CNN.
    


            Bowser has remained largely deferential to Trump's moves over the past few days to increase the presence of federal agents on the streets of DC. The Democratic mayor went so far as to highlight her “shared priorities” with Trump during an interview Sunday, saying she is “interested in being in neighborhoods and fighting crime.”
    


            Requests for comment to both the MPD and the mayor's office on Trump's takeover have gone unanswered.
    


            The details of Trump's move and how it could change MPD's strategies to address crime are sparse, one source told CNN, noting that leadership has been out of the loop.
    


            One source in the DC government told CNN they were surprised by the announcement Monday, especially because Trump and Bowser have been on OK terms recently and because the White House and the mayor's office have previously been in almost constant contact.
    


            DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb, meanwhile, slammed Trump's moves in a statement.
    


                    “The Administration's actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful. There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year. We are considering all of our options and will do what's necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,” he said.
                





            President Donald Trump said Monday that Ukrainian President Zelensky “could” attend his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday but expressed skepticism that it would make a difference in reaching a peace deal.
    


                    “He wasn't a part of it. I would say he could go, but he's been to a lot of meetings. You know, he's been there for three and a half years. Nothing happened,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
                





            “We're going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin, and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” Trump said.
    


            “How will you know that?” a reporter pressed.
    


            “Because that's what I do. I make deals,” Trump said.
    


            The president later added that a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be necessary.
    


            “Ultimately, I'm going to put the two of them in a room. I'll be there, or I won't be there, and I think it'll get solved,” Trump said.
    


            The president said that “there could be many definitions” of a good deal, but he also seemed to lower expectations ahead of Friday's summit.
    


            “I expect to have a meeting with Putin that I think it'll be good, but it might be bad,” Trump said.
    


            House Oversight Chair James Comer praised President Donald Trump for placing Washington, DC, police under federal control and said he plans to follow up with a hearing with city officials when lawmakers return to Washington.
    


            The committee confirmed Monday it had received notification from the White House about the president's federal takeover of DC police.
    


                    President Trump is rightly using executive power to take bold and necessary action to crack down on crime and restore law and order in Washington, DC.
                


                    Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky
                


            Comer said the committee will hold a congressional hearing in September with DC District Attorney General Brian Schwalb, DC Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Mayor Muriel Bowser. Lawmakers are currently in their home districts for Congress' August recess.
    


            The panel, Comer said, “is also advancing legislative solutions to protect Americans in their capital city.”
    


For context: Trump can retain control of the city's police department for a longer period if he notifies the chairs and ranking members of the congressional committees that handle legislative matters related to Washington, DC, including the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Any request of over 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            As President Donald Trump formally declared a public safety emergency in Washington, DC, and federalized the local police, one significant budget issue facing the city went without mention Monday at the White House.
    


            House Republicans have yet to restore $1 billion in funding for the District of Columbia, following a budgetary fight in Congress earlier this year. The Senate passed a funding bill that restored funding, but the measure stalled in the House and remains in procedural limbo. Local leaders have warned the hole could result in cuts to a wide range of city services, including police.
    


            The White House urged the House to “immediately” pass the fix. Speaker Mike Johnson said in May that he would work to pass the bill “as quickly as possible,” but no action has been taken on the matter for months.
    


            “I don't like being up here, talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was,” Trump said Monday, delivering a bleak and blistering assessment of Washington, DC, despite police statistics that show falling violent crime.
    


            The budget fight in Congress left a hole of about $1 billion after DC was forced to revert to last year's funding levels for the city.
    


            In March, the Senate approved a measure to allow Washington, DC, to maintain control over its funds after Democrats warned the Republican funding package would cut $1.1 billion of the city's funding.
    


            Instead of taking up that measure, the House passed a series of Republican policies in June to impose on the Democratic-run city, including a bill that would prohibit non-US citizens from voting in the district that was never taken up by the Senate.
    


            President Donald Trump said he's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday to see what the parameters of a peace deal could be before he speaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders.
    


            “I'm going to meet with President Putin and we're going to see what he has in mind, and if it's a fair deal I'll reveal it to the European Union leaders and to the NATO leaders and also to President Zelensky,” Trump said, noting that he'll call Zelensky first “out of respect.”
    


            But Trump stressed that it's not up to him to make a deal.
    


            “I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both,” Trump said, adding that the next meeting should include both Putin and Zelensky.
    


            And he cautioned that Friday's meeting may not necessarily result in any movement.
    


            “Now I may leave and say ‘good luck' and that'll be the end. I may say, ‘This is not going to be settled,'” Trump said.
    


            “I mean there are those that believe that Putin wanted all of Ukraine. I happen to be one of them by the way,” Trump said.
    


            President Donald Trump left the door open to further extending a trade truce with China, saying Monday that he's been “dealing very nicely” with the nation.
    


            “We'll see what happens,” Trump said during a White House press briefing. “They've been dealing quite nicely. The relationship is very good with President Xi and myself.”
    


Some context: The current 90-day pause on a series of aggressive trade penalties that the two countries agreed to in May is set to expire on Tuesday.
    


            US and Chinese officials have since suggested that the truce could be extended, though the two sides have yet to reach a formal agreement.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, telling reporters at the White House that officials will make a decision in the “next few weeks.”
    


            “We're only looking at that,” Trump said. “That's early.”
    


                    “Some people like it. Some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana, because if it does bad for the children, it does bad for people that are older than children. But we're looking at reclassification,” Trump said.
                





Some context: CNN reported last week that Trump is privately mulling how to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.
    


            This would move marijuana from its classification as a Schedule 1 drug to Schedule 3, which includes “drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
    


            Nearly a year ago, Trump suggested his return to the White House would usher in a new era for marijuana, one that would make it easier for adults to access safe products and give states greater leeway to pursue legalization. He signaled support for removing marijuana from the same legal category as dangerous narcotics like heroin. The pronouncement set him apart from many of his Republican predecessors and came as Trump courted younger Americans, minority groups and libertarian-leaning voters.
    


            Charles Allen, a member of the DC Council, quickly slammed President Donald Trump's move to take over the capital's police force, writing on social media Monday that the action is an “extreme, outrageous, and dangerous move for our city and the safety of all our residents.”
    


            Allen, who represents an area of DC that includes parts of downtown and the Capitol Hill neighborhood, wrote that “today's announcement will put untrained and unaccountable members of the military in an untenable position in our communities.”
    


                    “Over the last two years, DC has experienced a 52% drop in violent crime and is now at a 30-year low. While any crime is one too many, every local leader in DC is committed to the work and progress of safer communities and preventing violence,” Allen wrote.
                





            He concluded: “It's unnecessary, unwarranted, & a dangerous escalation of power in the Nation's Capital simply because he can.”
    


Some context: Trump has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC. But so far this year, overall crime numbers are lower than in 2024, according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC's Metropolitan Police Department — following a  similar trend of declining crime rates in major US cities.
    


            President Donald Trump said the Department of Defense stands ready to deploy active-duty military to address crime in Washington, but added that he doesn't think it'll be necessary.
    


                    “You're going to have a lot of essentially military — and we will bring in the military if it's needed, by the way,” Trump told reporters in the White House Briefing Room. “We're going to have National Guard, but (Defense Secretary) Pete Hegseth will tell you about, we will bring in the military, if needed… I don't think we'll need it, I think we've got so many great people, including the people that are in the police department.”
                





            Trump later added that “if necessary, we're going to move service members directly to joining the guardsmen.”
    


            Per Hegseth, the operationalization of the National Guard will be led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.
    


            “You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week,” Hegseth said Monday. “At your direction as well, sir, there are other units we are prepared to bring in — other National Guard units, other specialized units.”
    


            President Donald Trump said that his administration is going to change the statues relating to cash bail in cities like New York City, Chicago and Washington, DC.
    


            “This dire public safety crisis stems directly from the abject failures of the city's local leadership. The ‘radical left' city council adopted no cash bail. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster. That's what started the problem,” Trump claimed at a news conference.
    


            DC largely removed cash bail in 1992.
    


            Referencing New York and Chicago, Trump said they would “change the statue” regarding cash bail systems with the help of Congress.
    


            “We're going to end that in Chicago,” Trump said. “We're going to change the statute, and I'm going to have to get the Republicans to vote, because the Democrats are weak on crime.”
    


            “But we're going to change no cash bail. We're going to change the statute and get rid of some of the other things, and we'll count on the Republicans in Congress and Senate to vote,” Trump added.
    


            President Donald Trump said he's embarrassed that he has to address crime in Washington, DC, ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.
    


                    “It's embarrassing for me to be up here. You know I'm going to see Putin,” Trump told reporters at the White House this morning, adding that, “I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was.”
                





            US officials are rushing to finalize the details of a summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska on Friday.
    


            It was Trump's decision to call Monday's event to talk about crime in DC, where so far this year, overall crime numbers are lower than last year's, according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC's Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            President Donald Trump said he is designating Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            Trump said that Cole is one of the “top in the country” and told him to run the department “tough.”
    


            Cole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23. During his confirmation process, Trump touted Cole's work in Virginia overseeing 11 state public safety agencies with more than 19,000 employees.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday announced the federal government would take control of the DC Metropolitan Police Department to address crime.
    


            The Home Rule Act of 1973 allows the president to take control of the city's police for 48 hours if he “determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist,” which requires the department's use for federal purposes. Trump said Monday he was declaring a public safety emergency.
    


            Before Monday, there had never been a federal takeover of DC police under the Home Rule Act.
    


            The president can retain control of the department for a longer period if he notifies the chairs and ranking members of the congressional committees that handle legislative matters pertaining to DC. It is not clear whether the president has taken that step.
    


            Any request of control over the city's police department for over 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is placing the DC Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to the city, saying the move is aimed at restoring order in the nation's capital.
    


            “I'm officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, you know what that is, and placing the DC Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control,” Trump said during a White House news conference.
    


            The president told a crowd of reporters that his actions come as “something's out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly, like we did on the southern border.”
    


            Trump also announced the deployment of National Guard troops to assist local law enforcement.
    


            “I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC, and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,” Trump added.
    


            The Home Rule Act of 1973 allows the president to take control of the city's police for 48 hours if he “determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist,” which requires the department's use for federal purposes. The president can retain control of the department for a longer period if he notifies the chairs and ranking members of the congressional committees that handle legislative matters pertaining to DC. Any request of control over the city's police department for over 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            The president indicated he intends to extend the federal takeover beyond the initial 48-hour window and will formally notify the relevant parties.
    


            “I'll be making the appropriate notifications to Congress and to the mayor,” Trump said.
    


            “We will have full, seamless, integrated cooperation at all levels of law enforcement, and will deploy officers across the district with an overwhelming presence,” he added.
    


            Officers, Trump said, will have authority to do “whatever the hell they want,” he said, adding this will go beyond the country's capital. “We're not going to lose our cities over this, and this will go further.”
    


            Flanked by top administration officials, Trump also vowed to take aggressive action to address homelessness and blight in the capital. “We have slums here. We're getting rid of them. I know it's not politically correct,” Trump said.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            President Donald Trump is expected to announce the activation of hundreds of DC National Guard troops this morning as part of his effort to address crime in the nation's capital, two US officials told CNN.
    


            The DC National Guard forces are expected to be providing safety and security support to law enforcement, though one of the officials said many of the operational specifics still remain unclear, such as where they will be placed throughout the city, what their command-and-control chain will be, and for how long they will be activated.
    


            Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are expected to be at the announcement with Trump.
    


            The official said up to roughly 800 troops in the DC National Guard are expected to be activated. Among the subordinate units of the DC Guard is a military police battalion, complete with maintenance and medical support, and an aviation support battalion.
    


            While National Guard units around the country report to their state's governors, the DC National Guard falls under the authority of the president, which is typically delegated to the secretary of the Army.
    


            President Donald Trump says he will announce a plan Monday morning to make Washington, DC, “GREAT AGAIN!” and “stop violent crime” in the nation's capital.
    


            As president, Trump has broad authority over parts of the city's affairs, including aspects of law enforcement. But he will need approval from Congress to exert control over DC in the way he says he wants to.
    


            There are dozens of federal law enforcement agencies in the city that answer to the Trump administration, and the president has already ordered a surge of hundreds of federal officers supplement the city's police department in some neighborhoods.
    


            Those include plans for scores of FBI agents to patrol the city's streets. Trump also has the authority as president to deploy the DC National Guard.
    


            DC is managed under Home Rule, a 1973 law that gave Congress oversight and authority over the capital city but allowed district residents to have some control over how it is run.
    


            This law would need to be overturned if Trump wants to completely federalize the district, but such a move is unlikely to happen under today's closely divided Congress. Trump has said he wants his administration to look into turning over Home Rule.
    


            Still, the law does allow the president to temporarily take over the city's police department.
    


            “Washington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today!” he said Monday morning on Truth Social.
    


            US officials are rushing to finalize details ahead of Friday's summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, with both logistical and geopolitical issues still unsettled four days ahead of the momentous sit-down.
    


            As of Monday, no venue for the summit had been announced. Administration officials were still making their way to Alaska — selected for its centrality to Washington and Moscow — to scope out where, exactly, the US and Russian presidents would meet.
    


            Officials were also working to clarify the contours of the two men's expected discussion, which Trump hopes can yield significant progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.
    


            And a number of questions hang over the preparations. Among them: whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would be invited.
    


            Ukrainian officials made clear Zelensky was prepared to travel to Alaska if invited by Trump. But they also acknowledged much would hinge on how the Trump-Putin meeting unfolds.
    


            President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day” in Washington, DC, in a social media post this morning ahead of a White House news conference.
    


                    “LIBERATION DAY IN D.C. WE ARE TAKING OUR CAPITAL BACK!!!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.






            Trump is expected to speak this morning on safety in the nation's capital, though he has yet to provide specific details. It comes despite a preliminary year-to-date comparison from DC Police showing that 2025 crime numbers in the city are lower than last year's.
    


            Trump has threatened to assert federal control over the capital city, following an assault last week on a well-known employee of the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            The president claimed the country's capital “will be liberated today” in a follow-up social media post on Monday.
    


            “Washington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today! Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR. I will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN! The days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER! I quickly fixed the Border (ZERO ILLEGALS in last 3 months!), D.C. is next!!!” Trump wrote.



            President Donald Trump has called a news conference at the White House today to address his federal crackdown on Washington, DC.
    


            In a series of posts on social media over the weekend, Trump claimed his announcement — scheduled for 10 a.m. ET in the press briefing room — will “essentially stop violent crime” in the nation's capital.
    


            He also said he will announce “Beautification” and “Cleanliness” efforts, which would apparently involve removing homeless people from the city.
    


            “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital,” Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday.  “The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong. It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border.”
    


            The post included pictures of tents and trash throughout the city.
    


            The president said DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is “a good person who has tried,” but claimed the city “only gets dirtier and less attractive.”
    


            We'll be covering the press conference as it happens today. Stay with us for the latest.
    


Some context: The Trump administration ordered an increase of federal law enforcement in the US capital last week, deploying officials from different agencies in a push to crack down on crime.
    


            In announcing the increase, the White House pointed to several high-profile crimes in DC, including the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff members in May.
    


            But according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC Police, 2025 crime numbers are lower than last year's.
    


            The federal government's plans for a surge of law enforcement in Washington calls for up to 130 FBI agents to patrol with officers from the city-run DC Metropolitan Police Department, according to one person familiar.
    


            President Donald Trump launched the initiative last week with a White House official saying Saturday up to 450 federal law enforcement officers are expected participate.
    


            It's not typical for FBI agents to patrol with local police departments. The Washington Post first reported on the use of FBI agents.

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro on Monday said the federal government needs to "go after" the District of Columbia city council for its "weak" laws on youth criminals.

Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., vowed to "change the laws" in D.C. to crack down on what she described as a surge of young people committing violent crimes in the nation's capital — part of a broader effort President Donald Trump announced Monday that includes deploying hundreds of National Guard troops and temporarily seizing control of D.C. police. 

Speaking at a White House press briefing Monday, Pirro lamented the share of crime in D.C. she said is being committed by so-called "young punks" in the city, whom she said are often granted probation or other lenient sentences due to their age. 

"That changes today," Pirro vowed, flanked by President Trump and other Cabinet members.

"I see too much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can get together in gangs and crews and beat the [heck] out of you or anyone else," Pirro said. "They don't care where they are."

"But they know that we can't touch them, because the laws are weak," she said. "I can't touch you if you're 14, 15, 16, 17 years old, and you have a gun." 

"We need to go after the DC Council and their absurd laws. We need to get rid of this concept of 'no cash bail,'" she said. "We need to recognize that the people who matter are the law-abiding citizens," Pirro added. "And it starts today."

Pirro's remarks came during a broader press conference during which Trump also vowed to deploy hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the nation's capital, in a bid to "reestablish law order and public safety" in D.C.

Trump vowed on Truth Social just one day earlier to evict homeless persons from that nation's capital. "The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY," Trump said on social media.

"We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong," he said on Truth Social.

Violent crime in Washington, D.C., is currently down to a 30-year low.

President Donald Trump announced the federal takeover of Washington D.C.'s police force during a Monday press conference. Trump had been weighing various options to make changes in Washington, and he is also calling up National Guard troops to the city.

Covered by: Anders Hagstrom

President Donald Trump announced the federalization of Washington, D.C.'s police force on Monday, an unprecedented move taken by no prior U.S. president.

Trump also called up the National Guard to bolster D.C.'s police force in the coming days.

Trump declared his announcement "liberation day" for America's capital.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries argued crime in Washington, D.C. is not a major issue on Monday after President Donald Trump federalized the Metropolitan Police Department.

Jeffries released a statement on X following Trump's unprecedented move, which included calling for the deployment of some 800 National Guardsmen to the city.


"Violent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low. Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost," Jeffries wrote.





D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb condemned President Donald Trump's takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department on Monday.

Schwalb argued that the law Trump used to take over the police force should not apply, due to there being no crime emergency in the nation's capital in his view.

"The Administration's actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful," Schwalb wrote on X. "There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year."


"We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents," he continued.

Trump federalized the MPD under the Home Rule Act, which allows the president to take over the force for a up to 30 days if certain Congressional Committees are notified.





President Donald Trump predicted that "land swapping" would likely play a role in any potential peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine on Monday.

Trump made the statement during a press conference ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Trump criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for appearing unwilling to agree to such a swap.


"I was a little, bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, well, I have to get constitutional approval," Trump said, adding that he knows "through Russia" that "there will be some swapping."

We're going to change the lines. The battle lines. Russia's occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They've occupied some very prime territory. We're going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine. But they've taken some very prime territory," Trump said, noting in particular Russia's occupation of much of Ukraine's coast.





President Donald Trump suggested that he will know within the first two minutes of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin
 whether a deal can be made to end the war in Ukraine.

Trump made the claim during a wide-ranging press conference at the White House on Monday. Trump also said he would be speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as European leaders ahead of the meeting.

"We're going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin. And at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made," Trump said.


"I go into that thing fully loaded right up there, and we're going to see what happens. Now, I think one of two things is going to happen. It could be a good meeting, and we'll go a step further. We'll get it done. I'd like to see a ceasefire very, very quickly, very quick. I'd like to see it immediately, but I'd like to see it very quickly. And, we're going to be dealing with the European leaders and, we're going to be dealing with President Zelensky and hopefully we're going to have a great success," he added.





President Donald Trump put Chicago and New York City on notice Monday as he declared a federal takeover of Washington's police force to crack down on crime.

Trump and several of his top cabinet officials lamented the state of the nation's capital, with "young punks" committing violent crimes and homelessness visible on nearly every street. He then called out Chicago and New York City, saying he may intervene there as well if they don't address their own crime and homelessness issues.


"I'm going to look at New York in a little while. Let's do this. Let's do this together. Let's see. It's going to go pretty quickly," Trump said.

"And if we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago, which is a disaster. We have a mayor there who is totally incompetent. He's an incompetent man. And we have an incompetent governor there. [J.B.] Pritzker's an incompetent. His family threw him out of the business, and he ran for governor. And now I understand he wants to be president, but I noticed he lost a little weight. So maybe he has a chance. You know, you never know what happens," he continued.

Trump's threat comes as New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani
 has centered his campaign around opposition to Trump.





U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro vowed that criminals in the nation's capital are "not going to get away with it anymore" as President Trump administration announced a crime crackdown.

Pirro called out "young punks" for committing violent crimes across the city and making Americans fear to bring their families to experience the history of the nation's capital.

"I see too much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can get together in gangs and crews and beat the hell out of you or anyone else. They don't care where they are. They can be in Dupont Circle, but they know that we can't touch them," Pirro said, going on to blame "weak" laws.


"I can't touch you if you're 14, 15, 16, 17 years old and you have a gun. I convict someone of shooting another person with an illegal gun on a public bus, in the chest, with intent to kill. I convict him. You know what the judge gives him? Probation. Says you should go to college," she added.

Pirro went on to say the federal government needs to "go after" the D.C. city council and end its "absurd laws."

President Donald Trump announced his picks to lead reform after federalizing Washington, D.C.'s police force on Monday.

Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi will command the Metropolitan Police Department, and Terry Cole will serve as interim D.C. police commissioner. Cole has been serving as head of the Drug Enforcement Agency since his swearing-in ceremony last month.


"Our new DEA administrator, who is one of the top in the country. He better be, Terry, if you're not I'm going to get rid of you so fast, Terry Cole," Trump said. "We just just got him, the most highly recommended person. And, you'll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department. Okay? And you run them tough. They're good. You have a lot of good people. You have people that should be there. You also have people that shouldn't be there."





President Donald Trump rejected claims that more police are needed to effectively keep the peace in the nation's capital on Monday.

Trump, announcing the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, said he'd heard complaints of a lack of staffing among the police force, but argued the problem was with leadership, not with numbers.


"I was told today, sir, they want more police. I heard a number, 3,500 police. That's a lot of police, 3,500. I thought they're going to say we only have 30 policemen or women. They said we have 3500. We need more. You don't need more. That's so many I never heard. That's like an army," Trump said.

"How could you need more than three thousand? It just happened two minutes ago, sir. They've requested more police. What do they have? About 3,500. I said 3,500--this is not a big area. It's ridiculous. What you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them. And we have the right people here that I can tell you," Trump added.

Trump spoke alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials. The president installed Terry Cole as interim D.C. police commissioner on Monday. Cole has served as the administrator for the Drug Enforcement Agency since his swearing-in in July.

President Donald Trump pointed to no-cash bail as a major source of crime problems in Washington, D.C. on Monday.

Trump made the statement during his press conference announcing the federal takeover of the capital's police force, saying cashless bail is a root of lawlessness from Chicago to New York City.

"This dire public safety crisis stems directly from the abject failures of the city's local leadership. The radical left City Council adopted no cash bail," Trump said. "Every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster. That's what started the problem in New York. And they don't change it. They don't want to change it. That's what started it in Chicago. I mean, bad politicians started it, bad leadership, started it. But that was the one thing that's central. No-cash bail. Somebody murders somebody and they're out on no-cash bail before the day is out."


Trump went on to say the state of America's capital is embarrassing for him as the head of state, referencing his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.





President Donald Trump
 announced a federal takeover of Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department on Monday, one of the most drastic measures he could have taken to address what he has described as rampant crime in the city.

Trump said he is also deploying 800 members of the National Guard to the city. Trump's authority to take over D.C. police is rooted in Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act.

"This is liberation day in D.C., and we're gonna take our capital back," Trump told reporters at the White House.

Flanking Trump during the press conference were Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Hegseth said the National Guard troops would deploy "in the coming week."





President Donald Trump
 is weighing whether to deploy up to 1,000 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., as early as this week, Fox News has learned, in an effort to help deal with what he characterized as a surge in violent crime. 

The plans come just one day after Trump vowed on Truth Social to evict homeless persons from that nation's capital. "The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY," Trump said on social media. "We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong."

Trump's plans, which are expected to be detailed further at a 10 a.m. press conference Monday, would likely involve members of the D.C. National Guard, or the 2,700-member National Guard force that acts at the express authority of the commander in chief.

Unlike other branches, Trump would not have to get the sign off of local authorities to act — likely making their activation a tempting option.


When speaking to reporters in the Oval Office last week, Trump railed against what he described as a "ridiculous" level of crime in the nation's capital, buffeted most recently by the assault on a former DOGE staffer earlier this month.

Trump also told reporters that his White House lawyers are looking into ending the Home Rule Act, a law passed by Congress in 1973 that gave Washington, D.C., residents the right to elect their own mayor and local representatives. 

Trump is expected to address those plans in a press conference Monday morning.

President Donald Trump has directed federal law enforcement to increase its presence throughout Washington, D.C. amid his efforts to crack down on crime in the city.


The operation, which uses both local and federal law enforcement agencies, including Homeland Security Investigations, the FBI, DEA and others, began August 7 and will initially last for seven days with the option to extend "as needed."

In a statement to Fox News, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced "there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C."

"Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long," Leavitt said. "President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C."

She added, "President Trump is committed to making our Nation's capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world."

Authorities announced the arrest of two teens in connection with the brutal beating of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) last week, an incident that drew President Donald Trump's attention to the crime and homelessness in the nation's capital.

The victim, Edward Coristine, nicknamed "Big Balls," was assaulted around 3:00 a.m. August 4 by a group of teenagers in the city's Logan Circle neighborhood. The teens attempted to carjack him and a woman, whom police identified as his significant other, according to authorities.

Police said Coristine pushed the woman into the vehicle for safety and turned to confront the group. At least several of the teens then attacked him, police said, until officers patrolling nearby intervened. As officers moved toward the group, the teens fled on foot.


Coristine, one of the most visible figures of President Donald Trump's DOGE, was left bloodied in the attack, according to a photo the president shared on his Truth Social platform.

President Donald Trump is considering the deployment of up to 1,000 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. as part of his plan to clean up the nation's capital, Fox News has learned.

The troops would most likely be called up from the D.C. National Guard, a U.S. official told Fox. Trump is expected to announce concrete plans during a press conference at the White House scheduled for 10 am Monday.


Trump said on social media on Sunday that the news conference on crime and "beautification" will "not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation's Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital."

Trump described D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser – who publicly clashed with Trump during the George Floyd riots in 2020 – "a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive."

President Donald Trump vowed to rid Washington, D.C. of "crime, savagery, filth and scum" on Monday ahead of a planned press conference in the nation's capital.


Trump is expected to announce measures to combat crime and homelessness in the city, ranging from deploying federal law enforcement to taking direct control over the the city's government.

Trump may also deploy National Guard troops to patrol the city.

"Washington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today! Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR. I will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN! The days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER! I quickly fixed the Border (ZERO ILLEGALS in last 3 months!), D.C. is next!!! Thank you for your attention to this matter," Trump shared on Truth Social on Monday.

President Donald Trump announced Aug. 11, 2025, during a press conference from the White House that he is federalizing the Washington, D.C., police and deploying the National Guard to address spiraling crime issues.

President Donald Trump claimed crimes in Washington, D.C., trounce data from notoriously violent cities in nations such as Mexico and Colombia during his Monday morning press conference announcing he is federalizing the D.C. police department to curb spiraling violence. 

"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher," Trump said Monday. "This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse." 

Trump whipped out charts showing the media that the nation's capital allegedly suffers worse crime trends than other cities worldwide, calling on them to "take a look at numbers" as he rattled off the data's findings. 

"Look at these. Baghdad is … we doubled up on Baghdad. Panama City, Brasilia, San Jose, Costa Rica, Bogota, Colombia. Heavy drugs. Mexico City, I mentioned Lima, Peru, all double and triple what they are. So do you want to live in places like that? I don't think so. I don't think so. And I think the people in this room, if you wrote correctly, you'd see. Look at the kind of numbers we have. D.C. 41 per 100,000 (for homicides in 2023). Number one that we can find anywhere in the world. Other cities are pretty bad, but they're not as bad as that. That the way you want to live? The reporters of the world? Juvenile offenders and crimes against persons as they say, it's getting worse, not getting better. It's getting worse," he continued. 

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

(Jonathan Ernst/Reuters) (Reuters)

The White House directed Fox Digital to a pair of graphs published on the White House Rapid Response's X account on Monday when asked for copies of the charts, data and its citations. The graphs published to X show D.C.'s murder rate in 2024 sat at 27.54 per 100,000, according to FBI data – reportedly higher than the stats in cities such as Bogota and Mexico City. 

The nation overall saw an uptick in violent crimes in 2020, when protests and riots broke out in cities across the nation at the height of the pandemic. That year notched a nearly 30% increase in murders compared to the year prior, according to FBI data, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.

The nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June. 

Trump announced Monday that he was federalizing the local police department starting Monday under section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume emergency control of the capital's police force.

Local police chiefs are sounding off after viral footage of a brutal Cincinnati assault shined new light on what local leaders are saying is a consistent failure regarding violent offenders being released onto the city's streets. 

In a statement released by the Hamilton County Association of Chiefs of Police on Aug. 8, the organization blasted local leaders for "gaps in the judicial process" within the local government. 

"It is not enough to arrest violent offenders if they are swiftly released back into our neighborhoods due to lax bail practices or insufficient sentencing," the statement said.

The association vowed to host a roundtable discussion with local leaders within the next 30 days to address the community's concerns regarding safety after the July 26 beatdown on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets left six injured and led to six arrests. 

"The goal is to foster open, solution-focused dialogue around strengthening public safety while ensuring fairness and integrity across the entire justice process," the statement said. 

The update comes as police response time to the fight has been heavily criticized after Cincinnati Police Chief Theresa Theetge revealed only 11 officers were stationed downtown when the beatdown occurred. 

CINCINNATI MAYOR UNDER FIRE FOR POLICE MANAGEMENT AFTER VIRAL BEATING EXPOSES LAX BAIL LAWS

The city's bail policies have also come under fire from Republican mayoral challenger Cory Bowman, who is looking to unseat incumbent Mayor Aftab Pureval, a Democrat, in the upcoming election. 

"There are things from City Hall that are showing that the police are not supported the way they need to," Bowman, Vice President JD Vance's half-brother, told Fox News Digital. "They are unable to do their jobs because they've been told time and time again that they have to use restraint in certain things instead of enforcing the law. They're told to dial back, and then what happens is that we have prosecutors and judges that have a catch-and-release system."

While citywide data indicates crime throughout Cincinnati has remained on par with last year's numbers, Bowman echoed the sentiments of the police department, blaming the city's leadership for the reason police feel unsupported while carrying out their duties. 

"So many officers have come to me, and they've said they don't even see a point in making arrests because the criminals are just going to be back on the streets the very next day," Bowman said. "We have to put pressure on all the judges and prosecutors, and we have to be able to let the officers know, ‘Do your job, see your training and do your job properly, and you're going to have all of City Hall to back you up in that circumstance." 

On Friday, a grand jury indicted the six individuals arrested in connection with the violent assault that sent shockwaves through the community.

Patrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, are each charged with three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital. 

Merriweather was previously indicted just two weeks before the violent attack for allegedly receiving stolen property, weapons under disability, improper transportation of a firearm and other charges, according to the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) Queen City Lodge #69. 

The order also revealed that at the time of the beatdown, Merriweather was out of jail on $4,000 bond, though he only needed to post 10% – or $400 – to be released. 

"This is your court system," the FOP said in a social media post. 

The association is looking to fellow leaders within Cincinnati's government to provide further transparency surrounding bail laws as they look to keep violent offenders off the streets.

"Just as law enforcement is held to high standards and evaluated on our daily practices, we must also understand the outcomes taking place in courtrooms and who is responsible for them," the association said. "Let us be clear: we will not allow the dedication and sacrifice of our law enforcement professionals to be rendered meaningless by systemic failures or the absence of shared responsibility."

A federal judge on Monday denied a request from the Trump administration to unseal grand jury material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and is the longtime associate of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

In a 31-page order issued Monday morning, Judge Paul Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the Justice Department‘s bid to release the transcripts and exhibits from the grand jury in Maxwell's prosecution. Grand jury records are typically kept under seal, but prosecutors argued the circumstances of Maxwell's case warranted an exception. Engelmayer dismissed that claim.

“The Government's invocation of special circumstances, however, fails at the threshold,” Engelmayer wrote. “Its entire premise — that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them — is demonstrably false.”

After reviewing the records, Engelmayer said they contained “virtually nothing … that isn't public already” and would “not reveal new information of any consequence.” He added that anyone expecting significant revelations “would come away feeling disappointed and misled,” concluding there was “no ‘there' there.”

In a particularly sharp rebuke, Engelmayer said “the one colorable argument” for unsealing the transcripts would be to “expose as disingenuous the Government's public explanations” for requesting their release.

Maxwell, who has maintained her innocence, was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and related charges for helping Epstein recruit and abuse underage girls. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Authorities ruled it was suicide, which has since fueled years of speculation, conspiracy theories, and renewed demands for transparency.

Maxwell was recently transferred to a minimum-security prison in Texas following an interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a move that has drawn scrutiny amid her cooperation with the DOJ. Efforts to secure her testimony before the House Oversight Committee have since been postponed while the Supreme Court weighs whether to hear her appeal at its Sept. 29 long conference.

Maxwell's petition argues that her prosecution violated a nonprosecution agreement Epstein obtained from federal prosecutors in Florida in the 2000s, which she said should have shielded her from charges. The DOJ has urged the justices to reject her case.

COMER CONFIDENT IN TRUMP VOW TO RELEASE EPSTEIN FILES AFTER SUBPOENA: ‘I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD'

In July, a judge in Florida declined to unseal transcripts related to a criminal case brought against Epstein for sex charges in the early 2000s.

A separate judge in New York is still weighing whether to release grand jury files from his 2019 sex trafficking charges, which never went to trial before authorities found Epstein dead in his cell on Aug. 10 of that year.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Ukraine and its European backers on Monday sought talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in an effort to protect their security interests ahead of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has so far been excluded from the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska on Friday, and the Europeans are unlikely to be invited. All are wary that Putin and Trump might agree, without Ukraine's participation, to land swaps of Ukraine's territory or other terms that might favor Russia. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz organized a series of meetings for Wednesday. He invited Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Zelenskyy, NATO's chief and several European leaders to attend. The chancellery said the talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” as well as “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security.”

The European Commission confirmed that President Ursula von der Leyen will take part “in the calls organized by Chancellor Merz.” The leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Italy and Poland are also set to join the “various discussion groups,” the chancellery said.

Ukraine and its backers in Europe insist that Trump and Putin cannot decide on land swaps behind their backs at the summit, but the Europeans concede that Moscow is unlikely to give up control of Ukrainian land it holds.




“There'll be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff for both,” Trump told reporters on Monday.

He did not confirm whether he would take part in the talks convened by Merz, but said: “I'm going to get everybody's ideas” before meeting with Putin.

Concerns have mounted in Europe that Kyiv may be pressed to give up land or accept other curbs on its sovereignty. Ukraine and its European allies reject the notion that Putin should lay claim to any territory even before agreeing to a ceasefire. They want a ceasefire first.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Europe lawmakers say the US and Russia cannot agree to a deal on Ukraine land swaps.

In Europe, a “coalition of the willing” has been formed by countries ready to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Merz are organizing a coalition meeting, also on Wednesday, to coordinate.

Poland is also part of that coalition. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said “it must be obvious to Poland and our European partners — and I hope to all of NATO — that state borders cannot be changed by force.” Any land swaps or peace terms “must be agreed upon with Ukraine's participation,” he said, according to Polish news agency PAP.

Still, it's hard to ignore the reality on the ground.




Russia in 2022 illegally annexed the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Ukraine's east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south, even though it doesn't fully control them. It also occupies the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014.

On the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, Russia's bigger army has made slow but costly progress with its summer offensive. The relentless pounding of urban areas has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to U.N. estimates.

“In the end, the issue of the fact that the Russians are controlling at this moment, factually, a part of Ukraine has to be on the table” in any peace talks after the Alaska summit, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on CBS on Sunday.

Rutte said Ukraine's Western backers “can never accept that in a legal sense,” but he suggested that they might tacitly acknowledge Russian control.

He compared it to the way that the U.S. hosted the diplomatic missions of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from 1940 to 1991, “acknowledging that the Soviet Union was controlling those territories, but never accepting (it) in a legal sense.”

Giving up any territory, especially without a ceasefire agreement first, would be almost impossible for Zelenskyy to sell at home after thousands of troops have died defending their land.

Ultimately, Putin is seen by some analysts as being not so much interested in land itself, but rather in a more “Russia-friendly” Ukraine with a malleable government unlikely to try to join NATO, just as pro-Russian breakaway regions in Georgia have complicated that country's quest to become a member.

Zelenskyy insists that a halt to fighting on the front line should be the starting point for negotiations, and the Europeans back him. They say that any future land swaps should be for Ukraine to decide and not be a precondition for a ceasefire.

Claims on land could also be part of negotiations on the kind of security guarantees that Ukraine might receive to ensure another war does not break out.

The Europeans believe Kyiv's best defense is strong armed forces to deter Russia from striking again. They insist there should be no restrictions on the size of Ukraine's army and the equipment, arms and ammunition it can possess or sell.

Beyond that, they say Ukraine should not be constrained in its choice of joining the EU or being forced to become a neutral country.

The Trump administration has already taken Ukraine's membership of NATO off the table for the foreseeable future.

For the Europeans, maintaining unity is also key. After chairing a meeting of foreign ministers on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said they had agreed to “work on more sanctions against Russia, more military support for Ukraine and more support for Ukraine's budgetary needs.”

“Transatlantic unity, support to Ukraine and pressure on Russia is how we will end this war and prevent future Russian aggression in Europe,” Kallas posted on social media.

President Donald Trump announced plans Aug. 11, 2025, to deploy the National Guard and to takeover the Metropolitan Police Department to address crime in the nation's capital.

President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is activating approximately 800 National Guard troops and is taking over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington, after beefing up federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital Saturday. 

"I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC," Trump told reporters at a Monday press conference. "And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly."

Trump also said that he would federalize the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to respond to crime, placing it under the authority of Attorney General Pam Bondi. 

National Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and are typically overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from California to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to dispatch the troops. 

The federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard. 

President Donald Trump speaks to the press, accompanied by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, about deploying federal law enforcement agents to bolster the local police presence, at the White House, in Washington, Aug. 11, 2025.  (Reuters)

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will operationalize the D.C. National Guard, and signaled that more National Guard troops could be roped into the deployment down the line. 

"You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week," Hegseth told reporters Monday. "At your direction as well, sir, there are other units we are prepared to bring in. Other National Guard units, other specialized units. They will be strong, they will be tough, and they will stand with their law enforcement partners." 

Trump's remarks come just after he promised Washington would be "LIBERATED" from "Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum" in a post on Truth Social Monday morning. He said in the post that the "days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER!" 

Trump floated the idea of taking over Washington's Metropolitan Police Department and utilizing National Guard troops to manage crime in Washington Wednesday, following the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer on Aug. 3 in Washington's Logan Circle.

"What a shame – rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else, we're not going to let it, and that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly, too," Trump told reporters Wednesday at the White House. 

Trump also told reporters at the time he was open to taking over Washington's Metropolitan Police Department because crime in the nation's capital is "ridiculous." 

While a temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is justified in cases of emergency, Trump's move will likely be challenged in court over whether the situation in Washington qualifies as an emergency. 

Trump has historically railed against violence in Washington, and said Tuesday that crime is "totally out of control" in the nation's capital. 

Meanwhile, crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington's Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.

Washington's Mayor Muriel Bowser challenged Trump's description of the city during an interview with MSNBC Sunday, and voiced concerns about the possibility of activating the National Guard to tackle the city's crime. 

"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false," Bowser said.

"I'm concerned about them not being used efficiently, and I just think that's not the most efficient use of our Guard," Bowser said.

MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Erin formed Monday in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean, just west of the Cabo Verde Islands, as Hurricane Henriette strengthened in the Pacific Ocean well away from Hawaii, forecasters said.

There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect for either storm, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, but Erin could become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season this week.

Erin was about 280 miles (451 kilometers) west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph), the NHC said. It was moving west at about 20 mph (32 kph).

Gradual strengthening was forecast over the next several days.

Hurricane Henriette was a Category 1 storm on Monday. Henriette had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (137 kph), the NHC said, and was about 525 miles (845 kilometers) northwest of Honolulu.

Additional strengthening was possible Monday, with weakening over the next few days.

Also in the Pacific, remnants of what once was Tropical Storm Ivo degenerated on Monday, the NHC said. They were about 615 miles (990 kilometers) west of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico, with no thread to land.

President Donald Trump suggested it is time to federalize law enforcement in the nation's capital city and bring in the National Guard to stamp out rampant crime.

President Donald Trump is weighing whether to deploy up to 1,000 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., as early as this week, Fox News has learned, in an effort to help deal with what he characterized as a surge in violent crime. 

The plans come just one day after Trump vowed on Truth Social to evict homeless persons from that nation's capital. "The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY," Trump said on social media. "We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong."

Trump's plans, which are expected to be detailed further at a 10 a.m. press conference Monday, would likely involve members of the D.C. National Guard, or the 2,700-member National Guard force that acts at the express authority of the commander in chief.

Unlike other branches, Trump would not have to get the sign off of local authorities to act — likely making their activation a tempting option.

When speaking to reporters in the Oval Office last week, Trump railed against what he described as a "ridiculous" level of crime in the nation's capital, buffeted most recently by the assault on a former DOGE staffer earlier this month.

"We want to have a great, safe capital," Trump said last week. "And we're going to have it."

Trump also told reporters that his White House lawyers are looking into ending the Home Rule Act, a law passed by Congress in 1973 that gave Washington, D.C., residents the right to elect their own mayor and local representatives. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters last week that Trump had ordered law enforcement personnel to increase their presence in the capital, though the additional details on the scope and timeframe of that presence remain unclear. 

Trump is expected to address those plans in a press conference Monday morning. 

However, for Trump, delivering on this promise could be fraught with long-term legal complications — in part, because crime in the city is actually down to its lowest point in nearly 30 years.

Violent crime in the first seven months of 2025 has dropped by roughly 26% compared to 2024, according to data compiled by the D.C. Police Department and released earlier this month. Overall, crime in the nation's capital has dropped by roughly 7%.

On Sunday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in an interview with NewsNation that Washington, D.C., "is more violent than Baghdad." 

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, for her part, told MSNBC in an interview Sunday that "Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false."

However, it's not the first time Trump has sought to crack down on crime in the nation's capital — an effort he has returned to frequently, including during his first term in office.

Trump in March signed an executive order, "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force," designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as "filthy," "horribly run" and "crime-ridden," among other things. "We want to have a great, safe capital," he told reporters. "And we're going to have it. And that includes cleanliness and it includes other things."

However, those powers aren't indefinite, experts explained to Fox News Digital.

Trump does have the authority to activate the 2,700-member D.C. National Guard without the approval of local officials. Guard troops provide "mission-ready personnel and units for active duty in the armed services" in Washington, D.C., according to their website.

Beyond that, Trump's ability to exercise authority in the nation's capital is bound by the Home Rule Act. 

In the more than 50 years since that law was passed, "there really hasn't been a serious conversation about ending home rule governance," George Derek Musgrove, a history professor at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County, told Fox News in an interview.

"And the problem with our federal system is that there are places where Trump really doesn't have any supporters, and therefore, with the limits of executive power, really doesn't have that much sway," Musgrove said. "And he's constantly probing for ways around that."

Other options available to Trump aren't without their own limits. In order to call up the local police force for any meaningful length of time, as Trump has suggested, a president must be able to assert "special conditions of an emergency nature," according to the 1970s law.

"If D.C. doesn't get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take federal control," Trump said last week. 

However, that's easier said than done, individuals familiar with the law told Fox News Digital.

"DC is just a tempting target because there's not even a lot of legal gymnastics you have to do in order to exert tremendous power [in a city with ]a 90% Democratic jurisdiction. He has it already," Musgrove said.

"But it is morally questionable, I think, and violates democratic principles," he added.

America's wildfire strategy is falling apart when it's needed most.

This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

Every spring, Forest Service fire leaders meet to plan for the upcoming fire season. This year, some employees were shocked by the blunt remarks made during a meeting with forest supervisors and fire staff officers from across the Intermountain West. “We were told, ‘Help is not on the way,'” said one employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job. “I've never been told that before.”

Agency leaders already knew it might be a bad wildfire season, made worse by having fewer hands available to help out. According to the employee High Country News spoke to, the Forest Service lost at least 1,800 fire-qualified, or “red-carded,” employees through layoffs, deferred resignation, and retirement offers. In total, 4,800 people left the agency.

“We were told: Don't commit to an attack thinking the cavalry is going to come,” the employee said. As fire activity continues to pick up across much of the West, that warning rings true.

The Forest Service claims it recently reached 99 percent of its firefighting hiring goal, with almost 11,300 wildland firefighters. But a recent ProPublica investigation and internal communications obtained by High Country News paint a grimmer picture than what the public is seeing.

ProPublica's review of internal agency data found that more than 4,500 Forest Service firefighting jobs — over one-fourth of all the agency's firefighting jobs — were vacant as of July 17. The Guardian also reported that vacancy rates were highest in the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain Regions, at 39 percent and 37 percent, respectively.

The Department of Agriculture, which houses the Forest Service, disputes this. “ProPublica's analysis doesn't reflect our current fire response capacity,” spokesperson Cat McRae told High Country News in an email. “Their numbers likely come from outdated org charts and unfunded positions.” In an email, ProPublica confirmed that their data excluded unfunded positions. According to McRae, “the Forest Service is fully prepared and operational to protect individuals and communities from wildfires.”

But in a memo shared with HCN, Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz told agency leaders on July 16 that “as expected, the 2025 Fire Year is proving to be extremely challenging.” 

“We know the demand for resources outpaces their availability,” Schultz wrote. He requested that all red-carded employees, including IT and human resource staff, be made available for fire assignments. “We have reached a critical point in our national response efforts, and we must make every resource available.”

Much of the Western US is expected to experience above-normal wildfire activity over the next few months. Already, the Forest Service has asked at least 1,400 people with fire qualifications who had resigned to come back. After all, firefighting is a group effort.

“All those people matter,” said Dave Whittekiend, formerly the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache forest supervisor. “Once it goes beyond an initial attack, it takes all the logistics. It's like setting up a small city.”

Whittekiend, who retired in May, had also attended this spring's planning meeting for forest leaders in Nevada, Utah, and parts of Idaho and Wyoming, where he heard the same warning about limited help. “It was creating a sense of urgency,” he said. “It was pretty direct: ‘We are seeing changes, and so be careful about how you choose your strategies and what you think you might be able to do with a fire.'”

“We were told: Don't commit to an attack thinking the cavalry is going to come.”

Whittekiend pointed out that — even before all the layoffs and resignations this spring — the Forest Service sometimes struggled to get through busy fire seasons. Firefighters have been called in from Canada, Mexico, and Australia when resources are stretched too thin, and sometimes National Guard or military troops are deployed.

“We've never had all the people that we needed in some fire years,” he said. “That's been an ongoing trend. It probably accelerated when a whole bunch of us said, ‘All right, we're out of here'” — including employees in overhead positions, like the people who buy food and organize shower trailers and outhouses for fire camps, as well as staffers who take weather forecasts and do safety checks on firefighting operations. More than 10,530 people are currently assigned to wildfires; as of August 1, there are 35 large fires nationwide.

Meanwhile, just last week, the Department of Agriculture announced a widespread reorganization to further slim down and consolidate the workforce. Fort Collins, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah, were designated as two of the five new “hub” locations and the only offices that will be located in the entire West. The Forest Service will “phase out” the nine regional offices that currently exist, six of which are in the West, over the next year. Standalone research stations will be consolidated into one station in Fort Collins, while the Fire Science Lab in Missoula, Montana, will remain as is.

The elimination of the Forest Service regional offices throughout the West, which divided the territory into the Pacific Northwest, Northern, Rocky Mountain, Southwestern, and Intermountain regions, is expected to cause even more employees to leave. “I'm going to guess that there will be people who will leave rather than move,” Whittekiend said. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that up to half of staff may not relocate, according to Politico.

It's a familiar scene, echoing the lackluster response when the Trump administration moved the Bureau of Land Management's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado, in 2019. Only three out of the 328 employees who were supposed to relocate to the new headquarters actually did so — despite the millions of dollars the reorganization cost.

            That cup of joe that jolts you awake in the morning is pretty safe when it comes to contaminants and toxins, a new investigation has found. Well … almost.
    


            “While some contaminants were present, most were found at minimal levels and well below the European Union's safety limits per 6-ounce serving. This means coffee is generally safe,” said Molly Hamilton, executive director of the nonprofit Clean Label Project, which conducted the investigation into caffeinated coffees.
    


            That's great news because coffee has a stellar résumé: Studies have found drinking about 3 cups of black coffee a day provides health benefits, such as reducing risk for such issues as heart disease, multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, liver disease, prostate cancer, stroke, dementia and more.
    


            But here's the grind — the testing found traces of a worrisome herbicide called glyphosate and one of its byproducts. Glyphosate is a popular herbicide that has been linked to hormone disruptions and neurotoxic effects, including the development of autism and other developmental disorders in children.
    


            The first MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) Commission report, released in May, raised concerns about the impact of glyphosate and other pesticides on children's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory bodies, however, say numerous studies and risk assessments have shown no adverse effects of glyphosate at levels found in the food supply.
    


            In addition to glyphosate, testing found some coffees also contained small amounts of phthalates, a plasticizer found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children's toys.
    


            Phthalates have been linked with reproductive problems, such as genital malformations and undescended testes in baby boys and lower sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to asthma, childhood obesity and cancer.
    


            Testing found the highest levels of phthalates in coffee sold in cans, followed by pods and finally bags. The reason for that isn't yet clear, “so our next study is going to be analyzing the packaging assembly line to discover why there is a change in contaminants,” Hamilton said.
    


            “The Clean Label Project plays an important role in post-market testing for contaminants in everyday consumer products, including this recent report on coffee,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer for the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group that maintains a database on personal care products that contain toxins.
    


            “The higher phthalate levels found in coffee pods and canned coffee suggest that packaging could be a meaningful source of exposure to these chemicals of concern,” Andrews said.
    


            The National Coffee Association, which represents the US coffee industry told CNN that it was “highly irresponsible to mislead Americans about the safety of their favorite beverage.”
    


            “Decades of independent scientific evidence show that coffee drinkers live longer, healthier lives,” NCA President and CEO William “Bill” Murray said in an email.
    


            The Clean Label Project measures levels of heavy metals, pesticides and plasticizers in food and consumer products. The organization also checks to see whether the tested products' labels list those contaminants.
    


            To do the testing, Clean Label obtained samples of coffee from 45 popular brands — which they did not name. Coffee beans were grown in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kenya, Peru and Hawaii.
    


            A certified lab conducted over 7,000 tests looking for pesticides, including glyphosate; heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium; mycotoxins, which are toxic chemical compounds produced by some molds that grow on crops; and phthalates, a plasticizer found in consumer products such as food wrapping, food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children's toys.

            The tests found scant glyphosate, but “significant” amounts of aminomethylphosphonic acid, or AMPA, a byproduct of glyphosate as it breaks down in the environment, according to the report.
    


            The half-life of AMPA is longer than that of glyphosate, which means it can persist in the environment and is easily absorbed by plants from soil and water.  In addition, AMPA has been shown to damage cellular DNA in prostate cells and cause an increased risk of liver inflammation and metabolic disorders in young adults.
    


            Testing found organic coffees bested conventional coffees in total amounts of contaminants, but there was one oddity — there were levels of AMPA in all of the 12 organic coffees tested. Of the 45 samples of conventionally grown coffees, only 29 tested positive for aminomethylphosphonic acid, according to the report.
    


            While certified organic coffee growers cannot use pesticides like glyphosate, it's possible for organic fields to be contaminated by runoff from neighboring conventional farms, Hamilton said.
    


            “Still, the detection of AMPA in 100% of organic samples we tested is definitely a wake-up call,” she said. “We definitely need stronger safeguards and greater transparency in our food system.”
    


            Levels of heavy metals depended on where the coffee was grown. Africa has some of the lowest levels of heavy metals, while the highest were found in Hawaiian coffee. Hawaii, however, is a volcanic island and therefore expected to have more significant levels of heavy metals in the soil.
    


            An analysis also found 100% of the tested coffee samples contained small amounts of acrylamide, a colorless, odorless chemical formed when certain foods are cooked at high temperatures, such as when frying, baking and roasting.
    


            Acrylamide has been linked to cancer in animals when they are exposed to extremely high doses. However, the chemical is not thought to be toxic to humans at small levels of consumption. Despite that, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised manufacturers to attempt to lower levels in the food supply.
    


            Clean Label's testing found levels of acrylamide varied with the degree of roasting of coffee beans. The highest levels of acrylamide were found in medium roasts, followed by light roasts and dark roasts.
    


            “The dark coffees are the best choice because they are roasted at lower temperatures for a longer period of time so acrylamide levels don't rise,” Hamilton explained. “The light coffees are roasted minimally, so here too, acrylamide levels don't build up.
    


            “However, medium roasts have the higher levels of acrylamide because they are roasted at higher temperatures long enough to darken the beans,” she said.
    


            What could a coffee lover take away from the testing?
    


            “When you decide which coffee to buy, choose darker or the lightest roasts in bags or pods and consider where coffee is grown, which can impact the levels of heavy metals,” Hamilton said.
    


            “But I want to stress that it's important to put these findings into context,” she added. “Caffeinated coffee is still one of the cleanest product categories we've ever tested.
    


            “Our report isn't meant to raise alarm or keep consumers from drinking coffee, but rather to empower people on how to choose the cleanest, safest cup of coffee.”

The deputy head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is headed to Iran on Monday, the first visit by an official from the top nuclear watchdog since the United States bombed three of the regime's nuclear sites in June.

The aim of the IAEA's visit is to “determine a framework for cooperation” after Iran suspended its ties with the watchdog in early July, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced on Sunday.

That earlier move from Iran, which came after after the 12-Day War with Israel devastated the regime's top military brass and U.S. strikes set back its nuclear ambitions, has effectively kept its nuclear program in the dark. Shortly before that decision, the regime also banned the head of the IEAE Rafael Grossi from its nuclear sites and removed surveillance cameras from them.

While the scheduled Monday visit signals Iran is willing to reopen lines of communication with the nuclear watchdog, Araghchi was clear that it will not include any inspection of its nuclear sites.

“A deputy director general of Grossi will come to Tehran tomorrow, while there are no plans to visit any nuclear sites until we reach a framework,” he said.

Iran previously reached a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in its war with Israel in late June, just days after the U.S.'s bombing of the nuclear sites.

While the ceasefire remains, the regime has left the door open for a broader peace deal in the Middle East.

In early July, Araghchi laid out a condition for his country to reengage in talks that derailed just before the summer.

“In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations. And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time,” he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously not appeared willing to reenter negotiations with the regime, saying in late June that he would not be offering Iran “anything” while also trashing former President Barack Obama's Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018.

President Donald Trump on Monday said that he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut of the chipmaker's sales to China, but the number came down to 15% after CEO Jensen Huang negotiated with him.

The comments came after news broke over the weekend that Nvidia agreed to pay the federal government a 15% cut in return for receiving export control licenses that will allow it to once again sell the H20 chip to China and Chinese companies. Nvidia's Huang visited Trump in the White House on Friday.

"I said, 'listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country,'" Trump said at a news conference in Washington.

Trump said that Nvidia's H20 is an "old chip that China already has" and is "obsolete." He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance.

"The Blackwell is super-duper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that," Trump said, adding that it was possible to make a deal for a "somewhat enhanced in a negative way" version of Blackwell.

"That's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years," Trump said.

One reason for the U.S. export controls is fear that providing advanced chips to China could allow the foreign power to leapfrog the U.S. in AI capabilities. Many have said that could pose a threat to the national security of the U.S.

Trump said that China already has chips with some similar capabilities to the H20.

Huang has said that it is better for U.S. national security if Chinese AI developers use U.S. technology, and that denying them access to Nvidia chips would actually encourage the Chinese chip industry to develop and catch up.

"He's selling a essentially old chip," Trump said. "Huawei has a similar chip."

The H20 is a Chinese-specific chip that has had its performance slowed down. It is related to Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S. The H20 was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on AI chips in 2023.

In April, the Trump administration said it would require a license to export the H20 chip, and in May, Huang said that "effectively closed" the market off to Nvidia. Huang said that Nvidia was expecting to sell about $8 billion in H20 chips in the July quarter before sales were stopped.

"While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide," an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday.

Trump on Monday also said that Huang plans to visit him again to negotiate export licenses for the Blackwell chips.

"I think he's coming to see me again about that," Trump said.

A White House official confirmed to CNBC that Advanced Micro Devices, the second-place AI chipmaker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish raised the size of its initial public offering.

Bullish is aiming to raise $990 million, offering 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 apiece, and targeting a valuation of $4.8 billion, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company, led by former New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley, had previously marketed 20.3 million shares at a proposed range between $28 and $31 a share and sought a $4.2 billion valuation, per a filing last week.

Bullish granted its underwriters, led by JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup, a 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. Bullish stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol "BLSH."

BlackRock and Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management have indicated interest in purchasing up to $200 million of the shares, according to the updated filing.

Bullish, which also owns the crypto media site CoinDesk, is the latest crypto firm to join the public market, reflecting reinvigorated capital markets driven by investor confidence and increasing regulatory support and clarity from Washington. The stablecoin issuer Circle made its highly successful debut in June. In May, Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital uplisted to the Nasdaq and stock and crypto trading app eToro opened trading to the public.

Crypto custody startup BitGo has confidentially filed for a U.S. listing as has Gemini, the crypto exchange run by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom warned President Donald Trump on Monday that he will push to redraw his state's congressional district maps if Trump does not call on Texas and other Republican-led states to end efforts to redraw their own districts.

"You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make," the Democrat Newsom wrote in a letter to Trump.

Newsom said that the GOP-led states are seeking to redesign their congressional maps to "rig the upcoming midterm elections" to benefit Republican candidates.

If the Republican majority in the Texas legislature is successful in redrawing district maps, it is expected to give their party an additional five seats in the House of Representatives.

Democrats currently need to flip three House seats to win back control of that congressional chamber in the 2026 midterms.

Trump, in an interview last week with CNBC, said that his fellow Republicans are "entitled to five more seats" in the House. Trump accused California and Illinois, which have Democratic-controlled House caucuses, of gerrymandering their congressional districts to maintain that edge.

Newsom, in his letter to Trump, wrote, "This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy."

"This is not what the Founders envisioned, and California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds," Newsom wrote.

"If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states," Newsom wrote.

The governor added that if the other states "call off their redistricting efforts, we will happily do the same."

Newsom's warning is among the starkest examples of Democrats vowing to counter the effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps.

That effort has reached a fever pitch in recent days as Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum needed to advance legislation in the state House.

A number of Democratic lawmakers on Sunday suggested that the party has to "fight back" against the redistricting effort.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday reiterated his warning that the Democratic lawmakers will be arrested upon their return.

"If they want to evade that arrest, they're going to stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years," he said on Fox News.

The push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 elections has also spread to other states, including Indiana.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Newsom's letter.

In this article

Ford on Monday announced it would invest $2 billion in a Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant aimed at rolling out more affordable electric vehicles.

The investment comes on top of $3 billion already planned for a battery park in Michigan. Together the facilities will create or secure nearly 4,000 new jobs, Ford said in a news release.

"We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers," Ford CEO Jim Farley said in the release.

The Detroit automaker's new "Universal EV Program" centered around low-cost EVs will start with a midsize, four-door electric pickup, produced at the Louisville Assembly Plant. That vehicle launch is slated for 2027.

Executives had teased the announcement on the company's latest earnings call as its next "Model T moment." Ford said the starting price of the new EV truck, $30,000, will be roughly the same as the famed Model T, when adjusted for inflation.

Ford noted that lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for the new family of EVs will be assembled in the U.S. and not imported from China.

Farley said during an event in Louisville on Monday that the announcement comes as the automotive industry is at a crossroads because of new technology and competition.

"We knew that the Chinese would be the major player for us globally, companies like BYD, new startups from around the world, big technology has their ambition in the auto space. They're all coming for us, legacy automotive companies," Farley said. "We needed a radical approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle."

The changes also come as Ford and other U.S. manufacturers are navigating shifting EV policies under President Donald Trump, including an end to EV tax credits that will take effect after Sept. 30.

Ford said Monday that the Louisville plant will "secure" about 2,200 jobs, but noted that once it's retooled for EV production, it will employ about 600 fewer workers than in its current configuration.

According to the Ford website, the plant employed more than 3,000 employees as of April 2024.

Farley told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during an interview with "Squawk on the Street" on Monday that the automaker continues to add new jobs elsewhere.

"Ford's the only car company in America that's added 13,000 jobs since the recession. We're not going to stop," Farley said.

— CNBC's Phil LeBeau contributed to this report.

Correction: This article has been updated to correct that the Louisville Assembly Plant will secure about 2,200 jobs. A previous version misstated the job impact.

Cannabis stocks rallied Monday after President Donald Trump said he is considering reclassifying marijuana, which would categorize it as less of a danger to public safety.

Canopy Growth soared more than 26%, while Tilray Brands skyrocketed more than 41% in its best day since 2021. Cronos Group jumped around 16% and hit a new 52-week high.

The AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF (MSOS) surged around 28%, marking its best day since 2022. The Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) recorded its biggest one-day gain on record, rising more than 26%.

"We're looking at reclassification," Trump told reporters Monday during a press conference to announce the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C. "We'll make a determination ... over the next few weeks."

"It's a very complicated subject," he added.

Many stocks in the sector now sell for less than a dollar per share, meaning a move of just a few cents can lead to a large percentage change. Despite Monday's rally, many of these stocks are far below their all-time highs.

Shares of publicly traded pot growers and distributors surged before the press conference after a Wall Street Journal report late Friday, citing people familiar with the matter, said Trump was considering changing marijuana to a less-dangerous drug classification. Trump disclosed he was considering such a move during a fundraiser at his New Jersey golf club earlier this month, the people said.

Under federal law, cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug in a group that also includes heroin and cocaine. Previously, reclassification discussions have centered on moving the drug to Schedule III, a class that includes steroids and Tylenol with codeine.

Reclassification would allow marijuana companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment interest, among other benefits.

Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC he expects the process of reclassification to take about a year. Trump discussing the matter publicly, and saying he plans to make a decision in coming weeks, is cause for optimism in the industry, Simon said.

"Trump gets things done," Simon said. "He wouldn't be talking about it ... if he's not going to get something done."

Trump's backing can brighten the outlook, but technically he cannot reclassify the drug alone. The Controlled Substances Act places that authority under the Attorney General, who historically has delegated it to the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

A move from Schedule I to Schedule III would be "a game changer" for the roughly $80 billion market, Tim Seymour, investing chief at Seymour Asset Management, said on CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange" on Monday. He noted that such a change seems to have bipartisan support.

"It does not mean that it won't be a complicated trade," Seymour said. "But it does mean that you're investing now well ahead of a lot of institutional capital if you are, in fact, investing into this sector."

In the end, success comes down to three things. If you think the first one is luck, sorry! That would be a platitude. 

Okay, fine, of course luck matters. It matters in the big-big things, like where and when you're born, your health, your class, your race. But it also helps with the small stuff, like when the person sitting next to you in Row 45 on the Tampa-Chicago flight loves your product and places the order that saves you from bankruptcy. 

But luck is random by definition. As a business academic who studies career trajectories, I've found long-term success is, aside from luck, a function of PIE. It refers to the quality of your:

Let me explain. 

Good news, I'm not going to tell you to network. I hate networking. It's mercenary and phony, and it doesn't work. 

Instead, invest your time and energy making friends with all sorts of people, and lots of them, at work and out, with no expectation of anything in return. They may be able to help you someday, or maybe not, but if and when they do, their help will have more impact than any networking contact. 

My dear friend, Hollis, is the publisher of my latest book, "Becoming You." Would she have acquired my manuscript if she hadn't liked it? No, of course not, and our friendship would have been just fine. But you've also never seen an easier, faster book deal brokered. The lawyers had nothing to do. Poor them! 

Friends, real ones, are what make business go. And the better friends you have, the better it will go for you

You don't need a lot of ideas. But I've never met a successful person who didn't have a few really good ones over the long arc of their career. 

What is a "good" idea? Well, for one thing, it's original. I'm thinking of Jeff Bezos when it dawned on him that he didn't need to sell just books online. He could sell anything. 

Luckily for the rest of us, an original idea doesn't have to blow up the economy. It can be as small as replacing a bureaucratic process with a clean, simple one. Or a marketing activation that bumps sales 3% or a design tweak that makes an industrial product 5% more efficient. 

I know a car salesman who, in his first year on the job, doubled his location's sales by bringing a new question to his teammates. When a customer throws a lowball price at you, he said, instead of negotiating off the bat, ask, "Can you help me understand how you came up with that number?" 

He runs the place now. 

This is the most underrated success-driver of the PIE triad — which is ridiculous, because any manager in the world will tell you they'd kill for a team member who gets you-know-what done. 

In my class at NYU, every MBA student must go through 360 Feedback, an evaluation tool that gathers input from former and current coworkers, bosses, and employees, and aggregates it into a report. 

Sarah, a student, reviewed her 360 results in class and immediately booked double office hours. When we met up, she was in tears. "Professor Welch, I need you to teach me how to be a leader," she said, "because my 360 Feedback results are horrifying." Dear Reader, it was a WTF moment for me, since my reaction to her results had been, "Nice!" 

The issue was that Sarah's 360 results had shown her to be kind of low on leadership traits. But every single piece of feedback suggested that Sarah was SEAL Team Six when it came to getting projects over the finish line. Her execution was perfect, precise, and invisible. As a leader myself, it made me feel faint with ardor. 

I needed to make sure. Did Sarah want to be a leader? There was a long pause, then: "Honestly? No!" Strategy bored her, she told me. Vision statements made her gag. Just tell me what needs to be done and get out of my way. 

"Why don't you just aim to have a career as a COO?" I asked. "Every CEO in the world will be in a cage match over you." 

"But we're supposed to become leaders," she protested. "That's why we go to business school." 

Ah, but no, I reminded her. You are in business school — you are in life — to become you. 

My Becoming You methodology helps you answer: "What should I do with my life?" 

The PIE theory drives much of the information Becoming You digs to unearth: how you relate to people, how your brain works, and how you show up in the world. 

It's literally set up to set you up to succeed, based on how I believe success actually happens.

President Donald Trump on Monday said he is placing the Washington, D.C., police department under federal control and deploying 800 National Guard troops in order to address what he claims is out-of-control crime in the capital city.

The move — which marks the first time in history that a president has federalized the district's police force — was met with fierce condemnation from local officials, who quickly noted that official statistics show crime is on the decline.

Trump unveiled the action after describing the city in apocalyptic terms.

"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor, and worse," Trump declared at the start of a lengthy news conference in the White House press briefing room.

"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capitol back." 

He said he was invoking his authority under Section 740 of the district's Home Rule Act, the decades-old law that establishes the capital's local government.

The section Trump cited gives the president the power to order the D.C. mayor to temporarily hand over control of the Metropolitan Police force if he determines that "special conditions of an emergency nature exist."

But his emergency control is set to expire after a maximum of 30 days, according to the statute. That can be extended, but only if Congress passes a law authorizing it.

While Trump has frequently complained about crime in the district, violent crime there has fallen to a 30-year low as of January, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Statistics from the Metropolitan Police Department also show that incidences of homicide, sexual abuse, assault with a dangerous weapon, robbery and overall violent crime have dropped by double-digit percentages so far this year.

Federal law enforcement presence in D.C. has nevertheless increased in recent days.

D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalbe called Trump's actions "unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful," and signaled his office will take action to challenge the administration.

"There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year," Schwalbe said in an X post.

"We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents," he said.

D.C. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, in a statement called Trump's actions "an historic assault on D.C. home rule," and a "counterproductive, escalatory seizure of D.C.'s resources to use for purposes not supported by D.C. residents."

"The administration is justifying the decision by misleadingly citing years-old statistics," Norton said.

Trump, who has recently threatened to place Washington under federal control, said Monday morning that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is "taking command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment."

He also said that he will deploy the National Guard to "help re-establish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly."

Trump added, "You're going to have a lot of essentially military, and we will bring in the military if it's needed."

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's actions.

She had previously pushed back on Trump's characterization of her city.

"People are coming to our capital. They're starting business in our capital, and they're raising families in our capital. Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false," Bowser said Sunday on MSNBC's "The Weekend."

Trump had teased his announcement on social media in the days leading up to the presser.

"Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR. I will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN!" Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier Monday.

On Sunday, he declared that "the Homeless" in D.C. will "have to move out, IMMEDIATELY," while assuring that the government "will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital."

The Trump administration has disputed that crime in D.C. is dropping. White House communications director Steven Cheung on Monday morning pointed to a police union's reported accusation that crime statistics in D.C. have been manipulated.

Trump's complaints about crime in D.C. ramped up after reports that Edward Coristine, one of the initial staffers on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, was assaulted there earlier this month.

Trump also signaled he plans to renew criticism of the cost of an ongoing renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters, continuing his line of attack against the central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell.

In another social media post, he wrote, "We are not going to allow people to spend $3.1 Billion Dollars on fixing up a building, like the Federal Reserve, which could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner for $50 to $100 Million Dollars."

The Trump administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June to address civil unrest over federal immigration enforcement operations in the city.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sued the administration, arguing that Trump's actions were unconstitutional.

A trial on the suit in California federal court was set to begin Monday morning.

Shares of the enterprise artificial intelligence company C3 AI tumbled more than 20% Monday after it announced preliminary financial results and a restructuring of its global sales and services organization.

C3 AI said Friday that it expects to report revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million for its fiscal first quarter 2026, though those figures are unaudited, preliminary estimates. The company reported $87.2 million in revenue during the same period a year earlier.

Thomas Siebel, C3 AI's CEO, said in a statement that sales results during the quarter were "completely unacceptable." He attributed the performance to the "disruptive effect" of the reorganization, as well as his ongoing health issues.

The company expects to report a GAAP loss from operations for the quarter between $124.7 million and $124.9 million, a much wider loss than a year ago, when C3 AI had a loss of $72.59 million.

"Unfortunately, dealing with these health issues prevented me from participating in the sales process as actively as I have in the past," Siebel said in a statement. "With the benefit of hindsight, it is now apparent that my active participation in the sales process may have had a greater impact than I previously thought."

Siebel announced in July that he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease earlier this year, resulting in "significant visual impairment." C3 AI's board and Siebel have kicked off a search for the company's next chief executive.

C3 AI said its sales and services restructuring is complete, and Siebel said his health has "improved dramatically" except for his vision impairment. He said he is feeling strong and fully engaged, and will work to quickly identify "excellent" CEO candidates.

"I am confident the company is positioned to accelerate going forward," Siebel said.

The company is scheduled to hold a conference call for first-quarter results on Sept. 3 at 5 p.m. ET.

Longtime mall staple Claire's has begun liquidating its stores after filing for bankruptcy for a second time in seven years.

The tween accessories retailer was once a thriving retailer. From fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2007, the company grew its annual sales from $846 million to $1.48 billion. But by 2018 it had filed for bankruptcy protection for the first time. It was taken over by creditors Elliott Management Corporation and Monarch Alternative Capital, who eliminated $1.9 billion of debt.

Despite some sales momentum in 2021, attempts by Claire's to modernize in an e-commerce world failed to re-energize the brand.

Turnaround efforts over the past couple of years included expanding retail partnerships with companies such as Walgreens and Walmart, a loyalty program rollout, and investments in influencer-led content.

But now the company is in need of saving once again. 

"Claire's was not immune from the continued trend away from brick and mortar and more recent macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates, labor costs and, most recently, tariffs," the company said in a bankruptcy declaration filed Wednesday. "While Claire's took many steps over the last few years to address these and other challenges, it was not enough to overcome the obstacles."

At least nine other major retailers — including Party City, Z Gallerie, Forever 21 and Rite Aid — have filed for bankruptcy at least twice within the past 10 years.

"What we're typically seeing in the last year are these repeat filers is that they are just liquidating and closing down their stores, maybe with some online presence continuing," said Sarah Foss, global head of legal at Debtwire.

In its bankruptcy declaration, Claire's said it had contacted over 150 potential buyers in the months leading up to its bankruptcy and received multiple letters of intent, which it is continuing to negotiate. The deadline for a buyer to acquire the company is tentatively set for August 31.

Josh Holmes, head of research at Retail Economics said its longstanding legacy in the American mall could help save it.

"Its ear piercing service became a sort of rite of passage for many," Holmes said. "That nostalgia, the retro element is something I think actually does hold value and something that potential investors will look at and consider in terms of if they are to come in and rescue the brand."

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said artificial general intelligence, or "AGI," is losing its relevance as a term as rapid advances in the space make it harder to define the concept.

AGI refers to the concept of a form of artificial intelligence that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. For years, OpenAI has been working to research and develop AGI that is safe and benefits all humanity.

"I think it's not a super useful term," Altman told CNBC's "Squawk Box" last week, when asked whether the company's latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI. The AI entrepreneur has previously said he thinks AGI could be developed in the "reasonably close-ish future."

The problem with AGI, Altman said, is that there are multiple definitions being used by different companies and individuals. One definition is an AI that can do "a significant amount of the work in the world," according to Altman — however, that has its issues because the nature of work is constantly changing.

"I think the point of all of this is it doesn't really matter and it's just this continuing exponential of model capability that we'll rely on for more and more things," Altman said.

Altman isn't alone in raising skepticism about "AGI" and how people use the term.

Nick Patience, vice president and AI practice lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC that though AGI is a "fantastic North Star for inspiration," on the whole it's not a helpful term.

"It drives funding and captures the public imagination, but its vague, sci-fi definition often creates a fog of hype that obscures the real, tangible progress we're making in more specialised AI," he said via email.

OpenAI and other startups have raised billions of dollars and attained dizzyingly high valuations with the promise that they will eventually reach a form of AI powerful enough to be considered "AGI." OpenAI was last valued by investors at $300 billion and it is said to be preparing a secondary share sale at a valuation of $500 billion.

Last week, the company released GPT-5, its latest large language model for all ChatGPT users. OpenAI said the new system is smarter, faster and "a lot more useful" — especially when it comes to writing, coding and providing assistance on health care queries.

But the launch led to criticisms from some online that the long-awaited model was an underwhelming upgrade, making only minor improvements on its predecessor.

"By all accounts it's incremental, not revolutionary," Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at the University of Southampton, told CNBC.

AI firms "should be forced to declare how they measure up to globally agreed metrics" when they launch new products, Hall added. "It's the Wild West for snake oil salesmen at the moment."

For his part, Altman has admitted OpenAI's new model misses the mark of his own personal definition of AGI, as the system is not yet capable of continuously learning on its own.

While OpenAI still maintains artificial general intelligence as its ultimate goal, Altman has said it's better to talk about levels of progress toward this state of general intelligence rather than asking if something is AGI or not.

"We try now to use these different levels ... rather than the binary of, 'is it AGI or is it not?' I think that became too coarse as we get closer," the OpenAI CEO said during a talk at the FinRegLab AI Symposium in November 2024.

Altman still expects AI to achieve some key breakthroughs in specific fields — such as new math theorems and scientific discoveries — in the next two years or so.

"There's so much exciting real-world stuff happening, I feel AGI is a bit of a distraction, promoted by those that need to keep raising astonishing amounts of funding," Futurum's Patience told CNBC.

"It's more useful to talk about specific capabilities than this nebulous concept of 'general' intelligence."

In this article

On President Donald Trump's first day in office, he signed an executive order aiming to eliminate the "electric vehicle mandate" and remove subsidies that favor EVs. Since then, his administration has taken steps to do exactly that, while automakers are left figuring out the impact on their bottom lines.

Late last month, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding a landmark finding from 2009 establishing that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. The implication is that automakers would no longer be required to measure, control or report their greenhouse gas emissions.

That action follows the recent passage of Trump's tax and spending bill, under which the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs that automakers had benefited from is set to end after Sept. 30.

The new legislation will also end a provision that U.S. EV makers such as Tesla and Rivian have relied on as a key revenue source. Typically, traditional automakers that sell gas-powered cars buy regulatory credits from EV makers to make up for the emissions that come from their tailpipes. Under the new law, however, automakers will no longer have any reason to buy the regulatory credits — marking a win for gas-guzzlers and a loss for EV makers.

As a result of this changing EV landscape, U.S. automakers are evaluating their product lineups and calculating the dollar impacts. Here's a roundup of what U.S. automakers have said on their latest earnings calls about the softer regulations.

On Tesla's July 23 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla is in a "weird transition period" as it deals with losing EV incentives in the U.S.

"Does that mean like we could have a few rough quarters? Yeah, we probably could have a few rough quarters," he told analysts.

CFO Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla is focused on building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in the U.S. before the tax credits expire this fall. As a result of this renewed focus, the ramping of Tesla's lower-cost model will happen slower than expected next quarter, Taneja said.

Taneja added that while Tesla has never planned its business around selling regulatory credits to other automakers, it will see lower revenue as a result of those changes.

CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company's July 22 earnings call that General Motors is anticipating headwinds to EV profitability as a result of the government removing incentives.

He said he expects a rush on EVs before the tax credits expire, but then slower demand after that. However, Jacobson said he expects the change in legislation to have a minimal impact on the automaker's 2025 results.

Despite the company touting its portfolio, electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of GM's total vehicle sales — amounting to 46,300 for the second quarter compared with total vehicle sales of 974,000.

Jacobson said last month that GM has an "inherent advantage" over Tesla because it has more flexibility to adapt to changing EV demand through the diversity of its gas and electric offerings.

At a Monday event in Louisville, Kentucky, Ford announced a "Universal EV Program" aimed at low-cost EVs, starting with a mid-size electric pickup that will reach customers in 2027 at a starting price of $30,000.

CEO Jim Farley said the new program is geared toward bolstering Ford as competition rises from Big Tech and Chinese EV makers, like BYD.

When asked on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Monday about EV tax credits going away later this year, Farley said the EV business has reached a reckoning.

"I personally think EVs are going to be pretty tough here, until all companies go through what Ford is doing, where they have to bring their cost level radically down and reshape these plants to make the EVs that people really want," Farley said, adding that EVs in the $30,000 to $40,000 price range sell better than more expensive models.

On the company's July 30 call with analysts, Farley said Ford has had to change its EV spending and capital allocation "pretty massively" as a result of softer U.S. regulations, including by moving out launches and canceling some products.

CFO Sherry House added that as a result of tax credits going away, Ford could possibly pull back some of its EV production from the U.S. into other areas, such as leaning more heavily on Europe or moving into internal combustion engine products.

Rivian does not expect to earn any revenue from regulatory tax credits for the rest of 2025, CFO Claire McDonough told analysts during its Tuesday call. As a result, the EV maker brought its outlook for regulatory credit sales down to $160 million for the rest of 2025, from its prior outlook of $300 million.

CEO RJ Scaringe added that the regulatory credit changes mark a short-term reduction in positive cash for Rivian.

However, he said that the changes could also mean less long-term competition in the EV space, considering that there will be fewer incentives for traditional manufacturers to make investments toward electrification.

"When we look at all those things together, there's of course some puts and some takes," Scaringe said.

U.S. Treasury yields inched lower Monday as investors look ahead to key inflation data due this week which will offer fresh insights about the state of the U.S. economy.

The 10-year Treasury yield was down over 1 basis point to 4.269%, and the 2-year Treasury yield was unchanged at 3.76%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield shed 2 basis points to 4.834%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Investors are expecting a busy week of economic data relations with key inflation prints out this week. The consumer price index, set to be released Tuesday morning, and the producer price index, out on Thursday, will be critical to shaping the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions at its September meeting.

Economists are forecasting the July CPI to show a 0.2% increase on a monthly basis and 2.8% increase annually, per Dow Jones. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 0.3% on a monthly basis, and 3.1% yearly — up from June's figures of 0.2% and 2.9% respectively.

The PPI is expected to show a 0.2% monthly gain and 0.3% for core PPI, after both were flat in June.

The inflation data comes ahead of a Fed meeting in Jackson Hole in Wyoming, from Aug. 21-23, which will likely influence the direction of the September meeting.

"The most important thing is the CPI data," Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets said. "That will definitely dictate monetary policy."

Retail sales data for July and the preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment reading are also due later in the week.

Talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. counterpart Donald Trump are still days away, but the two leaders' upcoming meeting to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine is already seen as a victory for the Kremlin, the Russian economy and global financial markets.

The discussions are set to take place on Friday in Alaska.

"This is already a big win for Putin to be invited for the first time since 2007 to meet with the U.S. president on American soil. Is a wonderful achievement, from his point of view, no conditions and the absence of Ukraine, the absence of any European representation. This is already a triumph," Richard Portes, head of the Economics faculty at the London Business School, told CNBC Monday.

There are concerns that Ukraine could be forced to cede Russian-occupied territory to Moscow, and the mood is dour in Kyiv, whose officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have so far not been invited to attend the talks.

Kyiv has said no deal about its future would be struck in its absence, and European leaders are pushing strongly for Ukraine's involvement. The U.S., for its part, has said its considering inviting Zelenskyy, NBC News reported.

In the meantime, economists say the talks — which take place as Russia makes gains on the battlefield in southern and eastern Ukraine, with no ceasefire deal in sight — are already a win for Putin and his war-centered economy that is laboring under international sanctions and stubbornly high inflation of 9.4% in June.

"[Putin] starts from a relatively strong position on the battlefield. They're advancing ...On the other hand, from the economic point of view, he starts from a weak position. The Russian economy is not in very good shape. They're running a significant fiscal deficit, partly because oil revenues are down very substantially, oil and gas [are down] because of the oil price. And ... this is a weak economy," Portes told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition."

Coming into talks with a strong position in the battlefield, Russia is likely to want immediate sanctions relief as part of any ceasefire deal, as well as Ukrainian territorial concessions.

The Kremlin has spied a rapprochement with Washington as an opportunity not only for an economic recovery, but investment. Russian Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov on Saturday stated that "the economic interests of our countries intersect in Alaska and the Arctic, and there are prospects for implementing large-scale and mutually beneficial projects," the Kremlin stated.

Portes said that if Trump "had the patience and the willingness to apply sanctions properly, then waiting [to hold talks] would result in a very significant change in the balance of forces."

As things stand, however, Trump has mulled but so far held off on increasing sanctions on Russia. Washington has instead threatened the Kremlin's remaining trading partners, such as India, with "secondary sanctions" and additional trade tariffs for continuing with purchases of Russian oil, which have funded Moscow's war machine.

Asked whether Trump could press ahead with more punitive sanctions to push Putin toward a peace deal, Portes asked: "Can anyone predict what the President of the United States will do from one day to the next? It's very difficult."

"The likelihood of an increase in sanctions pressure is significant, but ... given Trump's desire for a Nobel Prize, the the likelihood that Trump will increase sanctions at this stage. Does not look very high, but he could change his mind tomorrow," he said.

Global financial markets reacted positively to the announcement on Friday that talks to end the war would take place imminently, with bourses in Europe and U.S. rising. Defense stocks in Europe fell on the news, however, as traders appeared to bet that peace could deter further investment pledged by NATO allies.

The spot price of gold, seen as a safe haven in times of geopolitical and financial market stress, was down around 1% at $3,364 per ounce, as of 8a.m. London time on Monday.

Shares of Germany's Rheinmetall were trading lower by almost 4% while Hensoldt declined by 1.5% and Renk fell 3.3% in early trades. Italy's Leonardo and France's Thales were also down by 1.9% and 1.7% respectively. Meanwhile, London-listed BAE Systems and Babcock also gave up gains from earlier in the day, down 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively around 9 a.m. London time.

But Christopher Granville, managing director at TS Lombard, said that the talks could ultimately prove to be a "win-win for European defense stocks" and advised investors to "buy on that weakness."

Granville said if the peace process fails, there would still be a need to replenish depleted arms inventories of U.S. and Europe, which "would be very good for orders and procurement for Rheinmetall and all the other European defense stocks."

"Or if there is a peace agreement, what do we see? We see a very powerful Russian military which — although the words 'victory' and 'defeat' will be banded around and should probably not be used — has to an extent prevailed. That reality will force continued increase defense procurement by European governments, and it's also good for European defense stocks. Either way, it's a winner," Granville told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

"The market, of course, has been discounting this some from time to time and as those [defense stock] names pull back a bit, you should buy on that weakness, in my opinion."

Too bad there isn't a way to debug the tech job market.

With Big Tech layoffs, the increase in computer science graduates, and quicker ways to learn through AI and vibe coding, there's a lot more tech talent, but not a lot of opportunities.

The labor market has been frozen for months, marked by low layoffs, low hiring, and few openings for job seekers and switchers.

It's looking like a better time to continue writing lines of code at your current role than to try to switch jobs or ask for a promotion.

Here are three charts that show how hard the tech job market is right now.

Are you an unemployed tech job seeker or staying put in your job because of the current job market? Reach out to these reporters to share your story at mhoff@businessinsider.com and jkaplan@businessinsider.com.

Indeed Hiring Lab economist Brendon Bernard said in a recent report that tech opportunities have been weak since mid-2023 after climbing to an early 2022 peak. The cooldown has been worse than the slowdown in overall US job postings.

The report said artificial intelligence "could be stalling a rebound" in tech openings on the job-search platform. However, it's not the only possible factor.

Bernard said that "the sector is experiencing an overhang from its earlier hiring boom, aggravated by less supportive economic conditions — including the end of the 'zero interest rate period' — with some resemblance to trends in the broader economy." The Fed began raising interest rates in March 2022 to fight rising inflation, making financing big speculative investments in new tech riskier.

A Burning Glass Institute analysis found the unemployment rate for Gen Z and younger millennials who were in computer and math occupations over the last couple of years has increased from their pre-pandemic rates in 2018 and 2019.

The recent report said that knowledge economy sectors, which are primarily white-collar industries that usually absorb college graduates, have scaled back their hiring pace from before the pandemic, "suggesting that they have found a new lower-employment equilibrium." It's another sign of a quiet white-collar apocalypse afflicting Gen Z.

How to navigate the tough job market:

Younger workers are also already on the tougher side of the career divide that's cleaving Gen Z white-collar workers. The oldest Gen Zers, who are turning 28 this year, experienced a labor market in 2021 and 2022 that was eager to staff up on white-collar workers, and may have benefited from firms willing to pay a premium to attract new employees amid the Great Resignation.

As economists have said many times over the past year to Business Insider, it's a tougher time to be a job seeker than a job stayer. That can still be the case if you're looking to move up the ladder or switch roles within your current company.

Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small and midsize businesses, found that the promotion rate in technology has slowed down the most among major sectors since the Great Resignation. Gusto economist Aaron Terrazas said a normalization from "aggressive talent retention strategies" that companies tried in 2021 and 2022 could be a factor.

"We'll only know with time whether or not this is the new normal," Terrazas said about the slowdown in promotions across industries. "Right now, there are clearly a lot of structural forces, high interest rates, economic uncertainty, that would make it seem at least for the moment cyclical."

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he doesn't feel comfortable with how people are consulting ChatGPT on major life decisions.

"A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn't describe it that way," Altman wrote on X on Sunday.

"I can imagine a future where a lot of people really trust ChatGPT's advice for their most important decisions. Although that could be great, it makes me uneasy," Altman added.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Altman said in his X post that OpenAI has been "closely tracking" people's sense of attachment to their AI models and how they react when older versions are deprecated.

"People have used technology including AI in self-destructive ways," Altman wrote on Sunday. "If a user is in a mentally fragile state and prone to delusion, we do not want the AI to reinforce that."

Altman said that while most ChatGPT users can distinguish "between reality and fiction or role-play," a minority cannot. He added that ChatGPT could be harmful if it leads people away from their "longer term well-being."

"This is just my current thinking, and not yet an official OpenAI position," Altman said.

In his post, Altman also referenced the negative response from some ChatGPT users after GPT-5 landed on Friday.

Some ChatGPT users, for instance, called for OpenAI to restore older models like GPT-4o. People made posts on social media to voice their complaints about GPT-5, saying the model's replies were written in a "flat" tone and lacked creativity.

OpenAI has also tweaked its models. In April, the company said it was rolling back an update to GPT-4o because the model had become sycophantic and was "overly flattering" to users.

Altman has previously expressed concern about how people are using ChatGPT as a personal therapist — and the legal concerns around it.

In a podcast that aired last month, Altman told podcaster Theo Von that OpenAI may be required to produce its users' therapy-style chats in a lawsuit.

"So if you go talk to ChatGPT about your most sensitive stuff and then there's like a lawsuit or whatever, we could be required to produce that, and I think that's very screwed up," Altman said.

"No one had to think about that even a year ago, and now I think it's this huge issue of like, 'How are we gonna treat the laws around this?'" Altman added.

One of the original Ethereum ICO investors has sent 2,000 ETH (around $8.55 million) to the crypto exchange Kraken. The decision is made when ETH is trading at a price of $4,250 after the asset showed a bullish momentum that has seen up to a 22% price increase within the past weeks.

Nansen on-chain data indicates that the whale first purchased 100,000 ETH during the Ethereum 2015 ICO for a total of only $31,100, which means the price per token was approximately $0.31.

This initial investment has given a more than 1.3 million percent increase to date.

All the same, the whale retains a huge balance of 58,000 ETH, or around 247.86 million, spread over several wallets despite the recent transfer. 

The recent 2,000 ETH transfer to Kraken is just a fraction of the total asset possession of the whale, and most of their long-standing holdings are not yet touched upon.

This is the same ICO wallet 0x2c…F0E99 to which a deposit address 0x815…c3eD is attached, which confirms the link to the first Ethereum fundraising.

Analysts and traders closely monitor these movements, because transfers to exchanges in large amounts may (but not always) hint that the asset is about to be sold or that a portfolio is being rebalanced.

The Ethereum bulls' return and the steady buildup of its ecosystem, which has been propelling the Ethereum price to date, can affect the timing of this transfer. 

At its current levels, which are within striking distance of yearly highs, with current momentum being very strong, early investors are positioned to cash in while still leaving plenty on the table on the upside.

Whale activity shall also be in the spotlight of traders as Ethereum inches closer to all-time highs of holding high value at 4,800.

The actions of early ICO participants, who hold large amounts of Ethereum at very low cost bases, are particularly significant in influencing market sentiment and liquidity.

Clay Chandler is executive editor, Asia, at Fortune.

For years, the crypto economy was a digital wild west: volatile, speculative, and often untethered from the real world. Now, Asia is leading a reinvention—building a blockchain ecosystem that doesn't just trade coins, but tokenizes roads, solar farms, and financial instruments. It's a shift from roulette wheels to regulated rails, from speculation to scaffolding. 

The first uses of the blockchain were purely virtual: Cryptocurrencies and NFTs that reflected digital assets with no real-world counterpart. Yet the next wave of financial innovators are trying to make blockchain work in the “real” world by tokenizing real-world assets like artwork, real estate—and, if two small Asia-based financial startups have their way, clean energy.  





If predictions hold true, real-world assets on the blockchain can be a lucrative opportunity: Standard Chartered believes the market could be worth $30.1 trillion within the next decade.  





Amber Premium, a Thailand-based institutional crypto services provider, and Evolve, a tokenized infrastructure company specializing in renewable energy, are tiny by global standards: Amber's market capitalization hovers around $600 million, while Evolve manages a relatively small asset base.  





Unlike crypto giants like Binance or Coinbase, Amber and Evolve are niche, but their focus on tokenizing real-world infrastructure are examples of how Asia is transforming the realm of digital finance. 




What connects both Amber and Evolve are tokens: the conversion of real-world assets into digital tokens onto a blockchain. In principle, this offers institutions a compelling alternative to legacy investment structures. Rather than have layers of financial intermediaries, investors have direct, auditable ownership through the blockchain. Users can then divide and trade these tokens however they wish, and set up smart contracts to automate yield distribution. 





These tokens represent tangible physical or financial assets—solar arrays, government bonds, EV fleets—bringing real yield, lower volatility, and legal transparency to crypto markets. Amber Premium allows clients to hold tokenized clean energy debt, money market stablecoins, and more—all within a single digital wallet. Meanwhile, Evolve's tokens are linked to solar farms and battery networks, seamlessly bridging the gap between industrial infrastructure and digital finance. 





Amber Premium, led by CEO Wayne Huo—a former Morgan Stanley trader—recently merged with iClick, securing a Nasdaq listing and establishing itself as a fully regulated institutional crypto player. Amber's regulatory framework spans multiple jurisdictions: its Singapore arm (formerly Sparrow Tech) operates under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), while other subsidiaries hold licenses adapted to local Asian markets. The firm invests heavily in compliance infrastructure, aiming to meet the expectations of institutional clients and regulators alike.  





Amber's Nasdaq listing established the company as a U.S.-listed institutional gateway into “Web3”—shorthand for an internet built on decentralized blockchain technologies. Huo took over as CEO, giving the company a bridge to traditional finance.  





Amber Premium's clientele is distinctly institutional. As of Q1 2025, the platform counted roughly 928 active clients—an increase from 891 the previous year—who collectively held $1.275 billion in assets under management. These clients span regional banks, family offices, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries across Asia, the Middle East, and North America. A significant share of Amber's clients are based in Greater China who are looking for exposure to digital assets amid uncertainty around mainland China's treatment of cryptocurrency. 




Amber is still a tiny company, generating just $14.94 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, up from $1 million a year prior. Amber Premium has yet to turn a profit, instead prioritizing infrastructure, licensing and regulatory compliance over short-term earnings. And its revenue has tracked the ups and downs of the crypto market: It generated just $33 million in revenue in 2024, down from $308 million in 2021, the height of the COVID-era crypto boom. Shares have lost half their value since the listing, falling from a peak of around $12.80 in March to around $6.50 today. Analysts blame low awareness, thin trading volume and skepticism about the viability of crypto-finance hybrids after FTX's spectacular collapse in 2022.  





Evolve, founded by Maverick Hui, a pioneer of Canadian crypto ETFs and early digital asset regulation, is turning renewable energy infrastructure like battery-swapping stations, solar farms, and EV charging networks into digital tokens that deliver proportional returns to investors. Several of its ETF offerings, including those tied to Bitcoin and Solana, have received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission. The company partners with U.S.-licensed custodians like Coinbase Custody Trust for cross-border holdings.  





Hui, from Evolve, is focusing on yield-generating clear energy assets, particularly through e-scooter and battery station manufacturer Mile Green. In early 2025, Mile Green secured $50 million from CMAG Funds, a Singapore-based private investment firm, to expand battery-swapping and EV charging infrastructure across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.  





(Fortune's parent company holds a minority stake in CMAG Funds. Chatchaval Jiravananon, Fortune's owner, is also an investor in Amber, Mile Green, and Evolve. Chatchaval recently took part in a $25.5 million private placement in Amber.)





Mile Green is Evolve's infrastructure partner: Mile Green develops the clean energy assets, which Evolve converts into investment-grade digital tokens. Investors can now track performance through these tokens rather than company filings.  




Asia is taking the lead in tokenized finance, thanks to clearer regulatory frameworks, innovation sandboxes and startups that are eager to experiment. Even mainland China, which bans most cryptocurrency trading and mining, is experimenting with enterprise blockchain through its state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) and central bank digital currency, the e-CNY.  





The financial hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore are among Asia's most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Yet regulators in both cities are still cautious about cryptocurrency. Tokenized products still face strict limitations, retail access is tightly controlled, and approval processes can be unpredictable. One major constraint is the difficulty of transferring tokenized assets between wallets. As a result, wallet-to-wallet transfers are often restricted or require complex approvals, limiting broader adoption. 





Changing winds in Washington are also buoying Asia-based crypto platforms. The second Trump administration is taking a decidedly more pro-crypto stance. In January, U.S. president Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting responsible blockchain growth. He paused enforcement actions against crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, and Trump's SEC then launched a “Crypto 2.0” task force to clarify rules on crypto, moving away from the preceding Biden administration's more skeptical stance.  





In March, the White House announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, naming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano as national digital assets. Then, in August, new rules opened 401(k) retirement plans to crypto, private equity, and real estate—unlocking trillions in potential institutional capital.  





The administration also backed the GENIUS Act, which clarifies rules for stablecoins. Together, these moves are ushering in what the crypto industry hopes will be a more friendly, legally-stable foundation for growth.  




These shifts benefit both Amber and Evolve. Amber, as a Nasdaq-listed company, gains regulatory legitimacy and improved U.S. market access. Evolve's yield-bearing, tokenized infrastructure may soon appeal to pension funds and fiduciary investors seeking new types of assets.  





As the U.S. softens its stance and Asia doubles down on digital finance, companies like Amber Premium and Evolve are quietly building the financial plumbing for the next phase of blockchain adoption—and getting the real world on the blockchain. 





There's still a long way to go. Liquidity remains thin, valuation remains depressed, and the sector remains vulnerable to global regulatory swings. Then there's the ownership question: How do you ensure a digital token on the blockchain grants a clear and enforceable claim on the real-world asset in question? 





Tokenized finance may still be in its early innings—but the infrastructure is maturing. Asia didn't invent blockchain. But it may be where blockchain becomes real.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged on Monday to trade near record highs as investor enthusiasm and momentum around crypto grew amid Trump's recent Fed nomination and executive order allowing crypto investment in 401(k) retirement plans.

The digital token reached $122,000 on Monday before easing to around $120,000. The gains come as inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown and public companies have been adding bitcoin to their balance sheets.

Bitcoin wasn't the only cryptocurrency getting a bid. Ethereum (ETH-USD) touched 2021 levels on Monday, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged roughly 190% since the April market lows.

Companies have been adding ethereum to their balance sheets as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets, such as stablecoins.

The move higher in crypto also comes as stocks hover near record highs on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September and that President Trump's next Fed chair pick will likely bring looser monetary policy.

"If the Fed is cutting into an economy that is still growing, with unemployment in check and inflation elevated, that is a macro cocktail that should favor allocation to crypto," Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote on Friday.

Farrell also noted that Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran to serve on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors is also bullish for crypto assets, given that he has called for weaker dollar policy in the past, which typically drives up asset prices.

At the same time, regulatory tailwinds have also pushed the price of bitcoin higher.

Last week Trump issued an executive order asking the Labor Department to look into allowing 401(k) plans to hold cryptocurrencies, among other alternative assets. The move would open the door for more investors to get involved in crypto.

Even Trump's son Eric Trump has noted crypto's surge, writing recently, "Stop betting against BTC and ETH — you will be run over."

Strategists note the administration's crypto push is a major tailwind for the industry.

"The administration is pushing crypto. They are pushing bitcoin. Bitcoin is the lead dog in the crypto market," Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, told Yahoo Finance on Monday morning.

"So is it short-term a little frothy? Sure," he added. "But longer term, there are some fundamental changes here that I think are bullish for it and we'll send it much higher in the future."

 The IPO is led by Wall Street heavyweights JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup, SEC filings show. 

Digital asset exchange operator Bullish raised the target valuation for its initial public offering by almost 60% to potentially $990 million, a move that may reflect growing investor appetite amid renewed momentum in crypto-related stocks.

Bullish now plans to sell 30 million shares at $32 to $33 apiece, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing recent regulatory filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That's nearly 60% higher than the upper range of its earlier target.

If the IPO meets expectations, Bullish would debut with a market capitalization of about $4.8 billion — up from the $4.2 billion goal set in early August.

The IPO is being led by Wall Street heavyweights JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup. Bullish plans to list under the ticker symbol “BLSH,” according to the filing. 

Several institutional investors, including subsidiaries of BlackRock and ARK Investment Management, have already signaled interest in the offering.

In its filing, the company pointed to rising activity in digital asset markets and increasing adoption by traditional financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs as key drivers behind its decision to go public.

In addition to operating an institutional-grade digital asset platform, Bullish expanded into crypto media in November 2023, acquiring CoinDesk from Digital Currency Group in a $72.6 million deal.

Bullish and other crypto-focused companies want to capitalize on strong market sentiment, raising funds to fuel growth as institutional interest in digital assets accelerates. They follow in the footsteps of stablecoin issuer Circle, which earlier this year completed a blockbuster IPO that raised more than $1 billion.

Since its debut, Circle's market capitalization has climbed to about $41 billion, with its share price up roughly 140%.

Beyond crypto-related stock offerings, institutional interest in digital assets is accelerating in other areas. In recent months, inflows into spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds have surged, more public companies have added digital assets to their corporate treasuries, and university endowments and pension funds have also been seeking exposure to the asset class.

According to Bitbo data, ETFs, along with public and private companies, collectively hold more than 13.5% of the total Bitcoin supply.

Last week during a presentation at the Blockchain Rio event, Brazil's central bank Governor Gabriel Gallipolo spoke about the bank's innovation agenda. The slide regarding DREX, the wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) initiative, didn't mention blockchain or tokenization. Nor was there much mention of CBDC for that matter.

DREX was always part of an open finance push by the Banco Central do Brasil, and it will remain so. But the focus of the next phase of work is now far narrower – to enable brokers to enable clients to use assets – stocks, bonds, and other assets – as loan collateral. So it's now a lien reconciliation project that will use neither blockchain nor decentralization technologies, but will integrate with PIX, Brazil's successful retail instant payment system. But some work using blockchain technologies will continue in the background.

There appear to be two issues driving the change of direction. The technical challenge of combining novel privacy solutions with Ethereum-based Hyperledger Besu was flagged during the first phase, resulting in delays. While the privacy solutions were progressing, the central bank did not consider them sufficient or battle tested. That first phase was quite narrow, involving a wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and digital treasury bonds (Federal public bonds), and smart contracts to manage their issuance, transfer and redemption. In the delayed second phase which ended last month, 16 participating consortia trialed various use cases. But the privacy solutions remain immature.

Last week during a presentation at the Blockchain Rio event, Brazil's central bank Governor Gabriel Gallipolo spoke about the bank's innovation agenda. The slide regarding DREX, the wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) initiative, didn't mention blockchain or tokenization. Nor was there much mention of CBDC for that matter.

DREX was always part of an open finance push by the Banco Central do Brasil, and it will remain so. But the focus of the next phase of work is now far narrower – to enable brokers to enable clients to use assets – stocks, bonds, and other assets – as loan collateral. So it's now a lien reconciliation project that will use neither blockchain nor decentralization technologies, but will integrate with PIX, Brazil's successful retail instant payment system. But some work using blockchain technologies will continue in the background.

There appear to be two issues driving the change of direction. The technical challenge of combining novel privacy solutions with Ethereum-based Hyperledger Besu was flagged during the first phase, resulting in delays. While the privacy solutions were progressing, the central bank did not consider them sufficient or battle tested. That first phase was quite narrow, involving a wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and digital treasury bonds (Federal public bonds), and smart contracts to manage their issuance, transfer and redemption. In the delayed second phase which ended last month, 16 participating consortia trialed various use cases. But the privacy solutions remain immature.

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

The crypto markets keep roaring. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies notched a new all-time high of almost $4.15 trillion early Monday morning, according to data from CoinGecko. That beats the last record set in late July. The total value of the crypto market has since dipped but is still up almost 0.6% over the past 24 hours. 

Among the top tokens, Ethereum is the biggest gainer. The world's second largest cryptocurrency crossed the threshold of $4,000 over the weekend for the first time since December. The token is up over 2% in the past 24 hours and now trades at around $4,300, according to data from Binance. 





Ethereum's surge outpaces Bitcoin's, but the world's largest cryptocurrency is still up 1.4% over the past day to cross the $120,000 mark, per Binance. The stock markets are essentially flat, with the S&P 500 slightly up since Monday morning.





The surge in the digital assets market comes amid two crypto-friendly executive orders from President Donald Trump. 





On Thursday, the 47th president instructed federal regulators to reevaluate their guidance on the allowance of alternative assets like crypto or private equity into employer-sponsored retirement plans. 




The measure essentially reinstated a similar order Trump had issued in 2020 during his first term that Preisdent Joe Biden rolled back when he assumed office.





Still, crypto industry analysts hailed last week's executive order as a potential windfall for the industry. Assets in 401(k)s totaled $8.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute.





On the same day that Trump potentially opened up 401(k)s to crypto, he also tackled one more pet issue for the digital assets industry. In an executive order, he instructed financial institutions to stop the practice of “debanking” of customers based on their politics, religious beliefs, or business activities.





The crypto industry has long decried banks' shuttering of their accounts, and some have alleged that there was a centralized conspiracy, known as Operation Chokepoint 2.0, to deny crypto businesses access to traditional financial institutions. Still, there hasn't been a smoking gun, or discrete guidance from regulators that instructed banks to stop working with crypto firms.





Regardless, industry advocates cheered on the president's order on debanking.




“Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was real,” Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer at the crypto exchange Coinbase, posted Thursday on X. “And now we see real action taken to fix it.”

As Ethereum continues to power an expanding ecosystem, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) stands out as one of the leading public companies aligned with the blockchain, Wall Street broker Bernstein said in a research report Monday.

The network's native token ether (ETH) has rallied 80% since June 5, the report noted, catalyzed by Circle's (CRCL) listing and the market's realization that most stablecoins are minted on the Ethereum network.

Coinbase operates one of the largest Layer 2 chains on Ethereum, Base, which processes more than 9 million transactions daily, encompassing stablecoins, trading, financial applications, and consumer-facing services, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

While Base has no native token, transaction gas fees are settled in ether, positioning Coinbase to earn sequencer fees in ETH. This contributes to an annualized revenue run rate of $75 million, the analysts wrote.

Beyond transaction fees, Base has also emerged as the dominant chain for token deployments, Bernstein said. Coinbase's decision to integrate all Base tokens into its primary exchange platform has significantly increased trading activity, further boosting ETH-denominated brokerage fees. 

The launch of the Base App, a consumer wallet for buying, selling, holding, and transferring crypto (including stablecoin payments), further strengthens Coinbase's exposure to Ethereum and its ecosystem.

In addition to its operational activities, Coinbase holds a sizable ether treasury valued at $590 million (136,782 ETH), making the company a direct beneficiary of the token's price appreciation, the broker said.

As Coinbase highlighted in its second quarter earnings report, July trading fees surged approximately 40% compared to the Q2 average, driven by increased ether trading activity. 

This surge reflects the broader market excitement surrounding ether, and with over 250 tokens listed on Coinbase, the exchange is poised to benefit from the broader Ethereum ecosystem growth, the report added.

Bernstein has an outperform rating on Coinbase stock with a $510 price target. The shares were 4% higher, trading around $323 at publication time.

 Sustained ETF inflows and corporate reserves could position ETH to outperform and challenge $5,000 for the first time ever. 

Key takeaways:

ETH rallied 41% in a month, but derivatives data shows traders remaining cautious, not bullish.

Institutional inflows and corporate Ether reserves suggest strong demand, yet recession risks cloud the outlook.

Ether (ETH) climbed to $4,349 on Monday, its highest price since December 2021. Despite outperforming the broader cryptocurrency market by more than 30% over the past 30 days, derivatives data shows ETH traders have yet to turn decisively bullish. 

This has raised doubts about whether a rally to $5,000 is likely in the near term.

ETH has gained 41% in the past month, compared to a 9% increase in total crypto market capitalization. With such strong outperformance, demand for hedging naturally rises as traders lock in profits and rotate into other opportunities. The lack of appetite for leveraged bullish bets above $4,000 is therefore not unexpected.

In neutral market conditions, monthly futures contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium relative to spot markets to offset the longer settlement period. Yet despite ETH nearing six-month highs, this premium remains below a clear bullish threshold. 

The lack of bullishness is somewhat concerning given that spot Ether exchange-traded funds attracted $683 million in net inflows between Thursday and Friday.

The ETH options market provides clues to gauge whether traders missed the rally and are waiting for a better entry or instead expect a price drop below $4,000. 

In bearish setups, the options delta skew moves above the 6% neutral mark as put (sell) contracts command higher premiums. Conversely, excessive bullishness will drive the indicator below -6%.

Currently at -3%, the ETH options delta skew points to neutral sentiment. The metric has improved significantly since Aug. 2, when it briefly turned bearish after a 13% price drop.

In short, professional traders are not aggressively bullish but are not expecting ETH to retest $4,000 either. Stronger institutional demand for ETH holdings helps explain this sentiment shift.

Publicly traded BitMine Immersion (BMNR) said Monday it added 317,126 ETH to its corporate reserves, valued at $1.35 billion at current prices. Meanwhile, Sharplink Gaming (SBET) disclosed it raised nearly $900 million to expand its ETH reserve strategy. 

The company already holds about 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet, worth over $2.55 billion at today's levels.

Ether's neutral derivatives readings appear encouraging, especially given that traders failed to anticipate the swift rally from $3,400 to $4,300 in just eight days. 

The longer ETH price stays above $4,000, the greater the likelihood that traders will gain confidence and initiate bullish positions, which could pave the way for a move toward $5,000.

Macroeconomic conditions and overall risk appetite remain the main obstacles to further gains. Some investors worry that US import tariffs could weigh on global economic growth. However, the expected summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump has eased geopolitical tensions, at least for now. 

If spot ETF inflows continue and companies keep raising capital to expand Ether reserves, ETH is well-positioned to outperform the broader cryptocurrency market.

Beeple caused Nakamigos NFTs to soar — and later plummet — in price this weekend after an AI-based stunt at the artist's CryptoPunks meetup depicted Larva Labs' founders launching an earlier iteration of the collection. 

At “CryptoPunks meetup 2.0,” a video showed an AI rendition of Matt Hall and John Watkinson supposedly launching the “V-ZERO CryptoPunks.”

The founders apparently discussed how the original, earlier iteration of CryptoPunks was created two years before the actual CryptoPunks NFT collection.

Both Hall and Beeple also signed flyers, however, these used pictures from the Nakamigos collection, a separate NFT project based on CryptoPunks. These flyers also rained down from the sky after the AI video was finished.

This led some to believe that the Nakamigos were in fact the “launched” V-0 Cryptopunks, and the collection's trading volume and price in ether (ETH) duly shot up by 1,782% and 127% respectively.

However, when news spread that it was a joke, the price tumbled by 57% and returned to a roughly pre-pump 0.189 ETH. 

Beeple then doubled down on the joke by releasing an apology video that ridiculed anyone who previously fell for the stunt. He listed multiple telltale signs that it was joke, and said he would make things right at the URL “I'mafuckingretard.com.”

Someone has already bought a similar domain and is using it to redirect people to a different NFT collection. Beeple also shared a satirical post implying a lawsuit had been filed that accused him of buying hundreds of Nakamigos NFTs in advance.

Crypto exchange Bullish has raised the size of its initial public offering to $990 million from $629 million, as the company looks to take advantage of a hot market for crypto firms.

CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Bullish.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Bullish is aiming to sell 30 million shares at a price of $32 to $33 each, or $990 million and a valuation of $4.8 billion at the top of the range.

In a previous filing on Aug. 4, the company had planned to market 20.3 million shares at $28 to $31 each, or about $629 million and a $4.2 billion valuation at the top of the range.

Bullish is one of many crypto companies hoping to take advantage of a booming IPO market in the space as the industry is starting to profit from a clearer regulatory framework and investor interest, not to mention sharply higher prices of late for leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.

Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was among first to go public in June and has seen its share price skyrocket 93% since.

In an earlier filing with the SEC, Bullish disclosed that funds managed by BlackRock and Ark Investment Management have expressed interest to buy $200 million worth of shares of the company at the IPO price.

The company, which would trade under the ticker “BLSH” also disclosed that it had posted a net income estimate of $106 million to $109 million for the second quarter after reporting losses for the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2024.

LAS VEGAS, Aug.  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bullet Blockchain, Inc.

Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today.

Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion (BMNR) said Monday its ether holdings have surpassed 1.15 million tokens, valued at about $4.9 billion, a level the company says makes it the largest corporate ETH treasury globally.

The disclosure extends BitMine's rapid accumulation this summer and makes it the first digital asset treasury company to surpass 1 million ETH. Previously, The Block reported the company at 625,000 ETH alongside a $1 billion stock repurchase program, and then 833,000 ETH worth $2.9 billion on Aug.4 as buys accelerated. Monday's announcement suggests the NYSE-listed firm added 317,000, or $1.3 billion worth of tokens, to its holdings since last week. The firm did not detail new financing in today's statement.

BitMine has positioned itself as an Ethereum-denominated treasury and staking company at a time when corporate ETH balance sheets are growing and institutional adoption is maturing. The Block's data shows Ethereum treasuries have climbed past $10 billion across tracked entities like SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital.



BitMine chairman Tom Lee, also co-founder of Fundstrat, said on CNBC that Ethereum could be entering a “2017 Bitcoin” moment fueled by three key drivers: a regulatory green light for stablecoins, signs of SEC openness to moving finance onchain, and major firms such as JPMorgan and Robinhood building on Ethereum.  Lee floated the prospect of an “Ethereum MicroStrategy” era and said prices could move from roughly $3,700 to $30,000 or more if those trends compound.

ETH traded for $4,189, 14% away from its previous all-time high, The Block's price page shows. BMNR surged 9% after the latest treasury announcement, while BitMine shares are up 634% since January, according to Yahoo Finance data.

Ether's (ETH) recent rally has pushed a vast majority of its addresses into profit, a development that could slow its ascent. 

According to analytics firm Sentora, 97% of ether addresses are now "in-the-money." In other words, the average acquisition costs of these addresses is lower than ether's going market rate of $4,225. 

This high profitability figure suggests that the current price rally could run into a significant increase in the sell-side pressure, a dynamic that could slow the price ascent. 

According to data by Glassnode, profit-taking is already happening. ETH profit realization, measured by a seven-day simple moving average, is ramping up again, with the tally climbing to $553 million per day. The profit taking peaked a $771 million per day in July. 

Further analysis reveals a shift in the source of this selling. While long-term holders, or those holding coins for over 155 days, are realizing profits at levels consistent with the peak in December 2024, it is now short-term investors who are driving the current wave of profit-taking.

One investment firm is down hundreds of millions of dollars after attempting to short Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins, according to on-chain analysis.

In a post on the social media platform X, Lookonchain says that crypto asset manager Abraxas Capital – a firm with around $3 billion in assets under its management – tried to short BTC, ETH, Solana (SOL), SUI Network (SUI), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) as a hedge on its other positions

However, the positions may have been too large and have resulted in nearly $200 million worth of unrealized losses.

“Abraxas Capital's two accounts are shorting ETH, BTC, SOL, HYPE, and SUI as a hedge against spot holdings, with total unrealized losses exceeding $190 million! They're holding 113,819 ETH ($483 million) in shorts – down more than $144 million.”

Shorting is the practice of borrowing a stock or crypto asset and selling it right away, with the expectation of buying it back later at a lower price for a profit.

The market analytics firm goes on to highlight another failed attempt to short Ethereum by an unknown whale, resulting in $20 million worth of losses.

“To avoid liquidation, whale 0x8c58 deposited another 8.6 million USDC into Hyperliquid over the past 24 hours. He shorted ETH at ~$2,969 on July 12, but as ETH kept climbing, he kept adding margin to avoid liquidation…

New liquidation price: $4,885.3.”

Looking at Solana, Lookonchain says that crypto asset management giant Galaxy Digital appears to be selling its stash of SOL as it has been moving the token into prominent crypto exchanges.

“Is Galaxy Digital dumping SOL? Galaxy Digital deposited another 224,000 SOL ($41.12 million) into Binance and Coinbase.”

Solana is trading for $184 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day, while BTC and ETH are worth $122,187 and $4,302, respectively.

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

Sometimes, amid the memecoins and pay-for-access scandals, it can be difficult to remember that the crypto industry was built on the principles of privacy and autonomy. The elusive Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, after all. Even as Wall Street swallows blockchain technology whole, the core is still a spirit of disintermediation. 

I joined Fortune in August 2022, the same month that the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that allowed users to input their (very traceable) cryptocurrency holdings and receive an anonymous output. The software, predictably, became a favorite of terrorist organizations and North Korean-affiliated hacking groups, but it also embodied the cypherpunk ideology that birthed the crypto sector.





OFAC's action created novel questions, such as whether a piece of code, rather than a person or organization, can be sanctioned. It also drew the ire of privacy advocates, who argued that internet users should have the right to own and send digital cash without government interference, just as offline people can with physical cash (to a degree). These, more than crypto bros trying to drive up the price of their tokens through sex toy-related stunts, are the fascinating dilemmas raised by blockchain technology, and what sets it apart from other forms of financial technology. (And as much as I hoped topics like Tornado Cash would dominate my coverage, Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX empire collapsed two months later.) 





A year after the sanctions, the Department of Justice brought charges against the creators of Tornado Cash, with one, Roman Storm, arrested in the United States. This was a tricky case for the crypto industry to get behind. The DOJ's indictment made clear that the founders knew their software's main utility was to help money launderers, including North Korea's Lazarus Group, and they were earning millions of dollars off the platform through their own proprietary token. In a recurring segment I like to call “Are you taking notes on a criminal f***ing conspiracy,” one founder admitted over text that they had to relinquish control over the software to make it seem like they weren't the owners. As one former DOJ prosecutor told me at the time, “These are pretty egregious facts.” 





But many powerful voices in the crypto industry, including the venture giant Paradigm, still threw their weight behind Storm, arguing that the government's case eroded the idea of privacy-preserving software and was in direct contradiction to previous guidance issued by the financial crimes division of the Treasury Department. 




Storm's initial trial, which was held in the same courthouse that hosted Bankman-Fried, wrapped up last week. Though he avoided two of the more serious charges, the jury still found him guilty on one, related to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. His advocates are vowing to fight it, arguing that the decision sets a dangerous precedent for the future of privacy software. 





The more interesting question is why the case was allowed to continue under the Trump administration, which has broadly embraced the crypto sector—or at least the elements more tied to financial gains. The Securities and Exchange Commission abandoned cases against Coinbase and Justin Sun, and the DOJ issued a memo announcing the end of “regulation by prosecution” against the blockchain industry. They even dropped one of the lesser charges against Storm about registration. But the core charge—that a developer should be responsible for non-custodial software—was allowed to continue. 





The refrain since Trump returned to office has been that, thanks to the lax new regulatory approach, crypto enforcement is off the table. Unfortunately for Storm, it seems that's restricted to memecoins.

An individual who participated in Ethereum's ETH/USD initial coin offering dumped nearly $10 million worth of the cryptocurrency early Monday.

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

The long-term investor deposited 2,300 ETH, worth $9.8 million as of this writing, to popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to on-chain tracking platform Spot On Chain.

The investor received as many as 20,000 ETH during ETH's ICO in 2014 and has been selling at set intervals. With the latest sale, they are left with a balance of only 1,623 ETH, worth $6.92 million.

The whale's tactic appeared contradictory to the broader market. According to IntoTheBlock, the amount of ETH held by long-term investors increased during the last 24 hours, indicating that accumulation was taking place.

Moreover, ETH recorded negative net flows in the last 24 hours, suggesting that more ETH was withdrawn than deposited on exchanges. This is typically seen as a preference for HODLing.

Meanwhile, over 50% of Binance's top trader accounts i.e, the top 20% users with the highest margin balance, were positioned long on ETH as of this writing, according to Coinglass.

ETH rallied sharply during the weekend, sailing past $4,300 for the first time since November 2021. As of this writing, it was 12.84% away from the all-time high.

Price Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,263.86, up 2.27% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.  The coin has surged nearly 20% over the last week.

An Ethereum initial coin offering participant has sold 2,300 ETH, worth about $9.9 million, early Monday morning, onchain data shows.

Onchain data analytics provider Lookonchain reported Monday that the address "0x845…a210c" transferred 2,300 ETH to Kraken, leaving the address with 1,623 ETH remaining.

The Ethereum ICO whale originally received 20,000 ETH for $6,200, which is now valued at around $86 million, according to Lookonchain.

In addition to Monday's transfer, the address made several previous outbound transfers: 250 ETH in December 2024, 1,000 ETH in February 2024, and 3,000 ETH in late November 2023, among others.

Ethereum climbed 1.64% in the past 24 hours to trade above $4,300 at the time of writing, reaching its highest levels since December 2021, according to The Block's Ethereum price page.

The Ethereum ICO, held from July 22 to September 2, 2014, raised about $18.3 million by selling over 60 million ETH tokens at an average price of $0.31 per ETH, with 1 BTC initially buying 2,000 ETH and later 1,337 ETH due to price adjustments.

The funds, equivalent to 31,531 BTC, supported the development of Ethereum, which launched in July 2015 with a total initial supply of 72 million ETH, 83% of which went to ICO investors.

This ICO, accessible globally without investor restrictions, yielded an ROI of more than 12,000-fold for early investors, based on Ethereum's current price.

An individual known as "Fede's intern" claims to have been detained in Turkey on allegations of helping others "misuse Ethereum," according to a series of posts on social media platform X. The person, who identifies as an Argentinian developer focused on ZK and Ethereum, said he is being held in Izmir.

In a post published on Sunday, Fede's intern wrote that Turkey's Minister of Interior accused him of facilitating Ethereum misuse and that authorities confined him to a room.

"It's obviously wrong, we are just infra builders," the developer said, while adding that he is open to cooperating with the authorities. In following posts, Fede's intern wrote that he is receiving assistance from his legal team and may soon be able to leave the country, headed to Europe.

As details about the specific accusations against Fede's intern remain unclear, some users on the social media platform have raised doubts about his claims, with user "0xCenk" stating that there is "zero legal basis" for detaining an individual on such charges.

In a reply, Fede's intern wrote: "[I'm] waiting to share more information until I'm out of the country and our attorney gives me the green light ... I don't know what the heck I win by inventing that this happened to me."

DeXRP, a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has raised over $4.3 million in its ongoing initial coin offering (ICO), according to recent reports [3]. The project, which combines automated market maker (AMM) pools with traditional order book trading, is designed to leverage the speed and low transaction costs of the XRP Ledger to deliver fast 4-second settlement times and minimal trading fees [1]. The DXP token, which is central to the DeXRP ecosystem, has already attracted over 6,235 investors, with nearly 80% of the initial distribution tokens sold [3].

The DXP token is currently priced at $0.05285, with an expected listing price of $0.35 [3]. Investors can purchase the token using Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, or USDT on supported networks, as well as through bank card transactions. The tokenomics are structured to support long-term sustainability, with 25% of the total supply allocated to the presale, 15% reserved for liquidity provision, and 10% earmarked for staking rewards [3]. The project is also introducing a dynamic fee mechanism that allows liquidity providers to bid for lower trading fees, an innovative approach aimed at enhancing user incentives and platform efficiency [3].

DeXRP aims to serve as a go-to trading hub for the XRPL community, offering advanced features such as real-time analytics, smart order routing, and a transparent governance model for token holders [3]. The platform's utility-first approach is designed to support liquidity providers, traders, institutional investors, and DeFi platforms on the XRP Ledger. The project's development is aligned with the growing interest in the XRP ecosystem, which has seen its on-chain TVL increase from $20 million to $100 million in just eight months [3].

With the XRP Ledger already demonstrating a 34% monthly growth rate in real-world asset (RWA) adoption, DeXRP's launch is expected to further accelerate the expansion of DeFi on the chain [3]. The project has also drawn attention from major industry players, including Messari and Big Brain Holdings, which are anticipated to contribute to its early-stage growth [3]. DeXRP's planned cross-chain capabilities and integration with major analytics platforms could further broaden its appeal to a global user base.

The DXP token listing is expected to be announced in the coming months, with a projected launch by Q4 2025 [3]. As the project moves toward its official listing, it remains focused on transparency, compliance, and institutional-grade security, positioning itself as a key player in the evolving DeFi landscape.

Cellular immunity, mediated by tumor antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, has a critical role in the success of cancer immunotherapy by targeting intracellular driver and passenger tumor mutations. We present the final results of the phase 1 AMPLIFY-201 trial, in which patients who completed standard locoregional treatment, with minimal residual mKRAS disease (n = 25, 20 pancreatic cancer and 5 colorectal cancer), received monotherapy vaccination with lymph node-targeting ELI-002 2P, including mutant KRAS (mKRAS) amphiphile-peptide antigens (G12D, G12R) and amphiphile-adjuvant CpG-7909. At a median follow-up of 19.7 months, efficacy correlated with mKRAS-specific T cell responses above or below a threshold 9.17-fold increase over baseline, with median radiographic relapse-free survival not reached, versus 3.02 months (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.12, P = 0.0002) and median overall survival not reached versus 15.98 months (HR = 0.23, P = 0.0099). Seventy-one percent of evaluable patients induced both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, with sustained immunogenicity. Following ELI-002 2P treatment, antigen spreading was observed in 67% of patients, with increased T cells reactive to personalized, tumor antigens absent from the ELI-002 2P vaccine. Therefore, lymph node-targeting amphiphile vaccination induces persistent T cell responses targeting oncogenic driver KRAS mutations, alongside personalized, tumor antigen-specific T cells, which may correlate to clinical outcomes in pancreatic and colorectal cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04853017.

Tumor-promoting driver mutations in KRAS occur in approximately 20–25% of human tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC) (50%) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (93%). Despite curative intent, relapses are common following standard locoregional therapy, particularly for resectable PDAC. Subsequent elevated ctDNA or serum tumor antigen defines a biomarker-relapsed, minimal residual disease (MRD+) patient group at high risk for radiographic progression1,2. Further treatment following disease relapse/recurrence is primarily palliative and noncurative in intent (5-year survival = 23.3%3). Mutations in KRAS are attractive public neoantigens for immunotherapy due to their prevalence, truncal status and essential driver function. Growing evidence of mKRAS recognition by diverse human HLA alleles4,5,6 suggests that many patients could benefit from an effective off-the-shelf mKRAS-specific therapeutic vaccine. Recent analysis found T cells specific to G12D and/or G12V in 20/20 (100%) of healthy donors evaluated across a diverse HLA background, suggesting that the majority of patients include mKRAS-specific TCRs within their immune repertoire6. However, vaccination with conventional immunogens, including relatively small (<20 kDa) peptide antigens and molecular adjuvants, results in poor accumulation in lymph nodes where uptake by antigen-presenting cells programs adaptive immunity7. Conversely, chemical modification with albumin-binding lipid moieties facilitates delivery of amphiphile vaccines from peripheral injection sites to lymph nodes via size-dependent lymphatic transport by endogenous albumin (~65 kDa), resulting in improved antigen-specific T cell responses8.

We previously reported the safety, immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity observed in a dose escalation phase 1 trial9. Patients received ELI-002 2P, including lymph node-targeted amphiphile mKRAS G12D-specific and G12R-specific, 18-mer peptide antigens, designed to be processed into HLA class I and HLA class II epitopes. These immunizing peptide antigens were co-administered with an amphiphile-adjuvant CpG-7909 in 25 patients with surgically resected stage I-IV PDAC (n = 20) and CRC (n = 5) who had no evidence of disease on imaging but had detectable MRD+ (ctDNA positive in n = 13/25, CA19-9 and/or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) criteria in n = 7/25, or both n = 5/25; Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). Preliminary results at the initial time of data cutoff (6 September 2023; median cohort follow-up time 8.5 months) showed that monotherapy treatment with ELI-002 2P-induced potent mKRAS-directed T cell responses in 21/25 (84%) of the participants, including both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 59%. T cell responses above the median 12.75-fold increase from baseline significantly correlated with improved tumor biomarker response and relapse-free survival (RFS)9. Herein we update post hoc analyses of immunogenicity and clinical outcomes with more than double the follow-up time to demonstrate that ELI-002 2P-induced T cell responses are potent, sustained and continue to correlate with freedom from relapse and death. Immune responses included sustained mKRAS-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets exhibiting favorable effector cytokine function, cytotoxic markers and memory phenotype, as well as antigen spreading to personalized tumor antigens beyond the immunizing antigens.

At a median follow-up of 19.7 months for the cohort (data cutoff: 24 September 2024), no new safety signals were identified in the primary endpoint assessment. The exploratory endpoints of radiographic RFS and overall survival (OS) were reassessed. At extended follow-up, the n = 25 cohort median OS was 28.94 months (Fig. 1a). The median RFS was maintained at 16.33 months (Fig. 1b). Analysis of the PDAC subset indicated that mRFS (15.31 months) and mOS (28.94 months) were similar to those observed for the whole cohort (Extended Data Fig. 2). Study visits were concluded for AMPLIFY-201 in August 2024.

To assess the potential impact of mKRAS-specific T cell responses on clinical outcomes (OS and radiographic RFS), an exploratory receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) analysis was conducted10. While prior supervision was performed empirically using the median9, we identified a T cell fold-change threshold of 9.17 that optimally separated patients with better (n = 17, 68%) and worse (n = 8, 32%) outcomes, as determined by ROC analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3). As observed previously, the strength of ELI-002 2P-induced mKRAS-specific T cell response was correlated to tumor biomarker response (Fig. 1c), with patients exhibiting T cell response fold change above the 9.17 threshold universally achieving biomarker reductions, including six of six (100%) patients achieving complete ctDNA clearance. Presence or absence of radiographic progression or death (radiographic RFS) was also significantly associated with T cell response (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Table 1)—among the 17 patients with T cell responses above the 9.17 threshold, 11 (65%) were free from radiographic progression, including 5 who remained free of relapse and did not receive any subsequent therapy following ELI-002 2P; 6 (35%) patients received subsequent chemotherapy following tumor biomarker increase yet remained free from disease progression throughout follow-up. As three of six patients who remained free from radiographic progression received subsequent therapy, including immune checkpoint inhibition, following biomarker progression, it will be essential to evaluate these combinations prospectively in future trials. Although subsequent chemotherapy has the potential to negatively impact expanding tumor-specific T cells, prior use of sequential vaccination and chemotherapy regimens has shown that vaccine-induced T cell responses can be maintained following cytotoxic therapy11,12. The current data suggest that anti-mKRAS T cell induction may synergize with subsequent treatment to enable unexpectedly positive outcomes. In contrast to patients with T cell responses above the 9.17 threshold, radiographic progression was observed for all eight patients below the T cell threshold, and seven of eight (88%) died. This is consistent with an approximate threefold increase in risk of radiographic progression/death in the below threshold group (relative risk = 2.96), further suggesting that sufficient cellular immunity to driver mKRAS oncogenes may confer durable benefit. Moreover, the median OS of patients with above-threshold T cell responses was not reached, compared to 15.98 months (Fig. 1e; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.23, P = 0.0099). Finally, the median RFS was not reached compared to 3.02 months for patients with T cell fold change above or below the threshold (Fig. 1f; HR = 0.12, P = 0.0002). This was consistent with updated analysis of radiographic RFS and OS supervised by the prior 12.75 median T cell fold change (Extended Data Fig. 4). The high proportion of patients with above-threshold T cell responses who remained without radiographic evidence of disease following subsequent therapy for biochemical progression (6/11, 55%) suggests that vaccination with ELI-002 or early treatment at the time of biochemical progression may be important strategies to evaluate in future prospective trials.

At extended follow-up, 84% (21/25) of patients generated mKRAS-specific T cell responses following ELI-002 2P immunization with 100% responders at the two highest dose levels (5.0, 10.0 mg of adjuvant Amph-CpG-7909). The median response was 13.38-fold over baseline for all patients; however, 17 patients exhibited responses above the ROC threshold of 9.17-fold (Fig. 2a–c). Fifty-seven percent of patients induced responses to all seven mKRAS antigens evaluated (Fig. 2d). Seventy-one percent of patients induced both CD4+ and CD8+ mKRAS-specific T cells and the induction of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells significantly correlated with overall tumor biomarker response, indicating the potential importance of a balanced T cell response for improved tumor biomarker response (Fig. 2e,f). All 12 patients who induced both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells had T cell responses above the 9.17 threshold, suggesting an association between these biomarkers (Extended Data Table 2). ELI-002 2P vaccination amplified mKRAS-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting granzyme B and perforin, indicating cytolytic potential; 68% (13/19) of patients induced granzyme B and perforin secreting mKRAS-specific CD4+ T cells after vaccination with predominant central and effector memory phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 5). Likewise, 84% (16/19) of patients had cytotoxic mKRAS-specific CD8+ T cells, substantially composed of TEMRA memory cells (Extended Data Fig. 6). ELI-002 2P-induced mKRAS-specific T cells were persistent before and after booster vaccination with seven of eight (88%) evaluable patients maintaining elevated T cell responses relative to baseline levels following booster vaccinations (Fig. 2g). Furthermore, postboost, long-lived mKRAS-specific CD4+ T cells showed significantly increased central memory phenotype compared to baseline with associated decreases in the naive subset (Fig. 2h). Although not required in the AMPLIFY-201 study, collection of tumor tissue at the time of progression in future studies will allow for assessment of the tumor-immune microenvironment, which may elucidate potential mechanisms of resistance. Finally, antigen spreading was assessed to examine the potential for ELI-002 2P to promote the expansion of immune responses targeting personalized tumor neoantigens not present in the vaccine. Nonimmunizing antigens from each patient's personal tumor mutanome were selected for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) immunogenicity assessment directly ex vivo. T cell responses targeting nonvaccine tumor neoantigens were significantly expanded from baseline levels in 67% (6/9) of the tested patients (Fig. 2i,j). Overall, 13 of 52 (25%) evaluated neoantigens showed increased T cell responses, including examples of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as expansion of pre-existing, baseline-detectable responses or de novo expansion. Furthermore, five of six (83%) patients with positive antigen-spreading responses had mKRAS T cell counts above the ROC threshold, suggesting that robust mKRAS-specific T cell induction may be associated with diversification of the tumor-directed T cell response. Future assessment of larger patient groups will be critical to defining the potential contribution of antigen spreading to clinical outcomes.

Recently, multiple examples of next-generation therapeutic cancer vaccination have demonstrated promise in early phase and randomized clinical studies12,13,14,15. Innovative trial designs have focused on the adjuvant setting, where tumor burden is low, potentially allowing for robust and durable T cell responses to provide long-term protection from recurrence and death. Historically, PDAC has previously been considered a poor setting for immunotherapy; however, the favorable results from ELI-002 2P are consistent with the long-term follow-up of adjuvant patients with PDAC who received personalized mRNA vaccination in combination with atezolizumab and adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX12. In the long-term follow-up of ELI-002 2P treatment, mKRAS-specific T cell responses above a 9.17-fold threshold were significantly correlated to freedom from radiographic progression and death (radiographic RFS HR = 0.12, P = 0.0002; OS HR = 0.23, P = 0.0099). Outcomes in the PDAC subset, with a median radiographic RFS of 15.31 months and a median OS of 28.94 months, are notable given the historically rapid progression of patients with PDAC who have ctDNA+ MRD-relapse postsurgery, with a median radiographic RFS/DFS of 5.0–6.37 months and a median OS of 17.0 months12,16. Limitations of the study include the small sample size, nonrandomized design and that the median follow-up of the cohort is shorter than the median OS, suggesting that this estimate may continue to mature. Additionally, while the relatively small sample size and lack of an external validation cohort are limitations for the ROC analysis as performed, the subgroups were relatively well balanced for tumor type, tumor stage, prior therapies and baseline MRD characteristics (Extended Data Table 3). Notably, all five patients with G12R tumor mutations had T cell responses above the 9.17 threshold. Prior studies in PDAC have observed favorable clinical outcomes as well as decreased PDL1 expression for G12R17,18. This factor, together with potentially increased immunogenicity, may in part explain the more favorable clinical outcomes of PDAC patients with this mKRAS variant.

ELI-002 2P-induced mKRAS-specific T cell responses obtained in the monotherapy setting were observed in 100% of patients treated at the RP2D (adjuvant Amph-CpG-7909 was dose escalated), included both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and were sustained throughout the follow-up period, including development of memory and maintenance of critical antitumor effector functions. In the majority of T cell responders (17/21), T cell responses were observed against the specific tumor antigen detected at the time of enrollment. Analysis of tumor-specific T cell response and antigen spreading among larger patient groups, and with additional serial PBMC samples, will be helpful to further understand the instances where responses to the tumor antigen identified during screening were not observed. Additional longitudinal data will be useful to inform whether long-term dosing may augment cellular immunity. In addition to expanded T cells targeting mKRAS driver mutations, treatment with ELI-002 2P frequently led to antigen spreading, with ex vivo-detectable expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeting additional personalized tumor neoantigens similar to those discretely targeted by personalized vaccination. These are consistent with prior observations of antigen spreading following amphiphile vaccination19,20,21 suggesting a role for lymph node immune activation as a mechanism supporting the development of tumor-specific T cells in situ.

Taken together, the long-term follow-up of the AMPLIFY-201 phase 1 study provides evidence that ELI-002 2P induces potent, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity to mKRAS alongside frequent antigen spreading that may delay tumor recurrence. A randomized phase 2 study (NCT05726864) of a seven-peptide formulation (ELI-002 7P—KRAS/NRAS G12D, R, V, S, A, C and G13D) is ongoing in the adjuvant setting of PDAC. Beyond PDAC, off-the-shelf availability of ELI-002 supports broad development for various mKRAS-expressing tumor types. In conclusion, our observations support continued study of amphiphile lymph node-targeted immunotherapy for solid tumors.

A phase 1, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human trial of ELI-002 2P monotherapy was conducted in five ascending dose cohorts at seven centers in the United States between 4 October 2021 and 24 September 2024 (the clinical cutoff date for the results presented here). A fixed dose of Amph-Peptides 2P (G12D and G12R, 0.7 mg each) was administered with escalating doses of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg Amph-CpG-7909 adjuvant. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had mKRAS G12D-mutated or G12R-mutated pancreatic or colorectal cancers and were at high risk for relapse because of the presence of MRD (indicated by ctDNA-positivity or elevated serum CA19-9 and/or CEA). Clinical data was entered into Medidata Rave 2018.2.4. Additional details are provided in the study protocol (Supplementary Data 1).

We enrolled adult (≥18 years old) patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 with pathologically confirmed mKRAS (G12D or G12R) PDAC or CRC, who were MRD+ with either (1) absolute CA19-9 ≥ 90 U ml−1 or CEA ≥ 15 ng ml−1 or (2) successively rising values (≥1 week apart) in either CA19-9 or CEA not attributable to a noncancer condition, such as pancreatitis, peritonitis, postoperative leak/fistula or biliary obstruction. Patients had recovered from prior surgery, chemotherapy or radiation without ongoing medical/surgical issues and were willing to use effective methods to avoid pregnancy and provided written informed consent. Baseline absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 109 l−1, platelets ≥100 × 109 l−1, normal range liver function tests, serum creatinine <1.5 (or if serum creatinine was ≥1.5 mg dl−1, creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft–Gault formula ≥60 ml min−1 was acceptable), albumin ≥2.5 g dl−1 and IL6 <500 pg ml−1 were required.

PDAC patients had high risk tumor stages I, II, III or stage IV oligometastatic disease per current American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria with no evidence of disease on current imaging (equivocal radiographic findings such as subcentimeter lesions or potential resolving soft tissue changes after surgery were accepted), prior treatment with standard chemotherapy/chemoradiation administered in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting, and complete tumor resection (R0 or R1 pathologic margins), with focal use of intraoperative irreversible electroporation permitted.

CRC patients had high risk stage II (T4N0), stage III (T4N1-2/TanyN2) or stage IV oligometastatic disease per current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria, prior cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, or as total neoadjuvant therapy, and complete surgical resection (R0 or R1 pathologic margins), with focal use of intraoperative irreversible electroporation permitted.

We excluded patients who received antitumor therapy within 4 weeks, who had history of brain metastasis, other malignancies within the last 3 years (except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix, bladder, prostate, basal or squamous cell skin cancer), were receiving immunosuppressive drugs, those with serious comorbid illness including uncontrolled infection, class III or IV (New York Heart Association) cardiac failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months, active seizure disorders, autoimmune diseases or interstitial lung disease if requiring systemic steroids, pulse oximetry <92% on room air, prior organ transplants, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, hepatitis C (unless they had a sustained virologic response to direct-acting antiviral therapy) and those in the first two weeks of SARS-CoV-2. Women were excluded if pregnant or lactating. PDAC patients were excluded when tumors were of neuroendocrine subtype, or when there was a germline BRCA 1/2 mutation; CRC patients were excluded when tumors were mismatch repair defective (MSI+).

Treatment was divided into a ‘prime immunization series' (six subcutaneous doses of ELI-002 2P over 8 weeks), a 3-month ‘no dosing period' (observation) and a ‘booster immunization series' (4 weekly doses of ELI-002 2P). A follow-up period of up to 2 years was included after the first dose of ELI-002 2P to monitor safety and efficacy.

The study was sponsored and designed by Elicio Therapeutics in collaboration with the academic authors. The study and analyses were conducted in accordance with the general principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization. The trial protocol, amendments and supporting documents were approved by the local/central institutional review board for each study site, the US Food and Drug Administration and were registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04853017). All patients provided written informed consent.

A safety and monitoring committee was convened to review safety and determine dose escalation and cohort expansion decisions. Cohorts ranged from three to six patients with expansions allowed after the first three patients completed 28 days without dose-limiting toxicity and when additional eligible patients had been identified.

All the authors affirm that the trial was conducted in accordance with the study protocol and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data. All the authors reviewed and revised the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication.

The initial protocol (version 1.0) was approved on 13 July 2020. Key protocol amendments are as follows: Amendment 2 (version 3.0) was approved on 23 February 2021 and included changes requested by the US Food and Drug Administration. This was the initial protocol for initiating the study. On 8 April 2022, Amendment 4 (version 5.0) was approved and added serum tumor biomarkers (that is, CEA and CA19-9) to the MRD eligibility along with ctDNA. Amendment 5 (version 6.0), approved on 2 August 2022, added language regarding pseudo-progression and continued ELI-002 dosing. Amendment 6 (version 7.0) was approved on 25 January 2023 and added language for public record search for OS. Amendment 7 (version 8.0) was approved on 7 August 2023 and added another year of follow-up to collect additional RFS and OS.

Primary endpoints of the study were safety (adverse events were graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0), tolerability and determination of the RP2D. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include tumor biomarker reduction and clearance defined through assessment of ctDNA and/or serum tumor antigens (CA19-9 or CEA), radiographic relapse-free survival, defined as the time from initiation of ELI-002 treatment until confirmed radiographic progression using iRECIST criteria, and OS, and immunogenicity.

PBMCs for immunogenicity analysis were processed from leukapheresis (baseline, week 9) or whole-blood collections (all other timepoints). Patient PBMCs were processed by the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient protocol for leukapheresis samples or cell processing tubes (BD) for whole-blood samples. PBMCs were resuspended in CS10 freezing media (Cryostor), frozen in aliquots of 10–20 million cells per cryovial and stored in a temperature-monitored liquid nitrogen vapor phase freezer. Only PBMCs collected before subsequent therapy are included in datasets and graphs, with the exception of the long-term duration graphs (Fig. 2g,h). The maximum T cell response was determined as the maximum fold change from baseline to any postvaccination timepoint in either the ‘Ex vivo FluoroSpot assay' or ‘Ex vivo ICS assay' for any of the seven mKRAS antigens or a pool of all seven antigens combined. Figure 2a includes data from all T cell responders (n = 21/25). Figure 2b contains data from all responders with FluoroSpot data (n = 19/25) while Fig. 2c contains data from all responders with ICS data (n = 17/25). Figure 2g contains data from all patients with booster doses that had responses in FluoroSpot assay (n = 8) while Fig. 2h contains data from the boosted patients in Fig. 2g that were also tested for memory markers in the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay (n = 6/8).

A direct IFNγ/granzyme B (GrB) FluoroSpot assay was performed on thawed PBMCs. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed in 10% human AB serum/RPMI media + Benzonase and rested overnight at 37 °C. Precoated human IFNγ/GrB FluoroSpot plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with AIM-V media for at least 30 min (MabTech). The 2 × 105 rested PBMCs were plated into each well and stimulated for 44 h as per the manufacturer's instructions with seven individual mKRAS peptide pools and a WT peptide pool. Each pool consisted of a KRAS 18-mer peptide along with the corresponding 9-mer and 10-mer overlapping peptides (OLPs), at a concentration of 2 µg per peptide per ml. No exogenous cytokines were added to the PBMCs during this assay. All samples were plated in triplicate. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the negative control (background wells) and anti-CD3 (MabTech) was used as the positive control. The plate was developed based on the manufacturer's instructions. Plates were scanned and counted using the IRIS plate reader (MabTech) using the FITC and Cy3 filters. Data are background subtracted, averaged per triplicate measurements and normalized to 1 × 106 PBMCs. A postvaccination sample was characterized as positive if it was at least 2 s.d. above the DMSO negative control. A responder in the FluoroSpot assay was defined as a patient with a ≥2-fold increase from baseline at any postvaccination timepoint and more than the minimum threshold of 50 total IFNγ and GrB spot-forming cells per 1 × 106 PBMCs.

A direct ICS assay for IL2, IFNγ and TNF was performed by flow cytometry. PBMCs were thawed and rested overnight. In total, 106 PBMCs per well were plated and stimulated for 17 h at 37 °C with individual mKRAS peptide pools at 2 μg ml−1 per peptide (Supplementary Table 1). GolgiStop and GolgiPlug (BD) were also added to each well. The next day, cells were surface stained with antibodies against CD4 (BV421—clone, SK3; BD, 566907; 2.5 μl per well), CD8 (BV786—clone, RPA-T8; BD, 563823; 1:25), CD45RA (Alexa 700—clone, HI100; BioLegend, 304120; 1:25), CCR7 (PE-CF594—clone, 15053; BD, 562381; 1:12.5), Aqua Live/Dead marker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L34966; 0.5 μl per well) and dump markers CD14 (PE-Cy5—clone, 61D3; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15-0149-42; 1:200), CD16 (PE-Cy5—clone, 3G8; BioLegend, 302010; 1:200), and CD19 (PE-Cy5—clone, SJ25C1; BioLegend, 363042; 1:100). Cells were subsequently fixed with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD) and further stained with antibodies against CD3 (APC-H7—clone, SK7; BD, 560176; 2.5 μl per well), IFNγ (FITC—clone, Mab11; BioLegend, 506504; 1:200), TNF (BV711—clone, B27; BioLegend, 502940; 1:50) and IL2 (BV650—clone, MQ1-17H12; BioLegend, 500334; 1:50). Cells fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde were acquired on a BD FACSymphony and data were analyzed with BD FlowJo V10 software (gating progression and example plots in Supplementary Fig. 1). A responder in the ICS assay was defined as a patient having ≥2-fold increase in total IFNγ, IL2 and TNF from baseline at any postvaccination timepoint, along with a cytokine+ T cell frequency of ≥0.1%.

Some patients were also tested in an extended ‘Ex vivo ICS assay' that included additional activation and cytotoxic markers. The extended ‘Ex vivo ICS assay' was set up using the same methods as above, with the addition of CD107a (Alexa Fluor 700—clone, H4A3; BD, 561340; 1.25 μl per well) during the 17 h stimulation. The next day, cells were surface stained with antibodies against CD8 (BUV805—clone, SK1, BD, 612889), CD45RA (PE-Cy7—clone, HI100; BD, 560675), CCR7 (BUV615—clone, 3D12; BD, 562381), Aqua Live/Dead marker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L34966; 0.5 μl per well) and dump markers CD14 (PE-Cy5—clone, 61D3; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15-0149-42; 1:400), CD16 (PE-Cy5—clone, 3G8; BioLegend, 302010; 1:100) and CD19 (PE-Cy5—clone, SJ25C1; BioLegend, 363042; 1:100). Cells were subsequently fixed with the FoxP3/transcription factor staining buffer set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and further stained with antibodies against CD3 (APC-H7—clone, SK7; BD, 560176; 1:40), CD4 (BUV496—clone, SK3; BD, 612936; 1:40), IFNγ (BB700—clone, B27; BD, 566394; 1:80), TNF (BV750—clone, MAb11; BioLegend, 502940; 1:80), IL2 (BV421—clone, MQ1-17H12; BD, 564164; 1:40), granzyme B (FITC—clone, GB11; BD, 560211; 1:40), perforin (PE—clone, B-D48; BioLegend, 353304; 1;80), CD137 (BUV661—clone, 4B4-1; BD, 741642; 1;80), CD154 (BUV563—clone, TRAP-1; BD, 748984; 1:80), CD69 (BV711—clone, FN50; BD, 563836; 1:160), Ki67 (BV650—clone, B56; BD, 563757; 1;80) and FoxP3 (PE/Dazzle 594—clone, 206D; BioLegend, 320126; 1:160).

Comprehensive genomic profiling, whole-exome sequencing (WES), was performed to determine whether the patient's tumor harbored at least one of the two mKRAS alleles targeted by the ELI-002 2P (G12D or G12R). The Natera Signatera ctDNA test evaluated for the presence or absence of circulating tumor DNA. WES was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples with at least 20% tumor content confirmed by a pathologist under the Central Lab Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists guidelines. Genomic DNA was extracted from the patient's normal (whole blood) and tumor tissue. Libraries of tumor and matched germline DNA were prepared and exomic regions were captured. The assay was performed by target enrichment of the isolated DNA, followed by 440× coverage sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). Somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that were present in the tumor and absent in the germline were identified. A proprietary Natera algorithm selected a set of 16 SNVs to maximize the detectability of tumor DNA if present in plasma. Polymerase chain reaction primers targeting the 16 personalized SNVs were designed and synthesized to be used to identify and track ctDNA in a patient's plasma. Cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma and analyzed using a multiplexed personalized polymerase chain reaction assay. Plasma samples with ≥2 SNVs detected above a predefined confidence threshold were deemed ctDNA+, and ctDNA concentration was reported as mean tumor molecules per milliliter of plasma. In patients without adequate tumor tissue, a plasma-based ctDNA assay for mKRAS variants was performed using Sysmex SafeSEQ RAS-RAF. Cell-free DNA was isolated from plasma and a next-generation sequencing-based assay that evaluated K/NRAS to detect SNVs was performed using NextSeq 550 (Illumina). The ctDNA concentration was reported as the number of mutant molecules per variant and the mutant allele frequency. Local testing was permitted if already available to confirm mKRAS status. Serum tumor biomarkers, CA19-9 and CEA, were analyzed by the local laboratories at each study site.

To assess for antigen spreading, PBMCs were stimulated in the ‘Ex vivo FluoroSpot assay' and ‘Ex vivo ICS assay' as above, with neoantigens not included in the ELI-002 2P vaccine. Genomic DNA is extracted from the patient's normal and tumor samples using next-generation sequencing WES. Using the WES data for each patient, somatic single-nucleotide mutations present in the tumor and absent in the germline genomic DNA were identified using a validated bioinformatics tool (GEM ExTra pipeline NG2-LDT 1.14.0; Natera). The reference genome assembly used for alignment is NCBI GRCh37. Stop-gain and start-loss mutations were excluded. Up to ten neoantigens were randomly selected from the list of somatic SNVs generated by WES for each tested patient for antigen spreading testing. An algorithm was not used to select these neoantigens. First, an 18-mer was designed (generally with the mutation centered in the middle) and then Genscript synthesized two 15-mers overlapping by 11 to cover the mutated 18-mer (18-mer sequences found in Supplementary Table 1).

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic, medical history and safety data. Continuous variables were summarized using mean, s.d., median, minimum value and maximum value. Categorical variables were summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Clinical efficacy outcomes, such as tumor biomarker reduction or clearance, were examined for association with categorical variables, including high versus low T cell response, using the Mann–Whitney test. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the survival distributions. The log-rank test was used to compare the RFS between the high and low T cell responders and the ROC analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. SAS v9.4 and R v4.4.3 were used to create Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 2–4 and perform statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism v9.4 was used to create Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6 and perform statistical analysis.

Deep-Sea Desalination Pulls Drinking Water from the Depths

Companies are experimenting with deep-sea tech to produce cheaper fresh water

By Vanessa Bates Ramirez edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

From Cape Town to Tehran to Lima to Phoenix, dozens of cities across the globe have experienced water shortages recently. And in the next five years the world's demand for fresh water could significantly outpace supply, according to a United Nations forecast. Now several companies are turning to an unexpected source for a solution: the bottom of the ocean.

Called subsea desalination, the idea is to remove the salt from water in the deep sea. If it worked at scale, the technology could greatly alleviate the world's water access problems.

Costs and energy requirements have kept desalination from going mainstream in most of the world. Early desalination involved boiling seawater and condensing the steam, a purely thermal method that used loads of energy. This approach was later replaced by multistage flash distillation, in which temperature and pressure “flash” salt water to steam. In the past 25 years reverse osmosis has become more common—it uses high pressure to push seawater through a membrane with holes so small that only water molecules squeeze through, leaving salt behind.

Reverse osmosis is more efficient than distillation, but it takes a lot of energy to pressurize millions of gallons of seawater and move it through filters. What if we could let that movement happen naturally by harnessing the pressure hundreds of meters underwater?

That's the idea behind subsea desalination. Reverse osmosis pods are submerged to depths of around 500 meters (1,600 feet), where immense hydrostatic pressure does the heavy lifting of separating water from salt. Purified water is then pumped back to shore. Far-fetched as it may sound, there are multiple prototypes already at work; the companies behind them aim to take cheap, large-scale desalination from pipe dream to reality.

One of these companies is Oslo-based Flocean. Its founder and CEO, Alexander Fuglesang, says there's no revolutionary new technology behind his business; it's “essentially a subsea pump cleverly coupled to existing membrane and filter technology,” he says. What's new is the energy savings—Flocean uses 40 to 50 percent less energy than conventional plants—and modular systems that can be deployed to many deep-sea location without bespoke engineering.

The seafloor has other benefits, too. This region harbors fewer bacteria and other microorganisms than at shallower depths, and there is little local variation in temperature or pressure. “The deep sea is really predictable,” Fuglesang says. “It's the same 365 days a year.” This isn't the case at land-based plants, which have to deal with algae blooms, river runoff, storms and seasonal temperature changes. Plus, less chemical pretreatment of the water is needed at depth, and because the equipment is all underwater, there's no “not in my backyard” controversy over putting big, unsightly infrastructure near the seashore.

Despite its advantages over land-based plants, subsea desalination has several hurdles to clear before scaling to commercial levels. For starters, it's still too expensive. Land-based desalination is several times more costly than pulling water from aquifers or lakes, even at giga-plants in the Middle East that benefit from abundant solar power and large economies of scale. Even if subsea technology cuts the cost of land-based desalination down by 40 percent, it will still be a pricey way to obtain potable water.

“We need to remember that once the water is desalinated, it still needs to be pumped up from depths of up to 600 meters,” says Nidal Hilal, founding director of New York University's Water Research Center in Abu Dhabi, who has studied water-treatment engineering for more than 30 years. “Early pilot tests show promise, but the technology has yet to be proven at large scale.”

Affordable renewable energy will make subsea desalination more viable. Improvements in technology will also help. Hilal's research group, for example, is developing electrically conductive reverse osmosis membranes that keep themselves clean by repelling salt ions and impurities. They would extend maintenance intervals, which Fuglesang says might be two to three years with existing membranes.

Although proponents of the technology say it would have little effect on undersea life, others urge further research to gauge its impact on marine ecosystems. “Many organisms thrive at a 500-meter depth,” says Adina Paytan, a professor affiliated with the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The twilight zone—which extends from 200 to 1,000 meters below the surface—is not only home to organisms such as whales, squid and jellyfish. “It's extremely important for many ocean processes such as the carbon cycle and nutrient cycling,” Paytan says. Companies will need to ensure that their water intake and salty brine by-product don't harm marine life or significantly alter these processes.

Given the depths required, subsea desalination won't work in just any seaside location. “Many coastal cities lie on wide continental shelves, meaning deep water is far offshore,” Hilal says. Coastlines with steep drop-offs are ideal because shallow shelves would require long pipelines, adding to capital and operational costs.

Fuglesang isn't worried about technical or engineering hurdles; he says the industry's biggest challenge will be aligning customers, governments and financial partners. Flocean is working on what will be the world's first large-scale subsea desalination plant, off the coast of Norway, and has a contract to start supplying water to an industrial facility in 2026. Netherlands-based Waterise has also secured its first industrial customer, with plans to start building a plant in the Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba later this year, and Bay Area–based OceanWell is testing its prototype near Los Angeles.

Long-term government contracts will most likely be needed for subsea desalination to really take off, and they may prove elusive. “The water-infrastructure industry is quite conservative,” Fuglesang says, noting that because new projects are so expensive, “nobody wants to be first” to go all-in on a new technology.

Hilal says he believes subsea desalination could go mainstream and supply water to entire cities. But, he adds, “reaching true city-scale will take time, conceivably a decade or more.”

Humans are one step closer to traveling at faster-than-light speeds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In a surprising paper, scientists say they've nailed down a physical model for a warp drive, which flies in the face of what we've long thought about the crazy concept of warp speed travel: that it requires exotic, negative forces.

To best understand what the breakthrough means, you'll need a quick crash course on the far-out idea of traveling through folded space. 

The colloquial term “warp drive” comes from science fiction, most famously Star Trek. The faster-​than-light warp drive of the Federation works by colliding matter and antimatter and converting the explosive energy to propulsion. Star Trek suggests that this extraordinary power alone pushes the ship at faster-than-light speeds. 

Scientists have been studying and theorizing about faster-than-light space travel for decades. One major reason for our interest is pure pragmatism: without warp drive, we're probably never making it to a neighboring star system. The closest such trip is still four years long at light speed.

Our current understanding of warp speed dates back to 1994, when a now-iconic theoretical physicist named Miguel Alcubierre first proposed what we've called the Alcubierre drive ever since.

The Alcubierre drive conforms to Einstein's theory of general relativity to achieve superluminal travel. “By a purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it,” Alcubierre wrote in his paper's abstract, “motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible.”

Essentially, an Alcubierre drive would expend a tremendous amount of energy—likely more than what's available within the universe—to contract and twist space-time in front of it and create a bubble. Inside that bubble would be an inertial reference frame where explorers would feel no proper acceleration. The rules of physics would still apply within the bubble, but the ship would be localized outside of space.

It might help to think of an Alcubierre drive like the classic “tablecloth and dishes” party trick: The spaceship sits atop the tablecloth of spacetime, the drive pulls the fabric around it, and the ship is situated in a new place relative to the fabric. 

Alcubierre describes spacetime expanding on one side of the ship and contracting on the other, thanks to that enormous amount of energy and a requisite amount of exotic matter—in this case, negative energy. 

Some scientists have criticized the Alcubierre drive, however, because it requires too much mass and negative energy for humans to ever seriously construct a warp-based propulsion system. NASA has been trying to build a physical warp drive through Eagleworks Laboratories for most of the last decade, but hasn't yet made any significant strides.

This brings us to the new study, which scientists in the Advanced Propulsion Laboratory (APL) at Applied Physics just published in the peer-reviewed journal Classical and Quantum Gravity. In the report, the APL team unveils the world's first model for a physical warp drive—one that doesn't require negative energy.

The study is understandably pretty thick (read the whole thing here), but here's the gist of the model: Where the existing paradigm uses negative energy—exotic matter that doesn't exist and can't be generated within our current understanding of the universe—this new concept uses floating bubbles of spacetime rather than floating ships in spacetime.

The physical model uses almost none of the negative energy and capitalizes on the idea that spacetime bubbles can behave almost however they like. And, the APL scientists say, this isn't even the only other way warp speed could work. Making a model that's at least physically comprehensible is a big step. 

Plus, Alcubierre himself has endorsed the new model, which is like having Albert Einstein show up to your introductory physics class. 

Here's a helpful video in which Sabine Hossenfelder, a Professor and Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, breaks down the findings:

Of course, there's one gigantic caveat here: The concept in this paper is still in the “far future” zone of possibility, made of ideas that scientists still don't know how to construct in any sense. 

“While the mass requirements needed for such modifications are still enormous at present,” the APL scientists write, “our work suggests a method of constructing such objects based on fully understood laws of physics.”

But while a physical drive may not be a reality today, tomorrow, or even a century from now—let's hope it's not that long—with this exciting new model, warp speed travel is now a lot more likely in a much shorter timespan than we previously thought.

Pessimistic Dogs Are Better at Smelling Cancer—And Other Keys to Disease-Sniffing Success

New research is revealing how disease-smelling dogs can excel

By Rohini Subrahmanyam edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Individual dogs' personalities, and how we interpret their behaviors, may be key to disease sniffing at scale.

Billy, a floppy-eared little beagle, darts around a platform sniffing a series of holes. Each hole contains a used surgical-type mask bearing a different human's distinct mix of scents. But her sharp nose is hunting for just one such combination: the one that signals cancer.

Cancer can change a person's “volatilome,” the unique set of volatile organic compounds found in breath, sweat, blood and urine. Billy and her cohort have learned to sniff out these subtle scent cues in masks worn by people with cancer diagnoses. Researchers are also studying how dogs can detect diseases such as COVID and malaria, as well as psychological conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder.

Scientists discovered dogs' powerful disease-smelling skills in 1989, when a dog detected cancer in its handler. But clinicians still do not routinely use dogs for diagnosis. Besides the obvious logistical challenges, dogs vary greatly in their olfactory accuracy. Researchers are increasingly finding that disease-sniffing prowess may come down to individual dogs' personality—and how well their handlers know them. New research efforts are focused on figuring out which dogs would be best for the job and on interpreting dogs' behaviors during a smell test.

Sharyn Bistre Dabbah, a veterinary scientist now at the University of Bristol in England, set out with colleagues at the U.K. charity Medical Detection Dogs to learn how the animals' personalities—especially their level of optimism or pessimism—affect disease-detection skills. Their results appeared recently in PLoS One.

The researchers first showed the dogs what lay behind two screens at one end of a room: a “positive” location with a tasty treat and a “negative” one with an empty bowl. On subsequent visits to the room, the dogs typically bounded happily toward the former but trotted very slowly when they went to check out the latter—or simply didn't go there at all.

The scientists then placed bowls behind two new screens between the positive and negative spots, and they classified the dogs as “optimistic” or “pessimistic” based on how quickly they investigated these new locations.

Next, the team evaluated how accurately each dog could pick out a disease scent it was trained to detect among other smells. On average, the pessimistic dogs turned out to be more discerning. Pessimistic dogs are more cautious, and “a more cautious dog might be better at not making mistakes,” Dabbah says.

Other personality traits also play a role, says Clara Wilson, who researches disease- and stress-sniffing dogs at the University of Pennsylvania. Dogs that enjoy the thrill of a hunt—and thrive while searching for missing people or hidden bombs—might find sniffing through disease samples again and again rather repetitive. “We want a dog that doesn't get frustrated. They [should] find it rewarding, even though it may be less exciting,” Wilson explains.

Handlers' interpretations of dog behavior can also skew detection outcomes, says Akash Kulgod, co-founder of Dognosis, the Bengaluru-based start-up that trained Billy. Instead of teaching dogs to perform a specific behavior such as sitting or barking when they pick up an assigned scent—a process that takes extra time and can lead to dogs “lying” for treats—Kulgod and his team directly analyze each dog's natural body language. Based on how confidently the dogs move, as analyzed with computer vision–based machine-learning tools, the team can spot successful detections. “One of our dogs sniffs and then very confidently somersaults to go to the feeder,” Kulgod says. “They each have their own unique quirks—but all of it can be quantified because it's all related to this reward expectation that you have from the past sessions.”

In a pilot study with 200 test samples involving 10 cancer types, presented at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology conference, Dognosis dogs detected 96 percent of cancers. Next, the Dognosis team will scale up its study with 1,500 test samples.

Doctors currently diagnose many kinds of cancers by using a combination of blood tests and biopsies. Researchers are always on the lookout for less invasive methods—including options directly involving our canine companions, as well as electronic noses inspired by them. Dogs can currently outperform electronic sniffers. But this primacy may not last, according to Andreas Mershin, chief science officer at the Boston-based start-up RealNose.ai. He and his colleagues are developing electronic noses to sniff urine samples for prostate cancer and other diseases. If machine olfaction eventually surpasses dogs' abilities, it could help tackle the scalability problem—and give the animals a break.

Mershin's team put mammalian smell receptors on an electronic chip and used machine-learning algorithms to interpret the output. The technique focuses on broader patterns among detected molecules rather than categorizing them individually.

Dogs don't tick off a list of molecules in their heads, either; they just “know” what cancer smells like. This helps them to sense it accurately no matter which organ it is from or what the patient ate before giving their breath sample. “The dogs can generalize. They don't care about the font in which you write the scent; they just interpret it correctly,” Mershin says.

In a study published in PLoS One, Mershin and his team used machine-learning models to spot and analyze patterns of different odorants in urine samples from confirmed prostate cancer patients. Their findings, which built on work with diagnosis data from Medical Detection Dogs, suggest that focusing on this type of “scent character” might work as a scalable alternative to dogs, even if it's currently much slower.

Meanwhile, back on the test platform, floppy-eared Billy quickly detects the subtle scent of cancer in one of the masks she has been sniffing—and confidently bounds back to get her reward. Such tests show strong potential, says postdoctoral researcher Amritha Mallikarjun of the University of Pennsylvania: “The dogs, because of their amazing sense of smell and detection capabilities, are demonstrating to us what technology could look like 10 to 15 years from now.”

Many brain disorders involve mitochondrial alterations, but owing to the lack of suitable tools, the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in pathophysiological processes is difficult to establish. Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are key regulators of cell functions, and they can be found within mitochondria. Therefore, we reasoned that the activation of stimulatory mitochondrial G proteins (Gs) could rapidly promote the activity of the organelle and possibly compensate for bioenergetic dysfunction. Here, we show that a mitochondria-targeted recombinant designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (mitoDREADD-Gs) can acutely trigger intramitochondrial signaling to increase mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption. In vivo activation of mitoDREADD-Gs abolished memory alterations in cannabinoid-treated mice and in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Thus, mitoDREADD-Gs enables the establishment of causal relationships between mitochondria and biological or disease-related processes and represents an innovative potential therapeutic approach for disorders associated with mitochondrial impairment.

Over 95% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) harbor oncogenic mutations in KRAS. However, upon treatment with KRAS inhibitors, PDAC cells undergo rapid metabolic reprogramming toward an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent, drug-resistant state. Here, we demonstrate that this metabolic shift is associated with upregulation of the transcription factor ZBTB11 and both the metabolic state and resistance to KRAS inhibitors can be attenuated by ZBTB11 depletion. We develop molecular glue degraders of ZBTB11 and demonstrate that they reprogram the aberrant transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and bioenergetics of KRAS inhibitor-resistant PDAC, resensitizing them to KRAS inhibition. ZBTB11 degradation leverages cell-type-specific and cell-state-specific differences in gene-regulatory mechanisms controlling OXPHOS pathway transcripts to selectively target the KRAS inhibitor-resistant state in PDAC while sparing neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Together, this work establishes ZBTB11 as a druggable vulnerability in KRAS inhibitor-resistant PDAC and provides a suite of molecular glue degrader tool compounds to investigate its function.

Achieving the Global Biodiversity Framework will necessitate whole production systems contributing towards ‘halting and reversing' net biodiversity loss, counterbalancing negative impacts with comparable gains. Here, we report on an illustrative quantitative exploration into the feasibility of monitoring for positive net biodiversity outcomes for the Dutch dairy production sector, using a composite metric. We analysed performance data from 8,950 dairy farms across the Netherlands, combining these data into an integrated biodiversity index. Usefully, this index allowed us to calculate sectoral baseline biodiversity impacts, and explore possible biodiversity strategies. We show that the largest overall source of impacts is imported feed; interestingly, nutrient loads contribute little to the footprint, despite representing an important political issue nationally. This highlights a general risk in using single indices to track net biodiversity outcomes: that they could result in an exclusionary focus, and perverse outcomes. Consequently, we develop safeguards to accompany the index; showing the necessity of incorporating safeguards, but also that meeting them could reduce sectoral biodiversity impacts by ~94%. Our proposed strategies vary in feasibility, all requiring trade-offs between biodiversity, land availability, and production.

In late 2022, the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the Global Biodiversity Framework, aiming to “halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a path to recovery”1. Achieving this mission requires addressing biodiversity impacts not only from direct economic activities but also those embedded in global supply chains. Agriculture, as a leading driver of biodiversity loss, presents both challenges and opportunities in this context2,3. The path to global nature recovery will involve combining reactive mitigation for negative impacts on biodiversity with proactive biodiversity conservation and restoration initiatives4. Key principles will include that biodiversity impacts caused by economic development are quantified, reduced where possible, otherwise compensated for through biodiversity offsets, and accompanied by additional proactive conservation initiatives; leading to net positive biodiversity impacts overall. Here, we explore ‘net outcome' approaches on biodiversity at the scale of a national agricultural production system (the Dutch dairy sector, using data collected via the established Dutch ‘Biodiversity Monitor'), as one necessary step in quantifying pathways towards global biodiversity goals.

The idea of ‘net outcome' type mechanisms for biodiversity (i.e. those that seek to quantify biodiversity losses and sum them against comparably quantified gains, to calculate a net outcome for biodiversity) is not new, and currently forms the basis of established or emerging policy in over 100 countries worldwide, a growing conservation portfolio, as well as underpinning environmental markets worth billions of dollars a year5. Many of the theoretical challenges associated with achieving neutral or even positive net outcomes have been explored in the scientific literature—with the most acute current barriers more related to practical considerations, e.g. monitoring, implementation, and demonstration in practice (e.g. refs. 6,7).

Crucially, in implementing the Global Biodiversity Framework, it will be insufficient to consider only the direct biodiversity impacts of economic activities, but also necessary to consider their indirect impacts on biodiversity that are embedded in the supply chain. This thinking partly underpins the emerging concept of ‘nature positive'3,8—a specific type of positive net outcome approach—current definitions for which are explored in ref. 8, but which under the definition we assume (see below and www.naturepositive.org) is directly aligned with the CBD post-2020 mission. The evaluation of biodiversity impacts for specific organisations—both direct and indirect—as a basis for developing positive net outcome-type strategies (again, of which ‘nature positive' is one example), has started to receive attention in the recent scientific literature9. This includes efforts to understand the organisational impacts of food consumption10. Nonetheless, of all of the key sectors in the global economy, agriculture is one that has seen relatively little attention in terms of net outcomes approaches. Agriculture will be an extremely influential sector in developing net outcome pathways: fundamental to society, but a leading global cause of biodiversity loss (e.g. refs. 11,12,13), and one that will play a key role in whether international agreements on climate change can be achieved14. Equally, agriculture could play an important role in biodiversity recovery—not only through reduction of impacts, but through restorative practices15. Further, agriculture as a sector represents a clear illustrative example of the challenges in trading off any efforts to stay within physical planetary boundaries with efforts to ensure society can meet core social objectives on wellbeing16.

Here, we use an illustrative case study of dairy production in the Netherlands. Dairy farming could feasibly help support represent a ‘land sharing' approach to nature conservation: cows grazing at low densities in herb-rich grasslands, interspersed with certain well-connected landscape elements, could provide habitat for a substantial diversity of wild species. However, such landscapes have diminished globally because of a focus on dairy production efficiency, with dairy farmers primarily paid for milk sold in a competitive global market where their contribution to biodiversity receives little reward. The Dutch Sustainable Dairy Chain (DuurzameZuivelKeten, or DZK)—a collaboration between key public and private dairy organisations in the Netherlands—has recently shown interest in calculating net biodiversity outcomes associated with national dairy production; and understanding to what degree the sector could support nature positive goals.

In defining nature positive, the Nature Positive Initiative states “Companies and financial institutions can contribute to the Nature Positive goal by taking these high-level actions: Assess their material impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities; shift their business strategy and models; commit to science-based targets for nature; report their nature-related issues to investors and other stakeholders; transform by avoiding and reducing negative impacts, restoring, and regenerating nature; collaborate across land, seascapes and river basins; and advocate to governments for policy ambition”. A key point here is the concept of contributing towards an overarching absolute nature positive objective (say, on the scale of the Netherlands); which DZK could begin to do by first assessing impacts, and then developing a positive net outcome strategy within the production sector itself (see refs. 8,10,17,18). Note also that a nature positive pathway is considered by the NPI to be one in which connected global challenges beyond biodiversity (climate change, water use, other forms of environmental pollution—alongside other sustainability issues, such as human wellbeing) are solved in tandem; but here, we focus on biodiversity. Similarly to multiple other organisations, DZK has sought in the first instance to track net biodiversity outcomes against a strategy using one main focal biodiversity metric, acting as a proxy.

Our analyses are underpinned by data collected using the Dutch Biodiversity Monitor. The Biodiversity Monitor for Dairy Farming, developed by FrieslandCampina, Rabobank and WWF (World-Wide Fund for Nature) Netherlands, aims to enable Dutch dairy farms to improve biodiversity outcomes whilst ensuring sustainable revenue. It uses seven key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the environmental impacts of individual dairy farms (both positive and negative). The Biodiversity Monitor consequently provides the basis of one potential system for calculating losses and gains of biodiversity towards a net positive impact; by combining KPI data treated as environmental pressures, characterising those pressures into biodiversity impacts in terms of the potentially disappeared fraction (PDF) of species, and aggregating these into a single measure of PDF.year (Fig. 1; see the “Methods” section); i.e. the fraction of global species richness that could be lost if the relevant pressure persisted.

A flow diagram showing the calculation of the specific biodiversity indicator we use here to track net biodiversity outcomes. Process incorporates biodiversity monitor key performance indicator data into a single aggregated index, measured in ‘PDF.year'. PDF potentially disappeared fraction.

Here—having developed an integrated biodiversity index to act as a metric for monitoring progress towards a nature positive goal, we: (a) calculate overall sectoral impacts for a baseline year; (b) define a set of biodiversity ‘safeguards', i.e. sub-targets to be achieved to ensure that a net positive outcome measured using the integrated index would not lead to perverse outcomes (e.g., by exceeding physical limits linked to one or more planetary boundaries); and (c) discuss broad strategies that could take the sector from baseline impacts towards positive net outcomes for biodiversity.

The baseline biodiversity impacts calculated for Dutch dairy production were the annual impacts for the year 2020, measured in terms of PDF.year (where PDF is the potentially disappeared fraction of species; Fig. 2). The KPIs from which the PDF-year estimates are derived (Fig. 1) come from a screened dataset consisting of 8950 farms (see the “Methods” section), which was then factored up to represent the whole sector—a total of 14,542 farms covering 870,880 ha19. The largest source of biodiversity impacts under our analysis comes from land transformation—mostly linked to the production of ingredients used in purchased feeds (e.g., concentrates and other roughage and by-products). Ingredients derived from oil palm products were linked to ~60% of land use change impacts associated with purchased concentrate feed (noting that land transformation impacts from soy, one of the key ingredients, were assumed to be zero, due to the sector currently sourcing 100% RTRS or equivalent certified soy). The second highest source of impacts was associated with land use change on farms within the Netherlands (negative impacts from land transformation and positive impacts from land restoration). This was calculated from annual reductions and increases in ecologically valuable landscape components (“Nature & Landscape”) and areas of herb-rich grassland: for example, a farm that reduced/increased its area of Nature & Landscape elements relative to the previous year would incur an associated biodiversity loss/gain. These losses and gains were then summed across farms to obtain the sectoral values.

Annual biodiversity impacts for the year 2020, in –PDF.year, broken down per KPI. LUC land use change, NL impacts within the Netherlands. Note: Other embedded impacts (non-LUC impacts) from purchased feed include those from land occupation, marine and freshwater eutrophication, and water consumption. Embedded greenhouse gas emissions associated with feed are included under the GHG emissions KPI. NPI net positive impact.

Impacts from other KPIs are comparatively lower than those from land-related KPIs, which is consistent with land use change being the primary driver of global biodiversity loss20. However, this does not negate the importance of other KPIs (e.g., nitrogen soil surplus, ammonia emissions) which are particularly important as drivers of local to national biodiversity loss, and highly contentious issues within the Netherlands. It is commonly advised not to focus on the results for biodiversity footprints in PDF.year or similar metrics in absolute terms, but on the relative impacts across activities, which is more instructive9.

Though the practice is not uncommon, there are challenges in seeking to achieve a biodiversity net outcome measured using a single composite index. Not only are there considerable uncertainties in organisational biodiversity proxies (including those based on LCIA); there is also the potential to mask undesirable outcomes. For example, good performance against the index overall could reflect excellent performance across six KPIs, and unacceptable performance against the seventh. Consequently, we identified a set of safeguards specific to the Dutch dairy case to be implemented in conjunction with the biodiversity index; seeking to avoid perverse outcomes, and allowing biodiversity strategy to be set at the level of midpoint pressures rather than on the basis of the biodiversity index.

In the context of this project, based on literature review and stakeholder consultation (see the “Methods” section), we define a ‘safeguard' as: a standard put in place to ensure that a positive net outcome is achieved while limiting any unintended, undesirable, or perverse biodiversity outcomes (given that ‘net outcomes' approaches have at times led to the latter6).

Table 1 lists identified values for each safeguard category (see the “Methods” section), defined at the sector level (i.e., not for individual farms), and categorised into two groups that apply at different points of the mitigation hierarchy (a widely used framework for the preferred sequence of actions to take in mitigating biodiversity impacts, see e.g. ref. 3):

Safeguards (1) and (2) define the minimum impacts that should first be avoided or reduced (i.e., the ‘unacceptable' impacts on biodiversity). These are determined from ‘static' goals or standards—such as the goal to buy 100% responsibly sourced soy, or to adhere to nitrogen standards as set out in the EU Nitrates Directive.

Safeguards (3)–(5) define how unavoidable impacts should be compensated in line with best practices for biodiversity (e.g., through restoring or offsetting). These are determined by the type of impacts that have taken place (e.g., the habitat types and locations that have been affected), and when those impacts occurred.

Given the potential importance of the identified safeguards in developing a net positive strategy, we calculated the baseline values for current sector performance against each Biodiversity Monitor KPI separately (Fig. 3).

Progress against proposed safeguards for 2020, with a range of scenarios included for comparison. Best practice = top 10th percentile; worst practice = <50th percentile. herb-rich grassland (HRG) and Nature and Landscape KPIs have high levels of uncertainty having been extrapolated from fewer data points. While the change in herb-rich grassland between 2019 and 2020 matches well with the ‘Natural Grassland' figures reported by CBS for the dairy sector, our estimated total value of HRG is about three times larger than the Natural Grassland value reported by CBS for 2020.

If all biophysical safeguards listed in Table 1 were met, the annual impact would be substantially less—but still, positive net outcomes (labelled for this specific project by DZK as net positive impact or NPI) would not be achieved without additional offsetting efforts (Fig. 4).

Comparison between 2020 impacts vs. impacts if all proposed preventative safeguards were met at the sectoral level.

Our finding that a main contributor to overall sectoral biodiversity impacts is land use change in the supply chain is not necessarily unexpected (see refs. 8,10). However, the degree to which it dominates the biodiversity impact risks is; obscuring the importance of nitrogen surplus and ammonia emissions (as environmental, social, and political concerns) in the Netherlands. Thus, if any strategy was optimised using this index without safeguards as we proposed, it would run the risk of ignoring the importance of nutrient balances as a key issue in the Netherlands specifically. Biodiversity impacts can be considered at global, national, or local scales, and be assigned markedly different values across these scales—necessitating the inclusion of safeguards partly derived from local perspectives when performing calculations based on headline indicators and global trade flows. The safeguards employed here are specific to the Dutch case study, but the safeguard categories (Table 1) are not; the same categories could be used to structure safeguards for other agricultural production systems or even other sectors entirely. In essence, these categories draw from decades of work into biodiversity impacts mitigation hierarchies, extended to organisational or sectoral scales (see refs. 2,3,4,9).

Safeguards are likely especially important when one considers the degree of variability in results that can be obtained under the application of slightly different LCIA methods to calculate biodiversity footprints21; as without safeguards, any net biodiversity strategy developed based on that footprint would be highly sensitive to the specific LCIA route chosen. But targets for biodiversity could be set around the mid-point environmental pressures used in the LCIA process—in this case, the KPIs reported under the Biodiversity Monitor, which form part of the set of safeguards—as they are more precisely calculated and understood. In the meantime, the calculated endpoint biodiversity outcomes remain a useful tool for headline tracking of progress towards the desired net outcomes. Such an approach would be entirely consistent with current thinking on biodiversity impact calculation and disclosure, as recommended by, e.g. the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures22 or equally by policies such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive; which themselves are explicitly aligned with guidance on biodiversity target setting as per the Science Based Targets Network. Interestingly, meeting the safeguards alone in this case would potentially take dairy production in the Netherlands a long way towards fully mitigating biodiversity impacts (Fig. 4). It would also be a mechanism for ensuring alignment with other relevant existing policies and standards, at EU level and beyond (see detail in Table 1).

Importantly, beyond the likelihood that the use of safeguards would help avoid perverse outcomes for biodiversity, there will be other red lines from the perspective of the Dutch dairy sector associated with ‘mission critical' (and consequently unavoidable) impacts on biodiversity (see ref. 9). In particular, since there is a requirement for milk production to continue, there will remain some inevitable negative impacts on biodiversity, which will require ecological compensation (such as biodiversity restoration offsets). The overall amount of dairy produced by the sector every year is a fundamental consideration, and whether dairy production is to increase, remain stable, or decrease year on year. The types of scenarios displayed in Fig. 4 should be interpreted in that context. For instance, if we apply linear regression to farm-level data, we find that: kg milk produced per hectare trends downwards with increasing % protein produced on farms' own land (coefficient = −0.6), and trends upwards with increasing purchased concentrates per ha (coefficient = 0.9). It is important not to over-interpret these relationships, as they do not imply causation, and a full statistical treatment of the data would require far more nuanced analyses which is beyond scope here. However, such relationships would align with the reasonable contention that reducing biodiversity impacts via limiting feed imported from overseas will either require intensification of feed production within the Netherlands to maintain production or an overall reduction in milk production. So if the goal was to maintain dairy production while reducing the amount of feed purchased from overseas, there would be a requirement to give more land over to protein production within the Netherlands, implying less space to implement restoration of herb-rich grasslands and/or Nature and Landscape components to support domestic biodiversity gain. More extensive farms tend to be slightly larger on average, which may imply (given the positive relationship between purchased feed and production) that farm intensity rather than size plays a more substantial role in maintaining higher levels of production. In the case where the distribution of impacts by farm shifted to substantially lower impacts—such that farms in the current 90th percentile for impacts met current 50th percentile standards on those KPIs—we estimate that the result would be a 48% reduction in net impacts (in PDF.year) relative to 2020 values (Fig. 5). That might be considered more of an ‘even contribution' approach towards net positive biodiversity outcomes, in which lower-performing farms were required to meet current ‘average' performance. However, extrapolating based on correlations between KPI scores and production, this would also result in a ~26% reduction in milk production (assuming the same efficiency in processes and number of farms). Such nuances as those discussed in this paragraph, and the trade-offs associated with them, demonstrate the need to couch discussions around biodiversity metrics and relevant safeguards within a broader framework for sustainable development, which requires more detailed investigation than we have the space to perform here. Considerations, though, would certainly include those around the socio-economic implications of any given strategy for farmers nationally, as well as the implications internationally; particularly, for instance, in those regions that currently produce feed that is then exported to the Netherlands.

Comparison between 2020 impacts vs. impacts if farms below current 50th percentile standards on the index improved performance to current 50th percentile levels, based on the integrated index scores.

Considering all components of the analyses reported here, what possible pathways exist for the Dutch dairy sector to contribute towards nature positive i.e. the Global Biodiversity Framework post-2020 mission? We lay out three broad hypothetical pathways, with different implications for the sector, and therefore varying feasibility (although, arguably, with each option sequentially showing increasing alignment with global targets under the Global Biodiversity Framework). These are:

‘Adaptive compensation' approach: In the case in which the mid-point KPI safeguards are seen as aspirational rather than strict ‘red-line' limits, a scenario could involve making incremental progress year on year towards meeting all safeguards at the sector level—with all remaining annual impacts (initially close to baseline 2020 levels; Fig. 2) offset through restoration measures in the Netherlands and overseas. The offset activity required would be large but could be determined year on year via the methods here. Offsets would ideally commence in the same year as the impacts for which they compensate, with any delays leading to the use of multipliers (see ref. 23). Under this category of approach, it would be recommended to evaluate progress at milestones towards 2030 and on to 2050, to determine (a) the degree of feasibility of meeting all KPI safeguards, and (b) the practicality and cost of eventually implementing sufficient biodiversity offsets to compensate residual impacts.

The approach is a ‘compensation' (i.e. offsetting) focused approach (see ref. 9), with small initial efforts at impact prevention that increase steadily over time. It is a more feasible option in terms of the challenges of maintaining dairy production and of meeting safeguards. But this option could be costly in terms of financing biodiversity offsets requirements, where in any case offsetting should be a less preferred option on the spectrum of the mitigation hierarchy.

‘Even contribution' approach: In this case, the initial focus would be on working with all farms in the lower-ranked 50% (index performance), seeking improvements that bring them up to the equivalent index score as the current 50th percentile (Fig. 5). Since these calculations are based on the integrated index score, and not on separate KPIs, they inherently incorporate some of the key interactions between KPIs. The result would be extensive prevention of biodiversity impacts for those farms, whilst those in the upper ranked 50% (again, by index score) would either continue business as usual or voluntarily seek improvements. The residual impacts would be compensated through biodiversity offsets, which would likely be far less extensive than in pathway 1 above. However, this is predicated on maintaining the number and area of existing farms; and the result of that (alongside achieving a drop in biodiversity impacts) would be a commensurate drop in dairy production. Our analyses—in the absence of any improved efficiencies in dairy production (which might allow greater production levels)—indicate a possible drop in dairy production of ~26%. The approach combines biodiversity impact prevention and compensation. However, it makes abundantly clear that there are inevitable trade-offs between biodiversity restoration, land availability for the dairy sector, and dairy production.

‘Deep net positive' approach: This approach can be considered a maximum impact prevention approach. In one version of this case, all safeguards would be met at the sector-level (broadly assuming trade-offs at farm-level can be at least partly avoided), reducing impacts substantially (by ~94% according to our calculations; Fig. 4) and requiring minimal offsetting. In itself, this latter finding—that meeting basic biophysical and social safeguards (as outlined in Table 1) could proportionally deliver much of the progress needed towards neutralising biodiversity impacts—is worth underlining, and again emphasizes the usefulness of designing strategies based on multiple midpoint pressures and incorporating safeguards. Aside from the necessary changes in dairy production volumes, the deep net positive approach is appealing as it is likely not the case that a ‘one size fits all' approach can or should be taken to applying the KPIs safeguards to farms. What this type of scenario does usefully do is illustrate the extent of the change needed if the sector were to take a primarily ‘avoidance focused' approach towards meeting the net positive biodiversity target.

While considering pathways towards net positive outcomes, it is important to consider the issue of uncertainty in calculating impacts in the first place. The uncertainties involved in estimating biodiversity impacts using LCIA approaches—though considered the best available current practice—are numerous, and well documented24. Analyses specifically pertaining to the biodiversity impacts of dairy organisations based in the Netherlands have shown that even the relative impacts of different organisational activities can vary depending on the precise methodology employed21. This means in turn that nature strategies building on biodiversity footprints must be designed to account for uncertainty in the underlying approaches. It is not possible to make quantitative estimates of the uncertainty bounds involved, which remains a key research question for nature-positive efforts more generally7,24; rather, net positive strategies will likely have to be designed flexibly and with adaptive management practices built in.

Further, the safeguards outlined here were constructed around a combination of policy and literature review alongside non-systematic regional expert stakeholder consultation (see the “Methods” section). In principle, this provided a defensible basis for developing safeguards for our purposes. However, we note that the full application of a safeguards approach in practice would require a more detailed and nuanced stakeholder analysis, that is more widely built upon local knowledge, and systematically includes representatives of key stakeholder groups (see e.g. ref. 10).

The implementation of the Biodiversity Monitor has enabled us to perform a quantitative estimate of the Dutch dairy sector's biodiversity impacts; here, we have done so based on established methodologies for Life Cycle Impact Assessment. This study shows one path for developing an integrated biodiversity index for a sector, and strategically developing key areas for targeting biodiversity impact reduction (e.g. land use change linked to purchased feed). However, our key conclusion here is that the strategy must also be guided by efforts to meet a suite of safeguards—both biophysical and social—which we identified in this case through literature review and stakeholder consultation. Otherwise, the use of the single index to guide strategy might result in certain important impacts sources being overlooked (for example, if certain impacts were estimated to be less substantial using the index methodology in question than they were under another methodology21), or some other perverse outcome (e.g. there is considerable scope for perverse outcomes when implementing compensatory measures like biodiversity offsets19,23,25). Furthermore, given the limitations inherent in any biodiversity metrics, we suggest that actual nature strategies tracked using LCIA-type metrics might be usefully structured around the midpoint environmental pressures exerted on nature. This is even more important when considering that biodiversity is only one aspect of nature recovery, and of sustainable development more broadly. Consequently, any biodiversity metric used to track progress will necessarily sit within a much wider monitoring framework featuring multiple dimensions of sustainability; GHG emissions, water consumption, and beyond.

The use of strategic safeguards linked to midpoint pressures, alongside an overarching index for tracking biodiversity outcomes, ends up providing a clear path forward for any biodiversity strategy. Meeting the safeguards alone would clearly take the sector a long way toward neutral net biodiversity outcomes. These conclusions are derived in relation to our case study but are likely generalisable to many other systems, in agricultural sectors and beyond: most sectors will have to construct indices for monitoring trends in net biodiversity outcomes if they are to track progress towards the Global Biodiversity Framework. Indeed, there are many regions with higher intact biodiversity than the Netherlands, for which balancing conservation and agricultural production is perhaps even more urgent. All countries have targets for biodiversity conservation alongside agricultural production under the Framework (e.g. Target 10 on enhancing sustainability in agriculture, Target 16 on enabling sustainable consumption), which approaches such as that taken here could support. For the reasons given here, organisations, sectors, and even nation-states should consider developing biodiversity strategies through mid-point pressures, and systematically develop safeguards alongside the key biodiversity metrics employed.

Our focal biodiversity metric is based on LCIA approaches, as is current good practice for comprehensive biodiversity footprinting (see e.g. ref. 7). The metric was based upon the KPIs monitored via the Biodiversity Monitor (see ‘Introduction'). Not only do these KPIs represent key pathways by which environmental pressures could impact biodiversity (e.g. GHG emissions, eutrophication); but they have also been agreed as relevant for DZK through a lengthy process of stakeholder engagement, and crucially, reflect data that are collected and therefore available to track long-term progress towards net biodiversity outcomes. To create a biodiversity index that integrated the KPI data (steps visualised in Fig. 1), conceptually, we:

Gathered available KPI data (measures of environmental pressure) for the seven KPIs described in the Biodiversity Monitor, for all dairy farms in the Netherlands. Note that there are at least three additional possible KPIs not currently included in the Biodiversity Monitor which the authorship team felt could be relevant for incorporation into future iterations of the Biodiversity Monitor, but for which data are not currently available. These are pesticide use, water consumption, and phosphorus soil surplus;

Treating each KPI as a ‘mid-point' environmental pressure10, converted each KPI value into an estimate of biodiversity impacts using characterisation factors from the LC-Impact methodology. This was done at the level of KPIs for each individual farm—fully anonymised—to then be aggregated into a biodiversity impact per farm. Again, this is measured using the unit ‘Potentially Disappeared Fraction' of species over time (PDF.year), which should be interpreted as an indicator for proportional contribution to global species extinction risk25. Here, PDF.year is used as a proxy indicator for combining and comparing biodiversity impacts across a range of mid-point pressures/KPIs; and,

Summed PDF.year values across all farms to provide an estimate of biodiversity impacts over a given year for dairy production in the Netherlands.

We include the seven KPIs described in the Biodiversity Monitor: GHG emissions, nitrogen soil surplus, ammonia emissions, area of permanent pasture, area of herb-rich grassland, area of managed land (labelled ‘Nature & Landscape'), and ‘protein produced on own land/in farmer's own region' (Table 2). The raw data underpinning the KPIs was used e.g. the actual area of different land use types, CO2(e) value for GHG emissions, etc. (Fig. 1). ‘Protein produced on own land/in farmer's own region' is an indicator of the level of self-sufficiency (e.g., feed produced on own land), but is consequently indicative of the environmental footprint in other parts of the world (e.g., to grow ingredients like soy, used in concentrate feeds). To calculate the environmental impacts associated with purchased feed, we make use of the FeedPrint NL database developed by Wageningen University & Research, Blonk Consultants, and GFLI. KPIs were assumed to qualitatively correlate either positively or negatively with biodiversity impacts (e.g. the greater the emissions of GHGs, the more negative the impacts on biodiversity = negative correlation; Table 2).

We note the following assumptions:

though the KPIs for ‘Nature & Landscape' and ‘herb-rich grassland' represent a range of different land management regimes (e.g., meadow bird management, landscape management, soil management, etc.), we treat them uniformly;

the biodiversity index is calculated by farm and then aggregated. We assume that biodiversity gains across all farms have equal weight, and do not, for example, consider any strategic spatial placement of biodiversity gains as part of core areas or corridors;

characterisation factors in LC-Impact24 are based on models that predict biodiversity losses per functional unit in terms of global species extinctions. To estimate biodiversity gains associated with certain activities e.g., Nature & Landscape management, we assume it is meaningful to apply these factors in reverse. This is a necessary assumption since, as far as we are aware, there are no comparable methods that model biodiversity gains from such a broad range of activities. Not only does this introduce some further uncertainty, but also we acknowledge that there is a temporal aspect here (in that reversing losses of biodiversity would likely take longer than causing it).

Data were available at farm-level for 14,686 farms in total, with values spanning the time period 2018–2020. Since 2020 was the only year for which comparable data were available across all of the KPIs collected under the Biodiversity Monitor, it was chosen as the baseline year. Data on the herb-rich grassland and Nature & Landscape KPIs were provided by Royal FrieslandCampina (RFC), with data on the remaining KPIs and contextual data provided from the KringloopWijzer (KLW) database. To convert KPI values into a biodiversity index value for the sector as a whole, we converted KPIs provided as relative values (e.g., kg CO2e per kg milk, or kg NH3 per ha) into total/absolute values per farm, by multiplying by either the total farm area or total milk production per farm. Datasets were matched based on unique farm identifiers, but all farms were anonymised.

Farms were excluded from the analysis if they did not report comprehensive data under the Biodiversity Monitor across KPIs, for land area, or on production. Similarly, farms were excluded if there were discrepancies between the total area reported for the farm, and for the different summed habitat components (e.g. for different grassland types across the KPIs). We note that there is a possibility that exclusion could lead to analytical biases in terms of the types of farms that had data gaps/mistakes, though this is not something we can assume. Since the relevant farms were those that by definition we could not calculate biodiversity impacts for, due to data gaps/mistakes, this is not something we analysed. Instead, we note this as a potential issue and an avenue for further research. After screening, the final dataset consisted of 8950 individual farms (62% of all dairy farms in the Netherlands, based on a total number of dairy farms recorded by CBS in 2020 of 14,54219).

For each farm, the total area of combined temporary grassland and cropland combined was estimated by subtracting the area of permanent grassland from the total area of the farm. Yard area was assumed to be minor, and so not considered in this analysis. Areas of grassland/cropland were then adjusted to account for areas provided for Nature & Landscape. These Nature & Landscape management areas provided in the RFC dataset were separated into four categories, based on the type of land the measure would be applied to (e.g., grassland, cropland, or landscape element—as per the Cumulatie and Grondgebruik table provided by Boerennatuur) and also based on the biodiversity weighting per management package, (provided in the Beheerpakketten Biodiversiteitsmonitor (BBM) documentation and associated appendices26,27). These categories are shown in Table 3. The distinction between these four categories was necessary for biodiversity index calculations, separating areas of low-intensity farming (which it is assumed would have a relatively low biodiversity impact compared to more intensive areas) from farmland habitats capable of generating absolute biodiversity gains. It was necessary to exclude some management packages from calculations in order to avoid double counting by area: specifically, BBM107 and BB107 (‘Bodemverbetering grasland met ruige mest', ‘Bodemverbetering bouwland met ruige mest', ‘Bodemverbetering met ruige mest', ‘Chemie en kunstmestvrij land') as they are applied in combination with other management packages.

Since it was not always possible to determine from the dataset which land use types were overlapping (e.g., whether HRG was included under temporary or permanent grassland). The following assumptions were therefore made:

Area of HRG was subtracted from the total area of permanent grassland; and

Areas of low-impact grassland/arable land and Nature & Landscape areas were subtracted from the assumed arable/temporary grassland area. If these values exceeded the arable/temporary grassland area, the remainder was subtracted from permanent grassland areas.

While this involves making several assumptions, it was considered necessary and reasonable as a means to account for potential double counting of areas.

For the 2020 analysis, areas of land transformation/restoration were calculated using the change in area of herb-rich grassland or Nature & Landscape management per farm relative to the previous year (2019). This calculation was only made when data were available for both years, which was the case for 1237 farms for herb-rich grassland (14% of the dataset, 9% of all farms in the Netherlands), and 3753 farms for Nature & Landscape areas (42% of the dataset, 26% of all farms in the Netherlands).

To estimate biodiversity impacts associated with purchased feed, we converted data provided on quantities of feeds into an estimated level of environmental pressure using the life cycle analysis (LCA) database FeedPrint (written consent was provided by the owners for this project). FeedPrint is also referred to in the calculation guidance for the KLW, particularly when calculating GHG emissions associated with feed, so we use FeedPrint as a consistent source for estimating all environmental pressures. FeedPrint provides ingredient- and country-level breakdown for a broad range of dairy feeds, and calculates the associated environmental pressures using the PEFCR-Feed methodology. We exported environmental data for feed components per country, with default parameters selected.

Data were provided for feed produced on the farms, and feed purchased by the farms. Feeds included concentrates, other roughage & by-products, maize, grass silage, and milk powder. It was assumed that the impacts of all feeds ‘produced' by the farm were already accounted for by the other environmental KPIs (areas of grassland, total area of farm, N/NH3/CO2e emissions associated with growing fodder, etc.), so ‘produced' feeds were excluded. Next, we assumed that ‘purchased' grass and maize silage were produced on other farms within the Dutch dairy sector, and so were also excluded to avoid double counting.

Purchased concentrates and other roughage and by-products, however, were assumed to require additional analysis (i.e., produced by other sectors within the Netherlands, and/or by other countries). The analysis of purchased feeds therefore focuses on these two types of composite feeds.

To estimate the component ingredients in concentrates we used ‘concentrate dairy standard' as a reference product, taking the ingredient and country-level breakdown directly from the FeedPrint database. ‘Other roughage & by-products' is however a much broader category of feed ingredients; to determine constituent ingredients in this category, we referred to data published by Blonk Consultants28, which provided an in-depth life cycle inventory for Dutch semi-skimmed milk and semi-mature cheese. We referred specifically to Tables 3–10 of this report (using the most recent dry matter estimates provided within FeedPrint). The country-level breakdown for each of the composite ingredients was then sourced from FeedPrint, and can be viewed directly within the FeedPrint database software. Environmental values per kilogram of ingredient per country were exported for land occupation, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and water consumption. Carbon values from FeedPrint were not used in order to avoid double counting, as these were assumed to be accounted for under the GHG emissions KPI (an assumption that follows KLW guidance).

While the area of land occupation is provided directly in FeedPrint, the area of land transformation (also known as land use change; LUC) is not. However, FeedPrint does provide estimates of carbon emissions associated with LUC, calculated using the PAS2050 methodology. Therefore, to calculate the area of LUC, we reverse this calculation using the same factors (provided in Annex C of the PAS2050:2011 guidelines). These factors are in the form of tonnes CO2e per ha per year, and are provided at local level for a set of countries. For countries not included in this list, we used the continental average.

The area of LUC was calculated for all feed ingredients except for those derived from soybean products. Soy was assumed to have no impacts associated with LUC due to the dairy sector's requirement for sourcing 100% certified sustainable soy (RTRS or equivalent; see Table 1).

There are several biodiversity metrics currently available for use in impact analysis, though none are widely accepted as standard. LCIA is an approach supported by leading frameworks (e.g. ref. 22), has precedent in the literature (e.g. ref. 29), and allows us to incorporate the full scope of environmental pressures (KPIs), converting these KPI ‘mid-points' (pressures) into an estimated aggregated end-point impact on biodiversity.

LC-Impact software was chosen here because it is one of the most recently developed LCIA methodologies (developed as part of an EU FP7 project, via a collaboration between 14 partners). It incorporates spatial differentiation for environmental impacts where relevant, as well as levels of species vulnerability and endemism—both of which are lacking to some degree in other LCIA methodologies.

LC-Impact provides a set of characterisation factors (CFs), which can be used to calculate an estimate of biodiversity impact (in PDF.year) per unit of environmental pressure – for example, PDF.year per kg CO2e emitted, or PDF.year per m2 of land occupation. These CFs are based on a set of models from the scientific corpus that link the KPI to biodiversity via a particular ‘impact pathway' (e.g., climate change, eutrophication, acidification, habitat conversion, etc.). Here, we mainly used the core set of CFs, using the marginal CF in the case of terrestrial acidification impacts linked to ammonia emissions; marginal CFs calculate the biodiversity impact of an additional kilogram of ammonia (as opposed to the average effect of a kilogram of ammonia). KPIs for CO2e emissions and NH3 emissions were combined directly with the relevant CFs. For other KPIs, further adjustments were made as follows:

Nitrogen soil surplus describes the balance between supply (e.g., from fertiliser, manure, fixation, etc.) and removal (e.g., via crops or emissions to air) of nitrogen compounds on farms. We ‘capped' negative nitrogen soil surplus values at zero—assuming that net removals of nitrogen would be highly localised, and should not be accounted for when aggregating across farms—before combining values with the biodiversity CFs. We also note for completeness that the CFs for nitrogen model eutrophication are based on a commonly applied (e.g. ref. 30, assumption of nutrient limitation—that is: nitrogen is assumed to be the limiting nutrient in marine ecosystems and phosphorus is assumed to be the limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems. As such, the impact of nitrogen soil surplus is modelled in terms of eutrophication of marine systems (this takes into account a generic soil leaching fraction for the Netherlands and nutrient transport via river systems—see Verones et al.31 for more information) rather than of freshwater systems. This could lead to impacts from nitrogen soil surplus being underestimated in our metric—although there is evidence that phosphorus is a primary driver of freshwater eutrophication, including within the Netherlands (e.g. refs. 32,33,34), and that nitrogen limitation tends to be stronger in marine systems35. Furthermore, relatively low levels of phosphorus soil surplus are reported for Dutch dairy farms—which would translate into a biodiversity impact from freshwater eutrophication several orders of magnitude lower than other KPIs ( ~ 1.4 × 10−08 PDF.year, based on an average of 7 kg P2O5 recorded on the WUR Agro & Food portal). So, though we have used the best method available, we acknowledge that this is a simplified approach. There are high percentages of eutrophic freshwater bodies in the Netherlands36, which would ideally be improved by CFs that take into account site-specific nutrient limitation and synergistic effects of nitrogen and phosphorus37,38.

For land aspects, instead of applying the relevant factors provided via LC-Impact (based on a 2015 analysis), we substitute these for CFs calculated by Chaudhary and Brooks39. According to the authors of these resources, the 2018 factors are more up-to-date and reliable and can be directly substituted into LC-Impact. This also allows differences between three levels of land use intensity (minimal, light, intense) to be accounted for; definitions for each of the land use categories can be found in the supplementary material of Chaudhary and Brooks (2018). CFs for ‘light use' pasture were applied to areas of permanent grassland, whereas CFs for ‘minimal use' cropland and pasture were applied to areas of low-impact grassland/arable land. However, since ‘low-impact arable/grassland' encompasses a broad range of management approaches with varying benefits for biodiversity, we also apply BBM weightings (see https://biodiversiteitsmonitor.nl/certificatie.html).

For herb-rich grassland or areas under Nature & Landscape measures: Any decrease in area was assumed to represent a loss of habitat, so we applied the CF for the Netherlands; conversely, the increase in area represented a gain, and we applied the CF in reverse. We acknowledge that using reversed CFs to estimate ‘biodiversity gains' is not standard; however, it was necessary since, as far as we are aware, there are no comparable methods that model biodiversity gains from such a broad range of activities. As for low-impact arable/grassland (above), herb-rich grassland and different types of Nature & Landscape management have variable effects on biodiversity, which are reflected in the BBM weightings. To avoid these weightings overestimating biodiversity gains (the maximum possible proportional change in habitat restoration is 1 i.e., 100% habitat recovery), the weightings were normalised such that the maximum possible weighting was 1. Though this means that we effectively assume complete restoration for these areas, which would not happen in reality on short timescales, this is likely within the large uncertainty bounds for applying LCIA to biodiversity footprinting in any case24.

Areas undergoing LUC would also be associated with a change in GHG emissions; emissions associated with habitat loss, or sequestration through habitat restoration. We excluded GHG emissions from LUC linked to feed production, as those were already included within the values provided as part of the KLW dataset. Then, losses of habitat area were assumed to lead to an increase in GHG emissions, calculated using the values provided in Annex C of the PAS2050:2011 guidance. For any gains in habitat area (e.g., increases in herb-rich grassland or Nature and Landscape areas), GHG sequestration was estimated using the values provided by Table 3 of Schmidinger and Stehfest40, who calculate the average potential carbon sink per continental region and food product and provide factors in kg CO2/m2/year. GHG emissions and sequestration were both combined with the relevant CF in LC-Impact.

Agricultural land released from productive use could, in the absence of action by other sectors, passively restore to natural habitat over time (e.g. ref. 41). In general, however, land released from dairy production was not assumed to deliver a biodiversity gain via passive restoration as it would likely be used for other purposes (i.e. outside of the dairy sector). This is consistent with the literature on the treatment of counterfactual scenarios in net outcomes policies for biodiversity (e.g. ref. 18). However, there could be cases in which land was set aside but still retained by dairy sector actors, and in that case, any passive restoration should be included in the overall calculations. Therefore, passive restoration of released land is included in our model in the specific scenario where total milk production remains the same or increases, alongside a reduction in land use. In such cases, we apply a high temporal risk multiplier to reflect the uncertainty in restoration timescales (see below).

Biodiversity offsets are measurable conservation outcomes (e.g., restoring species and habitats) that are widely used to compensate for residual negative impacts on biodiversity. We did not include offsets in our models here, as these are not currently a component of DZK strategy. However, offsetting could be included in future versions of our models—and we note that biodiversity gains linked to biodiversity restoration offsets would likely be needed as part of achieving net positive impact overall.

Time lags are important in conservation42. Impacts such as land use change may result in immediate biodiversity losses, but ecological gains from compensatory restoration activities may take time to accrue. Time lags are undesirable—particularly if species/habitats are threatened, or when the existence of biodiversity provides some ongoing ecosystem service that is diminished during the time lag.

A common approach is to apply a multiplier to areas being restored, in order to account for uncertainties around immediate/certain losses being compensated by delayed/uncertain future gains. The multiplier can be considered a ratio between damaged and necessary compensated amounts of biodiversity. It would be applied here as a factor to biodiversity gains, to calculate gains that account for these temporal uncertainties.

Laitila et al.23 propose a method to calculate minimum temporal multipliers associated with biodiversity restoration for offsets, which we apply to the biodiversity gains shown in Fig. 4 in the main text. Their method is based on the following parameters:

Time taken to restore different habitats (in number of years); The change in habitat condition (e.g., the proportional increase in biodiversity that is achieved by the restoration activity); A discount rate, which mathematically determines the currently perceived value of biodiversity gains that are not achieved until future years (‘net present value'); and, Permanence of the positive and negative impacts.

The values we applied for each parameter, for different restoration activities, are described in Table 4. The ‘permanence of impacts' parameter was assumed to be 30 years for all habitats, being approximately equivalent to one generation (and therefore a feasible period of time for maintaining activities). Time lag values for habitat restoration are as advised by Meli et al.41 and via habitat management guidance provided by BoerenNatuur. Discount rates are as suggested by Overton et al.43. To calculate the change/improvement in habitat conditions associated with Nature & Landscape measures, we used the existing biodiversity weightings developed for the BBM and ANLb packages, which again were normalised as previously discussed.

After characterising all KPIs in terms of endpoint biodiversity impacts using the approaches described above, biodiversity impact values (in PDF.year) were summed across all farms (cf. Fig. 1). The total impact estimated for the filtered dataset was factored up to an estimate for the production sector as a whole, based on the total number of farms (14,54219), and total area under dairy production in 2020 (870,880 ha19).

Setting any ‘net outcomes' objective requires in part that any unavoidable biodiversity impacts are adequately compensated for (e.g., through biodiversity offsets). But to specify to what extent different biodiversity losses are permittable as part of net outcomes policies—and also in the context of uncertainties in calculating overall biodiversity impacts, as discussed throughout—we propose accompanying metrics with safeguards. These can be based both on empirical biophysical limits (at the level of the KPIs), as well as socio-political values. For example, a safeguard might specify that achieving net positive impacts on biodiversity should not be based on a strategy that includes deforestation of pristine rainforest through the Dutch dairy sector's feed supply chain, or one that leads to levels of nutrient pollution within the Netherlands that are unhealthy for humans or wildlife. Further, strategies for biodiversity can be set at the level of safeguards on the relatively certain midpoint pressures (here, the KPIs) on the environment, and then monitored through the indicative if less certain endpoint biodiversity metrics.

It is unlikely that values can be maximised for all Biodiversity Monitor KPIs. For example, there may be farm-level trade-offs between KPIs (such as between protein produced on own land and nitrogen soil surplus, if production intensity is increased) or local constraints that limit performance. Safeguards help to define the safe operating space for the sector as a whole, allowing farm-level constraints and trade-offs to be navigated while striving for a genuine Net Positive impact on biodiversity at the sector level. Safeguards therefore need to be comprehensive enough to prevent perverse outcomes for nature, but practical enough to ensure feasibility when designing strategies towards a net positive target.

In developing safeguards here, we drew upon existing good practice guidance around achieving ‘net outcomes' goals (such as net positive impacts on biodiversity), and associated topics (e.g. biodiversity offsetting). This includes peer-reviewed articles (e.g. ref. 6), business and financial institution standards and guidance (e.g., IFC Performance Standard 644, UK BNG Good Practice Principles), policy guidance (e.g., EU biodiversity strategy, Dutch Natuurpunten45), and stakeholder consultation sessions. These resources exhibit some common themes, which potentially serve as a good basis for determining categories of safeguards (Table 5).

During our research period, two stakeholder consultation meetings were organised. The objective of these consultations was not only to inform relevant stakeholders about the project but also to receive feedback on the proposed methodologies. The stakeholder consultation meetings took place virtually on December 6, 2021, and May 25, 2022 (running for 2 h in both cases). Where identified stakeholders were unable to attend the meeting, they were invited to provide feedback by email. Both consultations were hosted by the research team. Representatives from the following organisations participated in the stakeholder consultation:

Duurzame Zuivelketen (DZK)

IMAGEN

LTO

Staatsbosbeheer

Stichting Biodiversiteitsmonitor

Wageningen University & Research (WUR)

WWF France

WWF Netherlands (WNF)

The first consultation focused primarily upon the biodiversity metric, and the second consultation upon proposed safeguards. Separate documents outlining the status of methodologies were provided in advance of the meeting to attendees, and the research team presented research updates at each. Stakeholders asked questions, provided feedback, and made suggestions on how to improve the approach and methods. Finally, the project team hosted a focussed discussion about critical points where stakeholder input was essential to move forward with the project. All stakeholder inputs were recorded and evaluated, and incorporated into refinements to the methodology where relevant and appropriate.

KLW data from individual farms were linked to Nature and Landscape data from the same farms, and anonymized before being sent to the researchers i.e. completely anonymized. The data themselves are owned by ZuivelNL. The data have not been made public, so the research team is not permitted to share the dataset. Further, we use the FeedPrint NL database developed by Wageningen University & Research, Blonk Consultants, and GFLI; and, supporting data sourced from Royal FrieslandCampina and the KringloopWijzer database; again, these datasets can be requested from the corresponding owner organisations. The GLOBIO database, used to source characterisation factors for the analysis, is in the public domain.

Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) relies on a network of molecular chaperones that facilitates the folding and maturation of client proteins. How the ER chaperones organize in a supramolecular manner to exert their cooperativity has, however, remained unclear. Here we report the discovery of a multichaperone condensate in the ER lumen, which is formed around the chaperone PDIA6 during protein folding homeostasis. The condensates form in a Ca2+-dependent manner and we resolve the underlying mechanism at the atomic and cellular levels. The PDIA6 condensates recruit further chaperones—Hsp70 BiP, J-domain protein ERdj3, disulfide isomerase PDIA1 and Hsp90 Grp94—which constitute some of the essential components of the early folding machinery. The chaperone condensates enhance folding of proteins, such as proinsulin, and prevent protein misfolding in the ER lumen. The PDIA6-scaffolded chaperone condensates hence provide the functional basis for spatial and temporal coordination of the dynamic ER chaperone network.

One-third of eukaryotic proteins are processed within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to obtain their correct structure1,2,3. This function is ensured by a network of molecular chaperones that recognizes client proteins and assists their folding4,5. A rate-limiting step in ER protein folding is the formation of disulfide bonds, and the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) chaperone family is therefore indispensable for folding homeostasis6,7. PDIs contain one or more catalytically active thioredoxin-like domains, which can reduce, oxidize or isomerize disulfide bonds in client proteins via a characteristic CXXC motif. They typically combine catalytically active and inactive domains towards multidomain architectures. Although all PDIs share common structural features, they differ in terms of client-protein specificity and affinity, chaperone activity and redox properties, resulting in specialized roles for individual family members8. One particular family member, PDIA6, caught our attention because its malfunction is connected to several human diseases including cancer and diabetes, yet its exact function remained elusive9,10,11,12.

We observed that endogenous PDIA6 localized as expected in the ER of human HeLa cells. Remarkably, however, the endogenous protein was not homogeneously dispersed but concentrated in well-defined clusters, both in wild-type (WT) cells as well as in PDIA6–Halo knock-in cells (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a–e). Overexpressed PDIA6 formed clusters of similar shape and localization in living cells, albeit with substantially increased size (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1f–i). PDIA6 formed similar clusters in HEK and U2OS cells (Extended Data Fig. 1j,k). The PDIA6 clusters were mobile within the ER and underwent fission and fusion events, and their fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) occurred within minutes (half life (t1/2) = 78 ± 14 s, diffusion coefficient (D) = 4 ± 1 × 10−3 μm2 s−1), a time scale that is common for biological phase-separated condensates13,14 (Fig. 1b–d, Extended Data Fig. 1l–n and Supplementary Videos 1–4). The PDIA6 condensates thus fulfil all hallmarks of biological phase separation15.

Attempts to delete the PDIA6 gene in human cells were unsuccessful, indicating that PDIA6 is an essential protein, consistent with earlier findings in Caenorhabditis elegans16. Intriguingly, PDIA6 malfunction has been reported to lead to an imbalance in ER folding homeostasis16,17. We thus wondered whether a functional coupling exists between ER stress and condensate formation. To create a physiological ER-stress situation, we overexpressed Akita proinsulin, a misfolded mutant of proinsulin that accumulates in the ER and thereby causes ER stress18. This led to homogenous dispersion of PDIA6 in the entire ER lumen (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Similarly, following treatment of the cells with the pharmacological ER-stress inducer tunicamycin, the PDIA6 condensates dispersed independently of the PDIA6 expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 2b–d). Notably, the stress-dependent condensate dissolution was reversible, as PDIA6 condensates reorganized after washout of the stressor (Fig. 1e,f). Two other stress inducers, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, induced the same effect (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Remarkably, however, the dissolution kinetics differed substantially between the compounds. PDIA6 condensates dissolved completely within 1 h following thapsigargin treatment, whereas dissolution was observed only after 6 h of tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2g). This kinetic difference correlates with the different modes of action of the two drugs. Thapsigargin blocks the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pumps19, leading to an almost immediate Ca2+ depletion in the ER lumen, whereas tunicamycin inhibits N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins20 and causes a delayed drop in Ca2+ levels as a secondary effect of the accumulation of unfolded proteins21. Overall, the presence of PDIA6 condensates is thus coupled to protein homeostatic conditions and their dissolution in response to ER stress seems to be regulated by luminal Ca2+ levels.

To test this mechanistic hypothesis, we reconstituted droplets of purified recombinant PDIA6 protein in vitro. Homeostatic ER was mimicked by a high Ca2+ concentration, reducing conditions, physiological pH and a crowding agent. Under these conditions, recombinant PDIA6 reproducibly formed droplets that underwent fusion events and time-dependent growth in a time scale of seconds. The protein dynamically exchanged between the condensed and dispersed phase with similar kinetics as in vivo, as determined by FRAP experiments (t1/2 = 47 ± 18 s, D = 6 ± 2 × 10−3 μm2 s−1; Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 3a–f). Droplets did not form when Ca2+ was replaced by another divalent ion, Mg2+, that is, their formation was Ca2+-specific. Importantly, the droplets formed only at Ca2+ concentrations above about 500 μM and the saturation concentration was independent of the protein concentration (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 3g). We determined the Ca2+ affinity of PDIA6 to be 420 ± 20 μM in vitro by quantifying the number of PDIA6 condensates as a function of Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 1k). Remarkably, this value corresponds to the physiological transition between protein folding homeostasis ([Ca2+]homeo ≈ 800 μM) and ER stress ([Ca2+]stress ≈ 100 μM)22, and therefore correlates very well with our observations in living cells. PDIA6 condensates are thus regulated by the Ca2+ concentration.

We then employed an integrated structural biology approach to resolve the structure and mechanism of PDIA6 condensate formation. PDIA6 consists of two catalytically active thioredoxin-like domains, domains a0 and a, which are followed by the inactive domain b of unknown function (Fig. 2a)23,24. To monitor conformational changes and interactions using NMR spectroscopy, we assigned 94% of the Metε, Leuδ2 and Valγ2 methyl groups and established near-complete amide backbone assignments (Extended Data Fig. 4). Through size-exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments, we found that PDIA6 dimerizes via helix α4 in domain a0 (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a), in agreement with previous findings25. The dimerization interface was resolved by a methyl NOE network between residues L72 and L134 as well as between V75 and L131, L134 and L135, which corresponds to the arrangement observed in crystals of domain a0 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier: 4ef0). The dimerization thus resulted from a carboxy-terminal extension of helix α4 in domain a0 by seven residues and contrasts the PDI family members PDIA1–5, which have shorter helices and are monomeric26 (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Dimerization occurred with a dissociation constant (KD) in the low nanomolar range (Extended Data Fig. 5d) and the dimer is therefore the dominant species at the physiological concentration of about 100 μM (refs. 27,28). We determined the crystal structure of domain b (residues 274–427), which adopts a thioredoxin-like fold, to a resolution of 1.8 Å (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Table 1).

Ca2+ ions are modelled based on calsequestrin (PDB: 5kn3; Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). Methyl groups with substantial loss in intensity in g are represented as spheres. Side chains of Ca2+ binding residues are shown as sticks.

The dimeric domain a0 is connected to domain a by a long positively charged linker, and domains a and b are connected by a short five-residue linker that presumably restricts the relative domain motions as it contains three conserved proline residues (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 5g,h). Domains a and b unfold cooperatively, suggesting that they are stabilized by interdomain interactions (Extended Data Fig. 5i). The C-terminal tail of PDIA6 (residues 420–440) is highly flexible and disordered, as evidenced by a narrow chemical shift dispersion and high NMR signal intensities (Fig. 2e). Combining the experimental data, we established a full atomic model of PDIA6 (Fig. 2f).

As PDIA6 condensate formation is Ca2+-dependent, we set out to determine PDIA6 Ca2+ binding sites. Titration of Ca2+ to PDIA6 did not lead to substantial changes in the methyl NMR spectra, demonstrating the absence of large structural rearrangements (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Titration of the paramagnetic analogue Gd3+, however, quenched NMR signals specifically in three structural regions, thus revealing three cation binding sites (I, II and III; Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Bound Gd3+ was outcompeted by an excess of Ca2+, proving Ca2+ binding specificity. Binding sites I and II are located at the domain a–b interface and in domain b, respectively. Binding site III is located within the disordered C-terminal tail, as previously proposed25. We pinpointed the exact locations of binding sites I and II in the centre of the quenched regions by structural alignment with the Ca2+ binding protein calsequestrin and amide NMR experiments (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 6d–f)29. We attempted to probe the binding sites experimentally, however, single point mutations in binding sites I or II resulted in drastically decreased protein yields, preventing further experiments (Extended Data Fig. 6g). In contrast, mutagenesis of the Ca2+ binding site III was readily possible. Disruption of this site did not affect condensate formation in vitro or in living cells (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i). Taken together, the Ca2+-dependent phase separation of PDIA6 is controlled by a molecular switch in domain b, which is activated following Ca2+ binding.

Next, we set out to determine the molecular mechanism underlying condensate formation. Biological phase separation relies on multivalent interactions15 and therefore, we expected at least two intermolecular interactions to be involved. We suspected that dimerization of domain a0 is one of these interactions and indeed, a monomeric construct of PDIA6 (ref. 25) did not form condensates (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In search for the second interaction, we first tested droplet formation of the individual domain subconstructs but none of these formed droplets in solution (Extended Data Fig. 7b). As mentioned earlier, we also probed a potential role of the disordered C-terminal tail, but neither neutralization of its positive charges (EQDN) nor its entire truncation (ΔC) abrogated the formation of condensates (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i).

We then hypothesized that the highly flexible and charged linker connecting domains a0 and a (Fig. 3a) might drive condensate formation by interacting with another PDIA6 dimer. To resolve this interaction, we employed NMR spectroscopy on the disperse protein, that is, in the absence of crowding agent. We suspected this interaction to be rather weak and therefore added a 21-residue peptide corresponding to the a0–a linker (GGRSGGYSSGKQGRSDSSSKK) to methyl-labelled full-length PDIA6 to saturate any potential binding sites. The addition of the peptide indeed led to drastic spectral changes in domain b. In the absence of the peptide, the domain equally populated two conformations in slow exchange (two peaks per residue for all residues in domain b; 57:43 ± 8%). Following titration of the linker peptide, this equilibrium strongly shifted towards one conformation (93:7 ± 3%), evidencing a transient interaction between the linker and domain b (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). High salt concentration as well as charge-neutralizing mutations in the linker peptide impaired the interaction, validating its electrostatic character (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 7f). Strikingly, the interaction was Ca2+-dependent, in full agreement with the physiological observation of phase separation (Fig. 1).

Source data

The data thus suggest a functional model for PDIA6 condensate formation, where the positively charged a0–a linker dynamically interacts with the negatively charged surface in domain b at homeostatic Ca2+ concentrations. We tested this functional model on the in vitro-reconstituted droplets of full-length PDIA6. In full agreement with the model, droplet formation was prevented by increased salt concentration or neutralization of the positively charged linker residues by mutagenesis (Fig. 3e). Importantly, the linker mutations did not affect the PDIA6 dimeric state or its disulfide isomerase and chaperone activities (Extended Data Fig. 7g–j). Encouraged by these findings, we then also probed the molecular model of condensate formation in cells. Neutralization of the positive charges in the linker should abolish PDIA6 condensate formation. Cells transfected with PDIA6 linker mutants indeed no longer formed the large condensates observed for PDIA6 WT. Removal of two charges from the linker led to a reduction in condensate size, and complete neutralization of all five charged residues (5× linker mutant) fully impeded condensate formation, acting as dominant negative (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 7k). The expression levels of endogenous PDIA6 and transfected PDIA6 5× linker mutant were approximately equal in our in vivo experiment, and at the same stoichiometry PDIA6 droplet formation was also abrogated in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 7l,m). The multivalency required for PDIA6 condensate formation thus results from (1) the high-affinity dimerization of domain a0 and (2) the transient Ca2+-dependent electrostatic interaction between the a0–a linker and domain b (Fig. 3g–i).

To explore the biological role of the PDIA6 condensates, in particular their functional role in the ER chaperone network, we probed the localization of the central chaperone Hsp70 BiP30 relative to the condensates. BiP is one of the most abundant ER chaperones involved in protein folding and disaggregation and has been reported to interact with PDIA6 (refs. 31,32,33,34). Immunostaining of HeLa cells showed that endogenous BiP co-localized in the PDIA6 condensates, both at endogenous and overexpressed PDIA6 levels. Overexpression of BiP, in turn, did not affect the PDIA6 condensates (Fig. 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. 8a–c and Supplementary Table 2). We also tested whether BiP would form condensates on its own by staining endogenous BiP in cells transfected with PDIA6 5× linker mutant. As shown above, in these cells PDIA6 does not form condensates but is homogenously dispersed throughout the entire ER. Under this condition, BiP did not form condensates, thus establishing PDIA6 as the scaffold of the condensates to which BiP is recruited (Fig. 4c).

Next, we employed methyl and amide NMR experiments to determine the interaction sites between PDIA6 and BiP by chemical shift mapping. PDIA6 interacts via its domain b with the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of BiP (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8d–k). The affinity of KD ≈ 50 μM (Extended Data Fig. 8l) is in the same range as known BiP–co-chaperone interactions35,36 and fully in line with a dynamic chaperone network. Importantly, the BiP binding site on domain b does not overlap with the interface required for condensate formation such that condensate formation and BiP recruitment by PDIA6 is simultaneously possible, as observed in cells. In full accordance with this model, the isolated BiP NBD co-localized in PDIA6 droplets in vitro, although it did not undergo phase separation by itself (Fig. 4e). Together, these experiments clearly establish that PDIA6 forms the scaffold of the condensates into which it recruits BiP as a secondary protein.

Next, we investigated whether further ER chaperones were also concentrated into the PDIA6 condensates. We chose to examine the BiP co-chaperone ERdj3, an ER-resident member of the J-domain protein family, because it plays a central role in mediating client-protein transfer to BiP37. Strikingly, ERdj3 co-localized with the PDIA6–BiP condensates, both at endogenous protein levels and in PDIA6-transfected cells. Next, we probed the localizations of PDIA1 (the major PDI for numerous ER client proteins) and Grp94 (the ER-localized Hsp90), which cooperate with BiP in client-protein processing34,38. Both chaperones enriched in the PDIA6 condensates at endogenous protein levels and in PDIA6-transfected cells (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 9a and Supplementary Table 2). In contrast to this, the lectin chaperones calreticulin and calnexin (responsible for the glycosylation of client proteins before their export from the ER)39 did not enrich in the PDIA6 condensates (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 9b,c and Supplementary Table 2). From these observations, it emerges that the essential components of the early folding machinery—Hsp70, Hsp90, J-domain proteins and PDIs—specifically concentrate in the condensates, whereas the lectin chaperones involved in later-stage client maturation—calnexin and calreticulin—are not enriched (Fig. 4h).

The co-localization of multiple key chaperones in the condensates strongly suggests a fundamental biological function in client-protein folding. Proinsulin, the precursor of insulin, is known to be folded in the ER through the assistance of various chaperones including BiP, Erdj3, PDIA6 and PDIA1 (refs. 40,41) before being exported to the Golgi for further processing and subsequent secretion in the form of insulin42. This makes it an ideal model client to study the potential role of the condensates as folding compartments.

To assess the spatial localization of proinsulin within the ER, cells were transiently transfected with a proinsulin construct including a C-terminal myc tag. This allowed visualization of ER-localized proinsulin through staining with antibody to myc and revealed that proinsulin was highly enriched in endogenous PDIA6 condensates (Pearson's correlation coefficient, PCC = 0.93 ± 0.1), which strongly points towards a role of the condensates in client-protein folding. Similarly, proinsulin co-localized in PDIA6–GFP condensates (PCC = 0.88 ± 0.06; Fig. 5a,b, Extended Data Fig. 10a and Supplementary Table 2).

To evaluate whether proinsulin is actively processed within the PDIA6 condensates, we assessed their effect on insulin secretion. If the PDIA6 condensates served as functional ER folding compartments, their absence should lead to a decrease in insulin secretion. We co-transfected cells with proinsulin and either PDIA6 WT (condensates) or the PDIA6 5× linker mutant (no condensates), and determined the amount of insulin secretion. Strikingly, cells transfected with PDIA6 5× linker mutant secreted less insulin than PDIA6 WT-transfected cells, supporting our hypothesis of a functional role of the PDIA6 condensates in client maturation (Fig. 5c). Notably, intracellular proinsulin was not detectable in these experiments, presumably due to its proteolytic degradation. We thus treated the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, which led to detectable proinsulin accumulation (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Thereby, proinsulin levels were notably higher in cells expressing PDIA6 5× linker mutant (no condensates) compared with PDIA6 WT (condensates), which further demonstrates that the absence of condensates impairs proinsulin folding. To corroborate this, we also used the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1, which exhibits an inherently high glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, overcoming the requirement of proinsulin co-transfection. Comparison of the secreted insulin with the intracellular proinsulin ratio of PDIA6 WT- and PDIA6 5× linker mutant-transfected INS-1 cells led to the same conclusion as before, namely that the absence of the chaperone condensates severely disrupts insulin processing (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 10c). As shown earlier, the enzymatic activity of PDIA6 is fully intact in the 5× linker mutant such that the disruption of proinsulin folding must result from the disruption of the condensate architecture. Together, these experiments provide clear evidence that the PDIA6 condensates as such play a fundamental role in insulin folding that goes beyond classical chaperone functions.

Finally, we wanted to study the effect of the PDIA6–chaperone condensates on general ER client-protein turnover and proteostasis. To this end, we assessed the effect of chaperone condensates on three parameters that report on ER proteostasis: (1) XBP1 splicing, a well-established readout that directly reports on the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen43,44, (2) protein aggregation using the PROTEOSTAT aggresome assay and (3) fluidity of the ER membrane, which has been reported to stiffen on accumulation of misfolded proteins, measured via the recovery dynamics of mApple–Sec61 in FRAP experiments. We transfected cells with PDIA6 WT or PDIA6 5× linker mutant and quantified the above parameters. Strikingly, compared with PDIA6 WT-expressing cells, the absence of PDIA6 condensates (5× linker mutant) led to a pronounced increase in XBP1 splicing (Fig. 5e) and greater protein aggregation (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10d). The fluorescence recovery of mApple–Sec61 was significantly slower in cells without PDIA6 condensates (t1/2 = 17 ± 5 s) than cells with PDIA6 condensates (t1/2 = 8 ± 4 s; Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 10e–g), showing a stiffening of the ER morphology in the absence of the chaperone condensates. Together, these results lend strong support for our model that the PDIA6 condensates play an active role in preventing protein aggregation and enhancing protein folding robustness. This is further reflected in a lower cell viability in the absence of condensates (Extended Data Fig. 10h–l), indicating that condensates avert cell death by preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. PDIA6 condensates thus serve to subcompartmentalize the ER into functional ‘folding factories'.

In summary, our experiments reveal along multiple independent lines that crucial ER chaperones do not only cooperate in a functional network but form a self-organized supramolecular structure within the ER that guides client folding (Fig. 5h). The chaperone condensates seem to act in the early stages of client-protein folding and it is thus imaginable that client proteins are imported directly into the condensates following their translocation into the ER. The physiological benefits of subcompartmentalizing the ER by arranging chaperones into folding condensates indeed seem to be numerous: the elevated local concentrations of chaperones and clients increases both specificity and folding efficiency, thus reducing protein misfolding and aggregation. The simultaneous decrease in chaperone concentration outside the condensates may prevent non-specific interactions with folded proteins in the ER lumen, thus enabling a multistep processing pipeline for clients. Furthermore, the dynamic regulation of the chaperone condensates via the Ca2+ concentration might help to overcome an increasing load of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen during acute ER-stress situations by accelerating protein turnover at the cost of specificity. Condensate properties have recently been reported for the cytosolic chaperones Hsp70 and J-domain proteins, to specifically prevent aggregation of amyloid-forming proteins13,45. From these and our observations, the pattern seems to emerge that subcompartmentalization by chaperone condensates may be a general theme to structure cellular compartments. The chaperone superstructures in the ER not only provide a fascinating layer of functionality to enable protein biogenesis but might also result in novel therapeutical approaches to target protein misfolding diseases.

Human PDIA6 lacking its ER signal sequence (residues 19–440), domain ab (residues 161–440) and domain b (residues 276–440), with an additional N-terminal His6 tag including a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage sequence and domain a (residues 161–272) with an additional N-terminal His6 tag, followed by a SUMO tag were synthesised by GenScript. The genes were inserted using NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen). BL21-(DE3)-Lemo cells (New England Biolabs) were transformed and cultured at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium containing 30 mg ml−1 kanamycin. Expression was induced at an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6 by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubating at 25 °C for 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 35 ml lysis buffer per litre of culture (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.02 mg ml−1 ribonuclease RNase A (Roche), 0.01 mg ml−1 deoxyribonuclease DNase I (AppliChem) and 0.2 mg ml−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysis was performed using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics; three cycles at 4 °C). The soluble bacterial lysate was separated from cell debris and other components by centrifugation at 14,000g for 60 min and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer A (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole). PDIA6 was eluted using a 60% step gradient of buffer B (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole) and dialysed overnight against buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 300 mM NaCl) to remove the imidazole. The PDIA6 was denatured with 6 M urea and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer A + 6 M urea to further separate the protein from nucleotide and protein contamination. No changes in the protein conformation of refolded and not refolded PDIA6 were observed in two-dimensional-HMQC spectra and SEC-MALS analyses. PDIA6 was eluted at a 300 mM imidazole concentration in buffer containing 6 M urea. PDIA6 refolding was achieved by overnight dialysis against buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 300 mM NaCl). After refolding, the His tag was cleaved by overnight incubation with 1 mg TEV protease or Ulp1 SUMO protease per 50 mg of PDIA6 in cleavage buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM EDTA) at 4 °C. The his–TEV–domain b and his–TEV–domain ab constructs were not cleaved. His–TEV–domain a0 and his–TEV–domain a used for amide backbone assignment were not cleaved. Cleaved PDIA6 constructs were separated from the tag, TEV or Ulp1 and uncleaved PDIA6 by a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in buffer A. Finally, PDIA6 was concentrated by ultrafiltration and injected into size-exclusion chromatography columns (Superdex-200 16/600 PG for constructs >30 kDa or Superdex-75 16/600 PG for constructs <30 kDa; Cytiva) to further purify the proteins and adjust the protein to its final buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2). The PDIA6 was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at −20 °C until use. The final yield of purified protein was 25 mg per litre of LB medium. To obtain fully reduced PDIA6, the protein was incubated with 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at room temperature for 1 h, buffer exchanged (3×) to SEC buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2) and immediately frozen. Before performing the calcium-binding experiments, PDIA6 was incubated with 20 mM EDTA for 1 h at room temperature and dialysed overnight against SEC buffer at 4 °C.

Human BiP lacking its ER signal sequence (residues 19–654) with an N-terminal His6 tag including a TEV cleavage sequence was synthesized by GenScript. The gene was inserted through NcoI and XhoI into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen). BL21-(DE3)-Lemo cells (New England Biolabs) were transformed and cultured at 37 °C in LB medium. BiP expression was induced at an OD600 of 0.6 by adding 1 mM IPTG, and expression was continued at 25 °C for 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer per litre of culture (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.02 mg ml−1 ribonuclease RNase A (Roche), 0.01 mg ml−1 deoxyribonuclease DNase I (AppliChem) and 0.2 mg ml−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysis was performed using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics; three cycles at 4 °C). The soluble bacterial lysate was separated from cell debris and other components by centrifugation at 14,000g for 60 min and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer A (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2). BiP was eluted using a 60% step gradient of buffer B (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 M imidazole) and dialysed overnight against buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2). The BiP was denatured with 6 M urea and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in buffer + 8 M urea. The BiP was eluted at a 500 mM imidazole concentration in buffer containing 8 M urea. BiP refolding was achieved by overnight dialysis against buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2). After refolding, the His tag was cleaved by overnight incubation with 1 mg TEV per 50 mg BiP in cleavage buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM EDTA) at 4 °C. BiP was separated from the tag, TEV and uncleaved BiP via a Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer A. The BiP was then applied to an anion-exchange column (QHP, Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer QA (25 mM Tris (pH 8.5)) and eluted using a gradient of buffer QB (25 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and 1 mM KCl) at a concentration of 250 mM KCl. Finally, the BiP was concentrated by ultrafiltration and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-200 16/600 PG, Cytiva) to further purify the proteins and adjust to its SEC buffer. Finally, the BiP was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at −20 °C until use. The final yield of purified protein was 15–20 mg WT BiP per litre of LB medium.

Methyl-labelled PDIA6 proteins were obtained by growing the expression cells in M9 minimal media prepared with 99.85% D2O (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 15NH4Cl (1 g l−1; Sigma-Aldrich) and d-glucose-d7 (2 g l−1; Sigma-Aldrich). At an OD600 of 0.8, a solution containing the labelled precursors was added as follows. For [U-2H, 15N, 12C], Met-[13CH3]ε, Val-[13CH3]γ2 and Leu-[13CH3]δ2 labelling of PDIA6 methionine leucine valine, 240 mg 2-hydroxy-2-[13C]methyl-3-oxo-4,4,4-tri-[2H]-butanoate (pro-S acetolactate-13C, NMR-Bio) and 100 mg of [13C]ε-L-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich). For [U-2H, 15N, 12C], Met-[13CH3]ε and Val-[13CH3]γ2 labelling of PDIA6 methionine valine, 240 mg 2-hydroxy-2-[13C]methyl-3-oxo-4,4,4-tri-[2H]-butanoate (pro-S acetolactate-13C, NMR-Bio), 30 mg of l-leucine-d10 and 100 mg of [13C]ε-l-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich). For [U-2H, 15N, 12C], Met-[13CH3]ε, Val-[13CH3/12C2H3]cγ1/cγ2 and Ile-[13CH3]δ1 labelling of BiP isoleucine methionine valine, 100 mg 2-keto-3-(methyl-d3)-butyric acid-4-13C,3-d sodium salt, 30 mg l-leucine-d10, 80 mg α-ketobutyric acid methyl 13C (99%) 3,3-D2 (98%) and 100 mg [13C]ε-l-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich). One hour after the addition of the precursors, protein expression was induced by adding 0.5–1 mM IPTG and incubating at 25 °C for 12 h. Methyl-labelled proteins were purified following the protocols described earlier.

The QuikChange II mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to introduce the PDIA6 mutations M182L; M331L; M359L; M367L; L61M; V75I; V124I; L139M; L165M; L196M; I234V; L320M; L345M; L349M; L385M; I406V; V407I; L419M; V421I; I425V; L427M; L432M; L435M; L440M; K161 to stop (domain a0); L139STOP (domain a0 Δlinker); P274 to stop (domain a0a, domain a); S428 to stop (domain b ΔC(13)); 420STOP (ΔC(20); domain b ΔC(20); domain ab ΔC(20)); E422Q, D423N, D424N, D426N, D429N, E431Q, D433N and D434N (EQDN, dom b EQDN); R142Q, K150N and R153Q; K150N, R153Q and K159N; R142Q, K150N, R153Q, K159N and K160N (5× linker mutant) and the BiP mutation G407 to stop (NBD). All PCR primers were obtained from Microsynth. The plasmids were purified using the Zyppy plasmid mini prep kit (Zymo Research) and mutations were confirmed by sequencing by Microsynth AG. The expression and purification of the mutant proteins was performed as described for the WT proteins. All linker mutants (R142Q, K150N and R153Q; K150N, R153Q and K159N; and R142Q, K150N, R153Q, K159N and K160N) behaved like the WT protein.

NMR experiments were performed in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 or 25 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2 at 37 °C. The experiments were recorded on Bruker Avance IIIHD 600 MHz, Avance III 700 MHz, Avance Neo 800 MHz or Avance IIIHD 900 MHz spectrometers running Topspin 3.6–4.0 and equipped with a cryogenically cooled triple-resonance probe. The NMR data were processed with nmrPipe46 2022.230.12.16 and ccpnmr47 2.5.2. Reference experiments were recorded at concentrations between 25 μM and 100 μM. Secondary chemical shifts were calculated relative to random-coil values48. Depending on the conditions, 10 mM TCEP, 10 mM CaCl2, 5 mM ADP, 10 eq. linker peptide and 1 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 were used as indicated. To mimic ER homeostatic-like conditions, 10 mM TCEP or 15 mM glutathione (GSH) with 7:1 GSH:glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was used in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+. Samples behaved identically in the presence of 10 mM TCEP and 15 mM GSH with 7:1 GSH:GSSG. The samples were incubated before the experiment (about 1 h for TCEP, GSH and ADP; about 30 min for protein–protein interaction experiments, Ca2+ and Gd3+; and overnight for peptides). Data were analysed using Excel 16.97.

PDIA6 Met[CH3]ε, Val[CH3]γ2 and Leu[CH3]δ2 assignment was obtained using a structure-based approach combining mutagenesis, specific valine labelling schemes49, subconstructs and three-dimensional 13C, 13C-resolved [1H, 1H]-NOESY experiments recorded at 37 °C in SEC buffer with 10 mM TCEP and 5% D2O. The following point mutations were used: M182L, M331L, M359L, M376L, L61M, V75I, V124I, V139M, L165M, L196M, I234V, L320M, L345M, L349M, L385M, I406V, V407I, L419M, V421I, I425V, L427M, L432M, L435M and L440M. The following subconstructs were used: his–domain a and his–domain ab. Specific valine labelling allowed distinction between leucine and valine residues. Each sample was recorded at 37 °C with an adjusted duration depending on the final concentration of each mutant (experimental time ranging from 120 to 240 min per sample). Three-dimensional 13C, 13C-resolved [1H, 1H]-NOESY experiments were recorded in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5% D2O, with sample concentrations of 870 μM and a mixing time of 500 ms. Together, this allowed for the assignment of 62/66 Met[CH3]ε and Leu[CH3]δ2 and Val[CH3]γ2 methyl groups (94%).

For the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments, the following experiments were recorded. [U-1H, 13C, 15N]-PDIA6 domain a0: HNCA and HNCACB at 37 °C in 25 mM MES (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5 % D2O. [U-1H, 13C, 15N]-PDIA6 his–domain a: 4D-APSY50 at 37 °C in 25 mM MES (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5% D2O. [U-2H, 13C, 15N]-PDIA6 his–domain ab: HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO and HNcoCA at 37 °C in 25 mM MES (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5 % D2O; and HNCA, HNCACB with deuterium decoupling and 3D 15N, 15N resolved [1H, 1H]-NOESY with a mixing time of 100 ms at 37 °C in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5% D2O. [U-1H, 13C, 15N]-PDIA6 his–domain bΔC: HNCA, HNCACB, HNcoCACB and HNCO at 25 °C in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM GSSG and 5% D2O, and HNCACB, HNcaCO and 3D 15N, 15N resolved [1H, 1H]-NOESY with a mixing time of 80 ms at 25 °C in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5 % D2O. All experiments were recorded at sample concentrations of 0.5–1.0 mM. The amide backbone assignments comprise 85% of domain a0, 92% of his–domain a, 79% of his–domain b and 54% of his–domain ab.

All PDIA6 constructs were N-terminally tagged with DyLight 488 amine-reactive dyes (Thermo Scientific) at a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 in 25 mM MES (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2 in the dark for 1 h at 25 °C. Free dye was removed by overnight dialysis at pH 6.5 and 4 °C in the dark, and the labelled proteins were buffer exchanged (3×) to SEC buffer. BiP NBD was N-terminally tagged with DyLight 633 amine-reactive dyes (Thermo Scientific) following the same protocol. The protein concentration and extent of labelling were determined according to manufacturer's protocol for all constructs and only proteins labelled with 0.75 and 1.5 moles dye per mole protein were used for experiments.

SEC-MALS measurements of PDIA6 constructs were performed at 25 °C in SEC buffer using a S200 10/300 GL column (Agilent Technologies) on an Agilent 1260 high-performance liquid chromatography system. Proteins were eluted at a concentration of 20 μM. Elution was monitored by multiangle light scattering (Heleos II 8+; Wyatt Technology), differential refractive index (Optilab T-rEX; Wyatt Technology) and absorbance at 280 and 254 nm (1260 UV; Agilent Technologies). The column was equilibrated overnight in the running buffer to obtain stable baseline signals from the detectors before data collection. All system parameters were calibrated using an injection of 2 mg ml−1 BSA solution (ThermoPierce) and standard protocols in ASTRA 6. Molar mass and mass distributions were calculated using the ASTRA 6 software (Wyatt Technology).

Differential scanning fluorimetry data were acquired using a Prometheus NanoTemper NT.48 instrument (NanoTemper Technology) at protein concentrations of 100 μM in SEC buffer. The samples were scanned from 20 °C to 95 °C at a scan rate of 0.5 °C min−1. Protein unfolding was measured by detecting the temperature-dependent change in tryptophan fluorescence at emission wavelengths of 330 and 350 nm. Melting temperatures were determined by detecting the maximum of the first derivative of the fluorescence ratios (F350/F330).

For the determination of the dissociation constants N-terminally tagged DyLight 488–PDIA6 at 20 nM was incubated with increasing amounts of BiP in SEC buffer in the presence of 5 mM ADP, 1 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 0.05% Tween and 1 mM CaCl2 prepared by serial dilution. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C before being loaded into capillary tubes. The LED power was set to 100% and the microscale thermophoresis (MST) power to medium. The pre-MST period was 5 s, the MST-acquisition period was 30 s and the post-MST period was 5 s. Measurements were performed in triplicates on a Monolith NT.115 system (NanoTemper) and integrated at an interval of 2.5 s.

Mass photometry data were obtained using a Refeyn OneMP system in microscope coverslips prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with silicone gaskets. To lock the focus, 18 µl SEC buffer was used, followed by the addition of 2 µl protein sample at the indicated final concentrations. Movies were recorded using Refeyn AcquireMP 2.5.1 and analysed with Refeyn DiscoverMP 2.5.0.

PDIA6 his–domain bΔC (P274–L427) in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM TCEP was crystallized at 10 mg ml−1 concentration at room temperature in sitting-drop vapour diffusion experiments in a 1:1 ratio of protein to precipitant. Crystals appeared in 1.9 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0) and 1% dimethylsulfoxide after two days and grew to their final size within ten days. The crystals were cryopreserved by the addition of ethylene glycol to a final concentration of 20% (vol/vol) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at the SLS beamline X06DA (Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland) at 100 K, and integrated, indexed and scaled using the XDS software51,52. The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser53 1.0 using PDB accession code 3uem (ref. 54). Automated model building55 was carried out with Arp/Warp56 8.0, followed by Autobuild in PHENIX57 1.17, and completed by manual model building with Coot58 0.9.8 and structure refinement in PHENIX59 1.17. Model quality was validated with Molprobity60 4.4. Data collection and refinement statistics are in Supplementary Table 1. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB under the accession code 8cpq.

Disulfide reductase activity was assessed using the NADPH-based insulin reduction assay. Purified PDIA6 constructs (1 μM final concentration) were added to 1 mM reduced GSH, 800 μM NADPH, 0.16 units GSH reductase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 30 μM human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) in SEC buffer and the absorbance of NADPH monitored at 340 nm using a Biotek Synergy H1 multi-mode microplate reader for 25 min at 25 °C.

Chaperone activity was assessed using the citrate synthase aggregation assay. Citrate synthase (Escherichia coli; NZYTech) was dialysed against 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5). Purified PDIA6 constructs (10 μM final concentration) were added to 1 μM citrate synthase in 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) buffer and incubated at 45 °C and 300 rpm. Protein aggregation was monitored at 350 nm using a Biotek Synergy H1 multi-mode microplate reader at the indicated time points.

PDIA6 liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) was examined at 25 μM in SEC buffer in the presence of 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG3350, mass fraction, freshly prepared immediately before the experiment) as a crowding agent in the absence/presence of 15 mM GSH with 7:1 GSH:GSSG or 10 mM TCEP, 10 mM CaCl2 and/or 20 mM EDTA. The PEG was added last by simultaneously swirling the sample and gently pipetting up and down to thoroughly mix the sample. Images were taken 30 min after the addition of PEG. No PDIA6 construct formed liquid droplets in the absence of crowding agent and at concentrations below 1 mM. Phase-separated PDIA6 droplets formed under ER-mimicking conditions (15 mM GSH with 7:1 GSH:GSSG + 1–10 mM CaCl2) as well as under strongly reducing conditions (10 mM TCEP) in the presence of 1–10 mM CaCl2. Several salt concentrations (50–350 mM) were tested. Unlabelled proteins were used to confirm that they undergo phase separation without fluorescent labelling. Glass-bottomed 96-well plates were coated with 1% Pluronic F-127 overnight and the wells were washed three times with SEC buffer. For fluorescence microscopy, 1% N-terminally tagged DyLight protein was added to the unlabelled protein. BiP NBD LLPS was examined at 20 μM in SEC buffer in the presence of 5 mM ADP and 10% PEG as a crowding agent in the absence or presence of 20 μM PDIA6. Samples including BiP NBD were prepared as described for PDIA6.

A wide-field microscope (FEI MORE) with a Hamamatsu ORCA flash 4.0 cooled sCMOS camera using a TIRF APON ×60/1.49 and U Plan S Apo ×100/1.4 oil objective with the Live Acquisition 2.5 software were used for capturing images. Images were processed in the OMERO biological image data management system. All images are representative of at least three independent sets of experiments. Post-acquisition colouring of the channels was performed according to artistic preference.

HeLa CCL2, HEK293A and U2OS cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma) and 1×penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma). INS-1 832/13 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 10 mM HEPES (BioConcept), 0.05 mM EmbryoMax β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum. The HeLa CCL2 (ATCC CCL-2) and HEK293A (ATCC CVCL-6910) cell lines were a gift from M. Spiess; their identities were authenticated by short-tandem-repeat analysis by Microsynth AG (last in 2021). The U2OS cell line (ATCC HTB-96) was a gift from M. Hall. The INS-1 832/13 cell line was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalogue number SCC207). All cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative by PCR. For transient cell transfections, the cells were plated into six-well plates to reach 70% confluency the following day and transfected with 1 µg plasmid DNA complexed with Helix-IN transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences). For small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments, cells were transfected with a final concentration of 50 pmol Silencer Select siRNA targeting PDIA6 (siRNA1, GAAUGUUCUGGACAGUGAAtt, Ambion, s19715 and siRNA2, GGCAGUGAAUGGUCUGUAUtt, Ambion, s19716) using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were replated onto coverslips or an imaging chamber the following day and fixed or imaged 24–48 h post transfection. For stress treatments, the cells were treated with 1 μM tunicamycin, 1.25 μg ml−1 thapsigargin or 8 μM cyclopiazonic acid for the specified duration. For washout experiments, the cells were treated with 1 μM tunicamycin, 1.25 μg ml−1 thapsigargin or 8 μM cyclopiazonic acid for 10 h, washed with PBS and cultured in fresh medium overnight. For experiments with blocked proteasomal degradation, the cells were treated with 5 μM MG-132 for 18 h.

To ensure ER localization, the KDEL signal sequence (present in native PDIA6) was cloned at the C terminus of PDIA6–tGFP (Origene, RG201710) using a NEBuilder HiFi Assembly cloning kit (New England Biolabs) with primers designed by the NEBuilder assembly tool following the manufacturer's instructions. For simplicity, we refer to this plasmid as PDIA6–GFP. The C-terminal tail of PDIA6 was truncated by removing the last twelve amino acids from its sequence in the PDIA6-tGFP-KDEL plasmid using a NEB site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions and primers selected using the NEBaseChanger tool. The PDIA6-EGFP-KDEL plasmid for transient transfections was generated from the PDIA6-tGFP-KDEL plasmid and the EGFP insert from ACE2–EGFP (Addgene, catalogue number 154962), using a NEBuilder HiFi assembly cloning kit (New England Biolabs) with the primers designed by the NEBuilder Assembly Tool following the manufacturer's instructions. The QuikChange II mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to introduce the mutations K159N and K160N, and R124Q, K159N and K160N. Mutagenesis of L128A, L131A, L134A, V135A and L139A; R142Q, K150N and R153Q; R142Q, K150N, R153Q, K159N and K160N; and introduction of silent mutations in PDIA6 WT and PDIA6 5× linker mutant (for siRNA + transfection) was performed by GenScript. PDIA6 L128A, L131A, L134A, V135A and L139A has been characterized to be monomeric23 and is hence referred to as ‘PDIA6 monomer'. A gene encoding human pre-proinsulin, followed by a C-terminal myc–his A tag was synthesised by BioCat. The genes were inserted using BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes into a pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Novagen). The QuikChange II mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to introduce the Akita proinsulin mutation C96Y. Hamster BiP–mCherry was a gift from E. Snapp (Addgene plasmid 62233) and mutated to the human sequence, and mApple–Sec61 was a gift from J. Lippincott-Schwartz. All PCR primers were obtained from Microsynth. The plasmids were purified using the Zyppy plasmid mini prep kit from Zymo Research and mutations were confirmed by sequencing by Microsynth AG.

To generate the C-terminally Halo-tagged PDIA6 HeLa CCL2 cell line, the PDIA6 genomic locus was targeted shortly after the stop codon with the following guide RNA: 5′-CACCGAGTTGTGAGAGCCACAACAG-3′. The guides were synthesized by Microsynth and cloned into the hSpCas9 pX330 plasmid (Addgene plasmid 42230) by annealing oligonucleotides and ligation into the vector, which was linearized with BbsI. The homology repair was designed as follows: 500 bp left homology arm–glycine-serin linker (GSGSGSGSGS)–HaloTag–linker (PSRLEEELRRRLTEP)–ER retention sequence (KDEL)–PolyA–G418/geneticin resistance cassette–500 bp right homology arm. The coding sequence of the G418 resistance cassette, PolyA and the HaloTag were provided by F. Bottanelli and the homology repair plasmid was synthesized by Genscript. Both plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (Microsynth).

HeLa CCL2 cells at 70% confluency were transfected with 0.5 µg pX330 plasmid with the PDIA6 guide and 0.5 µg homology repair plasmid using Helix-IN transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences). Three days post transfection, 1.5 mg ml−1 G418 (Thermo Fisher) was added; the medium was exchanged every 2–3 days with fresh medium containing 1.5 mg ml−1 G418 until selection was complete (two weeks).

To generate a CRISPR–Cas9-mediated PDIA6-knockout cell line, the PDIA6 genomic locus was targeted with the following guide RNAs: 5′-GCTCGTGAAGGATCGCCTCG-3′ (gRNA1, targeting exons 5–7, depending on the splice variant) and 5′-AGACCGCGTTGGGGATTGGA-3′ (gRNA2, targeting exons 11–13, depending on splice variant). The guides were synthesized by Microsynth and cloned into px458-mCherry (gRNA1) and px459-Puro (gRNA2) vectors by annealing oligonucleotides and ligation into the vector, which was linearized with BbsI. The plasmid was confirmed by sequencing (Microsynth).

HeLa CCL2 and Hek293A cells at 70% confluency were transfected on a 10 cm dish with px458-mCherry (gRNA1) plasmid (2.5 µg per dish) and px459-Puro (gRNA2) plasmid containing the PDIA6 guides (2.5 µg per dish) using Helix-IN transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences). For selection, the cells were treated with 1.5 µg ml−1 puromycin one day post transfection for 24 h. FACS sorting (mCherry+) was carried out 48 h after transfection. The cells were trypsinized and resuspended in cell-sorting medium (2% FCS and 2.5 mM EDTA in PBS) and sorted on a Fortessa flow cytometer. Individual mCherry+ cells were collected, seeded into a 96-well plate and expanded. PDIA6 expression was determined by western blots. All of the surviving clones were positive for PDIA6, indicating that PDIA6 is essential.

HeLa cells were plated onto coverslips 24 h before fixation or stress treatment. At specified time points, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100, blocked in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum and stained with polyclonal anti-PDIA6 (1:200; GeneTex, GTX33397), monoclonal anti-GRP78/BiP (1:200; Invitrogen, 1H11-1H7; lot: XI3695781), polyclonal anti-calreticulin (1:200; Proteintech, 27298-1-AP), polyclonal anti-DNAJB11/ERdj3 (1:200; Thermo Fisher, 15484-1-AP), monoclonal anti-Grp94 (1:200; Enzo, SPA-850; lot: 103418), anti-PDIA1 (1:200; GeneTex, GTX2279), polyclonal anti-calnexin (1:200; Enzo, ADI-SPA-860; a gift from the Speiss laboratory), followed by Alexa Fluor (AF)488- or AF633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, AF633-conjugated goat anti-mouse, AF488- or AF633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, AF488- or AF633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, AF488-conjugated goat anti-rat or AF546-conjugated donkey anti-rat, AF633-conjugated goat anti-mouse and AF488- or AF633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (all 1:500), respectively. Proinsulin was visualized within the condensates by staining pre-proinsulin–myc–his-transfected HeLa cells with anti-myc clone 9E10 (1:2,000; Sigma-Aldrich, M4439; lot: 029M4849V) primary antibody, followed by AF633-conjugated anti-mouse (1:500). PDIA6 in the PDIA6–HaloTag knock-in HeLa CCL2 cell line was stained with polyclonal anti-HaloTag (1:250; Promega, G928A), followed by AF488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500). Overexpressed PDIA6–GFP was imaged in the 488 channel using the eGFP signal. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and sealed with nail polish.

Confocal images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview FV3000 system and an UPLSAPO ×60/1.30 objective with silicone oil using the FV3000 (FV21S-SW version 2.5.1) system software. Laser intensities were at 0.5–3.0% for both the 488 (AF488) and 640 nm (AF633) wavelengths. Sampling speed was 8.0 μs pixel−1. All images are representative of at least three independent sets of experiments. All images for corresponding experiments were processed with the same settings to insure comparable results. Post-acquisition colouring of the channels was performed according to artistic preference.

For live-cell imaging, cells were seeded on an imaging chamber (ibidi μ-slide) 24 h before data acquisition. Knock-in cells expressing PDIA6–Halo–KDEL fusion were labelled for 1 h using 200 nM JFX-554 (Promega) in the cell culture medium. After the labelling, the cells were rinsed and incubated for at least 1 h in culture medium. Live-cell imaging was performed in complete growth medium lacking phenol red at 37 °C with 5% CO2 on a wide-field microscope (FEI MORE) with a Hamamatsu ORCA flash 4.0 cooled sCMOS camera using a TIRF APON ×60/1.49 oil objective and an Olympus ‘SpinD' spinning-disc confocal microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion, sCMOS using an UPL APO ×60/1.5 oil objective. Laser intensities were set to 5–10% for the 488 nm wavelength. The system was preheated overnight (MORE) or 1 h (SpinD) to 37 °C to prevent thermal fluctuations. All images are representative of at least three independent sets of experiments. Images of the movies were recorded every 0.5–1.0 s. Post-acquisition colouring of the channels was performed according to artistic preference.

The FRAP experiments were performed on an Olympus ‘SpinD' spinning-disc confocal microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion, sCMOS using an UPL APO ×60/1.5 oil objective. PDIA6 droplets and condensates were bleached using a 488 nm laser with 100% intensity (Rapp OptoElectronic Firefly). A total ten images were obtained prebleaching, and 200 images were recorded every 1.0–1.83 s (in vitro) or 0.5–1.0 s (in vivo) post bleaching. Sec61 was bleached using a 488 nm laser with 100% intensity (Rapp OptoElectronic Firefly). A total of ten images were obtained prebleaching and 30–200 images were recorded post bleaching with a time interval of 1.5 s (PDIA6–GFP WT co-transfected cells) or 2.3 s (PDIA6–GFP 5× linker mutant co-transfected cells). Intensities of FRAP regions were extracted with the Fiji 1.52p software tool, background corrected and reported relative to the prebleaching time point (PDIA6–GFP) or normalized as a percentage of recovery (mApple–Sec61).

Images were analysed using Omero webserver 5.26.0, Fiji 1.52p and Python 3.9.

Cell images were processed using a custom Python 3.9 script with OpenCV 4.10.00 and NumPy 1.26.4 to detect phase-separated condensates based on predefined morphological parameters. The detected condensates were quantified using circularity-based segmentation, enabling the extraction of key morphological properties, including size, shape and number, for further analysis.

Microscopy images were processed using a custom Python 3.9 script with OpenCV 4.10.00 and NumPy 1.26.4, employing the Hough Transform to detect circular droplets. The number of detected droplets per image was then quantified, enabling further analysis of their distribution.

Cell images were processed using a custom Python 3.9 script with OpenCV 4.10.00 and NumPy 1.26.4 for cell segmentation via Otsu thresholding and condensate detection. Following feature extraction, the relative intensities of condensed and dispersed protein populations in each cell were quantified to assess protein enrichment in condensates.

Pearson correlation coefficients were determined using the Fiji 1.52p ‘JaCOP' plugin from 10–15 cells (see Supplementary Table 2). Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test. The fluorescence intensity histograms were extracted using the Fiji 1.52p software ‘plot profile' tool.

To assess PDIA6 and BiP expression levels, HeLa CCL2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and protease inhibitor) and denatured in Laemmli buffer at 65 °C for 10 min. The three biological replicates were prepared and lysed independently (n = 3). Samples were resolved by 10% SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membranes were blocked with TBST (20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% non-fat dry milk for 30 min and incubated overnight with primary polyclonal anti-PDIA6 (1:2,000; GeneTex, GTX33397), monoclonal primary anti-GRP78/BiP (1:2,000; Invitrogen, 1H11-1H7; lot: XI3695781) or primary monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (1:2,000; Sigma, T5168; lot: 0000242797) at 4 °C, followed by 2 h incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000; anti-mouse or anti-rabbit; Invitrogen, 31430 and 31460) in TBST. Chemiluminescence signals were detected using Immobilon western HRP substrate (Advansta) and imaged using a FusionFX imaging system (Vilber Lourmat).

To asses insulin processing in HeLa cells, the cells were transfected with pre-proinsulin (and PDIA6 constructs). After 24 h, the cells were washed with preheated 1×PBS and 4×OPTIMEM GlutaMAX (Gibco), and incubated in OPTIMEM GlutaMAX (16 h). To assess insulin processing in INS-1 cells, the cells were washed 36 h post transfection (of PDIA6 constructs only) with HBSS (Gibco) + 2.5 mM glucose (Gibco) for 1 h and subsequently incubated with HBSS + 2.5 mM glucose for 2 h. The medium was collected, spun down (10 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C) and the supernatant was precipitated by the addition of 100% trichloroacetic acid (one volume trichloroacetic acid to four volumes protein). After 10 min incubation on ice, the samples were spun down (5 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C) and washed twice with cold acetone. The dried pellet was dissolved in 30 μl Laemmli buffer by vortexing and boiling (10 min, 300 rpm, 95 °C). The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and denatured in Laemmli buffer at 65 °C for 10 min. The four biological replicates were prepared and lysed independently (n = 4). Protein levels were measured using a BCA assay (Merck) and the volumes of the precipitate and lysates were adjusted to equal lysate protein concentrations. Samples were resolved by 4–20% SDS–PAGE (BioRad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). The lysate blot was processed as described above. The blot of the secreted proteins was preblocked with TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 5 min and the samples were fixed by incubation with TBST containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. The membrane was washed in TBST, blocked with TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 30 min and incubated overnight with monoclonal anti-proinsulin (for secretion, 1:1,000; Invitrogen, MA1-83256; lot: 160454; for lysate, 1:2,000; Cell Signaling, 3014; lot: 10) in Can get signal solution (Toyobo) at 4 °C, followed by 2 h incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000; anti-mouse or anti-rabbit; Invitrogen, 31430 or 31460, respectively) in Can get signal solution. Chemiluminescence signals were detected using Immobilon western HRP substrate (Advansta) and imaged using a FusionFX imaging system (Vilber Lourmat).

HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates 24 h after transfection. After 24 h, MTT (Merck) was added at the indicated time points to a final concentration of 500 μg ml−1 and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and the crystals were dissolved in acidic (0.08 M HCl) isopropanol. The absorbance (A550nm − A690nm) was measured on a plate reader. All experiments were repeated in experimental and independent biological triplicates. Significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test (n = 9).

RNA was extracted and purified from cells using an RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was reverse-transcribed using GoScript reverse transcriptase primed with a mix of Oligo(dT)s and random hexamers (Promega). Real-time PCR was then performed using GoTaq qPCR master mix (Promega) and primers specific for sXBP1 (sXBP1, 5′-GCTGAGTCCGCAGCAGGT-3′; β-actin, 5′-CACCATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTC-3′). The expression of sXBP1 was normalized to that of β-actin. For PDIA6 WT-transfected cells, the sXBP1 levels were still below detection limit after 40 cycles of quantitative PCR and the Ct was thus set to 40 for statistical analysis. The significance was calculated from three independent biological replicates using a two-tailed Student's t-test (n = 3).

For microscopy, PDIA6–GFP (WT and 5× linker mutant)-transfected HeLa cells were plated onto coverslips 24 h before fixation. Aggresomes were visualized using the PROTEOSTAT aggresome dye following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde solution at room temperature, incubated with permeabilizing solution (1×assay buffer, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.05% Triton X-100) on ice for 30 min, incubated for 30 min with the PROTEOSTAT detection reagent at room temperature in the dark, mounted on a microscopy slide with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and sealed with nail polish.

For aggresome detection analysis by flow cytometry, PDIA6–GFP (WT and 5× linker mutant)-transfected HEK293A cells and controls were pelleted, fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized (1×assay buffer, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.05% Triton X-100), resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.05 μM EDTA) with PROTEOSTAT dye (1:1,250 dilution) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. A Fortessa flow cytometer was used to measure mCherry fluorescence (PROTEOSTAT dye) of GFP-positive cells. Data were analysed using FlowJo 10.9.0. The gating strategy is in Supplementary Fig. 2.

The BiP structural model in the ADP undocked states was obtained by homology modelling using the SWISS-MODEL server and the DnaK undocked conformation (PDB 2kho)61 as a template. The structural model of PDIA6 FL has been modelled as a chimaera of the individual domain crystal structures (domain a0, PDB: 4ef0; domain a, PDB: 4gwr; domain b, PDB: 8cpq, determined in this study). The linker connecting domain a0 and a, and the C-terminal tail were modelled as disordered based on the NMR data presented in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 3,4. The interface between the domain a0 monomers is based on the crystal structure of domain a0 (PDB: 4ef0) and confirmed by NOE contacts between the domain, as presented in Fig. 2. Importantly, the distances V75–L131 (7.3 Å), V75–L134 (11.4 Å), V75–V135 (12.7 Å) and L72–L131 (7.8 Å) within the monomer are too large to have (strong) intramolecular methyl NOE contacts, indicating that the resulting NOEs are intermolecular NOEs. The measured NOE crosspeak intensities fit to the expected intermolecular NOE intensities based on the distances calculated from the crystal structure (PDB: 4ef0; V75–L131, 4 Å; V75–L134, 4 Å; V75–L135, 7.1 Å and L72–L131, 7.5 Å). The interface between domains a and b was modelled using ESMFold62 based on the NOE contact between the domains presented in Fig. 2. The binding interface of the linker to domain b was modelled based on the experiments presented in this paper.

The following protein structures were used to compare the length of helix α4: PDB: 4ekz (PDIA1 a and a′), 2dmm (PDIA3 a′), 2dj1 (PDIA4 a0), 2dj2 (PDIA4 a), 2dj3 (PDIA4 a′), 4ef0 (PDIA6 a0) and 4gwr (PDIA6 a).

To determine the PDIA6 Ca2+ binding affinity (KD(Ca2+)), the Ca2+-dependent formation of droplets in the presence of a crowding agent was used as a direct measurable of the Ca2+ binding to PDIA6. The number of unlabelled PDIA6 droplets was quantified for a Ca2+ concentration between 100 μM and 1,000 μM from differential-interference-contrast microscopy images and fitted using nonlinear regression to the Hill equation binding model (equation (1)) to determine the KD(Ca2+).

where nc is the number of condensates and n is the Hill coefficient.

The structure model was generated with ESMFold61 for the full-length protein and manually trimmed to residues 161–419 to have a more compact, yet fully functional, construct. To generate equilibrated starting structures for the pulling simulations, each structure (WT and mutant) was placed in a dodecahedral box of TIP4 water, to which 150 mM NaCl was added, including neutralizing counterions. Following steepest descents minimization, each of the systems was equilibrated for 100 ps under a constant-pressure (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) ensemble, with position restraints applied to peptide heavy atoms throughout. Protein and non-protein atoms were coupled to separate temperature coupling baths and temperature was maintained at 300 K using the velocity rescale coupling method. Pressure was controlled using exponential relaxation pressure coupling to maintain pressure isotropically at 1.0 bar. Short-production molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for 100 ps in the absence of any restraints to relax the initial structures. All simulations were conducted using the GROMACS package (version 2024.3).

Structures at the end of each of the previous relaxed trajectories (WT and 274PPP–274GGG) were used as starting configurations for pulling simulations. To make the immobile reference for the pulling simulations, the coordinates of Cα atoms for residues 161–272 were restrained. Residues 284–419 were pulled away from the structure over 500 ps, using a spring constant of 1,000 kJ mol−1 nm−2 and a pull rate of 0.1 Å ps−1. A final centre-of-mass collective variable distance of approximately >6.0 Å was achieved. From these trajectories, snapshots were taken to generate the starting configurations for the umbrella sampling windows. A distribution of sampling windows was used, such that the window spacing was 1 Å centre-of-mass separation, and resulted in each WT and mutant case in nine windows. In each window, 1 ns of MD was performed for a total simulation time of 9 ns utilized for umbrella sampling. Analysis of results was performed with the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM).

The number of data points in each experiment is specified in the figure legends or in Supplementary Tables 2 (Fig. 5e) and 3 (microscopy images and western blots). All in-cell data are based on multiple experiments with independent biological replicates. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. A two-sided unpaired Mann–Whitney test was used for statistical analyses of the number of condensates per cell and condensate area. Statistical significance for all other analyses was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel 16.97 or GraphPad Prism 9. Details are provided in the figure legends. Where statistical comparisons were performed, specific P values are indicated on the graphs. No samples or data points were excluded. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to the conditions of the experiments during data analysis.

Most of us find it difficult to grasp the quantum world: According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, it's like observing a dance without being able to see simultaneously exactly where someone is dancing and how fast they're moving - you always must choose to focus on one. And yet, this quantum dance is far from chaotic; the dancers follow a strict choreography. In molecules, this strange behavior has another consequence: Even if a molecule should be completely frozen at absolute zero, it never truly comes to rest. The atoms it is made of perform a constant, never-ending quiet dance driven by so-called zero-point energy.

First direct measurement of correlated zero-point motion 

For a long time, these patterned zero-point movements were considered impossible to measure directly. However, scientists at Goethe University Frankfurt and partner institutions have now succeeded in doing precisely that at the world's largest X-ray laser, the European XFEL in Hamburg, Germany. They captured the "dance of the atoms" by shining a "spotlight" on individual molecules and taking snapshots of their atoms - revealing each atom's precise choreography.

Professor Till Jahnke from the Institute for Nuclear Physics at Goethe University Frankfurt and the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg explains: "The exciting thing about our work is that we were able to see that the atoms don't just vibrate individually, but that they vibrate in a coupled manner, following fixed patterns. We directly measured this behavior for the first time in individual medium-sized molecules that were also in their lowest energy state. This zero-point motion is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon that cannot be explained classically." Instead of choreography, physicists speak of vibrational modes. While the motion patterns of molecules with two or three atoms are fairly easy to follow, it quickly becomes complex with medium-sized molecules - like the studied iodopyridine, which consists of eleven atoms. Iodopyridine features a whole repertoire of 27 different vibrational modes - from ballet to tango to folk dance.

"This experiment has a long history," says Jahnke. "We originally collected the data in 2019 during a measurement campaign led by Rebecca Boll at the European XFEL, which had an entirely different goal. It wasn't until two years later that we realized we were actually seeing signs of zero-point motion. The breakthrough came through collaboration with our colleagues from theoretical physics from the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science in Hamburg. Benoît Richard and Ludger Inhester, in particular, came up with new analysis methods that elevated our data interpretation to an entirely new level. Looking back, many puzzle pieces had to come together perfectly."

Explosion reveals molecular structure

But how can you capture an image of dancing particles? Using a technique called Coulomb Explosion Imaging, molecules are triggered to undergo a controlled explosion by ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray laser pulses, allowing high-resolution images of their structure to be generated. The X-ray pulse knocks many electrons out of the molecule, causing the atoms - now positively charged - to repel each other and fly apart in a fraction of a trillionth of a second. The fragments are recorded by a special apparatus that measures their time and position of impact, enabling the reconstruction of the molecule's original structure. This COLTRIMS reaction microscope has been developed over the past decades by Goethe University's Atomic Physics group. A version tailored specifically to the European XFEL was built by Dr. Gregor Kastirke during his PhD work. Seeing the device in action is something special, Kastirke says: "Witnessing such groundbreaking results makes me feel a little proud. After all, they only come about through years of preparation and close teamwork."

New insights into the quantum world 

The results provide entirely new insights into quantum phenomena. For the first time, researchers can directly observe the complex patterns of zero-point motion in more complex molecules. These findings demonstrate the potential of the Frankfurt-developed COLTRIMS reaction microscope. "We're constantly improving our method and are already planning the next experiments," says Jahnke. "Our goal is to go beyond the dance of atoms and observe in addition the dance of electrons - a choreography that is significantly faster and also influenced by atomic motion. With our apparatus, we can gradually create real short films of molecular processes - something that was once unimaginable."

Bacterial microcompartments are protein organelles with diverse metabolic capabilities. Their functional diversity is determined by an enzymatic core that is sequestered within a structurally conserved protein shell architecture. Segregation of protein cargo into the bacterial microcompartment is enabled by encapsulation peptides, which are short helical domains fused to core proteins through a disordered linker. Here, we investigate how encapsulation peptides drive multicomponent cargo assembly into biomolecular condensates. In vitro experiments supported by molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the importance of both conserved hydrophobic packing and electrostatic interactions in stabilizing trimeric encapsulation peptide bundles. Topological rearrangements of encapsulation peptide domains can drive programmable liquid- or gel-like partitioning in vitro and in vivo. This partitioning is found to be encapsulation peptide-specific, modular, and can co-assemble at least three fluorescent reporters. In summary, we describe the molecular features necessary to drive biomolecular condensation using a widespread peptide tag. This work can serve as a blueprint for implementing encapsulation peptide biotechnology across diverse applications.

Bacteria are increasingly appreciated to dynamically organize their internal components1,2. One important strategy for bacterial organization is the segregation of their metabolism into organelle-like architectures, which can be found as lipid or protein membrane-bounded or unbounded (i.e., condensates)3. A widely studied prokaryotic organelle, called bacterial microcompartment (BMC), consists of protein polyhedra made of an outer protein shell which encases enzymatic cargo within4. These organelles are widespread across taxa5 and can serve catabolic (called metabolosomes) or anabolic (called carboxysome) roles. BMCs have been proposed as a promising resource of structural (scaffolds, nanoreactors) and functional (substrate channeling, toxic chemical sequestration) motifs for their use in biotechnology6,7,8,9,10. Recent work has connected the biogenesis of some bacterial organelles to phase-separated intermediates11,12,13,14. This link ties protein condensation phenomena (specifically through liquid-liquid phase separation mechanisms [LLPS])14 to numerous critical cell functions like carbon fixation, cell division, and organelle positioning1,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.

The early stages of BMC biogenesis have been suggested to make use of LLPS mechanisms, for example, in carboxysomes24. In β-carboxysomes, the scaffold CcmM first nucleates liquid-like droplet formation12,17,25 of itself, Rubisco, and CcmN (i.e., procarboxysome)26 prior to shell recruitment by an encapsulation peptide (EP) in the C-terminus of CcmN27,28. EPs are terminal amphipathic helices, typically 18 residues in length, fused to cargo by a poorly conserved disordered linker29,30,31. The hydrophobic residues along one face of EPs have been shown to be a common motif critical for successful microcompartment packaging32. This arrangement, as a single binding domain, does not strictly adhere to a canonical stickers and spacers (interaction motifs and linkers) framework commonly observed in biomolecular condensation33. Metabolosomes have been similarly tied to using LLPS to guide assembly in vivo34, presumably through their EPs, resulting in the aggregation of protein cargo to each other and to the interior of the microcompartment shell. Notably, α-carboxysomes have been found to likewise utilize liquid intermediates to facilitate assembly by local condensation of the disordered scaffolds CsoS2, Rubisco, and shell components to trigger an assembly cascade without an identifiable EP13,18. EPs have been observed to form in vivo aggregates35,36 but have not been explicitly studied for their ability to trigger biomolecular condensation of fused cargo31 for biotechnological applications.

In this work, we study the self-assembly and condensation propensity of EPs. First, we demonstrate that the model EP from the aldehyde dehydrogenase (PduP) from Salmonella enterica fused to an mNeonGreen cargo reporter can trigger phase separation of fused cargo in vitro. Additional protein components can be assembled into condensed droplets if they contain an EP. In vitro experiments supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate the importance of both conserved hydrophobic packing and electrostatic interactions in stabilizing trimeric EP bundles. Topological rearrangements of EP domains can exert control over liquid- or gel-like partitioning in vitro and in vivo. This partitioning is found to be EP-specific, modular, and can co-assemble at least three fluorescent reporters into liquid-like foci in live bacteria. In sum, we provide a blueprint of the molecular features necessary to drive biomolecular condensation using the widespread EP peptide tag. This work paints a drastically different view of EP domains and demonstrates a condensation system for the assembly of disparate metabolic machinery in bacteria.

Our investigation started with the model PduP EP from the Salmonella enterica propanediol utilization (Pdu) BMC. This EP has been established to be important in cargo packaging within BMC shells30 and known to exhibit an α-helical structure by NMR and circular dichroism31,37. We fused this 18-residue EP, along with its native 18-residue linker (Fig. 1A), to the N-terminus of mNeonGreen38 (EP-mNG) to act as a reporter system and purified it alongside wild-type mNG. Biomolecular condensation is commonly triggered by adding molecular crowding agents to samples39. As such, we titrated polyethylene glycol (average MN 2000; PEG2k) into solutions of mNG and EP-mNG at 20 µM and measured sample turbidity as a proxy for aggregation. Turbidity is commonly used to assess biomolecular condensation as particles, like condensates, refract light, and the resulting signal serves as an indirect measure of their number and size40. We observed no changes in turbidity for mNG while EP-mNG turbidity increased in a sigmoidal fashion with an inflection at 17.2% ± 0.6% (w/v) PEG2k (Fig. 1B). We then chose 20% (w/v) PEG2k as a constant and assayed protein concentration for turbidity changes (Fig. 1C). Again, mNG turbidity remained constant while EP-mNG increased with an approximate inflection at 33.1 µM ± 0.4 µM.

A The model EP from PduP is an amphipathic, 18-residue α-helix fused to the amino terminus of the protein cargo by a disordered linker. The residues depicted in the helix representation are shown below it. Turbidity assays are used to assess particle formation from EP fusions as a function of B molecular crowder PEG2k and C protein concentration. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 4 replicates. The arrow in (C) indicate the samples taken for imaging. D Confocal imaging reveals the presence of condensates in solution for samples containing EP fused cargo. E Photobleaching experiments show minimal/no fluorescence recovery.

The above data suggested that the EP tag can result in particle formation in solution. However, turbidity assays cannot differentiate between cargo aggregation and condensation41. We investigated this by imaging turbid samples (Fig. 1C, arrow) with laser scanning confocal microscopy. Imaging showed no structures formed by mNG itself (Fig. 1D). In contrast, EP-mNG was able to spontaneously demix and form spherical droplets in solution (alongside some amorphous material), which is suggestive of phase separation coupled to percolation (PSCP)42. Biomolecular condensates that form through PSCP should display changes in their viscoelastic material properties as a function of time42. We tested the material state of these droplets by performing a fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment to monitor the recovery of fluorescence43. If liquid-like, droplets will experience quick recovery of fluorescence (typically <60 s timescale) in bleached zones owing to rapid exchange and equilibration of bleached and unbleached molecules. The droplets formed by EP-mNG, however, did not experience significant recovery over a qualitative 2-min sampling (Fig. 1E), indicating slow internal dynamic rearrangements indicative of a gel-like state. The droplets were further commonly observed in arrested fusion states that never resolved (Supplemental Fig. 1A) and likewise reminiscent of gelation. We also found that if our usual order of component addition was inverted (protein from a concentration stock added last) then these mid-fusion assemblies or larger aggregates, which appear as numerous unresolved droplets, were more commonly observed (Supplemental Fig. 1B). These data suggest that these assemblies undergo rapid networking which cannot sufficiently resolve into distinct droplets when triggered from a concentrated protein stock. This, and their inability to recover quickly from bleaching, suggests that EPs enable PSCP to form physical microgels and that transitions in their viscoelastic properties happen on relatively short timescales.

We next sought to understand if EP-driven condensates can include more than one component. We tested this by mixing purified mNeonGreen (G) and mScarlet-I344 (R) either with (G1 or R1) or without (G0 or R0) an EP fusion and measured the results by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), turbidity, and imaging methods (Fig. 2A–C, respectively). Mixed samples with no EPs (G0R0) were unable to produce a significant FRET or turbidity signal and confocal imaging found no condensates in solution. Samples which included an EP only on mNeonGreen (G1R0) showed a slight decrease in FRET signal and high turbidity. Imaging results indicated that the turbidity was a result of mNeonGreen condensates with a weak outer halo of mScarlet-I3. The slightly lower FRET signal was likely due to mNeonGreen condensation in solution, which limited mScarlet-I3 interactions. Lastly, samples with EPs on both proteins (G1R1) produced the highest FRET signal and turbidity equal to G1R0 samples. Confocal imaging showed that G1R1 condensates were formed from co-assembled mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I3, which agrees with FRET data. EP-dependent co-assembly was also tested with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I3 cargoes fused to different EPs (Fig. 2D). Here, mNeonGreen fused to the EP of PduD (part of the signature enzyme complex PduCDE in the Pdu BMC)45 and mScarlet-I3 fused to the EP of PduP were mixed together to test their co-assembly. Microscopy shows that the PduD EP can condense mNeonGreen alone and support co-assembly with the PduP EP. Together, these data demonstrate that different EPs can drive specific homo- and heterotypic co-assembly of multiple cargoes in vitro.

A Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to assess assembly of a donor mNeonGreen (G) and acceptor mScarlet-I3 (R) with (1) or without (0) N-terminal EP fusions. FRET was calculated by subtracting the emission of mNeonGreen by itself at the peak acceptor emission wavelength (590 nm). Significant FRET only occurred when both cargoes have encapsulation peptides. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 3 replicates. B Turbidity assays of samples confirm particle formation only when at least one cargo had an EP. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 3 replicates. C Confocal imaging showed that specific co-assembly of mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I3 only occurred when they both had EP fused to their N-termini. D Similarly, co-assembly is observed with heterotypic mixes of EPs, with mNeonGreen fused to the EP from PduD (green text) condensing with mScarlet-I3 when it is fused to the EP of PduP (red text). In both (C) and (D), mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I3 were excited with the 488 and 561 nm laser, respectively.

Our model system gives us an opportunity to screen EP self-assembly through simple turbidity measurements. EPs have traditionally been thought to act solely through relatively non-specific hydrophobic packing interactions predominantly along their apolar face (Fig. 1A)32,46. We confirmed this by performing multiscale (integrated coarse-grained and fully atomic representation) MD simulations by inspecting the dimerization process of two EP helices. Using the Martini 2.2 force field, self-assembled structures were backmapped into their correspondent fully atomic representation and equilibrated at microsecond range using the charmm36m force field47,48. A residue contact map of tightly associated helices agrees with the notion that hydrophobic residues, for instance I10, form the closest and most abundant contacts between bound helices (Fig. 3A, black boxes) and have been previously implicated with being critical for cargo encapsulation within microcompartment shells but not self-assembly32. A closer look at simulated EPs also identified an antiparallel salt bridge network formed by E7 of one helix and R11 from the other spaced by exactly one helical repeat (Fig. 3B). We tested the importance of these residues by making several point mutations and compared their condensation propensity as a function of NaCl concentration (to disturb the salt bridge) and protein concentration. The mutations we chose to assay are R11K (conserved mutation), R11A (removal of salt bridge), E7D (side chain one carbon shorter), I10S (disrupt hydrophobic core), and a double E7R/R11E mutant which swaps the relative orientation of the salt bridge.

A A distance matrix of two assembled PduP EPs shows that the closest interactions are from hydrophobic residues (black outlines) along the apolar face. B Computational models of EP dimers suggest that they prefer an antiparallel orientation, which results in a salt bridge network between E7 and R11. The heteroatom distances are represented by dashed lines with distances (in Angstroms) calculated in PyMol. Several mutants were made, and their condensation propensities were screened by measuring turbidity as a function of C NaCl for electrostatic screening and D total protein concentration. These data demonstrate that EP self-assembly is sensitive to ions and condensation can be negatively impacted by disrupting the salt bridge and hydrophobic core. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 4 replicates.

A salt titration assay confirmed that all EP mutants, to varying extents, resulted in turbidity and that turbidity is negatively impacted by increasing salt (Fig. 3C). At low salt saturation, the R11K and E7R/R11E mutants performed similarly to the wild-type PduP EP, confirming that functionality is conserved. However, as expected by its hydrogen bond strength, high salt concentration had slightly more effect on the R11K mutant. The E7D mutant, which may simply weaken the salt bridge, was less robust than the R11K mutant but more robust than the R11A mutant, which completely removed that interaction. Further, the inflection points of all salt bridge mutants were shifted left towards lower concentration (140 mM for WT versus 80-100 mM for mutants), revealing a heightened salt sensitivity. Among these, the double E7R/R11E mutant demonstrated the greatest dependence on NaCl concentration, suggesting that the relative orientation influences assembly and other factors may be important. Confocal imaging of the wild-type PduP design shows that increasing salt results in reorganization of droplet-like condensates into aggregates, which then dissolve at a high enough concentration (Supplemental Fig. 2).

These trends were further reflected when titrating protein concentrations (Fig. 3D). Again, WT and R11K performed similarly, while salt bridge mutants showed an intermediate self-assembly propensity. The I10S mutant had no assembly propensity. The double E7R/R11E mutant performed similarly to WT, indicating that, under these assay conditions, the salt bridge is sufficiently recapitulated in a reverse orientation and promotes condensation. These results indicate that the computationally predicted antiparallel salt bridge is real and impacts self-assembly strength of EP domains. The most critical residue we tested, however, is I10 within the hydrophobic core.

Most BMCs use EPs to accumulate cargo within their shells29. This includes β-, but not α-, carboxysomes, which use the C-terminus of the protein CcmN to drive associations between CcmM-RbcLS coacervates and the shell28. The C-terminal extension of CcmN proteins have been regarded as EPs because they literally link cargo-shell interactions. This is a very different arrangement for cargo inclusion interactions compared to metabolosomes, wherein EPs typically exist fused to enzymatic cargo as opposed to CcmN, which acts as a discrete intermediary between enzymatic cargo and the shell. Sequence comparisons of several candidate metabolosome and CcmN EPs showed that metabolosome EPs largely conserve the salt bridge related residues we have identified with a sequence spacing corresponding to one helical repeat (Fig. 4A). The EPs of CcmN, however, do not carry these sequence elements. We investigated this further by screening the ability of different EPs fused to mNeonGreen to trigger biomolecular condensation of this cargo. In addition to our PduP model, we also selected PduD (swapped charges, similar to our E7R/R11E PduP mutant), PduE (reportedly not sufficient for cargo encapsulation45), EutC (different BMC), and CcmN (from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942)26,28. All metabolosome EPs (PduDEP, EutC) were found to result in cargo condensation to varying degrees (Fig. 4B). PduD was the most robust, followed by PduP, EutC, and finally PduE. Meanwhile, the CcmN EP was not able to trigger significant cargo aggregation. Protein droplets were likewise found to exist in all metabolosome EP samples, albeit in co-existence with fibril-like clusters in the case of PduE and EuC, but not with CcmN (Fig. 4C). These self-assembly trends were likewise recapitulated with in vivo overexpression, with CcmN unable to drive cargo partitioning (Supplemental Fig. 2A, B).

A An alignment of several EPs revealed that metabolosome EPs carry oppositely charged residues separated by one helical repeat. These elements are not maintained in carboxysomal CcmN sequences. Basic residues are colored blue, acidic are red, and apolar are green. B A turbidity assay demonstrated that these sequence differences result in CcmN being unable to condense cargo under conditions that trigger condensation for metabolosome EPs. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 4 replicates. C Aliquots from turbid samples (arrow in B) were imaged with confocal microscopy. Spherical droplets were observed in all metabolosome samples, to varying extents (arrows) and most clearly defined in PduP and PduD samples. CcmN did not drive droplet structures.

Our computational calculations demonstrated that EPs can form a specific salt bridge when paired in an antiparallel orientation (Fig. 3B). This association, however, splays open the hydrophobic core between the helices, indicating additional association capacity. We experimentally tested this by fusing serial repeats of the PduP EP and its native linker (EP1, EP2, EP3) to the N-terminus of an mNeonGreen cargo (Supplemental Fig. 3A). More repeats were not investigated due to issues cloning higher copy numbers, likely owing to the repetitious nature, despite our best efforts to mitigate sequence repeats. We hypothesized that this synthetic arrangement of intrinsic valency, mimicking a more classic stickers and spacers arrangement, will either (1) increase binding capacity linearly or (2) form intramolecular arrangements (due to proximity and connectivity) that self-quench binding capacity and lead to diminishing returns. We assayed these designs for self-assembly propensity and found that the EP2 design moderately outperformed the EP1 while the EP3 performed similarly or slightly worse than the EP2 (Fig. 5A). Specifically, curve inflections for the EP1, EP2, and EP3 designs were found to be (in µM) 33.1 ± 0.4, 15.5 ± 1.0, and 19.7 ± 1.9, respectively. The morphology of all samples was also similar, and all shared the ability to form droplets across a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 5B). We note that these images alone could not establish a threshold concentration for condensation, which may lay presumably in the low micromolar to high nanomolar range depending on assay conditions. Here, increasing protein concentration increased both the size and quantity of droplets from all designs. These designs were similarly assayed for response to PEG2k concentration with identical trends observed (Supplemental Fig. 4A). These results suggest intramolecular valencies above two may quench additional associations (Supplemental Fig. 4B–D), thereby providing evidence for associations greater than a dimer.

A Turbidity was measured as a function of protein concentration for synthetic EP designs where EPs were fused in serial to the cargo N-terminus. Additive copies had diminishing results. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 4 replicates. B Despite differences in sequence topology and condensation propensity, confocal imaging showed all designs formed similar condensates in solution across a range of concentrations (in µM). C MD simulations were conducted with two, three, four, or five EP helices to study their preferred assembly state as a function of exposed hydrophobic surface area and root mean square deviation (rmsd). Simulations with two or three EPs coalesced to one basin with low rmsd, while those with four or five showed two dominant populations. D Structural analysis of these basins revealed that EP assembly is associated with salt bridge interactions along their solvent exposed surfaces and maximize hydrophobic packing.

To understand the higher order association mechanism, we resorted to MD calculations to analyze the saturation binding capacity of EPs. In addition to dimeric association, we also tested simulations of 3, 4, or 5 associated PduP helices with the enhanced coarse-grained (CG) approach to access information on systems we could not experimentally create. The equilibrated CG configurations were transformed to atomic resolution and re-equilibrated at microsecond range, data which is summarized as a function of both positional variance (RMSD) and exposed hydrophobic surface area (Fig. 5C). Simulations with 3 helices coalesced towards one single basin composed of two overlapping species in parallel and antiparallel configurations, with the orientation of one helix being swapped between the two. These configurations closely align structurally (Supplemental Fig. 5A), agreeing with the low RMSD and exposed hydrophobic surface area (Supplemental Fig. 5B), but show slightly different salt bridge networks between E7, R11, and E16 (Supplemental Fig. 5C). Meanwhile, configurations composed of 4 or 5 helices formed two basins. Representative configurations for the different basins are provided in Fig. 5D, highlighting the helical association. In particular, the 3-helix configuration remained very stable and formed a tightly packed bundle, a result which was observed in four different replicates. In contrast, other stoichiometries (4 and 5 helices) led to unstable bundles that transition between configurations. In either case a trimeric bundle was observed in basin 2 which led to a single or dimeric helix that is unstably associated (Fig. 5D). Dimerization also leads to a configuration that was stabilized by a series of hydrogen bonds (as described before); however, the abundance of exposed hydrophobic core makes this configuration rather unstable and hypothesized as a metastable intermediate structure towards trimerization (Supplemental Fig. 6).

We further investigated whether trimerization would lead towards higher ordered configurations by self-assembling stable trimeric helices at different concentrations in silico. Aided by the latest Martini 3 force field49, we characterized the self-assembling propensity of EPs in the trimeric configuration (summarized in Supplemental Fig. 7). Even using high peptide concentrations (20 µM), our data indicates that trimeric bundles (with no cargo attachment) barely associate in solution. In fact, total peptide concentration must be at least one order of magnitude higher to observe larger assemblies. These insights led us to conclude that optimal trimeric bundles are expected to initially guide the association of EP domains, while localization would further enhance the interaction of these bundles, cooperatively affecting the condensation process.

The lack of a conclusive condensation enhancement by the EP3 construct in our experiments (Fig. 5A) led us to hypothesize that self-quenching may reduce the interaction of the tandem repeat. CG simulations were performed comparing EP2 and EP3 designs which show that covalently connected EP sequences can self-interact, effectively reducing the number of available binding sites for network extension (Supplemental Fig. 8). The computed equilibrium between different configurations indicates that the EP3 design can self-bind to the extent of completely closing the number of available binding sites, partially explaining the condensation results of our tandem sequence designs. The EP2 construct would always have additional networking capacity even if the domains intramolecularly dimerize (Supplemental Figs. 4B–D and 8). The EP3 design, in contrast, may have one more interaction site available, however, the self-blocking can potentially hinder further network extension.

Our in vitro model system thus far has included strictly monomeric proteins, which differs from those natively tagged with EPs and may not reflect physiological reality. For instance, PduP is a homotetramer50 and PduCDE, which has EPs on PduD and PduE, is a dimer of trimers51. We investigated the effects of binding site valency by again implementing our serial EP designs fused to a monomeric mNeonGreen against a tetrameric E2-Crimson52 (hereafter Crimson) to differentiate between intrinsic and emergent valency, respectively (Fig. 6A). We sought to explore the functional differences between these two arrangements in vivo to gain a proper understanding of EP-driven assembly in living cells. Accordingly, we overexpressed these designs in Escherichia coli and used laser scanning confocal microscopy to image their phenotypes in vivo (Fig. 6B). Both the wild-type mNeonGreen and Crimson showed a uniform fluorescence inside of cells. Meanwhile, increasing the EP copy number on mNeonGreen similarly increased the segregation of multiple (typically 2+) mNeonGreen cargo foci within the cells. This effect was also observed with a single EP copy fused to Crimson cargo, which formed single elongated foci. We quantified this effect by calculating a partition ratio (the intensity of background subtracted foci divided by non-foci areas of the same cell) which is analogous to how much denser foci are compared to the dilute areas of the cell (Fig. 6C). Quantification in this way gives the mNeonGreen and Crimson controls a median partition ratio close to 1.0, indicating uniform fluorescence distribution throughout the cell. This analysis further shows that, in contrast to our in vitro tests, additive copies of EP domains increased partitioning up to ninefold over the mNeonGreen control for the EP3 design. This effect was exacerbated in the EP-Crimson design, which was able to achieve a median partition ratio of over 500, making it nearly all-or-nothing. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of valency in driving cargo networking and that our serial repeat design likely prefers intermolecular, and not intramolecular, associations in vivo. We believe these differences compared to our in vitro experiments may stem from the dense cytoplasmic milieu inhibiting specific intramolecular associations and promoting intermolecular networking.

A We tested the cargo partitioning performance of serial EP designs on a monomeric mNeonGreen cargo (intrinsic valency) and on a tetrameric E2-Crimson cargo (emergent valency). The mNeonGreen structure is from PDB 5LTR and E2-Crimson is represented by a tetrameric DsRed 1GGX. B Overexpression of designs for intrinsic valency showed that increasing valency increased partitioning ability. The emergently valent EP1-Crimson showed elongated single foci. Arrows denote several example foci within each sample. C Partitioning was calculated by the quotient of background subtracted foci signal over non-foci signal. This analysis confirmed that partitioning increases with additional EP domains and that emergent valency outcompetes intrinsic in all cases. Medians are denoted within each sample with the black bar. **** denotes p < 0.0001 given by an upaired t-test. D Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showed that the EP2 and EP3 designs differed in their recovery rates, but both were liquid-like. Standard deviations are represented by the infill. E FRAP was calculated by normalizing the background subtracted (yellow circle) intensity of bleached foci (red arrow) to another unbleached foci (white arrow) within the same cell. Scale bar, 1 µm.

We next assayed the material state of EP-driven foci within cells by measuring in vivo FRAP43. Here, single foci within cells were bleached with a laser pulse and their fluorescence recovery was monitored with 0.5 s intervals. FRAP experiments were focused on comparing the relative differences between EP2 and EP3 designs (Fig. 6D) due to quick recovery of EP0 samples and EP1 foci being hard to find. FRAP was calculated by normalizing the background (yellow circle, Fig. 6E) subtracted fluorescence of bleaching foci (red arrow) to an unbleached focus (white arrow) to see when separate foci equilibrated. The EP2 and EP3 designs were able to achieve full re-equilibration relative to unbleached foci within 2 min and with half-times of 16.2 s ± 8.5 s and 27.2 s ± 14.6 s, respectively. We note that this is slower than recovery of free fluorescent protein, which is on the order of a few seconds53. This contrasted drastically with results from cells expressing EP-Crimson, which demonstrated a linear and incomplete recovery profile within this timeframe, indicative of a gel-like state (Supplemental Fig. 4)22,23,43. The relatively large errors may stem from different distances between bleached and unbleached foci within cells, therefore leading to longer diffusion distances. Despite this, the recovery curves of EP2- and EP3-mNG were significantly different (p < 0.001). This experiment alone cannot determine if the difference between the EP2 and EP3 designs stem from diffusion rate differences (EP3 is larger and may migrate slower) or due to slight changes in their condensed material states. However, it would make sense that the EP3 does equilibrate slower than EP2. The EP3 design likely forms more intermolecular contacts to shift equilibria, a function of on and off rates, as informed by its increased partition ratio and thereby slowing equilibration. These results demonstrated that EP-driven condensation in bacteria was liquid-like in contrast to our in vitro results; and in equilibrium with the excluded cytosol, and not inclusion bodies, which have been demonstrated to not recover during similar experimentation43. Further, topological rearrangements of EPs can be used to encode for different cytosolic behavior.

Overexpression of a single protein fused to the PduP EP can partition it between a condensed and dilute phase in vivo. However, more complex arrangements exist naturally, and multicomponent systems would be desired synthetically. We first tested the ability of a single mNeonGreen cargo to partition when co-expressed equally (assumed from ribosomal binding sites) with mScarlet-I3 and mTagBFP254. Designs were made with mNeonGreen encoding for up to three EP repeats and given a nomenclature based on the gene ordering and number of EP repeats (Fig. 7A, top). For instance, a design with two repeats only on mNeonGreen is named G2R0B0 (for green with two EPs, red with zero, blue with zero). Constructs were overexpressed and mNeonGreen partitioning was calculated as before. The general trend of more EP repeats leading to greater partitioning was again observed (Fig. 7B, C). However, the effect was muted compared to the single-expression designs, which we suspect stemmed from a competition for resources between the three proteins during expression. That is, the competition may have lowered the effective expression, and therefore concentration, of EP domains and reduced mNeonGreen fluorescence was observed again, confirming the specificity. In addition, the G3R0B0 expressing cells also reveal dark spots in the red and blue scans where the mNeonGreen appeared to localize, suggesting exclusion of non-EP tagged proteins.

A Synthetic operons were designed with three different fluorescent cargos of mNeonGreen, mScarlet-I3, and mTagBFP2 to test specific single and multicomponent partitioning. These designs were given a nomenclature based on the gene order and number of EP domains fused to that cargo. Here, EP repeat elements are signified by white rounded rectangles and ribosomal binding sites by gray lines. B Overexpression of designs expressing EP domains only fused to mNeonGreen showed only green components in foci formed. C As in the single-protein designs, more EP domains resulted in increased partitioning of the EP cargo. D Fusing EP domains to all cargo resulted in their co-assembly into condensed “zebra-striped” bands within the cell. Calculating the partitioning of these cargoes either (E) separately or F combined again showed that additive copies enhance combinatorial cargo partitioning. For all plots, n = 100 cells and the median partition ratios are denoted.

Next, we added in a series of equal repeats of EP tags to all three fluorescent proteins to encourage multicomponent assembly (Fig. 7A, bottom). Confocal imaging of designs again confirmed that G0R0B0 showed no signs of visual foci (condensation or aggregation) (Fig. 7D). Calculating the partition ratio likewise gave values of near 1.0 (Fig. 7E). We also calculated a summed partition ratio (Fig. 7F) which is the sum of all background subtracted foci signals divided by the sum of the background subtracted cellular background. For the G0R0B0 design, this value again came to 1.0, indicating no partitioning without EPs. Noticeable partitioning began to occur with the G1R1B1 designs (Fig. 7D), which correlated with increased partitioning of the individual (Fig. 7E) and total (Fig. 7F) components. The partitioning becomes even more pronounced in cells expressing the G2R2B2 designs, with cell exhibiting a highly overlapping zebra-strip patterning (Fig. 7D). The individual partitioning of components within the G2R2B2 expressing cells was not equal (Fig. 7E) but followed the same trends as the G1R1B1, suggesting that the characteristics of the individual proteins themselves can influence partitioning, as we found that mScarlet-I3 cargo shows a moderately increased EP-dependent partitioning ability compared to mNeonGreen (Supplemental Fig. 10). However, the total partitioning continued to increase (Fig. 7F) and suggests that the total sum, or concentration, of EP domains drives overall partitioning.

This study focused on defining the ability of EP domains to drive self-condensation of fused cargo proteins. We found that EPs resulted in cargo partitioning both in vivo and in vitro using predictive computational simulations and wet lab experiments. This self-assembly depended on hydrophobic packing and salt bridge interactions. These interactions sum to a preference and specificity for trimeric associations. The sequence determinants are conserved among metabolosome EPs but not CcmN from carboxysomes, resulting in CcmN's inability to promote self-condensation. Further, cargo partitioning was entirely modular and solely dependent on the inclusion of the EP domain both in vitro and in vivo.

Our data elucidates design principles for how EPs self-assemble. Prior work had found that the hydrophobic core is critical to encapsulation within microcompartment shells32, and we confirm that same propensity applies for EP self-assembly too. In addition, we discern previously unidentified salt bridges that also stabilize EP self-assembly. These salt bridges can form in a multitude of arrangements - our MD simulations suggest a preference for trimeric associations for the PduP EP. Salt bridge formation can form between various residues, including E7 and R11, in both parallel and antiparallel configurations. In agreement with the MD calculations, our in vitro data showed that, among the several PduP EP mutants we screened, I10 was the most critical residue in enabling condensation. Supported by the proposed trimeric packing mechanism, mutation of the central isoleucine nearly removed all condensation ability, while disruptions to salt bridge related residues only moderately decreased condensation propensity and demonstrate that salt bridge formation alone is not sufficient to drive EP associations. As such, we propose that EP trimerization is initially enhanced by non-specific hydrophobic packing, which then enables accessory salt bridge formation for further stability and specificity. However, EPs themselves are not sufficient for condensation alone at the concentrations we experimentally validated (Supplemental Fig. 7). Rather, we believe the trimeric bundles initially guide protein association to develop a high local concentration, which further enhances their interaction, cooperatively promoting the condensation process. These findings refines conventional notions where EPs are regarded as any short amphipathic α-helices separated from cargo by a flexible and poorly conserved linker within a microcompartment context29,30. Instead, we identify sequence elements that guides specific higher order networking.

We tested the self-assembly of several different commonly cited EPs from PduD, PduE, PduP, EutC, and CcmN28,30,45,55,56,57. We were motived by the notion that β-carboxysome EPs (encoded on CcmN) act strictly as intermediaries between the procarboxysome and the shell, while metabolosome EPs (encoded on PduDEP, EutC) reportedly act as a single module to aggregate and encapsulate cargo. Further, CcmN is present in very low copy numbers in β-carboxysomes58 while metabolosome EPs dominate interior interactions between themselves and the shell59. We noted that the sequence motifs in metabolosome EPs found to be important were missing from CcmN (Fig. 4A). We provide experimental evidence that the CcmN EP does not result in clear condensation under the same conditions as metabolosome EPs (Fig. 4B), which is congruent with its physiological role as a low-occupancy tether26,58. Our imaging also demonstrates metabolosome EPs can broadly trigger biomolecular condensation of fused cargo (Fig. 4C). This data makes us believe that, while the CcmN EP may be able to guide cargo encapsulation into synthetic β-carboxysome shells60, it cannot be used to guide robust cargo packaging alone since it lacks the ability to self-assemble. Using metabolosome EPs, in contrast, would likely be a more robust packaging strategy for building synthetic microcompartments or shell-free enzyme partitions. EPs are still an apt name for both metabolosome and β-carboxysome EPs given their ability to package cargo within BMCs. However, a sub-categorization of “assembly peptides” may be more appropriate for metabolosome EPs, which have a second role in self-assembly and could better reflect their functional diversity. In any case, an updated and more rigorous bioinformatic investigation into EP domains to better grasp their functional landscape is warranted.

Subtle differences also exist within metabolosome EPs. We observed that all our selected EPs could trigger biomolecular condensation, but the success varied (Fig. 4B). The EP from PduD is found to be the most robust, followed by PduP, EutC, and PduE. This agrees with recent observations that PduCDE, led by PduD EP, triggers hierarchical assembly of accessory cargo components in Pdu BMCs34. Importantly, comparing the EPs from PduD and PduP (as well as our E7R/R11E mutant) shows that the relative positioning of oppositely charged residues can be swapped as long as they maintain a sequence distance of one helical repeat. Still, other residues not explicitly tested in this work may also contribute to EP condensation. For instance, our MD calculations identified that E16 of the PduP EP may help to stabilize bundles in combinations with E7 and R11 (Supplemental Fig. 5). This notion is tentatively supported by our PduP E7R/R11E mutant, which would create at least one electrostatic clash (Fig. 5D) that may explain its heightened salt sensitivity (Fig. 3C). Further, the E16 position is not conserved among metabolosome EPs (Fig. 4A) and correlates with their condensation phenotypes. For instance, PduD and PduP have an acidic residue at that position while EutC, with weaker condensation strength, has a polar serine. The weakest EP we tested, from PduE, has an acidic residue at that position. This may also explain why EutC and PduE form more fibril like structures alongside some condensates (Fig. 4C). Additionally, the weak ability of the PduE EP to trigger self-condensation mirrors its prior described inability to package cargo within microcompartments and that these two functions may be related45. While our data presented cannot explicitly explain the differences between different EPs, we speculate that, in addition to specific residues like E16, it may also relate to helical stability by flanking residues. For instance, circular dichroism of synthetic produced PduD and PduP EPs has shown that the PduD is more helical in conformation37. A more stable helix could increase the entropic contribution during binding as we have observed in simulations on the PduP EP. As such, rationally designing stable helices, in conjunction with the critical sequence elements we identify, may provide a strategy for producing non-native EPs with tunable properties32.

One surprising finding was that the organization of EP valency (intrinsic versus emergent) drastically changes cargo partitioning and can mediate their material state in vivo. Intrinsic valency refers to when a molecule has more than one binding site encoded within that molecule, while emergent valency arises from the assembly of multiple subunits, thereby increasing the number of binding sites per molecule (diagramed in Supporting Fig. 4B–E)42,61. Serial additions of EPs onto monomeric mNeonGreen (intrinsic valency) resulted in fluid foci with moderate partitioning abilities, while a single EP on tetrameric Crimson (emergent valency) turbocharged partitioning and significantly lowered liquidity, demonstrated by dramatically slower photobleaching recovery in vivo. Our EP-Crimson design exemplifies emergent valency that is more reflective of all characterized EP fused enzymes. These findings suggest that BMC cargoes, which largely demonstrate emergent valency, can self-nucleate at a low saturation concentration and sequester nearly all cargo components during biogenesis. In native instances, the size of these assemblies may be determined by the co-expression of distinct shell proteins playing a kinetic race to truncate the growing cargo globule62,63. In the propanediol microcompartment specifically, the shell factors PduABK have all been strongly linked to cargo packaging with interactions supported along their interior-presenting convex surfaces31,37,59,64,65,66. Cargo valency and EP domain topology may be key considerations when packaging non-native cargoes to ensure robust network formation in addition to shell targeting and packaging. While any one single EP does not adhere to the canonical stickers and spacers architecture61, higher order cargo oligomers (dimers, tetramers) act as an emergent topological mimic thereof. In addition, we cannot disregard that an in vivo environment would modulate the self-assembly properties due to a higher viscosity of the intracellular environment, which may explain the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo behaviors.

In addition to valency effects derived from protein quaternary structure, which exacerbate EP network formation (Supplemental Fig. 5E), the biophysical features of cargo subunits themselves may also influence condensation. For instance, we found that mScarlet-I3 cargo regularly displays a higher partitioning ability than mNeonGreen cargo in vivo (Supplemental Fig. 10), despite both being noted to be strictly monomeric with low aggregation tendencies67. However, increased localized concentration (leading to condensation) is a driving force for non-specific protein interactions, a mechanism which we proposed is exacerbated by the non-covalently crosslinking of EPs68. We do note that EPs are found on a variety of enzymes with different quaternary states, biophysical features, and biochemical roles29. Indeed, the history of synthetically implementing EP biotechnology in both shell-free and shell-bound systems argues in favor of their broad application for assembling diverse cargoes36,69. These findings are congruent with the natural role of EPs as a modular assembly peptide5.

Our experimentation shows that salt bridge interactions, while not the predominant factor, help guide EP condensation. Knocking out the salt bridge makes cargo condensation both more sensitive to NaCl and lowers overall condensation propensity (Fig. 4C, D). These results suggest that EP-driven cargo nucleation events may be environmentally responsive to cellular conditions, including ions. This would not be without precedent, as biomolecular condensates have been found to be regulated by metabolites, ions, and environmental conditions22,70,71. Additionally, condensates themselves are recently being appreciated as also selecting for metabolites and small molecules72. Taken together, these notions suggest that prometabolosomes and EP-driven condensates could partition, and be influenced by, specific cofactors and metabolites during biogenesis73,74,75. Environmental responsiveness to redox status has been observed for CcmM-driven condensation12 in β-carboxysome biogenesis but further investigations for metabolosomes are warranted.

There is great interest in developing small peptides that self-assemble into biomolecular condensates. Synthetic peptides have been developed with this in mind and have well-defined phase diagrams and controllable properties. However, many of these are intrinsically disordered, heavily utilize π–π stacking interactions, and/or rely on non-specific mechanisms for protein co-envelopment, which mechanistically differs from the EP domain76,77,78. Other synthetic and naturally implemented condensation systems rely on accessory partners for network formation, particularly nucleic acids79,80,81,82,83,84. These characteristics apply equally when also just considering naturally occurring systems in bacteria1. The closest analog to our knowledge is the PopZ microdomain, which has been adapted into the fully modular and tunable PopTag23,85. Still, the EP domain is more compact than the PopTag and serves dual roles in cargo self-assembly and microcompartment encapsulation. Futher, the occurrence of EPs N- and C-terminally fused to diverse enzymes suggests these are tractable in a wide range of chimeras5,29. These features make the EP domain standout and have high potential to serve as a platform for future biotechnological development.

Metabolosomes can package an array of enzymatic functions within a wide array of microbes. Nature has supported this functional diversity by evolving a function agnostic, one-size-fits-all assembly approach. At its core lies the structural and functional features of the EP domain, which can be leveraged as a molecular tool to assemble disparate cargos in vitro and in vivo in a controlled, predictable manner. In vivo, these complexes may be used to scaffold target metabolic pathways for improved catalytic efficiencies (for example, substrate channeling). The applications for in vitro EP-driven phase separation are more diverse, for example: encapsulation of therapeutic molecules, stabilization of cell-free biomanufacturing systems, self-healing materials, among others. This work will help spur additional hypotheses on modes of assembly and rational design efforts using EP for biotechnology applications.

A complete list of primers, synthetic gene fragments, and plasmid names used in this study can be found in the Supplemental Materials. Briefly, all cloning used the NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (#E5520S), Q5® High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (#M0492S) and/or KLD Enzyme Mix (#M0554S) offerings from New England Biolabs. Gibson assemblies were carried out using 0.02 pmol of backbone with a threefold molar excess of insert. All gene fragments were ordered from Twist Biosciences as codon optimized for E. coli and assembled into a pre-linearized pET11a backbone. All primers were purchased from IDT. Gibson assembly reactions were completed at 50 °C for 20 min and then immediately frozen at −20 °C until transformed into NEB5alpha chemically competent E. coli (#C2988J). Transformation was performed by incubating cells with assembly mix (<10% total volume) for 10 min on ice, heat-shocked at 42 °C for 30 s, then recovered in SOC media for 30 min at 37 °C prior to plating. Clone screening was performed on miniprepped plasmid DNA with whole-plasmid sequencing offered by Plasmidsaurus. PCR reactions were performed at 50 µL scale using a 15 s/kb extension time and appropriate primer annealing parameters. PCR reactions were treated directly with 1 µL of DpnI (#R0176S) to remove template DNA for 30 min at 37 °C followed by cleanup and concentration using the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (#D4034) and quantified with a Qubit dsDNA BR kit (#Q32850) from Invitrogen. For PCR mutagenesis, 1 µL of successful PCR was directly mixed with KLD Enzyme Mix for 10 min at 25 °C and frozen until used directly for transformation.

Appropriate plasmids were transformed fresh into NEB T7 Express (#C2566H) competent E. coli. Single colonies were used to inoculate 4 mL of 2 × YT broth and carbenicillin antibiotic and grown overnight at 37 °C, 250 RPM. Overnight cultures were then used to inoculate 250–500 mL of 2 × YT supplemented with antibiotic in baffled flasks and grown to an optical density at 600 nm of ~0.6–0.8 at 37 °C, 250 RPM. At that density, cells were briefly cooled to room temperature prior to the addition of IPTG to 100 µM and continued incubation at 20 °C and 250 RPM for 16–18 h. Cells were harvested the next day via centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min) and frozen at −20 °C for at least 30 min. Thawed pellets were then resuspended at 5 mL/g wet cell pellet in NP40 High Salt Lysis Buffer (RPI, #N32000) supplemented with 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mg/mL egg white lysozyme, 5 mM MgCl2 and 12.5 U/mL recombinant benzonase (Syd Labs, #BP4200). The suspensions were lysed at 25 °C for 30 min with constant agitation. Insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were then decanted into new tubes and stored on ice while the pellets were resuspended in an additional 10 mL of lysis buffer (as above) and incubated for an additional 20 min. The insoluble matter was removed as before, and the supernatants were combined. The supernatants were then incubated at room temperature with 1 mL of PureCube 100 Ni-INDIGO agarose beads (#75105) equilibrated into Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.0) on an end-over-end rocker for 30–60 min at room temperature. Proteins were then purified by gravity flow with 15 mL of washing (Buffer A + 25 mM imidazole) and 5–8 mL of elution (Buffer A + 500 mM imidazole). Proteins were then dialyzed into Buffer A such that remaining imidazole was <0.1 mM using 10 K MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassettes from Thermo Fisher (#66380). In some instances, protein was dialyzed into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 without additional salt. Proteins were then concentrated and quantified by A280 before normalization to 200 µM and flash freezing into liquid nitrogen to store for future use. SDS-PAGE profiles of purified proteins can be found in Supplemental Fig. 6.

Turbidity assays were performed in 96-well plate format in quadruplicate and setup with the help of an Integra Assist Plus liquid handler in either standard (200 µL) or half-area (100 µL) plates. When assaying protein concentration effects on turbidity, stock sample was serially diluted into Assay Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.0) with appropriate mixing prior to adding an equal volume of Assay Buffer supplemented with 40% (w/v) PEG2k to reach a final value of 20%. When assaying the effects of crowding agent, an equal volume of PEG2k at a 2× final value in Assay Buffer was added to diluted protein solutions. Lastly, the effects of salt were assayed by first serially diluting a stock solution of 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 M NaCl pH 8.0 with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, before addition of appropriate protein (25 µM final concentration) and finally by addition of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 40% PEG2k. In all cases, turbidity was measured at 600 nm in a Biotek Synergy plate reader. In all cases, error bars represent the standard deviation from the reported mean.

Condensation reactions were prepared at room temperature in triplicate 100 µL volumes in a 96-well half-area plate. Briefly, reactions were performed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20% (w/v) PEG2k with 20 µM mNeonGreen (donor) and 5 µM mScarlet-I3 (acceptor). Reactions were mixed via pipetting and left to equilibrate for 5 min before reading turbidity and FRET in a Biotek Synergy plate reader. A control sample consisting of 20 µM mNeonGreen alone was used to subtract the non-specific FRET signal.

For in vivo imaging, protein expression was carried out using the same conditions as when expressing protein for purification. Samples were harvested with centrifugation (3000 × g, 2 min) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. Samples were then spotted into a prepared 1.5% agarose pad in PBS, spread and dried for 5 min prior to imaging on an Olympus FV3000. For in vitro imaging of droplets, 5 µL of each sample was sandwiched between two coverslips and imaged directly. The 405 nm laser line was used to excited mTagBFP2 and 488 nm laser line for mNeonGreen, 561 nm laser line for mScarlet-I3 and. Images were colored in ImageJ and are presented without further modification beyond cropping. ImageJ was also used for quantification of partition ratios by measuring the mean gray value of background subtracted foci and non-foci regions within cells. In all cases, n = 100 for partition ratio calculations. Photobleaching experiments, both in vivo and in vitro, were completed by imaging 5–10 s of pre-bleach sample at 0.5 s intervals prior to spot irradiation with the 488 nm laser for 0.5 s at 50% output. Images were then collected at 0.5 s intervals for 2 min. Bleaching quantification was performed in ImageJ.

For any given system, simulations were run in four independent replicates. PduP EP models were based on the observed solution structure31 and modelled using Modeller86, imposing a helical structure conformation. The helical structure was then equilibrated and simulated in a periodic box using the charmm3687 force field and the Gromacs88 molecular dynamics engine. Equilibrated peptides were later represented using the Martini coarse-grained force field in its version 2.2. This step was used to explore the dimerization process of two independent helices and to extract equilibrated configurations, which were backmapped into fully atomic structures using our developed pipeline89. The process was repeated to simulate trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. We also ran simulations of equilibrated trimeric bundles at varying peptide concentrations (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, and 0.1 mM, respectively) to characterize the formation of larger bundle aggregates. Simulations were run with the latest Martini 3 force field to prevent excessive aggregation, which can mislead conclusions49. Each system was composed of 80% water and 20% PEG. Finally, we built EP2 and EP3 tandem structures with Modeller to characterize self-EP association within the construct. Topologies were represented using an updated version of the Martini 3 to better match the dynamic properties of the disorder linker region90.

All atomistic simulations followed the same protocols as provided here. Each backmapped peptide system (dimers to pentamers) was centered in a cubic box, hydrated, and neutralized with 150 mM KCL. The size of the box was chosen to create at least 1.5 nm of padding on each side along the largest atom-atom distance of the peptide. A constant temperature of 310 K was maintained using velocity Langevin dynamics91 with a relaxation time of 1 ps. A constant isotropic pressure of 1 bar was maintained using the C-rescale approach with a relaxation time of 1 ps and compressibility of 4.5105 bar. Covalent bond lengths involving hydrogens were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm92 with a tolerance of 10-6 nm. Water molecules were rigidified with SETTLE93. Lennard-Jones interactions were evaluated using a cut-off where forces smoothly decay to zero between 1.0 and 1.2 nm. Coulomb interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald) approach. In total, 4 simulations were performed for each system with an aggregated time of 4 µs.

Coarse-grained simulations with the Martini 2.2 version were run as previously described94. Simulations were carried out at 310 K using isotropic pressure coupling at 1 bar with a time step of 20 fs. Non-bonded Lennard-Jones potentials used a cutoff radius of 1.1 nm. The reaction field method was used for electrostatic calculations95. The cutoff distance for dielectric constant was set to 1.1 nm. Within the cutoff, the dielectric constant was 15, and beyond the cutoff it was infinite. The velocity Verlet algorithm96 was used for integrating Newtonian equations. Temperature was controlled by a Langevin dynamics thermostat with a coupling time constant of 5 ps. Box pressure was controlled using a C-rescale method. For each CG MD production run, frames were saved every 100,000 time steps (every 2 ns). Configurations were categorized using the gmx cluster tool using the gromos approach. Simulations with Martini 3 were performed using the recommended parameters from the original work49.

Magic: The Gathering is having an even bigger moment than usual this year, thanks to a lot of attention around its splashy crossovers and its rapid rollout of sets. But with that attention, there's definitely been some consternation about just how wide-reaching Magic‘s aesthetic is getting, between experimental in-universe sets and those aforementioned “Universes Beyond” bringing more and more licensed material into the game. In a fascinating new article looking at the major sets of the last year, the game's head designer is starting to reckon with those lessons learned… lessons that are going to make for a very interesting reaction to the game's next big collab.

Today Magic head designer Mark Rosewater released his 2025 State of Design article on the official Magic website, looking back at feedback and lessons to be learned from the release of almost every major Magic set released in the last year (up to, but not including, Edge of Eternities, which released on August 1). There are lots of interesting points Rosewater makes in the piece, reflecting some of the biggest fan concerns about Magic‘s direction from a mechanical and aesthetic point of view, from the game's eagerness to move on from themes every set, creating an issue where mechanical elements are introduced and then left unsupported, to an awareness of the game's complexity creep from the sheer amount of interactions possible even when Magic introduces individually simplistic new mechanics.

But one of the most intriguing lessons to be learned that Rosewater highlights across several of the sets covered in the piece—Bloomburrow, Duskmourn: House of Horror, Foundations, Aetherdrift, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, and Final Fantasy—is a regular criticism Magic has faced as of late: that the game has occasionally pushed its fantastical too far into elements that don't capture Magic‘s feel. One particular pain point Rosewater highlighted was in Duskmourn, a horror-themed set that included several more direct aspersions to classic horror media, rooted in our own world.

“Players, it seems, are not fans of what I'm going to call ‘mundane modernity.' Magic has had many sets, such as Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty and The Brothers' War which push into more of a science-fiction feel, with items far more technically advanced than one would normally find in a fantasy story,” Rosewater wrote. “That doesn't generally bother many players. Some things Duskmourn: House of Horror did for the first time bothered players, like having characters wearing and using things that we actually use: things like sneakers, or jeans, or a baseball bat. Part of fantasy is the idea that you're coming to a world that is fundamentally different than your own. Fantasy wants to be inspirational, and seeing everyday objects which are a part of all of our daily lives deflates that.”

As Rosewater acknowledged, not every Magic set is rooted in explicitly fantastical material, from the sci-fantasy of sets like Edge of Eternities to collaborations in Universes Beyond like Doctor Who or Warhammer 40,000, which have fantastical elements rooted in science-fictional or real-world designs. But Magic also has a strong history of being able to root that kind of aesthetic in fantasy, which Duskmourn‘s more explicit horror callouts lacked. At a time when Wizards is also reckoning with the increase of non-Magic-original sets in the game, depending on the crossover, it's going to be an issue that continues to concern players (even beyond the general existence of Universes Beyond, complaints around which Rosewater acknowledged as a “sentiment [that] continually shrinks over time”).

It's an interesting thing for Rosewater to acknowledge, though, as Magic is now little more than a month away from the release of its next set, Marvel's Spider-Man. Although there are fantastical elements in a set about a superhero scientist and peculiar foes, like most of good Marvel, it's built into the so-called “world outside our window.” The Final Fantasy set did a great job translating Final Fantasy to the world of Magic, while drawing on a myriad of aesthetics from steampunk to sci-fi to more traditional medieval fantasy, and managed to effectively balance those aesthetic styles with what players typically expect from Magic.

Will Spider-Man walk the web-rope and balance that vibe, or will it end up with reactions like Duskmourn? We'll find out if there are more lessons to learn when the set hits shelves at the end of September.

          Wizards of the Coast thwipped by SDCC to give us an early look at the first Marvel 'Magic: The Gathering' set.
        


          The recent 'Magic: The Gathering' crossover set became its most successful ever, surging sales of the card game by 23%.
        


          In the wake of 'Final Fantasy,' 'Magic: The Gathering' is taking its next big risk: a full-on leap into science fiction.
        


          Of course most of these cards have haste. Or flash. Or both!
        


          The 'Avatar: The Last Airbender' set comes to 'Magic' in November, with more info arriving in mid-August.
        


          Suplex's place in 'Final Fantasy' meme history lives on, even if Square Enix would prefer you call it Meteor Strike these days.

The pace of muders in DC this year should put it somewhere around the mid 1960's numbers of around 150: https://www.disastercenter.com/crime/dccrime.htmSo... there are the raw numbers. Want to adjust your position on that "disinfo campaign?"

I agree that it would be misleading to judge  D.C. based on being at a 30 year low. Of the cities with the highest homicide rates, only Philadelphia has a higher population and rate. It's fair to say that there are other cities close in population. But it's clear that D.C. has a abnormally high homicide rate when compared to all of the other U.S. cities of its size or larger. Even if you only compared it to all other U.S. cities within, say, 100k of population, it's still at a very high percentile.

Population does matter somewhat but not really in this case. If you're invading a city because crime is high it only makes sense to do if it's high in absolute numbers; otherwise you're not really having much impact.Also half of DC actually lives in MD and VA.

Once you concede on that, could you say what homicide level requires a police state as a reaction? It would appear to be within a factor of two of the present numbers, but I can't work out where the line would be.

reply

And to cite these numbers without providing context at the same time of citing them that someone was literally fired for allegedly manipulating the data. And to be clear they're just allegations, but also the data is controlled by someone whose job and ego is tied to these numbers dropping, and the rate of the drop is basically unbelievable - 25% to 28% drop in a single year? After suggesting it went down 34% the year before?Even if my info I just wrote is something someone could dispute, is it not part of journalism to at least provide the bare minimum of context for people to at least know why this is controversial? If Trump's position on this is so soundly and clearly misguided, then it shouldn't be a problem at all to provide all facts and context to demonstrate as much. Instead we're given a single fact with zero other context.

The only remaining Zen 3 3D-VCache CPU is the Ryzen 5 5500X3D, but that chip is exclusive to Latin America.

The road is almost over for AMD's Zen 3-based 3D-VCache-powered gaming processors. Tweakers.net reports that various retailers can no longer purchase the Ryzen 7 5700X3D from AMD, thus confirming the CPU has reached end-of-life status.

Outgoing Ryzen 7 5700X3D pricing and availability back up Tweakers report, as AMD's last eight-core Zen 3 3D-VCache chip is no longer available in the U.S. from virtually all popular retailers, including Newegg, Amazon, B&H Photo, Best Buy, and Micro Center. The only places where the 5700X3D is still readily accessible include the used market and a few third-party listings on Newegg.

Newegg currently has three active Ryzen 7 5700X3D listings, one going for $278.09, another $340, and the last one $526.17, all coming from third-party retailers based in Hong Kong. EBay has a variety of used Ryzen 7 5700X3D chips starting as low as $205 (at the time of writing), as well as some sellers claiming they have brand-new models.

Over in the Netherlands, Tweakers reports Ryzen 7 5700X3D prices have started to climb, reportedly from €225 to €260.

The Ryzen 7 5700X3D debuted in January 2024 as a cheaper alternative to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, slotting in between the 5800X3D and the MicroCenter-exclusive Ryzen 5 5600X3D. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D is a downclocked variant of the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, featuring eight Zen 3 cores, 96MB of L3 cache, and a 400MHz clock speed reduction compared to its pricier brother. The 5700X3D peaked at just 4.1GHz, while the 5800X3D peaked at 4.5GHz.

Despite its lower clock speeds, the Ryzen 7 5700X3D proved to be one of AMD's most competitive gaming CPUs at the time, coming in at around $100 cheaper than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and Core i5-14600K, while offering performance similar to both chips. (The 5700X3D's MSRP was $249, but street pricing was at $229 when our review went live in May 2024.)

In our review, we found the Ryzen 7 5700X3D was just 9% slower than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D on average at 1080p (while being 35% cheaper), and was 3% faster than Intel's Core i5-14600K. The 3D-VCache in the 5700X3D also enabled the Zen 3 part to outperform entry-level Zen 4 parts, beating the Ryzen 5 7600X by 13%.

The Ryzen 7 5700X3D continued its competitive domination for months after launch, eventually becoming the sole X3D chip for the AM4 platform after AMD discontinued the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and MicroCenter ran out of Ryzen 5 5600X3D inventory — the latter was a limited-edition MicroCenter exclusive that EOLed during the 5700X3D's launch.

For most of the world, the 5700X3D represented the last attainable X3D chip for the AM4 platform. Technically, AMD is still pumping out one last remaining Zen 3 X3D part, the six-core Ryzen 5 5500X3D. But that CPU is exclusive to Latin America. Luckily, AMD is reportedly planning to make more affordable X3D parts on the AM5 platform in the near future, with the Ryzen 5 9600X3D supposedly arriving before the end of 2025.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

No matter how Tom Gurski crunched the numbers, there was no way the planet was going to switch to electric vehicles fast enough to meet even modest global warming targets. Gas-powered cars, trucks and SUVs are on the road for 20-plus years on average, and their usable lifespan keeps getting longer. Plus, it's a carbon-intensive waste to prematurely chuck all the steel tied up in the vehicles.

The longtime mechanical engineer believes he has a solution. 

From a two-car Seattle garage crammed with machinery that would make any gearhead swoon, Gurski has developed technology that can transform fossil fuel vehicles into plug-in electric hybrids — cars that can run on battery power for daily driving but switch to gas for longer trips — for a few thousand dollars and about a day of installation work.

“I'm fully convinced it's a solution the world needs,” he said. 

Gurski launched Blue Dot Motorworks five years ago to commercialize the technology, and his effort is kicking into gear:

The initial prototype, a product dubbed Narwhal, is designed to pair with pickup trucks. Its second version, called Humpback, will target cars and SUVs. 

Gurski has held mechanical engineering leadership roles at multiple companies and worked on sanitation technology for Gates Foundation-funded projects before starting his own engineering consultancy, which led into Blue Dot.

Redwood Stephens, former chief product officer for Rad Power Bikes and a past president of engineering company Synapse Product Development, recently joined the startup as a part-time CPO. The team includes Suzanne Ellis Wernevi, head of business development, communications and policy.

Stephens touts the universality of the technology as a major selling point as the business aims to get traction with outside investors. 

“If you have a solution that is agnostic to the make and model of the vehicle,” he said, “then suddenly the addressable market becomes massive.”

Gurski developed his prototype on his own 2001 Jeep Cherokee — a vehicle that gets a paltry 16 miles per gallon. On a recent test drive he put the key in the ignition, but instead of firing up the gas engine, he started it with a control unit mounted on the dashboard.

“You just turn the vehicle on without starting it, put it in neutral, power the system on,” he explained. A low hum indicated the different components were operating, and the dashboard device displayed that the battery was nearly fully charged, “and then off we go.”

On a quick spin through a residential neighborhood, the ride was a little louder and more rattling than a regular EV given the Jeep's age and a transmission feature that will change in the final product. But the vehicle worked as intended, smoothly accelerating and braking, all without pumping any CO2 into the atmosphere.

The Blue Dot conversion is a variation on traditional plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The vehicles operate entirely electrically until their batteries run out and they switch over to internal combustion engines. The hybrids have a much shorter battery range than 100% EVs, but given that most drivers make daily trips of 35-40 miles, they're running fossil fuel-free most of the time.

“If you look at any existing car on the road, it's already 80% of a plug-in hybrid. It's already a car … It's already got the combustion-powered part of the equation. All you need to do is add the electric side of the equation, and you've got a plug-in hybrid,” Gurski said. “So the trick is, how do you do that in a way that can be done cost effectively and scalably?”

Automakers including Toyota, BMW, Kia, Hyundai and others sell plug-in hybrid electric vehicles off the lot and sales have been increasing. Entrepreneurs have tried, and largely failed, to create retrofit solutions for converting gas-powered vehicles.

But Jay Donnaway, past president of the Seattle Electric Vehicle Association (SEVA) and long-time EV enthusiast, is “cautiously optimistic” that Blue Dot has landed on a winning strategy. Most other technologies added battery power to boost a gas vehicle's efficiency, he said, but didn't include the ability to drive purely as an EV.

“Without EV-only mode, you leave the easiest savings on the table,” Donnaway said, “because you can't even drive to the mailbox and back without turning on the engine.”

Blue Dot's team is prepping to build about 10-12 prototype kits for pilot tests on light-duty vehicles at Royal Roads University on Vancouver Island and the Richmond School District in British Columbia. The organizations will buy the kits, test the technology for six months, and can remove and return the systems for a full refund if they aren't satisfied.

The technology “makes good sense to me,” Donnaway said. “Mechanically, [Gurski] has been extremely careful.”

But there are plenty of challenges for Blue Dot to navigate. Building hardware is expensive, particularly for initial, limited-run production. Trump administration policies are undermining EV adoption by cutting tax rebates for vehicle purchases and eliminating funding for charging infrastructure — though the loss of rebates could make Blue Dot's proposition more cost competitive. And there's the hurdle of educating drivers on the existence of this technology and its benefits.

The Narwhal system includes a battery and electronics box about the size of a small truck-bed toolbox that's installed inside the bed. The system inserts a motor drive unit into the truck's drive shaft, allowing it to turn the rear wheels with battery power.

A dashboard display shows battery charge and allows drivers to switch between electric and gas power. It will give audible and visual warnings if the battery power gets low. The technology includes regenerative braking and enables one-pedal driving.

The system for cars and SUVs will be similar, but the motor drive unit will be placed on the rear wheels, and the battery component will go in the trunk or on a trailer hitch.

The conversion kit targets a price of $6,000-$9,000 based on vehicle type, plus roughly $500-$1,000 in labor costs for installation. The system is designed so any mechanic can install it.

The upfront costs are significant, but vehicles with poor fuel efficiency can make up the investment in three or four years given that electricity is cheaper than filling up with gasoline. There are additional maintenance savings as the combustion engine will see less wear and tear. 

After 10 years chasing a plug-in hybrid solution, Gurski thinks he's there.

“You could say that the best inventions are the ones that seem obvious once they're invented. And I think this kind of falls into that category,” he said. “It's like, yeah, obviously that'll work — but I had to come up with this.”

Nvidia has just launched two more Blackwell GPUs designed for professionals. The RTX Pro 4000 SFF and RTX Pro 2000 have been unveiled at SIGGRAPH 2025. These GPUs round out the company's workstation lineup, slotting in under the top-of-the-line RTX Pro 6000 that was released earlier this year. Aside from their increased performance over prior-gen products, Nvidia says that these GPUs are also tailored for AI acceleration that works across varying workflows in different industries.

The RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell SFF is a smaller version of the already available RTX 4000 Blackwell card. The company claims that it offers more than twice the AI performance of the previous-generation RTX A4000 SFF, with improved ray tracing capabilities and 50% more bandwidth — all while retaining the same 70-watt maximum TDP of the previous card.

With 24GB of ECC GDDR7 memory and a claimed 770 AI TOPS of throughput, this GPU could be a great option for professionals looking for more power in a smaller package. Those characteristics make it especially useful for workstations with limited space or tight power and thermal budgets.



There's also a new RTX Pro 2000 card with 16GB of ECC GDDR7 memory and 545 AI TOPS of power in the same 70W TGP. Nvidia says this card is built for mainstream design and AI workflows. This GPU is claimed to be around 1.5 times faster than the Nvidia RTX A2000 in 3D modeling, computer-aided design, and rendering. The company also says it's useful for AI image and text generation, boosting its AI performance to make AI-powered workflows faster and more seamless.

Unfortunately, we don't have detailed pricing for these GPUs yet — we expect that information to come from its authorized resellers and system integrators. The company also did not reveal the exact specifications for the RTX Pro 4000 SFF and RTX Pro 2000 on stage.

These GPUs are expected to become available later this year, with the RTX Pro 2000 available through PNY and TD Synnex for those looking for individual cards to upgrade their existing units, and from system integrators including Boxx, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, for those looking for complete workstation solutions. The Nvidia RTX Pro 4000 SFF will be available in systems from Nvidia partners like Dell, HP, and Lenovo.

Nvidia on Monday unveiled a set of new world AI models, libraries, and other infrastructure for robotics developers, most notable of which is Cosmos Reason, a 7-billion-parameter “reasoning” vision language model for physical AI applications and robots.

Also joining the existing batch of Cosmos world models are Cosmos Transfer-2, which can accelerate synthetic data generation from 3D simulation scenes or spatial control inputs, and a distilled version of Cosmos Transfers that is more optimized for speed.

During its announcement at the SIGGRAPH conference on Monday, Nvidia noted that these models are meant to be used to create synthetic text, image, and video datasets for training robots and AI agents.

Cosmos Reason, per Nvidia, allows robots and AI agents to “reason” thanks to its memory and physics understanding, which lets it “serve as a planning model to reason what steps an embodied agent might take next.” The company says it can be used for data curation, robot planning, and video analytics.  

The company also unveiled new neural reconstruction libraries, which includes one for a rendering technique that lets developers simulate the real world in 3D using sensor data. This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There's even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.

There are new servers for robotics workflows, too. The Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell Server offers a single architecture for robotic development workloads, while Nvidia DGX Cloud is a cloud-based management platform. 

These announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.

Elon Musk confirmed over the weekend reports that Tesla has disbanded the team working on its Dojo AI training supercomputer, just weeks after announcing he expected to have Tesla's second cluster operating “at scale” in 2026. 

“Once it became clear that all paths converged to AI6, I had to shut down Dojo and make some tough personnel choices, as Dojo 2 was now an evolutionary dead end,” Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, on Sunday. “Dojo 3 arguably lives on in the form of a large number of AI6 [systems-on-a-chip] on a single board.”

After bringing its first Dojo supercomputer to life and powering it with a mix of Nvidia GPUs and in-house-made D1 chips, Tesla had planned to build a second Dojo factory — referred to by Musk as “Dojo 2” — that would have been powered by a second-generation D2 chip. 

It appears the D2 chip under development has been shelved along with the broader Dojo project as Tesla shifts its focus to its AI5 and AI6 chips, which are being manufactured by TSMC and Samsung, respectively. The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla's driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.  

“It doesn't make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”

He added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.” 

“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.

Musk has talked about Dojo since 2019, reiterating that Dojo would be a cornerstone of Tesla's mission to achieve full self-driving and commercialize humanoid robots. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.”

It's not clear if Cortex is still in the works. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla to learn more, as well as to inquire about the fate of the Dojo facility Tesla had invested $500 million to build in Buffalo, New York. 

The shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk's forays into politics. Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.

Learning to code and working hard hasn't been quite enough to land the coveted tech jobs and six-figure starting salaries that computer science graduates were promised, according to a new report in The New York Times this weekend.

As the industry grapples with layoffs and the rise of artificial intelligence tools that can perform jobs faster, recent grads paint a picture in which they're applying for hundreds if not thousands of tech positions only to be ghosted and left feeling “gaslit” about their career prospects.

Some of the grads, who had visions of cruising into the tech workforce with skills that were deemed highly coveted, are resorting to jobs in the fast food industry.

“It is difficult to find the motivation to keep applying,” said an Oregon State University grad who has applied for 5,762 tech jobs since graduating in 2023, according to the Times. He's had 13 job interviews but no full-time job offers.

The Times says the spread of AI is not helping, as tech firms embracing AI coding assistants reduces the need for some companies to hire junior software engineers. Other firms are using AI to automatically scan resumes and reject candidates. Some graduates described feeling caught in an AI “doom loop,” The Times reported.

Another data science graduate told the Times that she received a rejection email three minutes after applying for a job. More companies are using AI to screen candidates and are removing the human element from the process. Seattle-based Humanly unveiled “AI interviewers” last month in which job candidates interact with an AI-generated video interviewer.

“It's hard to stay motivated when you feel like an algorithm determines whether you get to pay your bills,” the grad told the Times.

While the report does namecheck Amazon and Microsoft for recent layoffs and an embrace of AI tools, and University of Washington students and graduates are among those who replied to questions from the Times, a GeekWire report last month offered a different perspective.

In that story, Amazon was said to have hired more than 100 engineers from the latest graduating class at UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering — an all-time high, according to university data shared with GeekWire. Microsoft, Meta and Google were each hiring more than 20 UW CSE grads, reflecting a strong talent pipeline between the UW and Seattle's tech industry.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that while the U.S. labor market is cooling, AI can be ruled out — so far — as a culprit in any hiring slowdown. U.S. workers whose jobs involve tasks that AI can do are actually much less likely than other workers to be unemployed, according to an analysis by the Economic Innovation Group.

'Promptware' uses prompts to exploit flaws in LLM integration


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


SafeBreach researchers have revealed how a malicious Google Calendar invite could be used to exploit Gemini—the AI assistant that Google has built into its Workplace software suite, Android operating system, and search engine—as part of their ongoing efforts to determine the dangers posed by the rapid integration of AI in tech products.

The researchers dubbed an exploit like this "promptware" because it "utilizes a prompt—a piece of input via text, images, or audio samples—that is engineered to exploit an LLM interface at inference time to trigger malicious activity, like spreading spam or extracting confidential information." The broader security community has underestimated the risks associated with promptware, SafeBreach said, and this report is meant to demonstrate just how much havoc these exploits can wreak.

At a high level, this particular exploit took advantage of Gemini's integration with the broader Google ecosystem, the ability to clutter up Google Calendar's user interface with invitations, and their intended victim's habit of thanking an automaton for... automaton-ing. The researchers said this allowed them to indirectly trigger promptware buried within the user's chat history and perform the following actions:

Check out the full report for a step-by-step breakdown of how the exploit worked. The researchers said they disclosed the flaws to Google in February and that Google "published a blog that provided an overview of its multi-layer mitigation approach to secure Gemini against prompt injection techniques" in June. (It's not clear at what point those mitigations were introduced between the disclosure and the blog post.)

This kind of back-and-forth has been a mainstay of computing for decades. Companies introduce new technologies, people find ways to exploit them, companies occasionally come up with defenses against those exploits, and then people find something else to take advantage of. So, in that sense, the SafeBreach research just reveals another problem to add to the seemingly infinite array of such issues.

But a number of factors combine to make this report more alarming than it might be otherwise. Those include SafeBreach's point about security pros not taking promptware seriously, the "move fast and break things" approach companies are taking with their "AI" deployments, and the incorporation of these chatbots into seemingly every product a company offers. (As highlighted by Gemini's ubiquity.)

"According to our analysis, 73% of the threats posed to end users by an LLM personal assistant present a High-Critical risk," SafeBreach said. "We believe this is significant enough to require swift and dedicated mitigation actions to secure end users and decrease this risk."

"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets"

Both Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of China-sourced revenues to unlock export licenses for previously restricted chips. Under the reported terms of the new deal, Nvidia will be able to resume H20 chip sales, and AMD will be able to sell its MI308 accelerators into China. The deal, not officially announced, has been reported independently by a multitude of outlets, including the BBC, FT, and Reuters. We also followed up with Nvidia for more details.

The restrictions on exports of such potent AI accelerators were originally put in place due to national security concerns, but the 15% levy marks a significant shift in that strategy. The revenue-share deal would represent a landmark foray into uncharted territory. Several news agencies, such as the BBC and FT, point out that a deal where commercial entities pay a revenue share in exchange for government export license approval is unprecedented.

Furthermore, the FT asserts that the U.S. Commerce Department has already started issuing H20 licenses last Friday. That would be just two days after Jensen Huang last met in person with President Trump.

It is understood that AMD's licenses were also being inked ahead of the weekend. We don't have any AMD statements about the new 15% revenue-sharing deal at the time of writing.

Nvidia has been quite quick to trot out an official statement. This morning, an Nvidia spokesperson told Tom's Hardware, “We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.” Providing some context to the newly announced export license approval process, they added, “While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”

In addition, the statement repeated arguments in favor of relaxed cutting-edge technology export controls we have seen previously, “America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world's standard if we race,” ended the short statement.

For Nvidia and AMD, perhaps this policy shift has come at a pivotal time. There have been signs of China-based competitors raising their competitiveness on several fronts.

Only yesterday, we reported on Chinese state media molding public opinion by characterizing Nvidia H20 GPUs as “neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe.” The safety concerns seem to be a tit-for-tat response to Western powers, who cite similar concerns regarding Chinese-sourced semiconductors. and electronics. Nvidia has strenuously denied the existence of any kill switches, back doors, or spyware in its GPUs.

Reuters provided some interesting context to the new 15% deal between Nvidia, AMD, and the U.S. government. According to the latest financials, Nvidia raked in $17 billion in revenue during its latest financial year from China. AMD's China business scored $6.2 billion in revenue in 2024.

With the Green and Red team's expensive AI chips now available for sale in China, we could expect both yearly revenue figures to increase impressively. However, 15% of the total combined $23.2 billion (latest combined figures) is less than $3.5 billion for the U.S. Treasury. Also, we must remember that the 15% deal only covers the advanced AI chips that require these export licenses. In other words, the 15% deal is ‘small potatoes' to a country like the U.S., when judged purely on financial terms.

Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of their revenue from their specialized chip sales in China, in a deal so unconventional the business world is still reeling.

The arrangement, effectively a new kind of “export tax,” is an unprecedented move that ends a months-long blockade and reopens one of the world's largest markets for America's two most valuable chipmakers.

The news, first reported by the Financial Times, reveals the original and transactional tactics the Trump administration is deploying to generate revenue and control the flow of strategic technology. Nvidia and AMD chips are highly sought after by companies and governments to train their AI tools in the current AI race.

For Nvidia and AMD, agreeing to pay the government a portion of their profits was the lesser of two evils. Being completely locked out of the Chinese market was a financial catastrophe.

Nvidia had been hit particularly hard. After the administration blocked its China-specific chips in April, the company was forced to take a $4.5 billion charge for excess inventory it could no longer sell.

In May, it warned investors that the restrictions would cost the company an estimated $8 billion in revenue for the full fiscal year. Faced with losing billions, handing over 15% of future sales was a price they were willing to pay.

The standoff is the latest chapter in the long-running U.S.-China tech war. The U.S. government has been trying to slow Beijing's military advancement by blocking its access to high-end AI chips.

After the previous administration banned the sale of their most powerful processors, Nvidia and AMD cleverly designed special, less-powerful “compliance chips” — like Nvidia's H2O and AMD's MI308 — specifically for the Chinese market.

But in April, the Trump administration tightened the screws, requiring a special license to sell even these less powerful chips. That move triggered months of intense, high-stakes lobbying, marked by several White House visits from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, which ultimately led to this new arrangement.

For the Trump administration, the deal is a win on multiple fronts. It provides a new stream of federal revenue that could help finance the massive tax cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the president's signature legislation.

It also allows the administration to look tough on China while simultaneously protecting the financial health of critical American companies.

In a carefully worded statement to Gizmodo, an Nvidia spokesperson avoided confirming the 15% figure but acknowledged the new reality.

“We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” it reads. “While we haven't shipped H2O to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”

The spokesperson added: “America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunications leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world's standard if we race.”

This new deal is a radical departure from traditional trade policy.

Governments typically encourage and subsidize exports from their national champions to boost trade balances. This new model, however, forces America's most successful companies to pay for the privilege of competing abroad.

It's a pragmatic compromise that gives Nvidia a path to reclaim its dominant market position and potentially push its market value past the unprecedented $5 trillion threshold. But it also sets a startling precedent for how the U.S. government could exert control over its most strategic industries in the future.

AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

There are only a few brands that truly get over-ear headphones right, and Bose is one of them. The brand's QuietComfort lineup is especially great for anyone looking for decent noise cancellation with all-day comfort, and right now, you can grab a pair for less.

Amazon has slashed the price of the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones to $229, which is 34% off the usual price. This is the lowest we've seen in a while, and the discount is available on multiple color options.

As with most Bose products, a premium finish and solid build quality are a given. Earcups are plush, and the headband is padded, so having these on for extended periods won't leave you with red, sore ears.

Noise cancelling is the big feature here, but Bose makes it flexible. You're getting two noise control modes. Quiet mode blocks out the world when you want to be completely immersed in whatever's playing. Aware mode lets you stay connected to the background voices and laughter while still enjoying quality audio. Want to listen to the latest Coldplay song while feeling every beat? Go for the quiet mode. Working in a cafe and want to hear when the barista calls your name? Aware mode it is.

Those who prefer more control over their audio will appreciate the adjustable EQ in the Bose app. It lets you fine-tune the bass, mid-range, and treble for a personalized experience. They're also versatile, so you can connect to multiple devices at once and switch between them without constant re-pairing.

Long commutes and work hours will be covered, too. Bose packs these with up to 24 hours of battery life on a single charge – enough for one full day of listening. Even better, a quick 15-minute top-up gives you about 2.5 hours of playback. They are essentially wireless, but Bose does include an audio cable so you can keep listening even when the battery levels are running low or you just don't have a stable Bluetooth connection.

Overall, this is a solid chance to pick up a pair of premium over-ear headphones at one of the best prices we've seen. You're getting excellent comfort, two audio modes that let you customize your experience, a solid battery life, and more. The discount is available on multiple color options, including some limited-edition pairs like the Twilight Blue. At $229, it is still a bit of an investment, but you're paying for gear that's made to last.

Tan was just appointed CEO in March.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly set to visit the White House on Monday, following President Trump's call for his resignation last week and probes into his connections with China, as revealed by The Wall Street Journal

Intel has endured a torrid run of form lately. From faltering business performance to a gloomy outlook for its future nodes, the American powerhouse is under major scrutiny that it can't seem to escape. Most recently, Intel's CEO Lip-Bu Tan was probed by a U.S. Senator over his ties to China—which Tan addressed—after which President Trump called for his resignation. Now, the situation has escalated to the point where even Intel's board is reportedly at odds with Tan.

According to the report, Tan will be going to the White House today to meet President Trump. The purpose of the visit is clear: to elucidate recent developments and assure the U.S. government that both Tan and Intel are fully committed to the nation's goal of semiconductor independence, with no security concerns to worry about. Tan, who previously served as CEO of Cadence—the company recently found guilty of selling trade secrets to China— has invested heavily in some 600 Chinese firms, some linked to the Chinese military.

Tan will reportedly discuss both his personal and professional background, explaining his stance on the state's stringent anti-China tack. Intel's fabs are some of the only American equivalents to giants like TSMC that can potentially compete with the East. Last year, Intel received $8 billion through the CHIPS Act to keep its manufacturing facilities running and prevent them from being spun off. Tan will likely emphasize the connection between these fabs and national security in front of Trump, while also outlining other ways the two could collaborate to strengthen America's chipmaking prowess



This development follows recent tariff exemptions granted to companies like Apple in exchange for promises to manufacture products in America. Trump has stated he'll impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor companies that don't produce their chips domestically. Moreover, it was recently reported that the White House is enacting a new 15% revenue cut on AI GPU sales to China, demanding Nvidia and AMD share revenue with the state. This, however, doesn't affect Intel, as it is largely focused on the CPU market. If true, however, it would show the government's no-compromise and no-holds-barred position on working with Beijing.

Intel has had a tough couple of years. The company has lost half of its valuation, dropping from $200 billion to just $100 billion in less than 20 months. It is also planning to shed 25% of its workforce, has slowed the development of its Ohio plant, and spun off non-critical divisions to cut costs. Intel—a legacy firm whose dominance predates AMD and Nvidia's explosive ascent over the past decade—still holds the edge in CPU market share due to its extensive history, but now finds itself on the cusp of another major administrative hurdle.

The Korea Institute of Industrial Technology recently announced an incredible breakthrough in the world of additive manufacturing (aka 3D printing) and its practical application in the space industry. In a joint project led by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), KP Aviation Industries, Hanyang University, and AM Solutions, the group managed to 3D print a fuel tank out of titanium that was able to pass a critical durability test, as reported by Popular Science.

It seems that things are ramping up when it comes to getting space-ready 3D printed objects. It was just last week that another team showcased their efforts in getting 3D printed components to pass crucial tests for space travel. In that situation, the 3D printed pieces were coated before passing particle contamination tests. This is different from this project, in which the researchers have created metal-based components that are passing tests for durability.

The team decided to work on 3D printing a fuel tank, which has high-performance requirements when it comes to the ability to withstand pressure. Typically, tanks are forged using molds that titanium alloys can be poured into. This is great for reproducing the same piece over and over again, but much harder to adapt for custom designs. The ability to 3D print a fuel tank out of metal that is strong enough to withstand the pressure requirements for space launch is a huge step in enabling private and one-off space tech.

The 3D printed tank was created using Ti64 titanium alloy and measured 640mm across in diameter. The unit was able to withstand pressure as high as 330 bar. The tank was also cooled using liquid nitrogen, reaching a temperature of -320.8 F° (-196°C).

The technology definitely shakes things up a bit by bringing the production of space industry hardware local. However, this work is still in early development and won't be commercially abound any time soon. There are still tons of cool options out there for anyone interested in dabbling in the world of 3D printing.

A clean workspace is a productive workspace. If you're looking to improve your setup, a good docking station can be a smart investment, and right now, you don't have to pay the full price for one.

The HP USB-C dock G5 is down to $110 on Amazon after a 52% discount. That's more than $100 off a compact yet powerful device, but the discount might not be around for long. Snag it up while it's still available.

See at Amazon

Starting with what matters the most – ports. This compact box gives you four USB‑A ports, a USB‑C port up front for data transfer and power (up to 15W output), an audio jack, and wired connectivity options like HDMI 2.0 and dual DisplayPort 1.4. It covers everything from essentials like a mouse, keyboard, and webcam. You can even connect up to three monitors for a more expansive and productive workspace. Take video meetings on one while having work documents open on the other, or game while also chatting with friends on the side — options are endless.

There's an RJ-45 Ethernet port for a stable, wired internet connection, as well. You won't have to worry about your Wi-Fi signals dropping during important tasks.

It even saves you from those dreaded IT department visits. HP packs it with features like PXE Boot, MAC address pass-through, and Wake-on-LAN. These let tech teams access, manage, and troubleshoot your device remotely. For example, if your company needs to install new software or fix an existing issue, the IT team will handle all complications in the background while you keep working.

The dock is manufactured by HP, but supports universal compatibility. It works with both HP and non-HP USB-C and Thunderbolt-enabled laptops. It's a flexible option for homes with multiple users and will still work with future laptop upgrades.

Plus, since it's less than 5 x 5 inches, it takes very little space and is easy to carry with you around. Plug your devices in, place it near your monitor or laptop, and you're set.

In short, we all know how messy setups can get when you have multiple devices. At a little over $100, this dock offers a great way to cut down on cord clutter and manage all your gear from a single place. It keeps your desk neat and saves you from constantly swapping cables. If your current setup feels cluttered and unorganized, we recommend jumping in on this deal for a budget-friendly upgrade. Just note that it might not last long, so act fast while you can.

Apple in 2024 showed a swanky demo of what it said would be a new, intelligent Siri that would connect with different apps to fetch all kinds of information. But this new Siri has yet to see the light of day, as the company seemingly hasn't been able to get it ready. 

However, Bloomberg now reports that Apple is testing a version of Siri that will be able to take actions on your behalf across various apps by following voice commands. The company plans to release a new version of App Intents, its framework that gives developers the ability to allow users access to parts of their app via different systems, like search and Shortcuts.

Bloomberg reported that if this new version of Siri and App Intents works well, a user would be able to ask Siri to search for a photo, edit it, and send it to someone; post comments on a social app; or log in to a service.

The company is already testing this feature with apps like Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp, the report said. The publication previously reported that Apple planned to release an overhauled version of Siri in spring 2026.

We all want more for less—or at least I do. It's that Holy Grail of deals that makes the idea of budget gadgets so appealing, and especially so in the world of phones. The whole idea of a budget phone is pitching you what may as well be the bargain of the century. For less money, budget phones ostensibly offer you a device that does it all: browses the web, retrieves your email, makes calls and texts, gives you near-unlimited access to apps, and even captures important memories like your niece's first birthday and the horrible decision to hire a clown (therapy stuff). It's everything for almost nothing—write that down, phone companies.

But if you're like me, you see a good deal, and you wonder, “What's the catch?” That's what I say when I see a budget phone, but each and every time, I put my skepticism aside and open myself up to the prospect of forgetting the idea of flagships and embracing the warm bosom of budget stuff. That's what I did with the CMF by Nothing Phone 2 Pro (hereafter shortened to the shorter CMF Phone 2 Pro), and surely this will be the one that clicks… right?

CMF Phone 2 Pro

The CMF by Nothing Phone 2 Pro is a budget phone with more value than you'd expect.

Pros

Cons

There is a sea of budget phones out there, and most of them aren't even trying to be different. The same can't be said for the CMF Phone 2 Pro, a $280 device from a subbrand of Nothing, the company that makes see-through earbuds and, most recently, the divisive Phone 3. What makes CMF different in the budget phone space? A host of first-party accessories that position its Phone 2 Pro as modular in some ways. At launch, CMF offered a few: an attachable lanyard, additional camera lenses that include a fisheye and macro, a “universal cover” for actually putting stuff on, and a magnetic wallet mount. There's even a cool screw for attaching the lanyard built into the bottom of the device!

See CMF Phone 2 Pro at Amazon

They're not groundbreaking accessories by any means, but the idea of a modular phone is a provocative one, especially in the budget space where things get vanilla very fast. The problem? I haven't gotten to try any of that out. According to a spokesperson for Nothing, there was a manufacturing issue with the universal case that actually allows you to attach things, which prevents me (the person who's supposed to test this phone out) from, well, testing this stuff out. Not off to a great start when it comes to budget phone impressions.

Still, there's a lot of phone to test here, even if the main thing that makes this budget phone interesting isn't one of them. So, let's start with the more traditional stuff.

There are a few notable upgrades over the CMF Phone 1, and one of them is the camera. This time, the Phone 2 Pro gives you a three-lens system that includes a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 50-megapixel telephoto, and an 8-megapixel ultrawide. That's, on the surface, a pretty good deal, but what matters is how all that actually translates to the pictures the phone takes. And the answer to that is… honestly, better than you'd think.

Obviously, you can't expect a $280 phone to take flagship-level pictures, but you want them to be above potato quality all the same. I'd say the CMF Phone 2 Pro sometimes takes pictures at a level you'd expect, but a lot of the time exceeds your expectations. This generation's camera was designed specifically to capture more light with its sensor, and it definitely succeeds in that endeavor. Even photos shot outdoors on a cloudy day looked plenty bright—so bright that I would say I was actually surprised.

Any issue I have with the camera system doesn't have to do with its ability to capture light; it would be with its sharpness. Pictures on the CMF Phone 2 Pro tend to all look a little soft, with edges that can get a little blurry. This is a budget phone, after all, but something to be aware of if you're stepping down from a midrange device or, God forbid, a flagship. To avoid that dullness as much as you can, I'd recommend shooting in 50 megapixels for the highest resolution by changing your camera's settings, which are set to 12 megapixels by default. That won't change the fact that this lens (a budget one) may just be on the duller side, but it won't hurt.

Speaking of shooting in 50 megapixels, you should be prepared for a slight delay on the shutter when you're snapping pictures—sometimes that delay between button press and a picture actually being taken is about two seconds. Again, these are the types of sacrifices you'll make when buying a budget phone, and it may be a deal-breaker for some, but if you're not expecting the best and fastest all the time, it may be worth the savings. Overall, I would describe the photos as a step above what I was expecting from a sub-$300 device, slightly soft-looking warts and all.

So far, we've got a better-than-you-think camera, nonexistent accessories, and a very affordable price. But what about the rest of the Phone 2 Pro? If you're going to be taking pictures, you need a screen that actually lets you look at them with the right amount of color contrast, brightness, and clarity, and I can say the CMF Phone 2 Pro has that. There's a 6.77-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that provides 3,000 nits of peak brightness. In phone speak, that equates to a fast, fluid screen with good color contrast that makes editing photos, scrolling web pages, and watching YouTube videos feel seamless. Swiping between apps and pages on the phone is responsive, just like any other phone with a 120Hz refresh rate.

See CMF Phone 2 Pro at Amazon

Performance-wise, the Phone 2 Pro is using a budget chip, the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro, but as I've said in many other phone reviews, an older chip often doesn't matter much. The only time I noticed any real, perceptible slowness was when I was taking photos, but outside of that—if you're just web browsing and using apps like most people—then this will be enough performance to get you by.

While the biggest differentiator of the Phone 2 Pro is still the accessories, the second biggest is probably Nothing OS, which is Nothing's custom skin over Android that comes with some visual flourishes, including a monochrome setting that defaults all your app icons to black and white. If you don't want that, you can easily change your phone to stock Android, but it's nice to have the option. As is the case with other Nothing phones, Nothing OS runs smoothly on the CMF Phone 2 Pro even with a slower chipset. Again, this is not a phone built for machine learning, Apple-style computational photography, or graphics-intensive 3D gaming, but for all the normal stuff you do on a day-to-day basis, it performs reasonably well.

One thing that I love to see in the second-gen CMF phone is an NFC chip, which means that you can actually use mobile payments. Everyone is different, but not being able to use my phone to pay for things would be a dealbreaker, so it's nice to see CMF upped its game here. Battery-wise, the CMF Phone 2 Pro comes with a 5,000mAh battery, which lasted about two days for me with normal usage. For reference, that's the same size battery you'd get on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and lots of other phones for that matter. The CMF Phone 2 Pro also supports fast charging, but only up to 33W, compared to the Phone 3a Pro's 55W. One feature that was surprising to me was the inclusion of reverse charging, which operates at a slow and steady 5W, but it is still nice to have in a pinch. I was able to top up my Nothing Ear wireless earbuds, which was pretty neat.

One thing that you're going to get in basically any budget phone on the market is less expensive materials—this isn't an iPhone, no titanium here. The CMF Phone 2 Pro is no different and is made mostly from plastic. The bad news is the phone feels cheap in your hand, but the good news is it's also incredibly light, which I don't hate. Design-wise, I think the look of the CMF Phone 2 Pro is actually a step down from the CMF Phone 1, especially because it doesn't have a modular backplate anymore that lets you customize the look. The glass is glued on, despite the screws that would have you thinking otherwise. My main gripe aesthetically is that the “light green” colorway actually looks more blue or silver than anything else. I even did an impromptu quiz in the Gizmodo office, and most guesses were “silver.” I'm not going to go full color police here, but if your name is CMF (an acronym for color, material, and finish), you ought to nail the whole color thing.

I'm going to be honest with you: I won't be using a budget device any time soon—I've grown accustomed to snappy pictures aided by computational photography, beefy chipsets, and a weight and feel that some midrange and budget devices don't offer. But just because I won't be switching doesn't mean you shouldn't. The fact of the matter is that the CMF Phone 2 Pro does what you need it to and even excels in categories that you wouldn't expect.

The CMF Phone 2 Pro has a camera that performs much better than it ought to, a solid battery, a screen that will please most people in most scenarios, and even ventures to offer unique perks like accessories and bespoke software, even if one of those things was actually kind of botched at launch. In the budget world, I think it's hard to find all of those pros in one package, and for $280 it's encouraging to know that you can get a device that won't make you feel like you've stepped back in time to a point where people still said the “cell” in front of “phone.” I hope that CMF figures out its modular identity, though. A glued-on backplate is a step back, and not having accessories available at launch is a bad look, but the idea of a modular phone is one that I think could appeal to the masses.

Budget phones will never be for the legions of spoiled iPhone users, but for the rest of the world, options like the CMF Phone 2 Pro are here to fill in the gaps and offer you quite a lot for not a lot of money, and it's nice to know that if you ever wanted to, you could still buy a sub-$300 phone and get away with it.

The laptop you bring to college is important. Not only is it the device you'll be using through some of the most formative years of your life, but it's also often the one that you'll take to your first job, too. The problem is that the internet is full of laptops that aren't worth the money, especially if you're scrolling through lists of laptops on Amazon or Best Buy.

Good news! I've tested each of the following laptops and can wholeheartedly recommend them. More than that, I've been digging through the deals to find the best prices on the best laptops you can buy for back-to-school season. Below, you'll find lots of good cheap laptops as well as some great Chromebooks and gaming laptops that'll do just as well for schoolwork. You can even find some deals on laptop accessories.

B&H

Apple

If there is a quintessential college laptop, it's the MacBook Air M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It's been that way for many years. And even as Apple Silicon has transformed the MacBook Air into something far more capable, Apple has kept prices low enough to still make it the go-to choice. Right now, the starting configuration at Amazon is cheaper than it was on Prime Day at $800. That's even cheaper than the student discount offered by Apple.

What makes the MacBook Air such a perfect college laptop is its long battery life and portability. It's still one of the thinnest laptops you can buy, at 0.44 inches thick, and it weighs just 2.7 pounds. It's the kind of device that can go with you across campus and last well into the evening of studying all on a single charge. You can choose between the 13- ad 15-inch models, both of which are nearly identical, except the latter has more screen real estate and better speakers.

Dell

Dell

Amazon (258V)

When I initially tested the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Review), I gave it a hard time because of the $1,100 MSRP. But over the past month or so, Dell has kept a pretty generous discount intact. Right now, the starting configuration costs $750, which might not sound that cheap at face value, but when you consider what you're getting, you realize just how good a deal this is.

First off, that $750 gets you a whopping 1 terabyte of storage and a higher-resolution display (2560 x 1600), matching the MacBook Air in sharpness. It can even match the MacBook Air's battery life claims. And no, while it's not as thin or sleek as the MacBook Air, in exchange you get extra storage and more ports, making this my go-to pick for back-to-school season this year.

Asus

Amazon

Asus

Best Buy

The Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Review) has been my favorite budget laptop to come out this year, namely because it solves one of the main problems with laptops in this price range: battery life. It runs on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chips, bringing fantastic efficiency to devices as affordable as the Vivobook 14.

It's not a perfect laptop. The display isn't too bright, and the colors look off on it. I also wish the touchpad were a bit more precise. But at this price, you won't find a better Windows laptop, especially since it comes with 512 GB of storage. If you can afford the extra cash for the Dell 14 Plus listed above, it's worth it for the improved display and bump in storage.

Microsoft

Microsoft

2-in-1 laptops (otherwise known as detachables) are a great option for college. They're the lightest devices you can carry around that still give you access to a full version of Windows. The 2025 12-inch model of the Surface Pro makes this benefit even stronger, shrinking the screen down, but without losing performance or battery life. Due to its size, the Surface Pro 12 (6/10, WIRED Review) is a pure joy to use.

When it came out, it was too expensive compared to the larger 13-inch model, but on sale, it makes for an ideal college companion for note-taking in class and studying on the go. Just remember: You'll need to buy the keyboard, as it doesn't come bundled in.

Razer

Razer

The Razer Blade 16 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite gaming laptop, and it'd be a fantastic pick for college students if only it weren't so incredibly expensive. Normally, it starts at $2,400 for the RTX 5060 model, but Razer has a $400 back-to-school discount, meaning you can pick one up for as low as $2,000. I know that's not cheap, especially for this graphics card, but for a Razer Blade it's a rare discount. This is certainly the lowest price I've seen since the 2025 model came out. The 5070 GPU model is also on sale.

The draw to something like the Razer Blade 16 is that it can function as both your laptop for college work and a gaming device with your friends in the dorm. While you could buy just about any gaming laptop and pretend it's a school device, lugging that thing to class will be a nuisance, and once you get there, the design might be a distraction. The latest Razer Blade 16 is just 0.58 inches thick, making it surprisingly portable for a 16-inch gaming laptop. Outside of the Razer logo on the lid, you might not guess that it's even a gaming laptop. It goes without saying that because it has a discrete GPU, it'll serve as a good option for STEM students who need more performance.

Asus

Best Buy

Cheap Chromebooks should not be discounted as solid student laptops, and not all of them are as shoddy as their reputation has earned them. Despite its low price, the Asus Chromebook CX14 (6/10, WIRED Review) isn't half bad. It has a 1080p screen, even if it's not the best one I've tested, and there are lots of ports. It's reasonably portable with a solid keyboard to type on, too.

As usual with cheap laptops, the touchpad isn't the best, and battery life won't get you through a full day. But compared to the Chromebooks selling at this price in the past, the Asus Chromebook CX14 is a big step in the right direction. If your budget is under $300, look no further.

Samsung

Best Buy

Samsung

Now, if you want a more elevated Chromebook experience, you'll have to pay a little more. But as the price of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) proves, there are plenty of great deals to be found. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus has a superb OLED screen, something that's not common in Chromebooks, even those with the “Chromebook Plus” designation.

The Galaxy Chromebook Plus not only has a bright, 15.6-inch OLED display, but also the kind of high-end specs you'll most likely need for college. That includes 256 GB of storage, 8 GB of RAM, and an Intel Core 3 processor. Perhaps its most attractive quality, however, is its portability. It's the thinnest Chromebook you can buy at 0.46 inches thick—only a hair thicker than the MacBook Air.

Asus

Best Buy (RTX 4060)

If you want the sleek and minimalist design of the Razer Blade at a lower price, take a look at the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It's just as gorgeous and thin and doubles every bit as well as a study laptop. The RTX 4060 configuration is what's cheap, which, admittedly, isn't the most impressive gaming GPU at the moment. Alternatively, you can also pick up a slightly older Intel model that comes with a more powerful RTX 4070 for the same price.

Either way, what you're getting is an extremely capable laptop with some extra performance behind it for those who need it. And yeah, it's also a killer gaming laptop in your downtime.

Best Buy (13.8-inch)

Best Buy (15-inch)

This was my favorite new laptop of 2024, and almost a year later it's still without a doubt one of the best laptops you could bring to school. The Surface Laptop 7th Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is light and portable, has a fantastic screen, and an excellent touchpad. My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which means it has a taller shape, giving you more vertical screen space to work with than most other laptops.

The cheapest version you can buy is over on Amazon, where you can pick up the 1-TB model. It's $999 right now, and it will get you great performance with the Snapdragon X Elite chipset and all-day battery life.

I get it. You're a college student, and you're not worried about your posture. But trust me, your future self will thank you if you start using proper ergonomics earlier on in life, such as a laptop stand. This simple, cheap laptop stand is perfect for your dorm room and can fold down when you don't need it. You'll need to pair it with a good mouse and keyboard once you've raised the laptop to proper eye level.

There are tons of great laptop bags for lugging your new laptop around campus with you, and it's a great time to upgrade from whatever you were using in high school. This backpack is a common sight in schools for good reason. It's versatile for school and for day hikes or weekend trips. It comes in several colors, and has a 28-liter capacity—more than enough for a 13-inch laptop, jacket, snacks, and a water bottle.

Plugable

Amazon

Plugable

Many of the laptops above don't include a full selection of ports, which you may need from time to time as a student. That's why everyone likely needs some kind of USB-C hub. I like this 9-port hub from Plugable because it supports USB-C power delivery, despite being relatively cheap. If you need something more powerful, consider the Satechi 8-in-1 Multiport Adapter or this 5-in-1 option from Anker, which is a more budget-friendly and basic alternative.

Soundpeats

Soundpeats

You can't go off to college without a decent pair of earbuds, especially since you'll be needing to focus in public places many times. Sure, a pair of AirPods works just fine, but if you're looking for a cheaper alternative, our audiophiles have tested dozens of pairs of budget earbuds to recommend the SoundPEATS Capsule3 Pro+ (10/10, WIRED Recommends) as the way to go. Despite the price of under $100, our reviewers say it has “some of the best sound in the middle and treble registers I've heard from earbuds at any price.”

Through the looking glass of silicon.

In today's world of bleeding-edge processes and packaging techniques, the Intel 386 doesn't look like much—a grey ceramic slab with 132 gold pins, something you'd expect to find rattling around in an old parts bin at this point. But behind that dull façade lies a marvel of late-1980s chip packaging, the kind of engineering we've taken for granted. Using a CT scanner and some clever digital dissection, Ken Shirriff managed to explore every layer of this classic CPU without once touching a screwdriver or desoldering gun.

The scan produced hundreds of razor-thin X-ray slices, which were stitched into a 3D model you can spin, zoom, and digitally “peel” layer by layer. The first reveal is a halo of gold bond wires, each just 35 µm thick, far thinner than a human hair, radiating from the silicon die. These act as microscopic suspension bridges between the die's pads and the package's internal routing. Some carry simple data or control signals, others gang together—up to five on a pad—to handle the heavier demands of power and ground.



Pull back another layer, and the 386's package shows its true sophistication: it's essentially a six-layer circuit board in miniature. Two internal layers carry the signals while four dedicated copper planes deliver clean, stable power and ground to different sections of the chip. This “single-row double-shelf” bonding method, described in Intel's own packaging literature attached below, was a way to cram maximum connectivity into a surprisingly compact footprint.



Digging deeper into the scans, Shirriff was able to map which pins connect where—some routing directly to I/O pads, others buried deep into the power and logic supply network. The CT imaging even caught details Intel probably never intended anyone to see, like the fine side wires used during manufacturing to electroplate the pins in gold. These plating contacts, barely visible spikes along the package edge, were confirmed when he lightly sanded the ceramic to match the scans.



Moving on, the scans compare the signal and power layers side-by-side, which reveals the design's sophistication. The signal layers are like a tangled web of thin copper paths, weaving between tiny vias, carrying all the data and control signals across the chip. They're intricate and precise, designed to navigate the complex logic inside.

Power layers, by contrast, are almost solid sheets of copper, with only a few holes where the bond pads and vias break through. These planes deliver clean, steady power and ground to the chip, making sure everything runs smoothly without interference or noise that could cause glitches.



Beneath the silicon die, the X-ray reveals a bright patch—that's silver-filled epoxy. This isn't just glue; it's a carefully chosen material that pulls heat away from the chip while also providing a direct, low-resistance ground connection. It's a subtle but vital part of how the package keeps the 386 stable and reliable under load.

The packaging acts like a bridge across massive differences in scale. Inside the silicon die, the tiniest features are about 1 micrometer wide—barely visible even under a microscope. These then expand to wiring on the die around 6 micrometers, which connect to bond pads spaced about a quarter of a millimeter apart.

Those bond pads link to package pads spaced at half a millimeter, and finally to the pins on the bottom of the chip, spaced 2.54 millimeters apart. It's an incredible zoom-out—roughly 2,500 times—from the microscopic core logic to the bulky socket pins you can see and touch.



If you lined up one of the 386's bond wires next to the socket pins it connects to, the size difference would be absurd. That's the beauty of this packaging: it not only protects the die, but transforms it from a delicate, microscopic device into a robust, installable part you could—in theory—swap in and out of a motherboard by hand.

Moreover, the 386 package includes eight pins labeled as “No Connect” (NC), meaning they aren't wired to the motherboard and appear unused. Inside the die, most of these NC pads are nearly connected, with internal wiring and pad spots ready for bond wires. Intel left these as placeholders, likely for testing or debugging during manufacturing. Interestingly, one NC pin is actually connected to the die and functions as an output, hinting at hidden signals Intel kept under wraps. Refer to the second gallery image to identify the NC pins on the die.

For enthusiasts, we highly urge you to check out the original blog post to learn more; it goes into far more detail for those intrigued and looking for more technicalities. For Intel, this ceramic multi-layer approach wasn't just about elegance; it finally broke through the company's early obsession with keeping pin counts low—a relic of Intel management's 'bizarre belief that chips should never have more than 16 pins', according to Shirriff —which limited the potential of their first processors from the 70s.

The 386 marked a culmination of Intel's move to fully embrace high pin counts and advanced packaging, recognizing that complex chips demanded sophisticated, multi-layered ceramic packages to handle power, signal integrity, and heat. This shift was pivotal, enabling the performance leaps that made modern computing possible.

It's easy to forget now, but the 386 was the CPU that made contemporary multitasking PCs possible, and its packaging was as important to that leap as its transistor count. Shirriff's CT scan work doesn't just satisfy curiosity; it's a reminder that in the early microprocessor wars, Intel invested some of the world's best engineering talent into what seemed like the most mundane aspect—"the box it comes in." Only time will tell if the once-iconic innovation powerhouse will return to its former glory.

A new study by researchers at Northwestern University has set off alarm bells about the future of academic research, warning that the publication of fraudulent science is growing at a faster rate than that of legitimate research.

Over the last four centuries, an implicit contract has been established between scientists and states: in exchange for producing knowledge useful for economic and social development, governments and other benefactors offer researchers stable careers, good salaries, and public recognition. This model, similar to that of a commercial enterprise, has proven to be efficient and has been replicated in most regions of the world.

However, recent research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) reveals that, in recent years, this system—composed of researchers, academic institutions, government agencies, private companies, and dissemination platforms—shows signs of breaking down.

The authors argue that due to the large scale and specialization of contemporary science, the contribution of each actor is no longer evaluated by the intrinsic merit of their work, but by quantitative indicators, such as the number of research papers published, how often articles are cited by other research, university rankings, or by awards and other recognitions obtained.

“These indicators have rapidly become targets for measuring institutional and personal impact, which has generated unbridled competition and growing inequality in the distribution of resources, incentives, and rewards,” the authors warn.

This in turn has led to the proliferation of fraud in some quarters of the scientific community, as researchers look for quick ways to acquire indicators of success. “The use of numerical metrics to evaluate projects and professionals … encourages the search for shortcuts,” says Pere Puigdomènech, president of the Committee for Research Integrity in Catalonia (CIR-CAT) in Spain. The types of fraud detected range from the creation of fictitious research, to plagiarism, to the buying and selling of authorship and citations in papers.

Northwestern's research shows that cases of fraud are often not isolated incidents, but rather the result of complex networks that operate systematically to undermine the integrity of science.

The research team behind this paper, led by Luis A. N. Amaral, professor of Engineering Science and Applied Mathematics at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, reached this conclusion after analyzing large volumes of data on retracted publications, editorial records, and image duplication.

Sources included major aggregators of scientific literature—such as Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and OpenAlex—as well as lists of journals removed from these databases for violating quality or ethical standards. In addition, data on retracted articles flagged by the investigative website Retraction Watch, comments on the science-paper review site PubPeer, and editorial metadata (editor names and submission and acceptance dates) were also collected and analyzed.

This analysis highlighted the work of “papermills”—unscrupulous organizations that mass-produce low-quality manuscripts and sell these, sometimes through intermediaries, to academics looking to publish material quickly. These papers often contain falsified data, manipulated or copyright-infringed images, plagiarized content, and even absurd or physically impossible claims. “These networks are essentially criminal organizations, acting together to fake the process of science,” Amaral said in a statement published by Northwestern University.

The researchers warn that more and more scientists are engaging with these networks, where they are not only acquiring articles, but also citations and authorship positions in papers, allowing them to appear prestigious without having conducted their own research.

To delve deeper into the phenomenon, the team developed a parallel project aimed at detecting articles coming from these papermills. An automatic analysis system was used on a large body of materials-engineering research and related sciences to identify authors who incorrectly reported the instruments used in their studies, a potential giveaway of a piece of research being fraudulent.

The experiment uncovered fraudulent articles even in prestigious journals such as PLOS ONE. It also detected a strategy in which these papermills seek out defunct journals to usurp their names or websites, giving the appearance of legitimacy to fake publications they then release under those titles.

“Intermediaries connect all the parties. You need someone to write the article, people willing to pay to appear as authors, a magazine willing to publish it, and editors who will accept it,” Amaral says. “Millions of dollars are invested in this process.”

To curb this threat, the Northwestern researchers propose a number of measures: strengthening the scrutiny of editorial processes, implementing more effective methods to detect false research, developing better understanding of the networks that facilitate these practices, and radically restructuring the incentive system in science.

The researchers stress that the scientific community itself must strengthen its oversight mechanisms to preserve its integrity, a challenge that becomes even more urgent with the eruption of artificial intelligence in the production and dissemination of knowledge.

“If we're not prepared to deal with the fraud that's already occurring, then we're certainly not prepared to deal with what generative AI can do to scientific literature,” warned Reese Richardson, a postdoctoral researcher at the McCormick School of Engineering and first author of the Northwestern study, in a statement. “We have no clue what's going to end up in the literature, what's going to be regarded as scientific fact and what's going to be used to train future AI models, which then will be used to write more papers.”

A new research paper was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on July 25, 2025, titled "Dissecting the functional differences and clinical features of R-spondin family members in metastatic prostate cancer."

In this study, researchers led by first author Aiden Deacon and corresponding author Justin Hwang from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities investigated a group of genes known as the R-spondin family (RSPO1/2/3/4) in advanced prostate cancer (PC). The RSPO gene family regulates Wnt signaling, a pathway involved in cancer progression.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States and becomes especially dangerous when it spreads beyond the prostate. Most patients are treated with hormone therapies that target the androgen receptor; however, many tumors eventually become resistant.

The research team analyzed thousands of tumor samples and found that RSPO2 alterations were more common than changes in other R-spondin genes or even some well-known cancer-related genes like CTNNB1 and APC. RSPO2 amplification occurred in over 20% of metastatic prostate cancer. Patients with these alterations showed signs of more aggressive disease, including higher mutation rates and greater tumor complexity.

Using laboratory models, the team discovered that RSPO2 increases cancer cell growth and triggers a biological process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is known to promote tumor spread and resistance to standard treatments. Unlike other genes in the same pathway, RSPO2 also appeared to reduce the activity of androgen receptor genes, suggesting it drives a type of prostate cancer that no longer relies on hormones for growth.

"In cell lines, RSPO2 overexpression caused up-regulation of EMT pathways, including EMT-regulatory transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2, and TWIST1."

Importantly, RSPO2 showed structural differences from other R-spondin proteins, which may allow researchers to design drugs that specifically block its activity. Current therapies targeting the Wnt pathway are limited, and there are no approved drugs that inhibit RSPO2. However, this study highlights RSPO2 as a promising therapeutic target, especially for patients who do not respond to existing hormone-based treatments.

This research adds critical knowledge about how aggressive prostate cancers develop and persist despite therapy. The identification of RSPO2 as a key driver of disease progression opens new possibilities for treatment strategies aimed at improving outcomes for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

A new generation of malaria drugs failed clinical trials, in part because they were hard to swallow. UCSF chemists remodeled their structures to make them more soluble, while maintaining their effectiveness against drug-resistant parasites.

The search for new ways to treat malaria - a disease that kills some 600,000 people a year, most of them children in Sub-Saharan Africa - may have just gotten a boost.

Chemists at UC San Francisco have found a way to rearrange the atoms in a new generation of malaria drugs to make them easier to put into pill form without forfeiting their effectiveness against the malaria parasite.

New malaria drugs are desperately needed, as the parasite that causes the disease has developed resistance to today's best therapies, and this new resistant form is spreading from Southeast Asia into Africa.

Now that drug resistance is in Africa, many more lives are at risk. These new molecules could give us the upper hand we need to control this deadly disease."

Adam Renslo, PhD, professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in the UCSF School of Pharmacy and senior author of the paper

The work, which appears Aug. 8 in Science Advances, was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

For centuries, malaria has been known for causing cyclical and sometimes deadly fevers. In the 1950s, chemists developed new and more potent malaria drugs based on quinine, an anti-malarial compound found in plants. 

Over time, the parasites evolved to resist the best of these drugs, chloroquine, and the global health community scrambled to find new ones. 

Today's most essential anti-malarial therapies include a compound called artemisinin that is found in sweet wormwood, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine. As with quinine, artemisinin gave chemists inspiration to make more effective drugs. 

Artemisinin was combined with other effective drugs into a cocktail, known as artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), that became the standard malaria treatment. But resistance appeared once again.

We've tracked artemisinin resistance for years in Southeast Asia, but we're now seeing it spread to Africa, where 95% of cases and 95% of deaths occur. Given how long it takes to develop new drugs, there is widespread consensus that we need better drugs to circumvent this resistance ASAP."

Phil Rosenthal, MD, professor of medicine at UCSF and co-author of the paper

Artefenomel, a newer artemisinin-inspired variant, was intended to replace ACTs in time to stanch the spread of artemisinin resistance, which was just beginning to emerge. It was potent enough that scientists hoped it could cure malaria in a single dose. This would have been an improvement over ACTs, which must be taken for three days in a row to be effective. 

"For a disease like malaria, you would ideally like to cure the patient with one pill or a handful of pills and be done with it," Renslo said. "A multi-day regimen risks missing a dose."

But artefenomel proved difficult to study in clinical trials. The drug had to be given as an oral suspension - it resisted dissolving, so it needed to be shaken up with a liquid and swallowed quickly. This finicky nature also made it hard to combine with other drugs in a pill. 

Children also had trouble keeping the oral suspension down after drinking it, making it hard to know whether they had received the intended dose. In January of 2025, artefenomel was pulled from clinical trials.

Renslo and his team realized that the symmetry of the artefenomel molecule might be the problem: highly symmetrical molecules tend to clump into crystals that are slow to dissolve. 

The scientists thought that a less-symmetric version of artefenomel might avoid this clumping and dissolve more readily, making it easier to put into pill form. Their first successful attempt at making this molecule proved them right when it disappeared immediately into a water-like solution. 

The team continued tweaking the new molecules, testing how they worked against malaria parasites in cells, and then animals, and finally against artemisinin-resistant parasites sourced from blood samples from malaria patients in Uganda. 

The optimized compound passed with flying colors: it was just as potent as artefenomel, and much more effective than artemisinin, against artemisinin-resistant parasites. 

"We're optimistic that a simple chemical change like this can pave the way for an effective successor to artemisinin," Renslo said, "one that's cheap to make and easy to combine with other anti-malarial drugs."

A research team from the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn, and the Medical Center - University of Freiburg has gained new insights into the brain processes involved in encoding and retrieving new memory content. The study is based on measurements of individual nerve cells in people with epilepsy and shows how they follow an internal rhythm. The work has now been published in the journal Nature Communications.

"Similar to members of an orchestra who follow a common beat, the activity of nerve cells appears to be linked to electrical oscillations in the brain, occurring one to ten times per second. The cells prefer to fire at specific times within these brain waves, a phenomenon known as theta-phase locking," says first author and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bonn, Dr. Tim Guth, who recently joined the Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience group at the UKB from the Medical Center - University of Freiburg.

The research team led by Tim Guth and Lukas Kunz found that the interaction between nerve cells and brain waves is active in both the learning and remembering of new information - specifically in the medial temporal lobe, a central area for human memory. However, in the study on spatial memory, the strength of theta-phase locking of nerve cells during memory formation was independent of whether the test subjects were later able to correctly recall the memory content. "This suggests that theta-phase locking is a general phenomenon of the human memory system, but does not alone determine successful recall," says corresponding author Prof. Dr. Lukas Kunz, head of the Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience working group at the Clinic for Epileptology at the UKB and member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) "Life & Health" at the University of Bonn.

While most nerve cells always fired at the same oscillation time, some nerve cells interestingly changed their preferred timing between learning and remembering. "This supports the theory that our brain can separate learning and retrieval processes within a brain wave, similar to members of an orchestra who start playing at different times in a piece of music," says Guth. The study provides new insights into how nerve cells and electrical signals in the brain interact while new memories are formed.

A better understanding of these processes could help us in the long term to better understand memory disorders and treat them more effectively. "

The research team was able to observe the interaction between nerve cells and brain waves during the memory process in the study by exploiting a special feature of epilepsy therapy. Patients with particularly difficult-to-treat epilepsy have electrodes implanted in their brains for diagnostic purposes. The aim is to determine the exact origin of the epileptic seizures in order to achieve better surgical results. However, these implanted electrodes can also be used to record human brain activity at the level of individual cells. The researchers used measurements taken at the Medical Center - University of Freiburg and would like to thank all patients who participated in this study.

Mitochondria, the tiny organelles without which our bodies would be deprived of energy, are gradually revealing their mysteries. In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers from Inserm and the University of Bordeaux at the NeuroCentre Magendie, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, have for the first time succeeded in establishing a causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the cognitive symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Thanks to the creation of a specific and unprecedented tool, they succeeded in increasing mitochondrial activity in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, where they observed an improvement in memory deficit symptoms. While these are only initial results, they open the door to considering mitochondria as a new therapeutic target.

The mitochondrion is a small intracellular organelle that provides the energy needed by the cell to function properly. The brain is one of the most energy-demanding organs, and neurons rely on the energy produced by mitochondria to communicate with one another. Indeed, when mitochondrial activity is impaired, neurons do not have the energy required to function correctly.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive impairment of neuronal functions leading to the death of brain cells. In Alzheimer's disease, for example, it has been observed that neuronal degeneration, which precedes cell death, is accompanied by impaired mitochondrial activity. However, due to the lack of suitable tools, it has been difficult in the past to determine whether mitochondrial alterations play a causal role in these conditions or are simply a consequence of the pathophysiological process.

In this new study, researchers from Inserm and the Université de Bordeaux, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, developed for the first time a tool that allows to temporarily stimulate mitochondrial activity. They hypothesized that if this stimulation led to an improvement of symptoms in animals, this would mean that the impairment of mitochondrial activity precedes the loss of neurons in the context of a neurodegenerative disease.

In previous studies, the research teams already described the specific role of G proteins in the modulation of mitochondrial activity in the brain. In the present paper, the researchers succeeded in generating an artificial receptor, called mitoDreadd-Gs, able to activate G proteins directly in the mitochondria, thereby stimulating mitochondrial activity. The stimulation of mitoDreadd-Gs in the brain led to the normalisation of both mitochondrial activity and memory performance of dementia mouse models.

"This work is the first to establish a cause-and-effect link between mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial activity could be at the origin of the onset of neuronal degeneration", explains Giovanni Marsicano, Inserm research director and co-senior author of the study.

"These results will need to be extended, but they allow us to better understand the important role of mitochondria in the proper functioning of our brain. Ultimately, the tool we developed could help us identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for dementia and facilitate the development of effective therapeutic targets", explains Étienne Hébert Chatelain, professor at the Université de Moncton and co-senior author of the study.

"Our work now consists of trying to measure the effects of continuous stimulation of mitochondrial activity to see whether it impacts the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and, ultimately, delays neuronal loss or even prevents it if mitochondrial activity is restored," added Luigi Bellocchio, Inserm researcher and co-senior author of the study.

Building upon the success of the first in utero brain surgery for Vein of Galen Malformation (VOGM) reported in 2023, new data published today in JAMA provides further evidence for the potential use of fetal embolization for this condition.

VOGM is the most common type of congenital blood vessel abnormality, in which the earliest arteries that develop in the brain connect directly with the dominant vein in the young brain, rather than nourishing the brain tissue. This causes a tremendous rush of high-pressure, high-flow blood into the veins, putting the fetus at high risk for mortality, heart failure, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delay. To improve outcomes for patients, a team at Boston Children's Hospital designed a fetal embolization procedure that results in markedly diminished blood flow through the malformation, without blockage, and launched a clinical trial. Outcomes from their first successful procedure were reported in Stroke in 2023.

In this new report in JAMA, the team describes outcomes from the first 7 patients enrolled in the trial; the fetal procedure was successfully completed in 5 of the 7. With standard postnatal care, even at expert referral centers, this high-risk fetal cohort had an expected 90% mortality, with only 9% likelihood of reaching developmental milestones at age 6 months. Notably, the enrolled patients had a dramatic reduction in mortality to 43%, and 3 of the 5 successfully treated patients survived past the neonatal period; all are thriving, without sign of neurodevelopmental delay. The investigators point out that five of the seven enrolled patients had unscheduled deliveries, including three preterm, at a mean of approximately 3 days post-intervention.

These early results build on the success of our first case, demonstrating the feasibility of fetal embolization for VOGM and strongly suggesting that the procedure is safe and effective, though a full trial needs to be completed in order to draw solid conclusions."

Darren Orbach, MD, PhD, Co-Director of the Cerebrovascular Surgery and Interventions Center at Boston Children's Hospital and PI of the study

The research team plans to complete a full trial of this approach, weighing potential reduction in mortality, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delays against an increased risk of unscheduled, preterm delivery.

Cornell researchers have developed an implant system that can treat Type 1 diabetes by supplying extra oxygen to densely packed insulin-secreting cells, without the need for immunosuppression. The system could also potentially provide long-term treatment for a range of chronic diseases.

The findings were published Aug. 11 in Nature Communications. The co-first authors were former postdoctoral researcher Tung Pham and doctoral candidate Lora (Phuong) Tran.

The technology builds off previous implantable encapsulation devices developed in the lab of Minglin Ma, professor of biological and environmental engineering in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) and the paper's senior author.

Ma has explored a variety of ways to address Type 1 diabetes, in which the body's immune system turns hostile and destroys insulin-producing pancreatic cell clusters, known as islets. Without insulin, the body has no way to deliver glucose – sugar – into muscle and tissue cells to generate energy. People with Type 1 diabetes typically manage the disease through daily insulin injections or insulin pumps, but even with that treatment, patients still suffer devastating effects of the disease.

Ma's previous implantable devices have proved effective in controlling blood sugar in diabetic mice, but they can only last so long.

One of the major challenges is the implant itself often dies due to the lack of oxygen after implantation. In our lab, they had success in mice that lived over one year, and they controlled the diabetes very effectively with some small capsules without oxygen generation. However, when we scale up, we need more cells, we need more density, especially. We need a higher dose. If we implant without generating oxygen, the cells often die within two weeks."

Lora (Phuong) Tran, doctoral candidate

Ma's team developed the new system in collaboration with electrochemical researchers from Giner Inc., including co-author Linda Tempelman, Ph.D. '93.

The key components of the system are a cylindrical capsule with a ring-shaped cross-section that contains transplanted insulin-secreting cells, and an electrochemical oxygen generator that is roughly the size of a dime and removeable. A nanofibrous membrane outside the capsule protects the cells from the host body's immune system; a permeable membrane in the core of the capsule allows the central supply of oxygen to reach the ring of cells.

"We have to meet two requirements," Tran said. "The first is immune protection. And second, you have to maintain mass transfer, like the glucose and other nutrients and molecules that can go in and out."

Working with Dr. James Flanders, associate professor emeritus in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the researchers successfully tested the system in rat models.

"It's the proof of concept. We really proved that oxygenation is important, and oxygenation will support high cell-density capsules," Tempelman said. "The capsules are immune protective and last for a long time without having some kind of fouling of the membrane. The body never likes when you put a foreign substance in. So that's the engineering in the Ma Lab, to look for materials and coatings for the materials that are immune protective, but also don't invoke excess response from the body because of the material."

The new system would enable a much greater number of the 2 million people who suffer from Type 1 diabetes in the U.S. to now have an islet transplant or cell therapy without requiring immune suppression, which is considered too dangerous for routine use. Also, the new system can provide much tighter sugar control, effectively curing the disease and enabling the person to eat, drink and exercise like everyone else.

The next step will be to implant the system in a pig model, and also test it with human stem cells. The researchers are interested in eventually trying to use the system for implanting different cell types in humans for long-term treatment of chronic diseases, according to Tempelman, who is CEO of Persista Bio Inc., a new startup she founded with Ma and Flanders that is licensing these technologies.

"We see an age where people will be getting implants with allogeneic cells from other human beings, from stem cell lines, and using it long term to treat things that your body is missing," Tempelman said. "Here we're missing insulin. In pain control, maybe you need more endorphins or some other molecule. In enzyme replacement therapy, you need more enzymes. We're interested in things like other autoimmune diseases where there's inflammation that's out of control.

"So maybe you could put a small molecule in that would treat inflammation, and then someone, like a Lupus patient, wouldn't have to take an oral medication. They could just have a low-level implant that provides a low amount of it."

Co-authors include Flanders; Christopher Piccirillo '24 and Alan Li '23; and Simon Stone of Giner Inc.

The research was supported, in part, by the National Institutes of Health, the Hartwell Foundation, Breakthrough T1D and Novo Nordisk.

A new study shows how the single-molecule organization of receptors in a cellular context determines the function of antibodies, opening up new pathways for the development of cancer immunotherapies.

Therapeutic antibodies have transformed cancer treatment, yet the exact molecular mechanisms that drive their therapeutic effects have remained elusive. A team led by Ralf Jungmann (Chair Professor for Molecular Physics of Life at LMU and leader of the Molecular Imaging and Bionanotechnology research group at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry) has now taken an unprecedented look at how therapeutic antibodies reshape receptor organization at the single-molecule level, and how this affects the function of the antibodies.

Using Resolution Enhancement by Sequential Imaging (RESI) - a novel super-resolution microscopy technique capable of visualizing single proteins - the researchers directly imaged the nanoscale architecture of CD20 receptors and their interactions with widely used anti-CD20 antibodies such as Rituximab and Obinutuzumab.

"For the first time, we can visualize in intact cells how antibody-receptor complexes organize at the single-protein level," explains Ralf Jungmann, senior author of the study, which was published recently in the journal Nature Communications. "These nanoscale patterns directly correlate with therapeutic function and provide a blueprint for rational antibody design."

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies act through multiple mechanisms - triggering immune cells, activating complement pathways, or directly inducing cell death. These effects depend on how antibodies bind and reorganize receptors on the cell surface. However, traditional imaging methods lacked the resolution to reveal these arrangements in their native cellular context.

The Jungmann team overcame this barrier by implementing multi-target 3D RESI imaging, a method that labels receptors and antibodies with orthogonal DNA barcodes and sequentially visualizes them at sub-nanometer precision. This allowed the team to resolve the organization of CD20 receptors and their bound antibodies directly on the cell membrane.

We can now directly see how structural changes in antibody design translate into different receptor patterns and cellular responses. This opens the door to structure-guided development of next-generation monoclonal antibodies."

Isabelle Pachmayr, first author of the study

Beyond CD20, this RESI technology is capable of investigating virtually any membrane receptor and therapeutic antibody with molecular resolution directly at intact cells. Because RESI visualizes whole cells with high throughput, it enables systematic analysis of antibody candidates at a resolution previously only accessible through cryo-EM, but now directly in the cellular environment and with unique molecular specificity.

Looking ahead, the team envisions combining RESI with the imaging of multiple receptors and intracellular signaling molecules to map entire therapeutic pathways. "For the first time, RESI combines the structure of nanoscale receptors with their function in a cellular context," summarizes Jungmann. "This technology has the potential to fundamentally transform immunotherapies."

Women who reported having been stalked or obtained a restraining order were each more likely to experience a heart attack and/or stroke in later years compared to those who did not, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's flagship journal Circulation.

"Although violence against women is common, and evidence has linked violence with consequences for women's later heart health, it is still not widely recognized or routinely considered by health care professionals as a potential cardiovascular risk factor among women," said study author Rebecca B. Lawn, Ph.D., a research associate in epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston and at the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

"We felt it was essential to look beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors in women and strengthen our understanding of the relationship between underexplored types of violence and heart health."

About 1 in 3 women have been stalked at some point in their lives, according to data on intimate partner violence collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study notes that common forms of violence against women, such as stalking, are rarely discussed in cardiovascular research. Lawn's previous research linked sexual assault and workplace harassment to higher blood pressure in women. Other studies report that people with restraining orders are more likely to experience poorer health.

Researchers analyzed stalking, restraining orders, and heart disease or stroke development among participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, from 2001 to 2021. The analysis includes data for more than 66,000 women, average age 46 years in 2001. These women did not have cardiovascular disease in 2001, when they first shared whether they had experienced stalking or stalking harassment behaviors, such as receiving unsolicited correspondence, that made them fearful. The study also asked if participants had "ever taken out" a restraining order, which is a legal document that seeks to limit contact between a victim and perpetrator. Obtaining a restraining order was considered a sign of severe violence.

The analysis found:

Stalking is often seen as a form of violence that does not involve physical contact, which may make it seem less serious. However, our findings suggest stalking should not be minimized. Stalking can be chronic, and women often report making significant changes in response such as moving."

Rebecca B. Lawn, Ph.D., research associate in epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston and at the School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada

Harmony R. Reynolds, M.D., FAHA, immediate past chair of the American Heart Association's Clinical Cardiology & Stroke Women's Health Science Committee, said she was surprised at the strong association this study found between stalking and cardiovascular disease.

"A variety of stressful life experiences are known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including adverse childhood experiences, financial stressors, grief and other experiences," Reynolds said. "People subjected to intimate partner violence face about a 30% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next few years compared to others. While this study shows a more moderate risk, given the long-time frame, it highlights how feeling unsafe can affect the body, in addition to the mind."

Reynolds, the Joel and Joan Smilow Professor of Cardiology and Director of the Sarah Ross Soter Center for Women's Cardiovascular Research at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, was not involved in this research, and noted that the effects of stress can be long-lasting. "Perhaps because it is our nature to re-think about things that happen to us, making us experience the situation over and over. However, social support may mitigate the effects of stress. It's helpful to have people you can trust to talk with, whether they are family, friends, people in the community or professionals," she said.

Study authors note that the link between stalking and cardiovascular disease may be due to psychological distress, which may disrupt the nervous system, proper blood vessel function and other biological processes; however, these potential mechanisms were not examined in detail in this study.

Lawn said more research, as well as training for health care professionals, is needed to understand the link between stalking or obtaining a restraining order and women's cardiovascular health.

"We also need to increase awareness about the potential health harms of experiencing violence and provide women with help and resources," she said.

Among the study's limitations are that participants-U.S. registered nurses-were mostly non-Hispanic white women. The findings may not apply to other populations or groups of people. The study notes that previous research indicated that, "violence history, including stalking, is more common among women from minority racial/ethnic backgrounds and those with low income." In addition, the study relied on participants self-reporting their history of experiencing stalking and restraining orders.

Routine childhood and adolescent immunizations declined in Michigan between 2017 and 2023, particularly among counties with lower household income and higher uninsurance rates, a new study suggests.

For many key pediatric vaccines, completion rates dropped sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic and have not yet recovered, according to Michigan Medicine led findings in Pediatrics.  

"Our findings show that progress towards increasing childhood and adolescent immunizations is stalling in Michigan, increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases," said senior author Kao-Ping Chua, M.D., Ph.D., a pediatrician and researcher at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and the director of the Susan B. Meister Child Health Evaluation and Research (CHEAR) Center.

Researchers analyzed county-level data from Michigan's immunization registry between 2017 and 2023. During the study period, completion rates of a recommended group of childhood immunizations among toddlers (including vaccines for pertussis, polio, and measles-mumps-rubella among others) fell from nearly 76% to 67%.

Meanwhile, completion rates of a recommended group of vaccinations among adolescents (including vaccines for meningitis, pertussis, and tetanus) declined from about 81% to 75%.

The study also assessed adolescent completion rates of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series – which can prevent several types of cancers, including cervical and throat cancer. Although completion rates rose modestly - from 35% to 42% for males and 43% to 45% for females - the increases were smaller than expected based on pre-pandemic trends, in part because the rate of increase slowed after the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Our findings suggest that the pandemic interrupted the progress that was being made in increasing HPV vaccination rates in adolescents."  

Kao-Ping Chua, M.D., Ph.D., pediatrician and researcher at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children's Hospital 

The researchers examined trends in immunization completion rates by county socioeconomic factors, including income and insurance coverage. The decline in the completion rates of the recommended group of childhood and adolescent immunizations was greater in counties with lower income and higher uninsurance, while the increase in the rate of the male HPV vaccination series was slower.

"These changes often resulted in the creation of new gaps in immunization completion rates by county income or uninsurance rate or the widening of pre-existing gaps", said Chua, who notes that this is one of the first studies to examine recent changes in childhood and adolescent immunizations by county characteristics.

Vaccines have long been one of the most effective tools in public health. In 2019, childhood immunizations were estimated to prevent over 24 million cases of vaccine-preventable diseases nationwide. Yet in 2025, the U.S. reported its highest number of measles cases in 33 years - a disease that had been declared eliminated in the country in 2000.

Michigan also saw a spike in measles with more than a dozen cases reported in 2025 as well as pertussis (whooping cough), with 855 cases reported the same year, including 152 in children under two.

"Reversing the declines in childhood and adolescent immunizations is crucial to prevent further outbreaks of measles and pertussis, both in Michigan and in the U.S. more broadly," Chua said.

"To achieve this goal, broad-based efforts to increase immunization rates in all counties should be coupled with targeted efforts focused on counties with lower income and higher uninsurance rates."

Experts have created a customizable, web-based tool that provides state and local leaders with tailored resources to reduce lung cancer mortality rates and advance treatment. The tool's development and features are described in an article published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths worldwide, screening rates have remained low, leading to delayed diagnoses and care and ultimately resulting in high mortality rates.

To reduce lung cancer deaths, the American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable (ACS NLCRT) was founded in 2017 to unite public, private, and non-profit groups, with more than 200 leading patient advocacy organizations, professional medical societies, state and federal government agencies, cancer centers, academic institutions, health systems, health plans, and corporate associations joining together to lend their expertise. Among its 10 task groups, the State-Based Initiatives (SBI) Task Group was charged to provide states with tailored resources, best practices, and implementation strategies to address lung cancer, and to create a centralized, web-based tool.

The SBI Planning Tool was developed through meetings, interviews, and usability testing, and the website's content, layout, and navigability were reviewed biweekly. User feedback was also gathered through surveys. The developers made an effort to allow users to navigate the webpage towards tailored recommendations based on their needs because every state or region has unique challenges and assets dependent on existing work in lung cancer, availability of funds, policies in place, levels of provider engagement, and community perceptions.

Also, as limiting interventions to better-resourced communities without including underserved areas could worsen geographic, demographic, and cultural disparities in lung cancer outcomes, a focus on health equity was integrated throughout the SBI Planning Tool.

Before the ACS NLCRT was established, but more so after, state coalitions focused on public health initiatives to reduce lung cancer deaths have sprung up. It is often said that 'all public health is local,' and the aim of the ACS NLCRT State-Based Initiatives Task Group is to give local leaders, health care professionals, and advocates the tools to efficiently and effectively develop tailored programs to advance lung cancer control in their state. Among the many achievements of the ACS NLCRT, the development of the SBI Planning tool ranks high on the list."

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workers whose jobs have been reinstated after dizzying Trump administration disruptions say they remain stuck in a budgetary, political, and professional limbo.

Their work includes major agency priorities such as HIV testing and monitoring, as well as work at the nation's leading sexually transmitted infections lab. And while employees are back, many projects have been canceled or stalled, as funding disappears or is delayed.

"For a while, work was staring at a blank screen," an HIV scientist said. "I had a couple of projects before this. I'm trying to get them restarted."

"We don't know what's happening or what to do," said an HIV prevention researcher who was fired then rehired.

These employees voiced deep concern over the future of the agency and its work on HIV and other threats. The unprecedented downsizing could lead to loss of life and higher spending on medical care, they say. Their uncertain employment status has sunk morale. Many worry about the future of public health.

On Aug. 8, a gunman identified by Georgia authorities as Patrick Joseph White fired shots at CDC buildings in Atlanta. A first responder on the scene, DeKalb County police officer David Rose, was killed. White, who was found dead, was possibly motivated by his views on vaccines, according to news reports.

The attack added another level of anxiety for agency workers.

"We feel threatened from inside, and, obviously, now from outside," a lab scientist said Aug. 10. "The trauma runs so differently in all of us. And is this the last straw for some of us? The overall morale — would you go back in the building and you could be shot at?"

Healthbeat interviewed 11 CDC workers, who offered a rare glimpse into conditions at the agency. All but one had been fired then offered their jobs back. Most have worked on HIV-related projects for at least several years. All spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing a fear of retaliation.

They fear their employment, in the HIV scientist's terms, "is on shaky ground."

"I'm concerned there is chaos and that we lost ground on HIV prevention" from reductions in data collection and layoffs of local public health workers, an HIV epidemiologist said. "I feel like a pawn on a chessboard."

HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard responded to a query with this statement:

"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, the nation's critical public health functions remain intact and effective. The Trump administration is committed to protecting essential services — whether it's supporting coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH, safeguarding public health through lead prevention, or researching and tracking the most prevalent communicable diseases. HHS is streamlining operations without compromising mission-critical work. Enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans remains our top priority."

The workers received some positive news July 31, when a Senate committee voted to keep CDC funding at more than $9 billion, near its current level. "It is very encouraging, but that's only one step in the appropriations process," the HIV researcher said.

Still, under the Trump administration's budget request, the CDC's programs on HIV face uncertainty. John Brooks, who retired as chief medical officer of the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention last year, expressed concern over the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. Launched in President Donald Trump's first term, it "breathed new life into HIV prevention," Brooks said.

The successes of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative are jeopardized by the administration plan to scale back HIV prevention efforts, Brooks said. That would include the potential elimination of the CDC Division of HIV Prevention, which provides funds to state health departments and other groups for testing and prevention, conducts HIV monitoring and surveillance, researches HIV prevention and care, and assists medical professionals with training and education.

"There is no way to achieve the goals of EHE without maintaining the national prevention infrastructure it depends on," Brooks said. "There is every reason to worry that in fact new HIV infections will rise again."

Under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Department of Health and Human Services carried out widespread layoffs at the CDC and other health agencies beginning in early April. Lawsuits over those mass firings are playing out in federal courts.

The administration's budget blueprint would move CDC HIV work — with many fewer employees, according to people Healthbeat interviewed — to the Administration for a Healthy America, a new HHS division Kennedy has championed.

The Medical Monitoring Project, which tracks outcomes, quality, and gaps in HIV treatment, is set to be a casualty under the Trump restructuring plan, an HIV prevention physician said.

HHS officials have not communicated with the rank and file about the restructuring, several CDC workers said.

"It's been crickets," the HIV scientist said.

The White House's proposed CDC budget for the next fiscal year contains a cut of more than 50%, plummeting from $9.2 billion in fiscal year 2025 to about $4.2 billion, according to administration documents and public health advocacy groups, with some agency functions transferred to the proposed AHA. The Senate committee, by an overwhelming vote, injected billions back into the agency budget and declined to fund the AHA.

U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, thanked the committee for "rejecting the unacceptable effort to defund most of the CDC."

"The budget request from the White House included a 56% cut to the world's preeminent epidemiological agency," Ossoff said. He also criticized a "systematic destruction of morale at the CDC, the disbandment of entire agencies focused on maternal health and neonatal health and disease prevention at the CDC."

If the White House prevails and the prevention program is eliminated, "we would see most states have no funding for HIV prevention," said Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs for the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors. "That means most states would not be able to conduct any HIV testing, any referral to care, and/or referral to preventive services like PrEP," or pre-exposure prophylaxis, a drug that can prevent HIV infections.

"It means that states would not be able to help people get access to medications," she said, "and that means that we would see new cases and an increased spread of HIV across the United States."

"We would definitely see layoffs at the CDC, and I think we'd probably see them at state health departments and community-based organizations as well," she added.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has recently laid off or reassigned dozens of HIV workers due to funding problems, according to a statement emailed to Healthbeat.

"I fear all HIV prevention work will go away permanently," the HIV prevention researcher said. "I don't think this administration wants HIV prevention work to be done by the federal government."

Georgia leads U.S. states in the rate of new HIV infections, according to the latest data from AIDSVu. CDC workers also said they're concerned that vulnerable communities of color and LGBTQ+ communities would be deeply harmed by funding cuts.

In Georgia and other states, information provided by the Medical Monitoring Project about access to care will disappear, the HIV physician said. Information on prevention and treatment will dwindle for people who are disadvantaged, he said, including those with substance abuse problems or mental illness, transgender people, and those living in poverty.

"There is a lot of anger and sadness among people over the termination of the project," the physician said. "A lot of the enthusiasm is gone."

An effective home testing program for HIV plans to shutter this fall, said Patrick Sullivan, the Together TakeMeHome project's lead scientist and a professor at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. In its notice canceling funding for the project, the CDC said it no longer had the staff to oversee it. Based at Emory, the project delivered more than 900,000 free home testing kits to people across the country through an easy-to-use website and integration with dating apps.

More than 100 HIV workers were among the more than 450 CDC staffers brought back, said employees interviewed by Healthbeat. Some cited media coverage, support in Congress, and advocacy by patient groups and pharmaceutical companies for their reinstatement. "Members of Congress are going to bat for HIV," the epidemiologist said.

Several are closely watching a lawsuit brought by 20 Democratic attorneys general, seeking to halt an agency restructuring plan Kennedy announced in March. They are also paying attention to a lawsuit filed in California that challenges the firings.

A few people whose jobs were restored have retired or moved on to other work. "Some people aren't trusting we will remain, so they're leaving," the HIV prevention researcher said.

At the CDC's sexually transmitted infections lab in Atlanta, work has also slowed due to a shrinking staff and new spending constraints on supplies, the lab scientist said.

Restored lab workers are focusing on high-priority areas such as syphilis and gonorrhea while other diseases have been back-burnered, the scientist said, adding "a lot of what we were doing was staying ahead of the next pathogen, and we feel like our time and effort to do that now is limited."

"We're all public health because we know what the mission is," the scientist said. "We just want to get our job done and protect the American public."

A tapering strategy for TNF inhibitors maintained low disease activity in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and those with axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) over 24 months. Protocol-driven tapering achieved a greater reduction in the mean dose of TNF inhibitors than routine care tapering, with both methods equally effective for disease control.

“[T]hese data indicate that a taper-to-target strategy is effective and leads to substantial TNF inhibitor dose reduction, but optimal execution of such a strategy in routine care is more challenging than in the context of a clinical trial,” the authors of the study wrote. “Considering the risks and benefits of tapering, we suggest that disease activity-guided tapering could enable more optimized and personalized treatment in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis.”

The study was led by Amy C.D. Peeters, MD, and Celia A.J. Michielsens, MD, PhD, Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It was published online on July 24, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

Measurements for disease activity were missing at 18 and 24 months. The absence of validated flare criteria until 2022 may have led to an overestimation of flare incidence. Radiographic progression was not assessed at the 24-month follow-up. Allowing tapering in the control group during the extension phase reduced the difference between groups.

The study was funded by ReumaNederland. Some authors reported receiving grants from multiple companies including Novartis, Eli Lilly and Company, and AbbVie to their institution. One author reported receiving support for attending meetings and/or travel from Pfizer, Novartis, and UCB.

A new DNA methylation-based blood test can identify type 2 diabetes patients at the highest risk of heart attack or stroke years in advance, beating traditional risk scores and opening the door to earlier, more targeted prevention.

In a recent study published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, researchers identified epigenetic biomarkers predicting incident macrovascular events (iMEs) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

People with T2D have two to four times higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than non-diabetic individuals. Identifying individuals at risk for macrovascular events (MEs) is crucial for disease prevention. Nonetheless, ME prediction in people with T2D is suboptimal. While risk stratification scores for CVD are available, they have a moderate ability to stratify T2D patients. As such, there is a need to identify new biomarkers to improve CVD and ME prediction in T2D subjects.

In the present study, researchers identified blood-based epigenetic biomarkers to predict iMEs in people newly diagnosed with T2D. They included 752 participants with newly diagnosed T2D with available DNA methylation (DNAm) data and without known MEs from the All New Diabetics in Scania (ANDIS) and Uppsala County (ANDiU) cohorts in the “prospective cohort for MEs in T2D.” Of these, 102 individuals developed MEs over a mean follow-up of about four years and a maximum of seven years, while 650 did not.

The researchers analyzed DNAm of over 853,000 sites in blood to identify epigenetic biomarkers associated with future MEs. They found that DNAm of 461 sites was associated with iMEs using a Cox regression model adjusted for gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). These sites, annotated to 422 genes, were distributed across the genome.



Garcı´a-Calzo´ n et al. identify a bloodbased epigenetic biomarker tool that helps predict future cardiovascular disease, which individuals with type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop. Their findings support the use of epigenetic biomarkers to improve risk stratification and guide more personalized prevention strategies in diabetes care.

Further, results remained consistent, with about 453 sites associated with iMEs, after additional adjustment for medications, smoking, lipid profiles, and cell composition. Next, the team examined whether a methylation risk score (MRS) would predict future MEs in individuals newly diagnosed with T2D. Methylation sites with absolute methylation differences ≥ 2% between controls and individuals with iMEs were filtered for inclusion in the MRS.

The MRS included 87 methylation sites; most sites (74%) were hypomethylated in those with iMEs relative to controls. Besides, the MRS was significantly different between controls and individuals with MEs. Next, the team performed five-fold cross-validation using logistic models to assess whether the MRS could differentiate between controls and individuals with iMEs in the prospective cohort for MEs in T2D.

For comparison, a cross-validation analysis was performed with only clinical risk factors of MEs. Moreover, the combination of clinical factors and MRS was examined. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that the MRS predicted iMEs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81, while clinical risk factors alone predicted iMEs with an AUC of 0.69. The combination of the MRS and clinical risk factors yielded an AUC of 0.84.

Statistical testing showed the MRS performed significantly better than clinical risk factors alone (p = 0.001), and the combined model significantly outperformed clinical risk factors (p = 1.7 × 10⁻¹¹). Precision–recall analysis, appropriate for imbalanced data, also showed improved sensitivity and precision for MRS-based models.

Next, the ability of MRS to predict MEs was compared with established CVD risk scores, a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on 204 coronary artery disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and epigenetic clocks of mortality and aging. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and SCORE2-Diabetes risk scores that predict CVD in diabetic individuals had AUCs of 0.54 and 0.62, respectively, in predicting MEs.

The PRS, epigenetic clocks and mortality, and other risk scores (multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis, atherosclerotic CVD, and Framingham risk scores) were significantly worse than MRS or MRS plus clinical factors, with AUCs ranging between 0.61 and 0.68. The optimal cutoff point for the combined biomarker tool, which showed the best prediction, was estimated to be 0.023, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.804 and 0.728, respectively. At this cutoff, the model achieved a high negative predictive value of 95.9% and a moderate positive predictive value of 31.8%, meaning it could reliably identify individuals unlikely to experience iMEs but was less accurate for confirming those at risk. Net reclassification improvement analyses showed a 28.2% categorical and 90.2% continuous improvement over clinical risk factors alone. The test was estimated to cost approximately $200 per sample, a factor the authors suggest could be feasible for clinical screening if used selectively in high-risk populations.

Further, the researchers evaluated whether the 64 genes annotated to 87 methylation sites in MRS exhibit differential expression in carotid plaques from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. They found differential expression of four genes in plaques from symptomatic patients compared to asymptomatic patients. They also reported that 72% of the MRS genes had prior links to CVD in literature or GWAS data, and that several methylation sites overlapped with those differentially methylated in aortic plaque tissue.

Next, the team performed validation analyses of the methylation sites associated with iMEs in OPTIMED and EPIC-Potsdam cohorts. They validated 43 and 32 methylation sites in OPTIMED and EPIC-Potsdam cohorts, respectively, using Cox regression models adjusted for BMI, age, gender, and HbA1c. Moreover, five out of 87 sites in the MRS were associated with iMEs in the OPTIMED cohort.

An MRS developed using these five sites (MRS5sites) was significantly different between controls and individuals with iMEs in the OPTIMED cohort and the prospective cohort for MEs in T2D. The combination of clinical risk factors and MRS5sites had an AUC of 0.8 in the OPTIMED cohort and 0.78 in the prospective cohort of MEs in T2D. Notably, OPTIMED included newly diagnosed T2D participants, whereas EPIC-Potsdam was a general population cohort, supporting the broader applicability of the findings.

In sum, the study identified and validated a blood-based epigenetic biomarker predicting the risk of the first ME, in combination with and independently of clinical risk factors, in individuals newly diagnosed with T2D. T2D subjects with an MRS in combination with clinical risk factors of more than 0.023 were likely to develop MEs over the maximum follow-up of seven years. Overall, the epigenetic biomarker predicts iMEs better than established risk scores, supporting its future clinical use.

The authors note, however, that external validation in other ethnicities is needed, and that the moderate PPV likely reflects the low prevalence of events in this newly diagnosed population. They also caution that environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, and medications can influence DNA methylation, and that these were not fully captured in the current cohorts.

People who practised blowing through a conch shell regularly for six months experienced a reduction in their symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), according to a small randomised controlled trial published today (Monday) in ERJ Open Research.

OSA is a common sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops during the night due to a blocked airway. It leads to loud snoring, restless sleep and daytime sleepiness. It also increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.

Blowing the conch shell, or shankh blowing, has been part of Indian culture for thousands of years. The new research showed that people with moderate OSA who practised shankh blowing slept better, felt more alert during the day and had fewer breathing interruptions at night. The researchers say conch blowing is a simple, low-cost intervention that could help reduce symptoms without the need for medication or machines.

The study was led by Dr. Krishna K Sharma from the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India.

The standard treatment for OSA is a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, which keeps the patient's airway open by blowing air through a facemask throughout the night. While effective, many patients find it uncomfortable and struggle to use it consistently.

In my clinical practice, several patients reported feeling more rested and experiencing fewer symptoms after regularly practising shankh blowing – a traditional yogic breathing exercise involving exhaling through a conch shell. These observations led us to design a scientific study to rigorously test whether this simple, ancient practice could serve as a meaningful therapy for people with OSA."

Dr. Krishna K Sharma, Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute, India

The study included 30 people with moderate OSA, aged between 19 and 65, who were assessed at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute between May 2022 and January 2024. They were tested with polysomnography, meaning they are monitored throughout a night's sleep, and asked questions about the quality of their sleep and how sleepy they feel during the day.

They were randomly assigned to either be trained to practise blowing through a conch shell (16 patients) or to practise a deep breathing exercise (14 patients). Participants were provided with a traditional shankh used in yogic practices. They were trained in person at the clinic by a study team member before beginning home-based practice. Participants were encouraged to practise at home for a minimum of 15 minutes, five days per week. After six months, the patients were reassessed.

Compared to the people who practised deep breathing, the people who practised shankh blowing were 34% less sleepy during the daytime, they reported sleeping better and polysomnography revealed that they had four to five fewer apnoeas (where breathing stops during sleep) per hour on average. They also had higher levels of oxygen in their blood during the night.

Dr. Sharma said: "The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive. It involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate – areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA. The shankh's unique spiralling structure may also contribute to specific acoustic and mechanical effects that further stimulate and tone these muscles.

"For people living with OSA, especially those who find CPAP uncomfortable, unaffordable, or inaccessible, our findings offer a promising alternative. Shankh blowing is a simple low-cost, breathing technique that could help improve sleep and reduce symptoms without the need for machines or medication.

"This is a small study, but we are now planning a larger trial involving several hospitals. This next phase will allow us to validate and expand on our findings in a broader, more diverse population and assess how shankh blowing performs over longer periods. We also want to study how this practice affects airway muscle tone, oxygen levels and sleep in greater detail. We're particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of OSA."

Professor Sophia Schiza, Head of the ERS group on sleep disordered breathing, based at the University of Crete, Greece, who was not involved in the research said: "Obstructive sleep apnoea is a common disease around the world. We know that OSA patients have poor quality of sleep, and higher risks of high blood pressure, strokes and heart disease. A proportion of patients experience sleepiness during the day. While CPAP and other treatments are available based on careful diagnosis of disease severity, there is still need for new treatments.

"This is an intriguing study that shows the ancient practice of shankh blowing could potentially offer an OSA treatment for selected patients by targeting muscles training. A larger study will help provide more evidence for this intervention which could be of benefit as a treatment option or in combination with other treatments in selected OSA patients."

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have discovered a new pathway by which cells counteract the action of alovudine, an important antiviral and anticancer drug. The protein flap endonuclease-1 (Fen1) was found to improve cell tolerance by counteracting the toxic accumulation of another protein, 53BP1. A renewed spotlight on the underappreciated role of Fen1 promises not only new cancer treatments, but a way to gauge the efficacy of existing treatments.

Chain-terminating nucleoside analogs (CTNAs) are molecules which closely resemble nucleosides, the building blocks of DNA. They have been used as antiviral and cancer treatments since the 1980s due to their ability to bind to DNA as they are replicated. Since replication rates are abnormally high in infected or cancerous cells, these cells take up more of the drug, suppressing their growth. However, there is much that we don't know about how healthy cells resist the action of CTNA toxicity, limiting how we put them to good use. For example, alovudine, a CTNA containing fluorine, was envisioned as an HIV treatment, but clinical trials were stopped at phase II due to their toxicity.

A team led by Professor Kouji Hirota of Tokyo Metropolitan University have been looking at the pathways by which healthy cells resist the action of CTNAs. In previous work on alovudine, they had discovered the important role played by breast cancer type I susceptibility protein (BRCA1), a key player in DNA repair. Now, they have turned to the underappreciated role played by flap endonuclease-1 (Fen1), another DNA repair protein responsible for cutting off short, single-stranded DNA sections hanging off a replicating section of DNA known as an Okazaki fragment.

In their experiments with genetically modified chicken DT40 cells, a common model system, the team discovered that suppression of Fen1 made cells extremely susceptible to alovudine toxicity, with replication speeds significantly reduced. Strikingly, they discovered that the further loss of a gene encoding for an entirely different protein led to recovery of alovudine tolerance. Known as 53BP1, this protein is known to collect at nicks in double-stranded DNA. This suggests a mechanism where a lack of Fen1 firstly leads to long overhangs, or "flaps", being left on replicating DNA. When alovudine is incorporated, the 53BP1 accumulates around the flap, impeding other available mechanisms for cleaving off the overhang, effectively terminating DNA replication.

The team also carried out experiments extending their previous work on BRCA1. At the time, they found that homologous recombination (HR), a key DNA repair pathway involving BRCA1, was significant in their alovudine tolerance. While having either Fen1 or HR suppressed led to lowered resistance, having both led to significantly more suppression. This suggests that the newly found significance of Fen1 is independent of the previous role identified for BRCA1.

A deeper understanding of CTNA tolerance might yield not only promising new treatments but also effect biomarking of cancerous cells which often have a Fen1 deficiency, and a way to ascertain how effective drugs like alovudine might be. The team aims to move to studies in human cells, and work on how such treatments might be applied to different cancerous tissues, such as solid tumors.

This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grants-in-Aid (JP25K02256, JP21K19235, JP20H04337, JP22K15040, and 19KK0210), Tokyo Metropolitan Government Advanced Research Grant Number (R3-[2]), the Takeda Science Foundation, and the Uehara Memorial Foundation.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated Kenya as having eliminated human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness as a public health problem, making it the tenth country to reach this important milestone. HAT is the second neglected tropical disease (NTD) to be eliminated in Kenya: the country was certified free of Guinea worm disease in 2018.

"I congratulate the government and people of Kenya on this landmark achievement," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. "Kenya joins the growing ranks of countries freeing their populations of human African trypanosomiasis. This is another step towards making Africa free of neglected tropical diseases".

HAT is a vector-borne disease caused by the blood parasite Trypanosoma brucei. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of tsetse flies that have acquired the parasites from infected humans or animals. Rural populations dependent on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting are most at risk of exposure.

As the name indicates, HAT is transmitted only on the African continent. The disease exists in two forms, gambiense and rhodesiense. The rhodesiense form (r-HAT), which is found in eastern and southern Africa, is the only one present in Kenya. It is caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and progresses rapidly, invading multiple organs including the brain. Without treatment, it is fatal within weeks.

"This validation marks a major public health milestone for Kenya, as we celebrate the elimination of a deadly disease in our country. The achievement will not only protect our people but also pave the way for renewed economic growth and prosperity," said Dr Aden Duale, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for Health. "This follows many years of dedication, hard work and collaboration".

The first cases of HAT in Kenya were detected in the early 20th century. Since then, Kenya has engaged in consistent control activities, without indigenous new cases reported for over 10 years. The last autochthonous case was detected in 2009, and the last two exported cases, infected in the Masai Mara National Reserve, were detected in 2012.

Recently, Kenya strengthened HAT surveillance in 12 health facilities in six historically endemic counties to act as sentinel sites. They were equipped with diagnostic tools and had their clinical personnel trained on diagnostic procedures, including the most sensitive and practical tests for r-HAT. The country also actively monitors the control and surveillance of tsetse flies and animal trypanosomiasis, both within and beyond the historical HAT endemic areas, supported by the national veterinary health authorities and the Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council (KENTTEC). These activities and the related data provide supplementary backing to the claim of HAT elimination as a public health problem.

"This key milestone reflects Kenya's efforts and commitment over many years, as a collaboration between national and county governments, national research institutions, development partners and affected communities," said Dr Patrick Amoth, EBS, Director General Health, Ministry of Health, Kenya. "The country remains fully committed to sustain the quality of care and surveillance in line with WHO's recommendations".

Supported by WHO and partners, including FIND, Kenya's HAT elimination programme will now implement a post-validation surveillance plan to detect any potential resurgence or reintroduction of transmission. WHO continues to support ongoing monitoring in previously affected areas and maintains a stock of medicines to ensure rapid treatment of possible future cases, thanks to donations from Bayer AG and Sanofi.

This success was made possible by the Ministry of Health's leadership, the dedication of health workers in areas at risk and the support from key partners. WHO is proud to have contributed to this achievement and encourages all stakeholders to remain involved in post-validation monitoring".

Dr. Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO Representative to Kenya

A total of 57 countries have eliminated at least one NTD. Of these, 10 (including Kenya) have successfully eliminated HAT as a public health problem. The other countries that have reached this milestone are Benin, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Rwanda, Togo and Uganda.

Several European leagues kicked off the new season this weekend, and MLS is in full form in the second half of the year, including the Leagues Cup, which means there's a ton of U.S. Men's National Team talent pool action to catch up on.

Let's rewind some of the USMNT's top moments at their respective clubs from this weekend:

Chris Richards started the new season with Crystal Palace the same way he ended last season — by lifting silverware. Richards won the FA Cup with his club in the spring, and most recently, Crystal Palace beat Liverpool in a dramatic penalty shootout to win the FA Community Shield.

Richards played 90 minutes in the match on the back line. His growing accolades come at a time when the 25-year-old center back stepped into a leading role over the summer for the USA in the Concacaf Gold Cup.

Last week in the Dutch Super Cup, Sergiño Dest helped PSV win the Johan Cruyff Shield to begin the season. In the first regular-season match, Dest scored again. Just before half-time, Dest netted PSV's third goal on the way to a relentless 6-1 victory.

It's a great showing for Dest, who missed much of last season rehabbing from an ACL injury. The right back hasn't played for the National Team since March 2024, as he continued to come back, but if he continues on this track he could be a piece to consider heading into the next few USMNT camps as the group prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

In the group stage of the Leagues Cup, Max Arfsten sent home the game-winner for Columbus in the 1-0shutout win against León, a Liga MX club.

Arfsten picked up a quick pass from his Crew teammateAndres Herrera, and managed to regain control of the ball with a dribble before knocking it high into the far post. The winger has scored six goals across all competitions for the Crew this season. Columbus won two of its three group stage matches in Leagues Cup but won't advance to the knockout round because of goal differential.

The transfer window has seen a slew of moves for USMNT players. Midfielder Malik Tillman, who had a strong Gold Cup, transferred to Leverkusen (Bundesliga). Tim Weah made the move from Juventus (Serie A) to Olympique de Marseille (Ligue 1). Matt Turner returned home to the New England Revolution (MLS). Strikers Patrick Agyemang (Derby County) and Damian Downs (Southampton) both signed with EFL Championship, Division II English squads.

Downs had quite the introduction in his first match with his new team. He subbed on in the 60th minute when Southampton was down 1-0 to Wrexham, but the Saints stunningly scored an equalizer and the game-winning goal in the 90th minute and in stoppage time, respectively. Downs assisted Jack Stephen on the go-ahead score in 90+6.

The NWSL season rolls on as Matchday 15 is in the books. More than halfway through the 2025 regular season, the race to the playoffs heats up. U.S. Women's National Team players were, as always, right in the thick of it.

Meanwhile, the European leagues are set to begin later this fall, with club friendlies already kicking off.

Let's rewind some of the USWNT's top moments at their respective clubs from this weekend:

The rivalry between the Portland Thorns and Seattle Reign FC is one of the strongest in the NWSL. USWNT defensive midfielder Sam Coffey got in on the action, scoring one of four goals for the Thorns in the victory.

In the 18th minute, Coffey stepped up to take a penalty kick and smashed the ball into the bottom right corner of the net to equalize after Seattle scored early in the match. The Thorns would score three more times before the final whistle to finish with a 4-2 scoreline at full time.

It was Coffey's second goal of the season, and the fifth of her career. Her goal Sunday tied a career season-high after she netted two last season as well. Coffey, known as a stabilizer in the midfield, has also found the net in a National Team shirt. She scored three goals in the USWNT's last five outings.

After a record-breaking trade that transferred Ally Sentnor to Kansas City Current from the Utah Royals last week, the USWNT forward made her debut in teal at America First Field in Sandy, Utah.

Sentnor subbed on in the 46th minute in the Current's 1-0 victory over her former squad, the Royals. The second-year player jumped from the last-ranked team in the NWSL to the top of the league in Kansas City. Sentnor adds even more firepower to a first-place Current side that includes fellow USWNT players Michelle Cooper, Claire Hutton and Lo'eau LaBonta and holds the best record, by far, in the league with 13 wins and 39 points in the table. 

The Houston Dash escaped with a narrow 2-1 win over the North Carolina Courage with a game-winning goal in stoppage time.

USWNT forward Yazmeen Ryan may not have been credited with the assist, but her tenacious attack certainly opened the door for Sophie Schmidt to net the go-ahead goal. Ryan sized up a Courage defender on the right corner of the box and beat her 1v1 to launch the ball toward the goal. Schmidt cleaned up the rebound with a finish from close range.

The Dash improved to 4-8-3, 15 points, sitting 12th in the standings. While they're four places out of playoff contention, it's a tight race in spots No. 9 through 12. The Courage currently holds the ninth spot, so Houston's win this weekend could prove crucial later.

While the NWSL is in full action until November, the European clubs that the USWNT are a part of will kick off their seasons in September, with club friendlies already underway.

OL Lyonnes, which now has three Americans on the roster — Lindsey Heaps, Lily Yohannes and Korbin Albert — is one of those squads that played an exhibition game prior to the kickoff of the 2025-26 regular season. The Lyonnes beat Switzerland side Servette FCCF 5-0 over the weekend.

The pay is nonexistent, but the perk could be viewing games in the U.S., Mexico and Canada for free during the FIFA World Cup  next summer.

FIFA launched the application process for the World Cup  volunteers Monday. How many are needed? A staggering 65,000 across the 16 cities that will host the expanded 48-team format over 39 days beginning June 11, the largest volunteer program FIFA has ever attempted.

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event. 

“We hope interested individuals will join us as we welcome the world to North America in 2026.”

In addition to stadiums, volunteers will provide support across at training sites, airports and hotels.

Wednesday marks one year out from the start of the 2026 World Cup. A look at where preparations stand.

FIFA estimates 6.5 million fans will attend the World Cup, with 3.7 million attending games in the U.S., 1.5 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in Canada. The 2022 final with Lionel Messi leading Argentina past Kylian Mbappé and France, drew a record 1.42 billion viewers, including 26 million in the U.S. 

“The Super Bowl, which is fantastic, has what, 120-130 million viewers? The World Cup has 6  billion,” Infantino told Fox Sports in April. “A World Cup is 104 Super Bowls in one month.”

Volunteers in the past ranged from students to seniors. No experience is required but applicants must be at least 18 years old. Interested individuals can apply at fifaworldcup.com/volunteers.

Those whose applications are accepted will be invited to attend the Volunteer Team Tryouts, which are expected to begin in October. Training will take place in March 2026.

‘Volunteers are the heartbeat of FIFA events and champions of their host city — sharing their pride and passion with fans from all corners of the globe, welcoming visitors to experience the unique culture of their host city and supporting the extraordinary event that is a FIFA World Cup,” FIFA said in a statement.

The FIFA Club World Cup exposed some significant issues that could hamper the 2026 World Cup, with hot weather being among the top concerns.

Los Angeles is one of 11 U.S. host cities, with eight games scheduled at SoFi Stadium, including the U.S. team's opener June 12. After playing its second match in Seattle on June 19, the U.S. will conclude group play at SoFi on June 25. 

Included in the games to be played in Inglewood are two round-of-32 games and a quarterfinal. Only one venue — AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas — was awarded more games with nine.

“We're happy with with how it turned out,” U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said. “We look forward to being in L.A. [and] probably one of the best stadiums in the world and to get to play there twice in the group stage.”

Other U.S. hosts cities include Seattle, Houston, Kansas City, Atlanta, Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Miami and the San Francisco Bay area. Games in Mexico and Canada will be held in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Toronto and Vancouver.

“FIFA changed my life,” longtime volunteer Craig Collins said on a video. “Why do I want to volunteer again? I can give back to an organization that has provided for me without knowing it.

Collins became the one-millionth person to join the FIFA volunteer community in April 2025.

“I'm excited to apply for the 2026 volunteer program and hope to show off my community to the world once more.”

On Monday, FIFA launched the volunteer application process for the FIFA World Cup 26™, set to be the largest volunteer program in the organization's history, with an estimated 65,000 participants needed across Canada, Mexico, and the United States, including right here in North Texas.

The tournament, featuring an expanded 48-team format, will span 16 host cities over six weeks, starting June 11, 2026, in Mexico City. Nine matches will be hosted at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, including a Semi-Final. 

The FIFA World Cup 26™ Volunteer Community will support operations at stadiums, training sites, airports, hotels, and other venues, covering 23 functional areas. 

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event.”

No prior volunteering experience is required, but applicants must be at least 18 years old, eligible to volunteer in the host country, and have a good command of English. Proficiency in Spanish is desirable in Mexico, while French is an asset in Canada. Additional language skills are a plus.

Craig Collins, a volunteer at the 1994 FIFA World Cup USA™ and the FIFA Club World Cup 2025™ in Atlanta, became the one-millionth member of the FIFA Volunteer Community in April 2025. 

“I'm so proud to be part of this moment – not just for FIFA, but for my city,” Collins said. “I'm excited to apply for the 2026 volunteer programme and hope to show off my community to the world once more.”

Volunteers will receive an official FIFA World Cup 26™ uniform, exclusive reward items, meals during shifts, a volunteer certificate, and skills-based learning opportunities. Successful applicants will attend Volunteer Team Tryouts starting in October 2025, with training beginning in March 2026.

Volunteers must commit to eight shifts, attend pre-event training, and pass a background check.

Applications are open at fifaworldcup.com/volunteers. The program welcomes individuals from all backgrounds, uniting them through a shared passion for soccer and community engagement.

The revamped Club World Cup thrust the preseason schedules of the European clubs competing into disarray, and Real Madrid have just one friendly arranged before the start of the 2025–26 season. 

The Spanish behemoths, aiming to dethrone Barcelona domestically and claim a 16th Champions League crown this term, travel to Innsbruck in midweek and face a historically humble WSG Tirol side that have started the Austrian Bundesliga season brightly. 

Alonso would've learned plenty about his squad in the United States, with only one addition made since Madrid returned to the Spanish capital, but there's still much to be done if Madrid are to leapfrog an imperious-looking Blaugrana. 

Here's how Real Madrid could line up for their one and only preseason outing of the summer. 

GK: Andriy Lunin—Thibaut Courtois was impressive at the Club World Cup, and doesn't exactly need to play here. Alonso could thus give No. 2 Andriy Lunin a run-out in Innsbruck. 

RB: Trent Alexander-Arnold—The Englishman's injury altered Alonso's tactical plan for their Club World Cup semifinal defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, with the Spaniard previously utilising Alexander-Arnold as a wing-back. It seems unlikely that the new manager will have sustained success with a back three. 

CB: Raúl Asencio—The young defender had a poor Club World Cup and has a criminal case looming over him. However, for now, he's a part of Alonso's plans and will be used alongside Madrid's more experienced options here.

CB: Dean Huijsen—The new signing has hit the ground running right away and looks to be an indispensable figure in Madrid's defense.

LB: Álvaro Carreras—Ferland Mendy is out injured, so former Madrid youth player Carreras has the chance to establish himself down the left after returning to the club this summer. 

CM: Aurélien Tchouaméni—The versatile Frenchman is set to play an important role for the flexible Alonso during the Spaniard's first season. 

CM: Thiago Pitarch—There could be an opportunity for the 18-year-old in Austria, after he impressed in a behind-closed-doors clash against Leganes. Federico Valverde hasn't made the trip.

CM: Dani Ceballos—There could be a start for Ceballos, who enjoyed a resurgent campaign in 2024–25, with Eduardo Camavinga and Jude Bellingham out injured.

AM: Arda Güler—Güler has been one of the major early winners of Alonso's appointment. The new boss trusts the talented Turkish playmaker, and he could be used in an advanced role here.

ST: Kylian Mbappé—After a forgettable tournament in the United States, Mbappé has had the chance to fully recover over the past few weeks and should be raring to go for the start of 2025–26. 

ST: Vinicíus Júnior—The Brazilian's stock has slumped considerably over the past 12 months, and doubts remain over his Madrid future amid a contract dispute. Still, Alonso has insisted that Viní Jr remains a big part of his plans. Can he make the superstar partnership work up top?

Boston 25 Now



BOSTON — The Boston Host Committee for the FIFA World Cup 2026 announced Monday that it's seeking thousands of volunteers to apply to be part of one of the world's most iconic sporting events.

As one of 16 Host Cities across North America, Boston will welcome the FIFA World Cup to Boston (Gillette) Stadium in Foxboro and the Greater Boston area next summer for seven matches, including one quarter-final game. 

Volunteers will play a crucial and critical role in delivering an unforgettable experience for fans, teams, media, and officials from around the globe, according to the Boston Host Committee.

“Boston is one of the most historic and influential cities in America, and hosting the FIFA World Cup will be another landmark moment for our city,” Mike Loynd, CEO of FIFA World Cup 26 Boston, said in a statement. “We're thrilled to invite our community to be part of history and show the world the pride, passion, and spirit that define Boston.”

The volunteers are needed to fill a variety of roles, with opportunities available across Boston, Foxboro, and other key locations before and during the tournament. 

Applicants must be at least 18 years old and able to commit to eight shifts between June 11, 2026, and July 19, 2026.

Those interested in volunteering can click here to volunteer.

The games kick off on June 13, 2026, and run through July 9, 2026. The FIFA World Cup matches at Boston Stadium are as follows:

The Final Draw for the FIFA World Cup 26 will take place later this year and will determine which teams will compete in Boston as part of the group stage matches. Foxboro Stadium hosted six matches during the 1994 FIFA World Cup. 

Tickets to the FIFA World Cup 26™ will be released in several phases, with the first phase opening on Wednesday, September 10, 2025. Fans should visit FIFA.com/tickets to learn more and register their interest.

As volunteer applications open Monday, FIFA organizers here are looking to fill more than 5,000 spots, with a main hub coming to the Fashion District. 

FIFA announced an open call for volunteers ahead of next summer's men's World Cup on Monday, and with Philly as a host city, it will again need to rally one of the largest contingents of support. 

Those interested can pick where they'd like to support the tournament by applying at fifaworldcup.com/volunteers. According to a release, FIFA will invite selected applicants to its volunteer team tryouts, expected to begin in October, with additional training to continue in March 2026.

FIFA anticipates that it will need close to 65,000 volunteers across 11 host cities in the United States, as well as five additional cities in Canada and Mexico. All three nations will host the World Cup from June 11 to July 19. Mexico City is slated to host the first game of the tournament on June 11. Lincoln Financial Field will host its first of six scheduled matches on June 14. 

According to FIFA, volunteers must be 18 or older at the time they apply. They must commit to a minimum of eight shifts during the tournament or before the official starting date. They also must speak English and agree to a background review. 

FIFA World Cup 26 Philadelphia, the collective that is planning events ahead of the tournament, has been involved in opening its volunteer center in the Fashion District along Market Street, also known as the old Gallery complex. The group expects it to be the hub for the nearly 5,000 volunteers it will need before, during, and after the tournament. 

In addition to match-day services, volunteers will be expected to fill roles across 23 facets, which include work at training sites and concierge services at hotels, airports, etc. FIFA World Cup 26 Philly localized its information for volunteers at phillyfwc26.com/volunteer. 

“Hosting the FIFA World Cup 26™ is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our city, and volunteers will play a critical role in ensuring Philadelphia shines on the global stage,” said Alison Grove, senior director of strategy, operations, and partnerships for FIFA Philly 26. “Whether you're a lifelong soccer fan or simply proud to represent Philadelphia, this is your chance to create a truly unforgettable fan experience for visitors from around the world. We're calling on the community to answer the call, get involved, and be part of history.” 

Philadelphia will host its matches across the group and knockout stages. This summer, the region received a litmus test courtesy of FIFA's Club World Cup, which saw the Linc host eight matches over three weeks. 

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” Gianni Infantino, FIFA's president, said in a release. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament, and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event. We hope interested individuals will join us as we welcome the world to North America in 2026.”

One of those volunteers in Philly-based digital marketer Agatha Nothem, served during the Club World Cup and chronicled her experience on her Instagram page and shared with Philadelphia Soccer 2026. 

“Volunteering at the Club World Cup here in Philly was incredible,” Nothem said via Instagram. “It felt like I was a part of something bigger … you'll never forget the experience.”

Home > Morocco > Royal Decree Ends ‘World Cup Government' Race as New Foundation Takes Charge

A royal decree (dahir) has officially put an end to the political battle over who will lead Morocco's government during the 2030 World Cup.

Marrakech – A royal decree (dahir) has officially put an end to the political battle over who will lead Morocco's government during the 2030 World Cup.

The announcement came after King Mohammed VI issued Decree No. 1.25.54, published in Official Gazette No. 7428 on August 7, which implements Law No. 35.25 establishing the “Morocco 2030 Foundation” and granting its presidency to Fouzi Lekjaa, the budget minister and president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF).

Political parties from both the majority and opposition have lost their contest to lead what had been dubbed the “World Cup government,” regardless of who might win the 2026 legislative elections.

The decree effectively ends the verbal sparring between party leaders and ministers who had expressed ambitions to top the election results with the goal of leading the World Cup government.

According to the official text, the Morocco 2030 Foundation will cooperate with relevant administrations and bodies to prepare, organize, and enhance all international football events granted to Morocco by FIFA or the Confederation of African Football (CAF), up until the 2030 World Cup.

The foundation is described as “a public benefit institution, not aimed at making profit, with legal personality and financial independence,” according to the law.

It is tasked with “taking necessary measures to prepare and organize the aforementioned events, monitoring the implementation of related commitments, while providing support and accompaniment to the concerned regions and cities.”

The executive council of the foundation will include, in addition to its president, representatives from the government authorities responsible for interior affairs, foreign affairs, budget, public enterprises, and territorial councils, or any other institution the council wishes to include.

Among the executive council's powers will be evaluating the progress of projects related to international event preparations based on received reports and suggesting necessary measures when required. It will also monitor the implementation of state commitments linked to organizing these international events.

The law stipulates that the executive council will determine the foundation's general activity guidelines, specifically “planning necessary measures to prepare and organize international football events in Morocco, particularly the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, and any major sporting event organized under FIFA or CAF supervision.”

The legislation also establishes an advisory council serving as a space for dialogue and reflection. This council aims to mobilize all the country's vital forces through a participatory and inclusive approach to help create suitable conditions for successfully organizing these international football events.

It will be chaired by the foundation's president and include representatives from the private sector, civil society, Moroccans living abroad, Moroccan football representatives, and African experts.

A territorial management committee, chaired by the Minister of Interior, will be responsible for monitoring and coordinating the implementation of regional state commitments.

This step shields projects from political and electoral exploitation

Lekjaa, who serves as both budget minister and president of the Morocco 2030 Foundation, has previously advocated for the benefits Morocco will gain from hosting the 2025 AFCON and the 2030 World Cup.

These include advanced infrastructure and development projects that will benefit all Moroccan citizens. He has responded to public demands that development not be limited to cities hosting the two historic sporting spectacles, affirming that benefits will extend to other cities as well.

During a previous ministerial conference hosted by the National Higher School of Administration (ENSA) in Rabat, the foundation's president explained that these projects are based on a coherent approach among all stakeholders for integrated development in sports, economic, and territorial domains.

The investments in relevant sectors amount to approximately MAD 150 billion ($15 billion), covering major projects.

Regarding transportation project financing, Lekjaa confirmed a partnership between public and private sectors, with annual state support of MAD 1.6 billion ($160 million) until 2030.

This will ensure the development of high-speed trains and regional lines connecting Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangier, as well as the southern provinces, to strengthen territorial and economic integration.

Concerning financial arrangements, the Morocco 2030 Foundation president stated that they were designed not to burden the general budget, through an innovative concept based on partnership with the Caisse de Dépôt et de Gestion (CDG) and the National Company for Construction and Management of Sports Facilities (SONARGES), allowing cost recovery over twenty years.

Both the majority and opposition parliamentary groups announced their full support for Lekjaa's presidency of the Morocco 2030 Foundation just days before the end of the spring session.

They pointed out that this step distances ongoing projects from political and electoral exploitation, rising above narrow calculations and the rhetoric about who will lead the “World Cup government,” warning against turning this description into what local media have portrayed as an “electoral apocalypse.”

With the countdown to Morocco's hosting of major international football events now officially underway, the establishment of this foundation marks a significant shift in how preparations will be managed, placing them under specialized institutional oversight rather than within the regular political contest.

World Cup

U.S. men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams was back in Chicago for a second time this summer.

He had been in the Windy City with the U.S. team in the first days of June for its pre-Concacaf Gold Cup camp, where the United States' 2022 World Cup captain was intent on making a statement to head coach Mauricio Pochettino ahead of the 2026 edition.

Now, in the first days of August, he was back, with AFC Bournemouth this time, on tour in the United States and preparing for the new Premier League season — a campaign he believes can be an important chance to level up at a vital time. (And with his club facing reigning champion Liverpool at Anfield in Friday's curtain-raiser, it won't be long before he's facing a first significant challenge.)

That he was not only in the same city but the very same hotel felt symbolic. It was a reminder of the 26-year-old's approach to the year leading into that largely home World Cup next summer. Adams says he feels motivated and all-in.

Adams' presence with the U.S. this summer shouldn't have been newsworthy. But for a Gold Cup that became as much about who wasn't in camp as who was, it was notable that the defensive midfielder was there despite a foot injury that kept him from fully training or playing in the first weeks of camp.

Adams had gotten just one camp with Pochettino to that point since the Argentine's appointment in September last year, and he felt it was important to begin to prove himself and understand his new national-team manager better.

“It was a great learning experience,” Adams tells The Athletic. “Just because I hadn't been in his initial camps to begin with. So I think a lot of guys had a lot more time with him than I've had. Just ironing out that relationship, what he wants from the players, how the players can get the best out of the coaching staff, just balancing that relationship.

“You hear about him in the way that he works, but until you spend a month with him, you don't really know. I've had the opportunity to do that now, so I feel like that will be really helpful in the long run, for not just myself, but a lot of the young guys that had the first opportunity as well.”

While the U.S. was missing several regulars due to injury and Club World Cup duties, the controversy of the summer revolved around Christian Pulisic's decision to opt out of the Gold Cup. The Milan forward and sometimes USMNT captain felt he needed rest if he was going to be ready for the 2025-26 season — and, as an extension, primed for the World Cup.

Pochettino and his staff agreed to let him skip the tournament. But the coach, responding to Pulisic's comments to CBS that he wanted to take part in the two warm-up friendlies in June before missing the Gold Cup itself, was clearly bothered by the idea that those types of decisions would be left to the players.

“I am the head coach,” Pochettino said. “I am not a mannequin.”

It raised the question as to whether Pulisic will have to earn back the trust of the coaches — and maybe even his teammates, too. Adams pushes back hard on the idea that he had anything to prove.

“It's a topic that everyone wants to have an opinion on, of course, but what Christian did is what he had to do for himself,” Adams says. “He doesn't have to earn the respect of anyone in the group. Everyone knows who Christian is as a person, and how good of a player he is as well. But everyone needs time in certain moments of their career or life to just say: ‘Let me take a step back, focus on myself for a second and then move forward'.

“I speak to Christian all the time. We're obviously super close. And I just know that this summer, while he took a step away, he didn't anticipate that there was going to be that much noise and heat around it. But again, everyone wants to throw his name in the gutter because it creates a big story, or it creates noise around (the team). And that's how big of a player he is and how important of a player he is. But everyone in the team knows how important he is, what an amazing person he is.

“I can't say enough good things about him. He's one of the leaders of our team. The decision that he made was best for him, and it's going to help him in the long run.”

Pulisic's absence didn't just spark criticism. It also turned a spotlight on what feels like a growing divide between the program's current players and its alumni, many of whom have taken on roles in the media.

Several former USMNT players harshly criticized the team for its disappointing performances in the Concacaf Nations League finals in March, pointing to a perceived lack of heart or passion in losses to Panama and Canada. Multiple high-profile predecessors then offered thoughts on Pulisic's Gold Cup absence, including Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan and Tim Howard.

The comments from Donovan and Howard eventually led to Pulisic's CBS interview.

“You can talk about my performances, whatever you want, but to question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line, but that's how it is,” Pulisic told the Call It What You Want podcast.

Asked about what feels like a disconnect between players past and present in the program, Adams calls it “the strangest thing.”

“I can't even explain it,” he says. “I'm not a social-media guy, so I don't follow anything, but when people bring up some of the things that are being said and some of the stories that are being created, it feels weird, because it feels like not long ago that every single one of those people were on board with, like, the direction that the federation was going and how well the players were doing. And it feels like any setback, is (treated) like a disaster is happening. Do you know what I mean?

“And that happens in football. I get it. Some people have jobs where their job is to speak about the sport, and if that's their opinion, that's their opinion. My goal is to try to create an environment, especially within our team, where guys feel like they can go out, be themselves, be comfortable. We're all on the same page and want to grow the sport in America. People's opinions are people's opinions at the end of the day.”

Adams says he's “always a truthful guy” and that “the truth can hurt sometimes,” so he doesn't shy away from tougher conversations. That would include talks with former players who have criticisms, or with coaches who might want more from him, or initiating difficult conversations with teammates when the time calls for it.

It's part of what has made Adams one of the leaders of this team. He called being the U.S. captain in the 2022 World Cup “one of the most special moments of my career,” and though center-back Tim Ream has been wearing the armband most regularly under Pochettino – no official captain has been designated yet by the new manager – Adams says he will continue to be himself and help to the lead the group.

His goal for now, though, is to progress at the club level this season. He noted that this is his first chance to go through a full preseason in three years, and after having a full campaign last year without an injury, 2025-26 with Bournemouth is about reaching his peak form going into next summer.

“This past season gave me the confidence that I needed to now say: ‘You could take the next step. Let's take another step in development. Take a step in pushing yourself',” Adams says.

There is no doubt that as the USMNT continues to push through what has been a tumultuous two years, it would benefit significantly from having Adams consistently available and in the lineup, much as he was throughout the previous World Cup cycle ending wth the tournament itself in Qatar. The Gold Cup was a huge step forward in that regard. Adams feels confident he's rounding into form at just the right moment.

“Now it's like: ‘OK, I'm back to myself, I feel like myself',” he says. “I've had a nice break. I'm going to be able to get a nice preseason. And (then) it's go time.”

Joao Neves will miss Paris Saint-Germain's Super Cup clash with Tottenham following his red card in the Club World Cup final.

Spurs and PSG will face off in the one-off clash between the between the reigning Champions League and Europa League winners at the Stadio Friuli in Udine, Italy on Wednesday.

The showdown will be new head coach Thomas Frank's first competitive game in charge of the north London side.

It will also mark the Dane's first taste of European football following his arrival from Brentford in June, and he has already been handed a huge boost.

European champions PSG will be without key midfielder Neves after he earned himself a two-match suspension in their last outing.

In the Club World Cup final in July, the Portuguese star was sent off late in the French side's 3-0 defeat to Chelsea for a pull on Marc Cucurella's hair following a VAR review.

This was the first red card of Neves' career, and will also see him miss PSG's Ligue 1 opener against Nantes on Sunday.

According to RMC Sports insider Fabrice Hawkins, the French giants have worked around the 20-year-old's absence, putting together a tailored training programme for him since starting their pre-season.

With last season's extended schedule and the Club World Cup in the United States, PSG postponed their players' holiday period, and only resumed training on August 6.

As a result, Luis Enrique's team are yet to play a warm-up match ahead of the new season, and will return to action in the Super Cup.

And they will be looking to make the perfect start to the season by landing silverware, especially after enjoying huge success last term.

On top of winning a fourth straight Ligue 1 title, the Parisians finally captured their elusive first Champions League title in May.

PSG dismantled Inter Milan with a thumping 5-0 win, thanks to goals from Desire Doue, Achraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelai and Senny Mayulu.

Neves also played a significant role, as he started in the historic triumph before being substituted in the 84th minute.

His absence is sure to be felt against Tottenham, having been a mainstay in the PSG midfield throughout all of last season.

The Portugal star was pivotal in the 2024/25 campaign, making 59 appearances altogether and registering seven goals and 10 assists.

Spurs will certainly be looking to take advantage of Neves' suspension, as they head into the clash as underdogs.

They booked their spot in the Super Cup by winning the Europa League with a 1-0 victory over Manchester United under previous head coach Ange Postecoglou.

But with the Australian later being dismissed following a poor Premier League campaign and replaced by Frank, the final represents the perfect chance for the 51-year-old make his mark.

Speaking ahead of the final, Spurs' new boss admitted his side face a huge challenge, and urged his players to draw on their previous final experience as they eye up more silverware.

Frank told UEFA.com: "We're playing in a final - it's fantastic. 

"Hopefully we can use some of the experience we have from the last final that the team played against Manchester United. 

"[Paris] are the best team in Europe. They won the treble and it looks like they are extremely strong in all 11 starting positions.

"It's a fantastic challenge to have in the first game but, of course, we believe in ourselves. We're going to a final and there will be one objective – try to win it. 

"We don't see it as a test; we see it as two good teams against each other, and we want to win."

We are back again for another season of tracking the fortunes of USMNT players in Europe.

And as we gear up for the 2025-26 campaign across the continent's major leagues, this isn't just any football season: it's one that ends with a World Cup co-hosted by the United States next June and July, a tournament which will be the pinnacle for most of these guys' careers.

So, welcome aboard as we keep tabs each week on who is flourishing and who is struggling in this vital period, who is making a bid to impress head coach Mauricio Pochettino ahead of next summer and who could be a surprise contender for that all-important World Cup roster.

Let's start with one of the national team's more established players — and one who could be set for a big move before this transfer window closes on September 1.

The noise has ramped up in recent weeks that Yunus Musah might be leaving Milan, where he shares a dressing room with Christian Pulisic. Yesterday, The Athletic reported that the Premier League could be his destination. Talks are underway between Nottingham Forest and Milan over a deal for the 22-year-old, who has made 47 appearances for the USMNT.

And as chance would have it, Musah spent Saturday and Sunday facing Premier League opposition in two friendly matches against Leeds United and then Chelsea.

How did he do? The midfielder played 45 minutes of the 1-1 draw with Leeds at Dublin's Aviva Stadium. He was deployed as a right-sided wing-back for new manager Max Allegri, going up against Leeds' Wilfried Gnonto and Gabriel Gudmundsson.

His ongoing battle with Gnonto was the most eye-catching, as the Italian forward found space on multiple occasions and proved to be one of his team's best attacking outlets. Musah put in some strong tackles on both of his opponents, while his best attacking moment came in the latter stages of the first half. He collected the ball at speed down the right and skipped over a sliding Ao Tanaka before seeing his delivery cleared.

But it was a more chastening experience for Musah, and Milan, 24 hours later after they moved on to London. The Serie A side were soundly beaten 4-1 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and Musah endured a tough 73 minutes.

Playing as a right midfielder in the first half, he struggled to get into the game. There were a few early one-on-ones against new Chelsea signing Jamie Gittens. In the first of them, Musah conceded a foul as Gittens went past him, while in the next, he did well to recover and win a corner. Then there was a frustrating moment when he failed to control a cross-field ball.

Musah wasn't alone in struggling: Milan could not get near Chelsea, who won the Club World Cup in the United States last month. To compound a rough afternoon, Musah conceded a pretty harsh penalty in the second half. Trying to recover to intercept a low cross from Liam Delap, he was deemed to have fouled another Chelsea new boy, Estevao. Delap converted the ensuing spot kick.

The writing already appears to be on the wall for the American's long-term suitability at San Siro.

Milan appointed Igli Tare as sporting director recently, and earlier this summer he said: “I consider Musah an excellent player, but we are looking for profiles with characteristics that fit the project we have with coach Allegri. We are seeking deep-lying midfielders for a three-man midfield; Musah doesn't have these characteristics. He can play in a two- or three-man midfield, but with different characteristics. This is the real reason why we want to do something different.”

Musah joined Milan from Valencia of Spain in the summer of 2023 despite interest from Premier League sides Fulham and West Ham United at the time. Now he might be primed for a second chance at testing himself in England's top flight.

Musah may not be the only American heading to England this window. EFL Championship club Middlesbrough, for whom U.S. midfielder Aidan Morris has already become a key man, are now interested in Columbus Crew winger Max Arfsten.

Arfsten, 24, was involved in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup campaign and scored during the quarter-final win over Costa Rica.

Before they opened their second-tier campaign with a 1-0 home win against Swansea City on Saturday, Middlesbrough manager Rob Edwards admitted his admiration for the Californian. “I don't like talking about other clubs' players — I know I'm batting that one back. He's a good player, but I can't talk about it,” said Edwards.

Asked if he thought the interest in Arfsten would progress, Edwards replied: “I've no idea where it's at at the moment. He's a good player, but he's not ours.”

Well, for starters, it's worth noting those who didn't do anything because of their persisting injury issues.

Christian Pulisic was not involved in either of Milan's friendlies, with suggestions in Italy that he is still struggling with an ankle problem picked up during the 4-2 preseason win against Liverpool last month in Hong Kong.

Another gifted USMNT star, Malik Tillman, is also out of action. The midfielder, who joined Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the summer after helping Dutch side PSV retain their Eredivisie title, was missing from the German Bundesliga team's 2-0 loss at Chelsea on Friday night.

According to the club, Tillman is still suffering from an injury or, more specifically, “A mild stress reaction after training.”

“I can't say anything about his return,” Leverkusen manager Erik ten Hag told Sky Sport Deutschland. “We have to take it day by day.”

Asked if the injury has worsened, Ten Hag added: “We don't think so. We have to wait and see, day by day.”

Finally, what of Folarin Balogun? The forward has played and scored this pre-season for Monaco of France's Ligue 1 (in a 3-1 win over Torino from Italy and a 2-2 draw with Dutch side Ajax) but he wasn't in the squad for their 2-1 loss to Serie A visitors Inter on Friday.

While his previous runouts suggested Balogun is over the ankle injury that curtailed his hopes of featuring in the final games of the last campaign, his absence for what was Monaco's final pre-season game was put down to a leg problem he picked up against Ajax. The club do not consider it a serious issue, though.

But one USMNT veteran did feature over the weekend, and he was up against a young prospect. Weston McKennie played 24 minutes from the bench in Juventus' 2-1 win at Germany's Borussia Dortmund. If McKennie is already missing his pal Tim Weah, who left the Italian club for French side Marseille last week, he could at least have had a chat with young compatriot Cole Campbell, 19, who had a 15-minute cameo for Dortmund on Sunday.

Another USMNT international lifted some early-season silverware. Crystal Palace's Chris Richards played all 90 minutes of his team's Community Shield game against Liverpool as the FA Cup winners beat the Premier League champions 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw in normal time.

Richards was solid alongside Marc Guehi and Maxence Lacroix as Oliver Glasner picked the same starting line-up that defeated Manchester City in May's cup final. The centre-half, a popular member of the Palace squad, is expected to also start their first Premier League game of the campaign, away to Chelsea, next Sunday.

See if Pulisic has recovered in time to feature for Milan in their return to competitive action, as they host second division Bari in the first round of the Coppa Italia on Sunday (3:15pm, Paramount+). Before that, Damion Downs, who had an eventful debut for Southampton on Saturday — he was credited with assisting his new team's 96-minute winner against Championship newcomers Wrexham — could be in action again tomorrow (Tuesday) in the Carabao Cup's first round at third-tier Northampton Town (2:45pm, Paramount+).

And of course, excitement is building ahead of the Premier League's return on Friday, when Liverpool host Bournemouth in the big kick-off. Maybe Tyler Adams can help spoil the Anfield club's bid for a winning start to their title defence? (3pm, USA/Universo).

...

Former Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has backed the new-look Club World Cup and said that the players' high salaries are one reason why clubs have to participate in such events.

Rummenigge told Monday's edition of Kicker sports magazine that he doesn't want to "dramatise" the additional burden for players at the event held recently in the United States.

"As a player I would have been happy to take part in such a tournament. Of course the Club World Cup means more games in that season but you must also say: This tournament is only every four years," the Bayern board member said.

"And many players – together with their advisors – have contributed to this situation. They are demanding ever higher salaries, forcing clubs to tap into additional sources of income. That's why new formats are emerging.

"On the other hand, I see little willingness to take a pay cut. That's a contradiction that needs to be clearly addressed."

The Club World Cup offered an overall prize money of around $1 billion. Bayern reached the quarter-finals of the 32-team event won by England's Chelsea, which replaced the Confederations Cup for national teams which was in the past held every four years.

Rummenigge said that the Club World Cup was good for Bayern's visibility abroad and that shirt sales rose seven-fold in the US. He also spoke of good TV ratings in Germany despite plenty of criticism in the run-up.

"Many of our national team players would otherwise have played in the Confed Cup in the USA – without any added value for the club," he said.

"Now FC Bayern has been able to showcase itself on the world stage, gain new fans and also benefit financially. It pays to think outside the box from time to time.

"I really enjoyed the competition and watched almost all of the matches," Rummenigge said.

There was a point in Chelsea's 2024-25 season where manager Enzo Maresca looked to be teetering on the brink. Towards the end of the campaign, fans weren't happy with the Italian's timid style of play and they were in danger of missing out on Champions League football. How things have changed since then.

Advertisement

The Blues enjoyed a strong finish to the season as they won five of their last six matches to ensure they came fourth. Then Maresca rounded things off by winning the UEFA Conference League.

And if that wasn't enough, they went on to be crowned world champions by winning the new-look Club World Cup in the U.S., thumping Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final. Suddenly, the sky seems like the limit for the Blues.

They've pocketed an eye-watering prize of around £97m for winning the competition and put it to good use by making a total of eight signings, including a handful that could have a real impact on the first team.

It's been a turbulent few years for the club, who have been through six managers since American owner Todd Boehly succeeded the popular Roman Abramovich at Stamford Bridge, but they finally look to have found their footing with Maresca.

The Italian is a disciple of Pep Guardiola's and he has certainly followed his blueprint in terms of playing intricate passing football, as well as backing it up by winning silverware.

Chelsea have a real shot of challenging high up the table, especially after spending well with a handful of impressive new recruits, with even more possibly on the way — though Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City will give them stiff competition.

Chelsea are in strange territory because they clearly have a long-term plan. You only need to see the seven and eight-year deals they hand every signing. Maresca said last season he was not expected to deliver Champions League football last season and he did it. That means they're ahead of schedule.

Winning two trophies in the same season on top of that wasn't in the script either, and the Italian may have inadvertently increased the expectations for himself. Finishing in the top four (or five if that's still enough for a Champions League place) will certainly be the minimum expectation for Chelsea now, anything less will be considered a disappointment.

Chelsea will also want to continue their momentum by delivering another trophy to add to their ever-growing trophy cabinet. The club's social media channels proudly declared: “We've won it all” after they clinched the Club World Cup, but that doesn't mean they'll be satisfied to stop here.

So a realistic expectation for Maresca's Chelsea this season would be top four/five and a trophy to boot, though lifting the Premier League and Champions League might be a little bit too ambitious. Winning either the Carabao Cup or FA Cup is much more feasible.

The key for Chelsea will be finding some consistency. Last season they dropped too many previous points against teams in the bottom of the table.

Fans were fuming over relegated Ipswich getting four points against them this season, while they were also beaten at home by Fulham. Getting better results at Stamford Bridge will be a priority after they dropped points in a total of eight matches at home last season.

Chelsea have the fourth-shortest odds to win the Premier League with Betfair this season after being given odds of 9/4. That shows the uphill task the Blues face to keep pace with the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.



They have been given odds of 3/1 to finish in the top two, while they are at 4/7 to finish in the top four this season. Finishing in the top five is much shorter at 2/7.

Chelsea have been given odds of 2/1 to win any of the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup or League Cup and 40/1 to win any of the two cups other than the league title.

Chelsea have shown they mean business in this window and their dealings could even put them in title contention. There's no doubt about the club's ambitions after making eight transfers this summer — with a focus on youth.

Their oldest signing so far is 23-year-old João Pedro from Brighton, who arrived for a £60m fee. He already scored three crucial goals for Chelsea in the Club World Cup, two in the semi and one in the final. The Brazilian scored 10 goals and grabbed six assists in the Premier League last season and should be a valuable addition in attack.

He's not the only attacking star that's arrived. Liam Delap joined in a £30m deal from Ipswich and will add to their options up front alongside the likes of Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku.

Maresca has also been bolstered with additions of wingers Jamie Gittens from Dortmund — costing around £53m — and 18-year-old Brazilian prodigy Estêvão, who is being tipped to achieve huge things.

New centre-back Jorrel Hato, who is just 19, has also arrived to give the team more options in defence, which should be useful considering how injury prone Wesley Fofana has been.

He's not the only youngster to join the Blues this summer. Midfielder Dário Essugo has joined from Sporting Lisbon for around £18.5m while they have also signed 18-year-old Kendry Páez from Independiente del Valle in Ecuador and Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg, but he has gone back to the club on loan.

Chelsea have been enjoying a three-week break since their Club World Cup triumph but are now preparing for an opening Premier League clash at home to Crystal Palace on August 17.

They'll then travel to West Ham on August 22 before welcoming Fulham at home on the 30th, with a trip to Brentford after the international break on September 13 to make it four London derbies to open the season.

Their first big test comes against Manchester United away on September 20 before facing Liverpool at home on October 4.

Three games down in the final set, Madison Keys was on the brink of an early Cincinnati Open departure at the hands of Eva Lys. It comes after her recent semifinal loss in the Canadian Open.

Having rallied from a set behind to push for a decider, it seemed unlikely she'd conjure up another comeback. Yet, Keys rattled off three consecutive points to even the score at 3-3, ultimately clinching the set 7-1 in a nail-biting tiebreak.

The victory was a rollercoaster ride, and the 2025 Australian Open champ admitted her recollection of the last set against Lys was hazy.

Post-match, she confessed: "I think I blacked out. I was just trying to win the point directly ahead of me. I think it was just one of those days where neither of us played great at the same time, but we both kind of kept finding it.

"I feel like sometimes that's just a tennis match: you're not both raising your level at the same time, and that kind of happened a little bit today. I also thought we both played really well at moments."

As a past Cincinnati Open victor in 2019, Keys is gunning for another triumph in Ohio.

She reflected: "I think I played well when it mattered. I think I served really well at the end, and that was huge. I felt like there was times when I wasn't making the best decisions, but that's life. I'm really happy to have been able to in some way figure it out and get the win.



"I literally take it point to point to point, almost to the point where I'll walk off sometimes like, 'I don't remember; did she have match points? Did that actually happen? But just trying to be super clear when I'm walking up to the line, especially when I'm serving, so I know what I want to do with the first ball."

She wrapped up by saying: "I've always loved this tournament and it's always packed. There's never any match I've ever played where you look around and there's not hundreds of people around. I think that part of that is that this tournament has been here for so long, but the fans are very knowledgeable. They're very big tennis fans, and I feel like it's such a great central location for a lot of Midwesterners to come."

The ATP and WTA tours have rapidly moved on from the Canadian Open, with the Cincinnati Open now well underway.

The tournaments lead up to the US Open, the fourth Grand Slam of the season, which gets underway later this month.

And many high-profile players are taking on the Cincinnati Open in a bid to fully prepare for the major event at Flushing Meadows.

ATP number one Jannik Sinner and number two Carlos Alcaraz are involved, having both decided to skip the Canadian Open.

Sinner and Alcaraz could play the Canadian Open in 2026, but this year the pair decided to start their North American hard-court swings in Cincinnati.

And that decision certainly highlighted an issue with the tennis schedule, with the duo clearly deciding that it was too early to return to the court following their Wimbledon final.

Avoiding injuries will have been high on their agenda, with their absence in Toronto allowing them to recover for Cincinnati.

Taking a similar decision for the latest tournament was Novak Djokovic, who was among the withdrawals for the Cincinnati Open.

Also pulling out were WTA stars Naomi Osaka and Victoria Mboko, with the pair having just played out the Canadian Open final.

The players are clearly trying to manage their schedules and fitness levels, and many have been left with no choice but to pull out of tournaments.

And that is a blow to tournament organisers and fans who would have been eager to see the biggest names in action.

The ruthless schedule has now seemingly claimed another victim, with Camilo Ugo Carabelli retiring hurt during his meeting with Ben Shelton in Cincinnati.

And he isn't the only casualty, with Marta Kostyuk pulling out of her clash with Iga Swiatek due to a wrist injury that also forced her out of the Canadian Open at the quarterfinal stage.

The problem has indeed already spilt into the US Open, with WTA ace Paula Badosa having confirmed her withdrawal from the Grand Slam.

It is, of course, too late for the ATP and WTA tours to do anything about the current schedule, but the constant and lengthy list of injuries and withdrawals must be looked at going forward.

The ruthless schedule is by no means a new issue, but the powers that be have yet to fully address the many player complaints.

WTA number one Aryna Sabalenka lamented the ‘intense' schedule earlier this month, having also returned in Cincinnati after a lengthy break following Wimbledon.

MASON, Ohio — Doubles specialist you say? Not so fast.

Taylor Townsend, the 29-year-old single mom from Chicago who became the top-ranked doubles player in the world last month, advanced to the third round in singles of the Cincinnati Open after an aggressive and creative 6-2, 6-4 upset of 13th-seeded Liudmila Samsonova from that country that can't be named, otherwise known as Russia on Saturday.

Her nice two-match singles streak came to a sudden halt Monday morning, though. A lethargic Townsend was easily beat by Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, a 22-year-old Spaniard who kept Townsend out-of-rhythm to move through the third round.

Townsend had begun her journey through the draw with an intense all-American matchup over Danielle Collins  that left a frustrated Collins in tears and Townsend contemplating an interesting question.

Given a choice, Townsend was asked, would she prefer to win one singles major title or sweep the four Grand Slam doubles championships in a single year. Her quick answer was the one singles triumph. But then she stopped. “Wait,” she said, “no one has ever won all four doubles Slams in a season, right? OK, I'll take that. Something that's never been done.”

That's the unconventional Townsend at her most honest. Her tennis career has not been linear. In a time long, long ago Chicago native Townsend was the No. 1-ranked junior in the world. It didn't take an expert to notice her magnificent hand-eye coordination, her naturally easy service motion, her quick reactions on the court, her in-game savvy. Or her weight.

In 2012 there was an ugly controversy with the United States Tennis Association (USTA), when its spokesman Patrick McEnroe suggested Townsend was denied a wild card into U.S. Open qualifying, an honor almost always given the top American junior.

Without exactly saying Townsend's weight was the issue, McEnroe said the USTA asked Townsend to sit out the U.S. Open junior tournament besides denying her wild card request. “Our concern is for her long-term development,” McEnroe said at the time. “We have one goal in mind: for her to be playing in Arthur Ashe Stadium in the main draw and competing for major titles when it's time.”

Lindsay Davenport, another top-ranked junior who struggled with her weight as a teenager plus Serena Williams and Martina Navratilova all vocally criticized the USTA and Townsend quit her USTA coaches, choosing to train with 1990 Wimbledon finalist Zina Garrison.

Ever since, Townsend has gone her own way. She moved from Chicago to Atlanta to be coached by the father of Donald Young, another Chicago junior protégé. She had a son, Adyn Aubrey, four years ago, and she's proud Adyn has already picked up a racket and is a lefty like his mom.

When you watch Townsend play tennis, it is with wonder. Her hands are soft. You can imagine her catching baseball line drives with ease. She has impeccable instincts at the net, so good it brings to mind John McEnroe and his creative net game. Her excellence in doubles has given her the ability to confound opponents with a serve that she places well and that has various spins and curves.

And she isn't afraid to promote herself in ways beyond tennis. Being the best women's doubles player in the world wasn't enough to get Townsend a clothing contract so she unveiled her own line of apparel at this year's French Open, in collaboration with Alexander Julian.

In Paris, Townsend said, “I'm No. 2 in the world in doubles and still don't have a clothing sponsor. This is just the start.” Her outfits now have the logo TT and they fit her sturdy, athletic body perfectly.

Townsend is only the 13th American to be the top-ranked women's doubles player, a statistic that makes Townsend smile.

Her superior conditioning was in evidence Saturday afternoon. At every changeover Samsonava was wrapped in ice towels and packets so that she resembled a mummy and the Russian who was a Wimbledon quarterfinalist this year, left the court after losing the first set to change clothes and presumably enjoy a little air conditioning. Townsend stayed on the court, walking around and talking to her coach and seemed to be barely sweating.

Here in Mason, Townsend is seeded No. 3 in doubles with partner Zhang Shuai, a 36-year-old from China. It is always musical partners in tennis doubles. Shuai has won two doubles majors, both with partner Samantha Stosur, an Australian who once won the U.S. Open singles title.

Townsend won Wimbledon in 2024 and the 2025 Australian Open with Katerina Siniakova and overall has eight WTA Tour doubles championships. She made it to the finals of the 2022 U.S. Open with Cincinnati's Caty McNally. Siniakova, of the Czech Republic and who has 30 career doubles titles, chose not to play her since she wouldn't be in the singles draw.

But if Townsend continues to play with the confidence she showed in her wins over Collins and Samsonava, she may be playing singles more than she expected at the U.S. Open. Townsend finished her first-set win over Samsonava with an emphatic ace, her sixth of the set, and won on her first match point with a satisfying service winner at 40-15. It was her third service winner in that final game, evidence of her confidence and maturity.

But Monday for Townsend who is ranked 75th, the 50th-ranked, Spaniard Jessica Bouzas Maniero, continued her solid play her. She came isoff her own upset of 21st-seeded Canadian Leylah Fernandez who was a finalist at the 2021 U.S. Open to get to Townsend. So there will be no singles and doubles titles here for Townsend. Maybe one day.

There's a new Canadian tennis star who announced her presence on the worldwide stage this month ahead of the 2025 U.S. Open.

Teenager Victoria Mboko pulled off a stunning run to capture her first WTA title on Thursday, Aug. 7, defeating four former Grand Slam champions after entering the bracket as a wild card at the 2025 National Bank Open in Montreal. She beat Naomi Osaka in a thrilling final, which featured Mboko storming back after losing the first set.

Mboko became the second-youngest player in WTA history to beat four Grand Slam champions in one event, with wins over Sofia Kenin, Coco Gauff and Elena Rybakina as well. Only Serena Williams accomplished the feat at a younger age during the 1999 U.S. Open.

Here's what to know about Mboko now that she's suddenly a player to watch at the U.S. Open, which is the final Grand Slam on the 2025 tennis calendar:

Mboko is 18 years old. She turns 19 on Aug. 26, two days after the 2025 U.S. Open begins in New York.

Mboko was born in Charlotte, North Carolina after her parents, Cyprien Mboko and Godee Kitadi, moved to the United States in 1999 to get away from political turmoil and unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the WTA. The family moved to Toronto when Mboko was a small child. Mboko is the youngest of four siblings and they all played tennis growing up.

Mboko started the 2025 season ranked No. 333 in the world and it has been an incredible rise since then. She is now ranked No. 24 in the world in women's singles after winning the Montreal Open, with a 53-9 record in 2025. She entered the tournament ranked No. 85 in the world.

Osaka took some criticism on social media following her National Bank Open final loss to Mboko because she didn't mention Mboko during a brief speech at the trophy ceremony. Mboko, on the other hand, thanked Osaka "for an incredible match. I've always looked up to her when I was really little, so it's always great to play with such an amazing player like you."

Osaka elected to skip her post-match news conference, but she later clarified her on-court comments in a transcript from the WTA and apologized in a social media post, referencing some awkward trophy ceremony speeches that didn't go well for her previously.

"Thanks Montreal it's been a really great run. I also want to say sorry and congratulations to Victoria," Osaka wrote on Threads. "You played a great match and have an amazing career ahead! I realize I didn't congratulate you on the court. Honestly I was in a daze and I was so focused on not having the same speech as (Indian Wells) 2018 final or the Jenny/Jennifer situation that I tried to make my speech as short as possible."

No. Mboko and Osaka both announced after their Montreal Open final that they would be withdrawing from the Cincinnati Open. The tournament is already underway.

Mboko previously revealed she had injured her wrist during her semifinal match in Montreal and underwent an MRI. She told reporters she was likely to skip Cincinnati as a precaution. Mboko is still expected to play at the 2025 U.S. Open, which begins on Sunday, Aug. 24.

11/08/25
                            • 2 MINUTE READ
                    

British players enjoyed a standout week in South West London at the Lexus British Pro Series Roehampton, with home players featuring in all four finals, three of which were all-British ties, in a week which demonstrated the ever-growing depth of the sport in Britain. 

The event saw a second consecutive ITF World Tennis Tour women's W35 event at the National Tennis Centre, along with a men's M25 event.

In the men's event, Wimbledon breakout star Oliver Tarvet continued his strong summer by claiming his sixth ITF singles title, and first on home soil. The number one seed reached the final without dropping a set, including in a strong semi final win over former Wimbledon Boys' champion Henry Searle, and faced fellow Brit and number two seed Paul Jubb for the title. Jubb looked all set to claim his third title of the year, taking the first set 6-4 and leading 5-2 in the second, but Tarvet managed to find another gear and roared back to win the next nine games, taking the second set 7-5, and racing into a 4-0 lead in the third. Jubb managed to get just a solitary game on the board in the final set, as Tarvet went on to secure victory 4-6 7-5 6-1.

Following his win, Tarvet will continue his rise up the rankings to a new career-high of 385, once rankings are updated

In the second all-British final of the weekend, James MacKinlay and Connor Thomson secured their first title as a pair, overcoming third seeds James Story and Matthew Summers 7-5 5-7 10-7. The title is MacKinlay's third of the year and second of the summer, having won the ATP Lexus Nottingham Challenger title in July, whilst the title is Thomson's first since an ITF M25 title with current British star Jacob Fearnley in Edgbaston in 2023.

After claiming the women's doubles title in Roehampton the previous week, Alicia Dudeney claimed her first senior ITF singles title, defeating rising British star Hannah Klugman in Sunday's final. Dudeney enjoyed some strong performances throughout the week, coming through three-set battles against fellow Brits Emily Appleton and Brooke Black, as well as beating number one seed Tiantsoa Rajaonah, en-route to the final. Facing a confident Klugman, who came into the final having not dropped a set all week, Dudeney raced into an early lead, dominating the first set to take it 6-1. Klugman responded in the second set, and at 4-1 up looked to be taking the match to a decider, before Dudeney reeled off five games in a row, claiming the title with her first match point 6-1 6-4.

After claiming the title, Dudeney said, “I played really well and I've been building on my matches all week. Today I came out and I really tried to just play my game and I thought I did that really well.” Dudeney will be certain of a new career-high singles ranking once rankings are updated, with the 22-year-old sitting at 701 in the current live rankings. 

In the women's doubles, Naiktha Bains, along with India's Rutuja Bhosale, came out on top in a close final against American duo Mary Lewis and Brandy Walker. After losing a tight first set, Bains and Bhosale, stormed back to take it to a champions tiebreak, ultimately coming out on top 4-6 6-1 12-10.

Tournament Director Annabel Graham said, The Lexus British Pro Series Roehampton here at the National Tennis Centre was a great week of tennis. We had a strong player field across the draws, and British representation was testament to the excellent work of the LTA performance and pathways team. To have all Brits in the singles finals for the Men's and Women's and British representation in the doubles was wonderful for the spectators and tournament alike.”

International tournaments such as the Lexus British Pro Series Roehampton are part of the LTA's Performance Competitions Calendar (PCC) which provides significantly enhanced opportunities for British players at each age and stage of the performance player pathway on home soil. The calendar is designed to provide comprehensive opportunities for British players to play, earn ranking points and win prize money at home, throughout the year. This week, the action moves to Aldershot Tennis Centre, as the Hampshire venue hosts a joint ITF W35/M25 event.

Tommy Paul made a winning return to competition in Cincinnati and spilled the details on his romantic proposal to his girlfriend, Paige Lorenze. After being hampered by physical issues at the French Open, the world No. 16 picked up a fresh foot injury during his shock second-round defeat at Wimbledon and was forced to wear a protective boot for weeks.

But Paul saw the positives in his setback and used his time on the sidelines to pop the question to Lorenze, who has been supporting him at tournaments across the world since 2022.

The American is finally back in action at this week's Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, his first tournament since he ruptured a tendon in his foot - and his first as an engaged man.

Last month, Paul and Lorenze took to Instagram to confirm their engagement, sharing some snaps from the dreamy proposal set-up in Nantucket.

“I wanted to do it on the beach. But the schedule for the weather was horrible, it was supposed to rain the whole time, so I ended up renting a little cottage and did it there,” Paul told the Cincinnati Open as he made his return to the tour.

“Nobody was around, it was just me and her and I thought it was great to have that moment for ourselves.



“I knew I was going to do it for a while, but I didn't know when. Obviously I was out for a little bit, so it was kind of a forced vacation and I was like, ‘This is probably the best time for me to do it'.

“It was great because it was her family vacation. I didn't want to take over her family vacation with that, but I guess I kind of did. But it was great.”

The forced vacation came after Paul suffered a four-set defeat to Sebastian Ofner at the All England Club. He raced through the opening set before losing 1-6 7-5 6-4 7-5.

“I heard a pop in my foot during the match and then after, I got an MRI. When they tell you that you ruptured a tendon, you just shut it down,” Paul said of his foot injury, which left him in a boot for two weeks.

The world No. 16 missed the first few tournaments of the North American swing in Washington and Toronto, and even contemplated skipping Cincinnati. But he enjoyed a successful comeback, beating Pedro Martinez 6-2 6-2 in his first match in over a month.

Paul will now face Adrian Mannarino for a spot in the last 16. And the American is now playing for something extra, as he has a wedding to start saving for.

Will Raducanu exact revenge for her defeat by Sabalenka at Wimbledon?

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

Emma Raducanu is playing Aryna Sabalenka today in the third round of the Cincinnati Open. 

The British No 1 battled gamely against the world No 1 in a tight encounter on Centre Court at Wimbledon last month before succumbing to a 7-6, 6-4 defeat, and is out for revenge here. Raducanu carries reasonable form into the contest after reaching the semi-finals of the Washington Open in late July, although she was then thrashed by Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova in Montreal. 

As the 30th seed in Cincinnati, Raducanu received a bye to the second round where she met Serbia's Olga Danilovic, who beat Britain's Katie Boulter in round one. Raducanu came through in straight sets to set up this match with Sabalenka, who comfortably saw off the 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in her second-round tie.

The tournament is staged at the Lindner Family Tennis Center and is one of the 10 WTA 1000 events on the calendar. It is also considered the key tune-up before the US Open, where Raducanu won her shock grand slam title in 2021, and where Sabalenka is the reigning champion.

Follow all the latest updates below as Raducanu meets Sabalenka in Cincinnati.

Raducanu hits a lovely forehand winner on to the tramline at 30-0, whipped over the net with top-spin, and then serves it out with an ace. 

Sabalenka will serve to stay in the first set.

Sabalenka looks frustrated as she makes a couple of wild swings during her service game, but she still holds with an ace to stay on serve.

At 30-15, Raducanu throws in a loose double fault to give Sabalenka a sniff and the world No 1 earns herself a break point opportunity, but fires wide with a forehand to bring up deuce. An excellent wide serve by Raducanu gives her advantage, but she loses the next point and then follows it with another double fault. 

Sabalenka is just as erratic with her return, though, eventually firing a forehand into the net and a backhand long to give up the game.

“Relax, stay positive,” says Francis Roig repeatedly to Raducanu from courtside. 

Raducanu rushes over to speak to him at the end of the game, and she's told off by the umpire: “You cannot actively go to him.”

“I cannot hear him, the music is too loud,” Raducanu complains.

“Then he needs to speak louder,” comes the umpire's reply.

 Break! Raducanu earns two break-back points at 15-40, but loses the first with a wild forehand on the stretch. She takes the next one, though, as Sabalenka crashes a backhand into the net!

We've got a match, here.

At 15-30 down, Raducanu twice serves to the Sabalenka backhand and draws errors to avoid facing more break points. She finishes off the game with a fabulous serve which hits the corner of the service box.

Sabalenka rattles off another service game and she's in full control of this first set now.

Break! Ominous, this, as Sabalenka rattles off a series of sensational groundstrokes off both wings to break again, finished with a forehand winner. 

This is shaping up to be the most Sabalenka set, with wild swings of quality, but at her best she is almost unplayable.

A quick hold, and Sabalenka squares the scoreboard after that shaky start.

Break! Sabalenka wins her first point of the match at the 10th attempt, and then follows it with a powerful backhand winner that had some frustration in it. Raducanu misses with a backhand and Sabalenka takes the first of two break points to get quickly back on serve.

Break! This is superb from Raducanu, taking advantage of some early mistakes from Sabalenka to break to love. 

The world No 1 has not yet won a point, dumping a forehand into the net to seal the break.

The ATP Challenger Tour welcomes two brand-new tournaments this week, both staged on hard courts and offering $200,000 in total prize money—and 125 valuable ATP Ranking points for the champion. The Europcar Cancun Country Open in Mexico, and the Serve First Open in Sumter, South Carolina, promise high-level fields and unique settings.Mexico steps up, and the players are showing upFor Cancun, the journey from idea to reality was fast-paced.“Just a few months ago, after requesting a date to the ATP,” explained tournament director Daniel Langre, “Week 33 opened up, and we were happy to take it and accept the challenge of hosting a 125 event on the second week of the Cincinnati Open 1000.”The decision to launch at the second-highest Challenger level was backed by experience.“Our tournament promoter, Francisco Tarazona, has plenty of experience being involved in ATP 250s and 500s in the past, so I believe that gave the ATP the confidence they needed to grant him with this Challenger level,” Langre said. “I have also been involved in the organizing committees of ATP 75s, WTA 250s and a WTA 500 event, so we believed we had a strong team with the necessary tools to organize this event.”

Cancun will mark the highest-level men's professional tennis tournament ever held in the entire Yucatán Peninsula. The organizers faced the challenge of meeting all ATP requirements while ensuring “high-level facilities, hotel accommodations and food options for the class of players that we will receive, who are used to top-class treatments.”Fans can expect a star-studded entry list.

The WTA has long has a tennis presence in Charleston, South Carolina's most populous city. In Sumter, about 100 miles northwest, the Serve First Open arrives with big ambitions.Tournament director Brian Hodge says the event was conceived “in the early part of the summer season” and was added to the calendar directly by the ATP. The short preparation time brought logistical hurdles.“Probably the biggest challenge was the small window to create a campus with all the player and officials' amenities, set up for televised matches and an outstanding fan environment for watching high-level tennis,” Hodge explained. “We are very happy to say we have done very well to create a great atmosphere for the players, tournament staff, and fans.”Spectators can look forward to “an exciting week of tennis with some high-level tennis up close from the rising stars on the Challenger Tour.” The field is stacked: Zizou Bergs, Kei Nishikori—making his comeback with a protected ranking—Mattia Bellucci, Roman Safiullin and Filip Misolic are among the headliners.The matches will be staged at the Palmetto Tennis Center, a 32-court facility with 24 hard courts and eight European red clay courts. For the Serve First Open, there will be about 500 seats on each of the two oversized feature courts, and 250 seats for the remaining match court.🖥️📱 Click here for live coverage on TennisChannel.com Monday, August 11 through Sunday, August 17

MASON, OH − The singles field at the Cincinnati Open is getting noticeably thinner as the tournament moves into its second week Aug. 11.

The Round of 32 begins Aug. 11 from the Lindner Family Tennis Center and there's no shortage of stellar matches on tap, including the No. 1 player from both the ATP and WTA.

Reigning Cincinnati Open champion and World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka matches up with No. 30 seed Emma Raducanu for the third time. Sabalenka is 2-0 in previous meetings, but their last bout was a competitive 7-6 (6), 6-4 clash on the Wimbledon grass.

ATP No. 1 Jannik Sinner is looking for a second-straight Rookwood Cup. Sinner is 38-2 on hard court this season and is a monster favorite on Center Court Aug. 11 against 23-year-old Canadian Gabriel Diallo.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time updates from the third round of the Cincinnati Open.

Felix Auger-Aliassime, the ATP No. 23 seed, is through to the Round of 16 after his opponent, France's Arthur Rinderknech, retired in the second set. Auger-Aliassime won the opening set 7-6 (4) and was leading 4-2 in the second.

Holger Rune has now reached the Round of 16 in back-to-back ATP 1000 events after a 7-6 (4), 6-3 win over American Alex Michelsen.

Jessica Bouzas Maneiro has now won 10 of her last 12 matches after taking out American wild card Taylor Townsend on Center Court.

Maneiro is one victory away from back-to-back WTA 1000 quarterfinals appearances after going 4-1 in the Canadian Open.

Ekaterina Alexandrova, the WTA No. 12 seed, is in the Round of 16 after an efficient 6-4, 6-3 victory over Maya Joint of Australia.

Alexandrova, the WTA No. 16, dished out seven aces to reach the Round of 16 for the first time in Cincinnati. She was previously 0-3 in the Round of 32 with losses in 2019, 2020 and 2022.

The seventh day of the Cincinnati Open has started from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

Wild card Taylor Townsend, the WTA No. 1 in doubles, is looking for another Cincinnati Open run (Round of 16 in 2024) in singles. She leads Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 3-2 in the first set on Center Court.

ATP No. 7 seed Holger Rune is on the Grandstand Court against No. 28 seed Alex Michelsen. Rune trails, 4-3, in the first set.

Jannik Sinner has admitted Carlos Alcaraz is too good for him – at golf. The world No. 1 overcame the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final a month ago, gaining his revenge after losing to the world No. 2 in the French Open final.

The two young tennis stars look set to dominate the sport in a similar way to Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic did before them. When Sinner and Alcaraz step onto the court with each other, fireworks and breathtaking tennis are almost a guarantee. But while the duo are always leathering huge forehands and backhands past each other, the story is different when they are playing with their clubs rather than their rackets.

Despite being narrowly ahead of Alcaraz in tennis in the rankings, Sinner insists there is only one winner when they have a game of golf together.

While speaking to The Tennis Channel, Sinner offered an insight into their battles on the course together. The Italian said: “Yeah, we actually played a couple of times before the tournament. I am not a good golfer, but I love to spend time doing different things.

“Sometimes we will be talking and then it'll be, ‘Maybe now, we go, because it is not late and tomorrow we have one day off, so maybe we will play a couple of holes here' – [it was the same] also last year.



“Here is the best place to play golf. In Cincinnati there is not so much to do. We are actually lucky the golf course is there. The first hole should be straight, but on the left there are lots of cars. If one ball finishes in the car [park] then that's me [done].”

When asked if they were going to face each other in Cincinnati, Sinner quickly replied: "No, no, no Carlos is too good for me. Me and my team is better [for me].”

At the Cincinnati Masters, Sinner has been the player who has been far too good. He opened his hard court campaign with a first round match against Daniel Elahi Galan.

The world No. 1 dominated the Colombian star, winning 96% of his 1st serve points on his way to a comprehensive 6-1, 6-1 triumph. He next faces 30th seed Gabriel Diallo of Canada in the second round.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz made hard work of beating Bosnia and Herzegovina ace Damir Dzumhur. Alcaraz won the first set with ease 6-1, but lost the second set 6-2, after Dzumhur raised his game

He would go on to regain his composure in the third and final set, winning 6-3 to move into the next round. The two-time Wimbledon winner will need to improve when he faces Hamad Medjedovic next.

Eight pairs have qualified via their combined rankings, and Rune (No. 9 in the world) and Anisimova (No. 8 in the world) made the cut without any difficulty. The Danish tennis star is optimistic ahead of the new Grand Slam initiative.

"We talked a bit and agreed that she will take care of the base line, and then I will take the net. I have seen both her forehand and backhand, and she has a lot of power, which is beneficial for me. And she has great hands, so I think we have a good chance."

"I won't say too much, but I believe that we can play some good doubles tennis together", says Rune to the Tennis Channel.

The US Open mixed doubles tournament will be held this year on 19/20 August  preceding the start of the US Open on 24 August. Rune and Anisimova were for a while just outside the group of eight couples who could qualify directly for the US Open's new mixed doubles initiative but thanks to Anisimova's Wimbledon campaign she moved up the rankings. 

"I saw her play at Wimbledon, and it's actually a lot of fun, that I said already at Queens that she would win Wimbledon. And then she went all the way to the final. It's fantastic to be allowed to share the court with her", says Rune.

Eight pairs have qualified for the mixed tournament, while eight wildcards will also be awarded. The following pairs are qualified via the combined ranking:

Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarrro 

Taylor Fritz and Elena Rybakina 

Casper Ruud and Ida Swiatek 

Jack Draper and Paula Badosa

Holger Rune and Amanda Anisimova 

Daniil Medvedev and Mirra Andreeva 

Tommy Paul and Jessica Pegula

Coco Gauff is back to winning ways on the court at the Cincinnati Open, but now faces a tricky rematch against Dayana Yastremska.

Gauff and Yastremska met in the first round of Wimbledon last month, where the Ukrainian pulled off a stunning upset.

Yastremska loved playing against Gauff, who she beat 7-6(7-3), 6-1 less than a month after the American won the French Open.

A rematch between the pair has now been served up in the third round of the Cincinnati Open, the latest event on the WTA Tour.

Gauff has set up the clash after defeating Wang Xinyu 6-3, 6-2 in her opener, having received a bye in round one.

And while Wimbledon will undoubtedly be on the back of her mind going into the match, the world number two will be eager to completely put those memories behind her with a win this time around.

Speaking ahead of the match, she said: “I don't ever think of revenge-type tennis. At first I used to think like that but then I am like I have to play too many people too many times to have a revenge mindset.

“I think for me it's a good measure to see where my game is. I thought that Wimbledon match was a tough loss for me and I don't think I approached it well.

“I always have trouble against her, she is a tough opponent, great ball striker who can pull winners out of anywhere.

“So it will be a tough test for me, especially having to play her again, but I think I have had more time to work on things in the hard court season and I definitely think it's a better surface than grass for me.

“So it's going to be a tough match but I am looking forward to it and hopefully I can do better than Wimby.”

Gauff was under immense pressure arriving at the All England Club, having only just beaten Aryna Sabalenka in Paris.

That stunning victory represented her second Grand Slam title, and indeed her second Grand Slam final win over Sabalenka.

But early signs of a potential Wimbledon flop were apparent not long after, as Gauff lost her opener to Wang in Berlin.

She then suffered the same fate against Yastremska at Wimbledon, and has since lost in the round of 16 at the Canadian Open.

That defeat came against eventual champion Victoria Mboko, who also shocked the likes of Elena Rybakina and Naomi Osaka en route to the trophy.

Gauff did, however, manage to clinch silverware in Montreal, winning the doubles event alongside McCartney Kessler.

Three years ago, it looked like Felix Auger-Aliassime was on his way to establishing himself as a top-10 talent on the ATP Tour. 

The Montreal native went to the semifinals at the 2021 US Open, won four titles in 2022, and was runner-up to Taylor Fritz at the ATP Finals at the end of the season.

Auger-Aliassime ended the 2022 campaign ranked as the No. 6 player in the world, and he was considered one of the sport's most promising young talents.

These days, Auger-Aliassime is known as a cautionary tale about how quickly things can change in the world of tennis.

Auger-Aliassime's career has been defined by inconsistent play and disappointing results in big tournaments. 

The 25-year-old has been eliminated in the first or second round in 10 of the last 13 Grand Slams, and he's just 2-5 this season at Masters 1000 events.

Auger-Aliassime has an opportunity to buck that trend at the Cincinnati Open, where he's a chunky -250 favorite over Arthur Rinderknech in the Round of 32.

The issue is that nothing is ever straightforward with Auger-Aliassime these days.

The same can be said of Rinderknech, who is in the midst of a bizarre stretch of tennis that saw him beat No. 3 Alexander Zverev in Round 1 of Wimbledon and No. 13 Casper Ruud last round in Cincinnati. In between, he lost back-to-back matches against players outside the top 100 in July.

It's impossible to predict what will happen when either of these players steps onto a tennis court right now, but only one of them is a -250 favorite.

KALAMAZOO, MI –– There was heat, there was rain, sweat and pain, but in the longest –– and most important –– tennis match of his career, Darwin Blanch made sure his game spoke loudly.

Along with his victory roar, which spoke even louder.

Emma Raducanu will bid to beat world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka for the first time at the Cincinnati Masters today (Monday) with the help of her new Spanish coach. The British No.1 set up a re-match of their Wimbledon clash with an impressive in over Olga Danilovic in her first match working with Francis Roig.

In the third round at SW19 last month, Raducanu had a point to lead 5-1 in the second set under the Centre Court roof before losing 7-6 6-4 to the Belarusian. She has yet to take a set off the US Open champion in their two previous meetings

Raducanu, who is up to world No.34 in the live rankings as she seeks a seeding for New York, said: “I'm reasonable enough, and I guess honest enough with myself, to know that different surfaces favour different people, and where my game is at in comparison. So, I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage (against Sabalenka), but we'll see how it goes.”

Raducanu's 6-3 6-2 win over world No.43 Olga Danilovic means she now has a 19-4 winning record against lower-ranked players over the last year.

Her problems have come against the best - and she has hired Rafa Nadal's former coach Roig as her eighth full-time coach to close this gap. “When I play the really top players where I can't run and scrap, wait on them to miss,” she said. “I think that's where I need to improve.

“And yeah, I'm hoping he can help me with that. There were four or five points (against Danilovic) where I did something that we were working on, and it's always really satisfying and rewarding when you hit a shot and you've worked on it in practice.

“So I think I'm going to improve a lot, hopefully doing the work day in, day out.”

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Billionaire heiress and eighth seed Emma Navarro has been stunningly sent packing from the Cincinnati Open, upset by German qualifier Ella Seidel in three sets on Monday morning (AEST).

After two hours and 10 minutes, Seidel prevailed 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 to progress to the third round.

Ranked world No.125 and competing in her first WTA 1000 tournament, Seide progressed through the qualifying rounds to book her place in the main draw for the tune-up tournament for the US Open.

In the first set, Seidel broke with her first opportunity, going up 5-4 before saving several break points against her to take the set 6-4.

But Navarro responded in the second set, claiming the first five consecutive games to take the set comfortably.

With all the momentum going into the deciding set, it seemed that the local would be the one to go for the victory.

Navarro led 4-1, 30-15 in the final set before capitulating, losing five games in a row.

The win marks Seidel's first win against a top-20 player.

The loss is a huge blow to Navarro, whose billionaire father, Ben Navarro, has invested more than $300 million in this tournament.

Through his private investment firm, Beemok Capital, Ben Navarro purchased the tournament in October 2022 and recently funded significant upgrades to the venue and its facilities for players and spectators.

Navarro and her sister Margaret also lost their doubles match together on Sunday.

Ben Navarro also owns the Charleston Open.

With another early elimination, Navarro is struggling to find form after returning to hardcourts. She will arrive at the US Open with only one win and three defeats.

Seidel will face another American in McCartney Kessler, in the third round at the Lindner Family Tennis Centre in Mason, Ohio.

Fellow American heiress Jessica Pegula advanced after securing a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Australian Kimberly Birrell.

Raducanu gave the No. 1 all she could handle on grass; can she do it again on hard courts?ByDavid KanePublished Aug 11, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 11, 2025

CINCINNATI, Ohio—The Cincinnati Open will host a rematch of one of the most intriguing clashes of the 2025 Wimbledon Championships as world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka takes on Emma Raducanu in a battle of US Open champions on Monday.“She challenged me in that match,” Sabalenka said in a post-match mixed zone following her opening-round win over Marketa Vondrousova, “and I like to accept tough challenges, so I'm super excited facing her on a hard court.”🖥️📱 Click here for live coverage on TennisChannel.com Estimated start time: 12:10 p.m. ET, Monday, August 11A former world No. 10, Raducanu gave Sabalenka all she could handle over two sets beneath the Centre Court roof, forcing a tiebreaker in the first set and leading 4-1 in the second before Sabalenka ultimately secured an electric victory, 7-6 (6), 6-4.It was a match Raducanu was wishing she could play again.

It was a match Raducanu was wishing she could play again.

It's like a fact-finding match so you can see where you are in comparison to the top. I also think form fluctuates so much on the day, so you can lose 2&1 one day, and you could make it close the next day. It can be down to a few points. I'm excited either way. Aryna is world No. 1, so it'll be an exciting match and a good experience. Emma Raducanu on facing Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati

“I would say I thought, ‘I would love to have another crack at that, on grass, tomorrow,'” Raducanu said with a laugh after her own opening win against Olga Danilovic. “But I know and I'm honestly reasonable enough and honest enough with myself to know that different surfaces favor different people and where my game is at in comparison.“I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage, but we'll see how it goes [on hard courts].”Sabalenka has indeed been one of the best players on hard courts since winning her first of two Australian Open titles in 2023. The top seed captured her first US Open title last summer after first storming to the Cincinnati title, but Raducanu has proven her mettle on concrete, winning the 2021 US Open as a qualifier.The years that followed for Raducanu were riddled by physical setbacks and multiple surgeries. Now healthy and flanked by a strong team, one that recently added former Rafael Nadal coach Francisco Roig, the 22-year-old has slowly climbed back up the rankings from an April 2024 low of No. 303.

“It's important being seeded at these tournaments,” said Raducanu, the No. 30 seed in Cincinnati. “At Masters, you get a bye, which helps a lot. Then at the Slams, you avoid playing a top seed in the first round. Equally, with the stage that I'm at with my tennis and my development right now, it's about just improving the overall level and feeling I have on court, not having holes as much, I think that's my main priority.“I know there will be a time where I'll be targeting big tournaments, Masters, and Slams. Right now, that's not my goal. My goal is to improve as a player.”Sabalenka took note of some of those improvements first hand at SW19, the top seed praising the Brit ahead of their third-round rematch.“She played incredible tennis,” said Sabalenka. “I'm super happy to see her mentally and physically back. She'll definitely be back in Top 10 very soon.”Both Sabalenka and Raducanu plan to embrace the meeting as a challenge. But for the latter, it's more of a litmus test.

Both Sabalenka and Raducanu plan to embrace the meeting as a challenge. But for the latter, it's more of a litmus test.

Sabalenka leads their head-to-head 2-0, but Raducanu played Sabalenka tough over two sets at Wimbledon last month.

“It's like a fact-finding match,” she mused, “so you can see where you are in comparison to the top. I also think form fluctuates so much on the day, so you can lose 2&1 one day, and you could make it close the next day. It can be down to a few points. I'm excited either way. Aryna is world No. 1, so it'll be an exciting match and a good experience.”For one who has ready achieved so much, Raducanu is proud to take on an underdog role, perhaps as a means of reducing pressure but also nodding to the reality that this is effectively her first full season as a healthy top tier player.“It was great to have had a bye so we can actually get two days of training,” she said of her early work with Roig. “That was really crucial, to be honest. Other than that, in the last few months, I haven't actually had many training weeks because I've been doing better in tournaments, which is a great thing.

But I think actual quality and level improves with practice.”The combination of Sabalenka's consistency with Raducanu's calm, confident approach could yield the first must-watch match of the tournament, and one that could determine who goes on to wear the crown in Queen City.

For one who has ready achieved so much, Raducanu is proud to take on an underdog role, perhaps as a means of reducing pressure but also nodding to the reality that this is effectively her first full season as a healthy top tier player.“It was great to have had a bye so we can actually get two days of training,” she said of her early work with Roig. “That was really crucial, to be honest. Other than that, in the last few months, I haven't actually had many training weeks because I've been doing better in tournaments, which is a great thing.

It's like a fact-finding match so you can see where you are in comparison to the top. I also think form fluctuates so much on the day, so you can lose 2&1 one day, and you could make it close the next day. It can be down to a few points. I'm excited either way. Aryna is world No. 1, so it'll be an exciting match and a good experience. Emma Raducanu on facing Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati

“I would say I thought, ‘I would love to have another crack at that, on grass, tomorrow,'” Raducanu said with a laugh after her own opening win against Olga Danilovic. “But I know and I'm honestly reasonable enough and honest enough with myself to know that different surfaces favor different people and where my game is at in comparison.“I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage, but we'll see how it goes [on hard courts].”Sabalenka has indeed been one of the best players on hard courts since winning her first of two Australian Open titles in 2023. The top seed captured her first US Open title last summer after first storming to the Cincinnati title, but Raducanu has proven her mettle on concrete, winning the 2021 US Open as a qualifier.The years that followed for Raducanu were riddled by physical setbacks and multiple surgeries. Now healthy and flanked by a strong team, one that recently added former Rafael Nadal coach Francisco Roig, the 22-year-old has slowly climbed back up the rankings from an April 2024 low of No. 303.

“It's important being seeded at these tournaments,” said Raducanu, the No. 30 seed in Cincinnati. “At Masters, you get a bye, which helps a lot. Then at the Slams, you avoid playing a top seed in the first round. Equally, with the stage that I'm at with my tennis and my development right now, it's about just improving the overall level and feeling I have on court, not having holes as much, I think that's my main priority.“I know there will be a time where I'll be targeting big tournaments, Masters, and Slams. Right now, that's not my goal. My goal is to improve as a player.”Sabalenka took note of some of those improvements first hand at SW19, the top seed praising the Brit ahead of their third-round rematch.“She played incredible tennis,” said Sabalenka. “I'm super happy to see her mentally and physically back. She'll definitely be back in Top 10 very soon.”Both Sabalenka and Raducanu plan to embrace the meeting as a challenge. But for the latter, it's more of a litmus test.

Sabalenka leads their head-to-head 2-0, but Raducanu played Sabalenka tough over two sets at Wimbledon last month.

I actually find that my level improves more with practice than it does with playing matches. Playing matches, you get better at playing big points, you get more match fit. But I think actual quality and level improves with practice.”The combination of Sabalenka's consistency with Raducanu's calm, confident approach could yield the first must-watch match of the tournament, and one that could determine who goes on to wear the crown in Queen City.

2025 season: The story so far

Cadillac: Everything You Need To Know About F1's New Team

As the 2025 season takes a breather, F1.com takes a look back at the championship fight so far between McLaren team mates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

The 2025 season has featured several fascinating storylines so far – and one of these has centred around the increasingly close intra-team championship fight that has been playing out between McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

From Round 1 in Australia through to the last race before F1's traditional summer break in Hungary, the battle has seen its fair share of changes in momentum – as well as a dramatic collision along the way.

We've been taking a look back at how the duel has unfolded throughout the first half of the campaign – with plenty more to come when the action resumes at the end of August…

When the season kicked off at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Norris laid down an early marker by beating Piastri to pole position.

While Piastri remained on the tail of his team mate during the first half of Sunday's race, heavy rainfall in the latter stages resulted in the home hero running off the track, dropping him down the order in the process.

Throughout the hectic final stages, Norris held position to take victory by just 0.895s from Red Bull's Max Verstappen, with Piastri having to settle for ninth place.

Piastri was looking for a better outing when F1 moved on to Shanghai one week later – and while McLaren lost out to the Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's Sprint, Piastri grabbed pole position in Qualifying.

Despite a challenge from Mercedes' George Russell at the start, the driver from Melbourne looked in commanding form as he led throughout before claiming his first win of the season.

Norris, meanwhile, reported an issue with his brakes during the latter stages but held onto second place, giving the Woking-based squad a 1-2 finish.

Norris and Piastri dominated the top of the free practice timesheets when Formula 1 arrived at Japan's Suzuka Circuit. However, Verstappen caused a surprise by outpacing both to secure pole position.

While there was a close moment between Verstappen and Norris when both emerged from the pit exit at the same time during Sunday's race, the Dutchman remained ahead and ultimately became the third different winner in as many Grands Prix.

The final 10 laps saw Piastri close in on Norris during the battle for P2 before his challenge fell away towards the end, meaning that Norris led home his team mate in a 2-3 formation.

After the opening three races, Norris led the championship by one point from Verstappen, with Piastri 13 points adrift in third. But it was Piastri who enjoyed a stronger Qualifying at Round 4 in Bahrain, the Australian taking pole while Norris ended the session back in sixth.

From there it proved to be an impressive weekend for Piastri, who built a strong lead on race day before eventually crossing the line with a sizeable 15-second margin from Russell in P2.

Norris' good recovery drive saw him complete the podium in third, but the Briton had lost a fair bit of ground to his team mate in the championship, with Piastri having leapfrogged Verstappen to move just three points behind Norris.

After topping second and third practice in Saudi Arabia, Norris looked in promising form entering into Qualifying – but things unravelled for the Briton when a hefty crash in Q3 put him out of the session and left him down in P10 on the grid.

Piastri, meanwhile, lined up in second behind polesitter Verstappen. An early battle between the pair resulted in Verstappen being handed a five-second time penalty, dropping him behind the Australian who went on to claim a mostly untroubled win from there.

While Norris recovered to a final result of P4, Piastri's victory was enough to steal the championship lead from his team mate, making him the first Australian to head the standings in 15 years.

The Miami Grand Prix was the scene of Norris' debut win in 2024 and the British driver proved victorious at the track again during this year's Sprint, with a well-timed pit stop bringing him out ahead of Piastri.

That run did not continue into Sunday's race, however. With Verstappen taking pole ahead of Norris – and Piastri back in fourth – a mistake from Norris at the start dropped him back, while Piastri moved forwards and eventually overtook Verstappen for the lead.

Norris climbed back up to second and helped McLaren to seal another dominant 1-2, allowing Piastri to strengthen his championship lead in the process.

Piastri was again the man to beat in Qualifying for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the Australian clinching pole position while Norris ended the session in fourth.

It was second-placed Verstappen who starred on race day, however, with the Red Bull man making a stunning move on Piastri to take the lead on Lap 1.

The Dutchman went on to win, while Norris finished ahead of Piastri in second. This put the gap between them in the championship at 13 points.

Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets of every practice session during his home race weekend in Monaco – but Norris beat the Ferrari driver to pole position in Qualifying.

On Sunday the Briton held that position through Virtual Safety Car phases and a mandated two-stop strategy rule to claim his first Grand Prix win since the beginning of the season.

While Piastri joined him on the podium in third, the 24-year-old's championship lead had been cut to just three points.

The momentum swung back to Piastri as F1 returned to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for Round 9 of the season.

After beating Norris to P1 on the grid in Qualifying, the championship leader returned to the top step of the rostrum on race day.

Norris was not far behind, with the team securing another 1-2, but Piastri had eked out his title standings advantage to 10 points.

Entering into the Canadian Grand Prix weekend, Norris admitted that it was a case of “when” not “if” he and Piastri would come to blows on track during the battle for the World Championship.

Within a matter of days, that prediction had proven accurate. After a slightly weaker weekend for the squad in general, Norris was chasing down his team mate in a scrap for fourth during the closing stages of the race.

Contact occurred between them, resulting in Norris – who took responsibility for the incident – pulling off track with damage, while Piastri crossed the line in fourth. It was an incident that McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella labelled as “not acceptable”.

Off the back of that incident in Montreal, Norris appeared keen to bounce back at the next round in Austria, having set the pace in second and third practice before grabbing pole position in Qualifying, with Piastri placing in third.

What followed on Sunday was a thrilling race-long duel between the McLaren duo as they fought for the lead, Piastri remaining hot on Norris' tail throughout much of the Grand Prix.

Norris ultimately kept his team mate at bay by 2.695s to seal his third win of the campaign – and, after his non-score in Canada, the Briton was now 15 points off in the championship fight.

Verstappen again beat both McLarens to pole position at Silverstone – but a dramatic Grand Prix saw the order change.

In an eventful wet-dry race, Piastri overtook Verstappen for P1 just as rain started to fall. The Australian was later hit with a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much when preparing for a restart following a Safety Car period, handing the lead to Norris during the pit stops phase.

From there Norris claimed victory in front of his home crowd, with Piastri coming home in a slightly less happy second. His title lead had again been reduced, with the margin now down to eight points.

The Sprint spoils went to Verstappen as F1 arrived at Spa-Francorchamps for Round 13, the Dutchman having overtaken pole man Piastri in the early stages – but it was a fight between the McLaren pair when it came to Qualifying.

Norris outpaced Piastri by just 0.085s to claim pole. However, after a delay to Sunday's race due to heavy rainfall, Piastri was on the charge when racing eventually got underway and made a bold move on his team mate along the Kemmel Straight to take the lead.

While Norris went on the pursuit in the latter stages, he ultimately crossed the line just over three seconds adrift of Piastri – and, with that, the Australian had stretched his championship lead out again to 16 points.

Hungary hosted the final round of the campaign prior to the sport's traditional summer break – a venue that was also the scene of Piastri's first Grand Prix victory 12 months earlier.

Qualifying threw up a surprise result when Leclerc grabbed an unexpected pole, and the Monegasque initially led for the early stages of the race. However, while Norris had fallen away at the start, an alternative one-stop strategy put the Briton ahead of both Leclerc and Piastri as the event progressed.

Piastri went on the chase of the other McLaren during the final phase, providing a thrilling conclusion to the Grand Prix – but Norris held off his team mate to win by just 0.698s.

The impact on the championship? Norris is now only nine points away from Piastri – and, with a further 10 rounds to go when the season resumes, it looks like there is plenty more action to come in the fight for the title.

So if one of the seats had to be earmarked for an American, who would the best options be? We asked IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe to pick out five drivers Caddilac could bring to the F1 grid…

Universal Pictures said Monday it is moving DreamWorks Animation's Shrek 5 from December 23, 2026 to Wednesday, June 30, 2027. Essentially, the summer is better corridor for the mega return of the green fairy-tale ogre and friends; that's the season he's always dwelled in. It will rep 17 years since the previous Shrek movie, 2010's Shrek Forever After. 


	In addition, Universal said today that an untitled Illumination event movie is going earlier in 2027, from June 30 to April 16. It takes the place of an untitled Universal event film that had been on the release date calendar.

	











Shrek repertoire members Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are coming back to voice their signature roles of Shrek, Donkey and Fiona, respectively, As previously announced, Zendaya is joining the cast.




			Watch on Deadline		







Shrek 5 will be directed by franchise veterans Conrad Vernon and Walt Dohrn. Vernon's directing credits include Shrek 2 and Madagascar 2, and is the voice of Gingerbread Man (aka Gingy) in the Shrek films. Dohrn (Trolls franchise) worked on the second and third Shrek films as a writer and artist and as Head of Story on the fourth film. Dohrn also voiced the character of Rumpelstilskin in Shrek Forever After.


	The film is produced by returning producer Gina Shay (Trolls franchise), who produced Shrek Forever After, and by Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri. The fifth-quel will be co-directed by Brad Ableson (Minions: The Rise of Gru, The Simpsons).


	The four Shrek movies have amassed $2.9 billion at the global box office in addition to a global live-touring show; an award-winning Broadway musical that earned eight Tony nominations and 12 Drama Desk nominations; plus an immersive, top tourist destination in London; and popular events and attractions across Universal Studios Parks worldwide.


	The original 2001 movie won the first-ever Oscar for Best Animated Feature.

Westside Merchandising says the Baton Rouge, La., rapper breached their contract by hiring a new merch partner for his first-ever headlining tour.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



As YoungBoy Never Broke Again prepares to embark on his MASA Tour this September, the rapper has been hit with a lawsuit for allegedly trying to cut an established merchandise partner out of his first-ever headlining trek.


	YoungBoy (Kentrell DeSean Gaulden) and his label Never Broke Again face the claims in a federal complaint filed Friday (Aug. 8) by retail partner Westside Merchandising. The company supposedly paid YoungBoy a $1 million advance in 2023 as part of a licensing deal that gave the company the exclusive right to sell the rapper's apparel and other merch online and at live shows.


	Westside says the deal requires YoungBoy to promote the company's merch — obligations he's largely shirked due to being in prison on gun charges for the majority of the contract. Yet even now that YoungBoy is free (and pardoned by President Donald Trump), he's allegedly still not marketing the apparel on Instagram as promised.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In fact, soon after announcing his MASA arena tour in May, YoungBoy sent Westside a letter announcing he was terminating their contract due to “poor performance” on the company's part.


	“The purpose behind defendants' purported termination is clear: YoungBoy has embarked on a nationwide 32-date lucrative tour, and defendants have obviously obtained a new advance from another company to handle the touring merchandise even though defendants are contractually obligated to use Westside,” reads the complaint. “Westside has an exclusive license to sell Never Broke Again merchandise — rights that upon information and belief will be infringed by the new merchandise that will be sold at YoungBoy's upcoming tour.”


	Westside is now seeking a court order confirming that it is entitled to handle merch at the MASA Tour — scheduled to kick off Sept. 1 at Dallas' American Airlines Center — as well as financial damages from YoungBoy.


	The lawsuit alleges that, in addition to trying to cut Westside out of the MASA Tour, YoungBoy also breached the licensing contract by promoting a competitor's merch and getting in the way of Westside's business efforts.


	Westside says, for example, that YoungBoy ruined a potentially lucrative partnership to sell the rapper's merch at the retail chain Pure Atlanta by insulting the store's founder with an Instagram comment that called her “unprofessional and clout chasing.”


	“Although Westside was diligent, obtained numerous opportunities for the venture, and performed all of its contractual duties in good faith, YoungBoy did nothing except fail to perform his duties, while impeding Westside's efforts, and causing the parties to lose significant opportunities and profits,” says the complaint.


	Reps for YoungBoy did not immediately return a request for comment on the allegations.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, A24 has acquired genre writer Ian Tuason‘s horror film The Undertone, securing worldwide rights following its July 27th premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival.


	While unconfirmed, we're told that there were six buyers in the mix, and that the deal was for mid-7 figures — a momentous one for a young filmmaker unveiling his debut feature.


The Undertone stars Nina Kiri as Evy, a paranormal podcast host who returns home to care for her dying mother. Thereafter, she begins receiving recordings from a married couple plagued by strange noises in their house, pulling her into a spiral of fear and paranoia.

	











	In her description of the film for Fantasia Fest, programming director Carolyn Mauricette wrote, “Fans of SKINAMARINK and I AM THE PRETTY THING WHO LIVES IN THE HOUSE will love this slow-burn nightmare that will make hackles on your neck rise and your blood chill.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	The film was produced by Dan Slater for Slaterverse Pictures and Cody Calahan for Black Fawn Films. Exec producers include Steven Schneider and Roy Lee for Spooky Pictures, Chad Archibald for Black Fawn Films, Brit MacRae and Daril Fannin for Kino Studios, and DimensionGate.


	A Toronto-based writer-director active in the genre space, who won a Watty Award in 2016, Tuason's live-action virtual reality horror shorts have garnered over 14M organic views on YouTube, showcasing at SXSW, Fantasia Film Festival, and the Marché du Film NEXT Pavilion in Cannes.

	











	The deal was negotiated by Black Fawn Distro and 3 Arts Entertainment, whose Will Rowbotham and Luke Maxwell rep the filmmaker.

Plus, Chappell Roan's "The Subway" rumbles in at a career-best No. 3.

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden” goes up, up, up a spot for its first week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.


	The aspirational song is from the soundtrack to the smash animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters and glows as the first Hot 100 leader for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI. The set rules Billboard's Soundtracks chart for a seventh week.


	Notably, “Golden” is the eighth song associated with Korean pop to conquer the Hot 100 — and the first by female vocalists. It joins “Like Crazy” by Jimin of BTS in 2023, and BTS' six No. 1s in 2020-21: “Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat),” with Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo; “Dynamite”; “Life Goes On”; “Butter”; “Permission to Dance”; and “My Universe,” with Coldplay. (HUNTR/X singers EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.)


	“Golden” is also the first IRL Hot 100 No. 1 by any act with a fictional background since the ensemble No. 1 “We Don't Talk About Bruno,” which reigned for five weeks in February-March 2022. It, too, was released from a hit animated film, Disney's Encanto, and sung by multiple vocalists as their characters in the movie.


	As for all-women collectives of three or more members, HUNTR/X is the first to top the Hot 100 in 24 years — since Destiny's Child dominated with “Bootylicious” for two weeks in August 2001.


	Plus, Chappell Roan's “The Subway” pulls into the Hot 100 at No. 3, marking her highest debut and rank. The song starts as her fourth top 10.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Aug. 16, 2025) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, Aug. 12. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 31.7 million official streams (up 9% week-over-week), 8.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 71%) and 7,000 sold (up 35%) in the United States Aug. 1-7.


	The track slays for a third week at No. 1 on Streaming Songs and rises 5-3 for a new best on Digital Song Sales. It makes history in the former metric, as it's the Hot 100's greatest gainer in streaming for a record-breaking sixth straight week. (It surpasses the five weekly wins in a row for Migos' “Bad and Boujee,” featuring Lil Uzi Vert, in early 2017.) “Golden” debuted at No. 81 on the July 5 chart and began its streak the following week.


	Plus, “Golden” is the first non-debuting title to clear 30 million weekly official U.S. streams since Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” in late March. (In between, two songs reached the mark in their first chart weeks: Playboi Carti's “Evil J0rdan” and Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae.)


	Flying colors: “Golden” is the fourth Hot 100 No. 1 with “gold” or “golden” in its title to shine atop the Hot 100.


	Here are all the glittering “gold” records:


	Honorable mentions (silver medals?): 24kGoldn sparkled with “Mood,” featuring iann dior, for eight weeks at No. 1 in 2020-21, and Bobby Goldsboro led with “Honey” for five weeks in 1968.


	(While no songs with “silver” in their names have led topped the Hot 100, “Fly, Robin, Fly” by Silver Convention did for three weeks in 1975.)


	Chappell Roan's “The Subway” rolls into the Hot 100 at No. 3, marking the singer-songwriter's highest career debut and rank as she earns her fourth top 10. All four have hit the top five: “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Pink Pony Club” each rose to No. 4 last September and this April, respectively, and “The Giver” entered at its No. 5 peak in March.


	“The Subway” tallied 25.1 million streams, 787,000 in airplay audience and 6,000 sold in its first full week of tracking (no pun intended), following its July 31 release as a recording. Chappell Roan premiered the song live during her Governors Ball set on June 7, 2024, and built buzz for it by playing it regularly in concert since.


	(The song becomes the highest charting Hot 100 hit with “subway” in its title. Petula Clark rode her classic “Don't Sleep in the Subway” to No. 5 in July 1967.)


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” drops to No. 2 on the Hot 100 after nine nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It claims an eighth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (73.6 million, essentially even) and an 11th week atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the survey made its seasonal return after Memorial Day.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 3-4 on the Hot 100 after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It posts a 12th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” falls 4-5 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it debuted at its No. 2 high. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay for a second week (20.9 million, up 23%).


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” is steady at its No. 6 Hot 100 best, and Wallen's “Just in Case” descends 5-7 after reaching No. 2.


	Saja Boys, HUNTR/X's targets in KPop Demon Hunters, climb 9-8 for a new Hot 100 high with “Your Idol.”


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024 and closed as the year's No. 1 song, backtracks 7-9 as it adds a record-extending 103rd week on the chart overall and a record-boosting 73rd week in the top 10.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles 8-10, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning in July 2024.

	On Monday morning, Florence Welch posted a video of herself digging a hole and yelling in it… First of all, relatable. Second of all, does this mean new music?


	Welch posted a cryptic video of herself in a red dress in heels digging a hole in the ground with a dagger, before taking deep breaths and yelling into it three times as if she were escaping a killer in a horror film. Aside from comments like “Girl, same,” many Florence + the Machine fans speculated that the post may be teasing the arrival of new music from the group.

A post shared by Florence Welch (@florence)


	If new music is truly on the way, it'll be the first release from the group since 2022's Dance Fever, which marked Florence and the Machine‘s fifth LP. That project was postponed by two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album featured songs such as “King,” “My Love,” and Free,” and earned a “Complete Edition” the following year. The band toured that record in 2022 and 2023 for their last run of the era.

	Back in May, Florence shared a video of herself singing “Girls Against God” as she reflected on three years of Dance Fever. “‘And it's good to be alive crying into cereal at midnight' Dance Fever was released 3 years ago today,” she wrote on Instagram. “A pandemic fever dream record. About plagues past and current.”

	Since “Dance Fever,” Florence and the Machine released “Mermaids” in 2023, shared the live version of Symphony of Lungs for BBC Proms, and a remix of “Say My Name” with Morgan Seatree.

	President Donald Trump announced Monday he is placing Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, and is deploying the National Guard in the city, insisting the action was necessary “to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.” He said this would be “Liberation Day” for D.C. 


	“The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled,” Trump said Monday, contradicting figures that the U.S. attorney released earlier this year showing a downward trajectory for these crimes. Car thefts were even year over year, and armed carjackings are down 53 percent. 


	As recently as January, the Department of Justice was touting the fact that violent crime in Washington D.C. “is the lowest it has been in over 30 years.”


	“I'm officially invoking section 740 of the district of Columbia home rule act,” Trump said Monday, referring to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which contains a provision that authorizes the president to temporarily seize control of the police in the case of an emergency for 48 hours at a time. “I'm placing the D.C. Metropolitan police department under direct federal control.” The move to bring in the National Guard came from a presidential memo signed earlier this morning. 

	











	From the White House podium, Trump alluded to the idea that police will be emboldened by the changes. “They love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform,” he said, apparently referring to protesters. “The police are standing and they're told, ‘Don't do anything under any circumstances.' And you can see they want to get at it. And they're standing there and people are spitting in their face, and they're not allowed to do anything. But now they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” 

	











	The most prominent recent example of protesters attacking law enforcement in Washington D.C. is probably Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of President Trump rioted outside the Capitol building. One hundred and forty police officers were injured in the incident, and one of those injured officers, Brian Sicknick, later died. Trump, however, focused on violence perpetrated by individuals who are under 18, as well as disbanding homeless encampments within the city.

	On Monday, Trump suggested he may seek to deploy the National Guard to other cities as he did to Los Angeles in June, following protests against Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raids. He mentioned Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore and Oakland. 


	“We have other cities also that are bad,” Trump said. “We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to lose our cities over this. And this will go further. We're starting very strongly with D.C., and we're going to clean it up real quick, very quickly.”


	Trump's announcement that the federal government would take control of D.C.'s police force was preceded by an incident involving Edward Coristine, a former DOGE staffer known by his online alias “Big Balls.” Coristine, who still works for the Social Security Administration, was injured in an attempted carjacking.

	Coristine, Trump said Monday, “was left dripping in blood. He thought he was dead with a broken nose and concussion.”


	Trump's announcement came the same morning that a judge rejected a Department of Justice request to unseal grand jury testimony given in the case against Jeffrey Epstein. The embattled president has been trying to contain the continuing fallout from the Department of Justice's announcement last month that it would give no further disclosures in the Epstein case. Many on social media decried the move in D.C. as a distraction from the case. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department informed Trump in May that his name was repeatedly mentioned in the Epstein files. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing.

Bill Lawrence also unveils the season-two moment that was completely candid and how Brett Goldstein came to be cast.


							By 

	Seija Rankin


Senior Editor


	When Bill Lawrence and his Shrinking co-creators were writing the show's second season, they knew that casting the part of Louis — the drunk driver who killed the wife of Jason Segel's Jimmy — was going to be extremely difficult. Segel suggested tapping Brett Goldstein, but Lawrence was resistant. “I kept thinking, ‘He's known as [Ted Lasso's] Roy Kent, and he's too gruff,' ” says the showrunner. He eventually agreed to let Goldstein take on the role on one condition: that he shave his signature facial hair to make the character, a pivotal element of the season-two plotline, more vulnerable. “I called Brett upand said, ‘If you think you can do this, you should, but if you screw it up, you're going to ruin the show and it's going to get canceled,' ” Lawrence recalls with a laugh. “In the end I thought he just killed it, and I was so proud of him, and now I'm annoyed that his casting wasn't my idea.”

Shrinking did not get canceled; it received nine Emmy nominations, including its first for outstanding comedy series. Here, the perennially busy showrunner took a break from working on the third season (and the development of the Scrubs reboot, and the fourth season of Ted Lasso, and the development of an upcoming untitled HBO series) to break down what made a difference on their sophomore effort. 




Harrison Ford got his first Emmy nomination for this season; do you feel like you learned anything about how to write for him from the first season?


	One of the cheat sheets to successful streaming television is, at least for me, working with actors with whom I've worked before. Like Jason or my wife [Christa Miller]. We didn't know Harrison personally, so we originally wrote him as a very serious guy. As he grew to trust us, we realized he was game for anything, and that freed us up to write stuff for him that we normally wouldn't. I also noticed how vulnerable and emotional he was, that he made stuff sad even when we didn't put that in the script. Like the Thanksgiving dinner speech in the season-two finale; he could have delivered that matter-of-fact, and it would have worked. We shot everyone's reactions to him simultaneously, and a lot of those emotional reactions were real. It was a super poignant moment — and I'm a hard, cynical dude, so I got surprised by it. 

	











I'm surprised to hear you describe yourself as such.


	I mean that in terms of, I don't really get surprised on TV sets anymore. It's why I love having young writers around, because they still get that wow factor. I'm the luckiest guy on the planet, and I'm super grateful to get to do this, but one of the things that comes from getting your 10,000 hours in something is you don't expect to be surprised. When you are, it's revelatory.


How hard was it, logistically, to pull together that scene — with your entire cast in one room at the same time?


	It can be self-indulgent to direct your own show, but one of the reasons I directed that one is I knew I was the only one who was allowed to ask certain things of the cast for that. It was a giant room of thespians, but the whole scene was in service to Harrison's speech. And it's a nightmare for a crew to be like, “We're going to shoot eight pages at one location and there are 17 actors.” But it was worth it. 


This season has a lot of guest stars. Do you write your ideal actors into the script?


	We'll often write one draft where the character isn't too specific, and then we'll go to Candice Bergen or Damon Wayans — the second they say yes, even before the ink is dry, we'll do a pass for their voice. But I also wrestle with some of the casting, like maybe I shouldn't have the guy who played the janitor on Scrubs be on Shrinking, or my wife on Shrinking, or now I have Jamie Tartt from Ted Lasso [Phil Dunster] as one of the male leads on the new Steve Carell show. But also, if you think someone is talented and you like spending time with them, then you would be silly not to keep hiring them. 

	











Did you go through that same process for the character of Louis, played by Brett Goldstein?


	No, because once it was Brett, then all the writing was for him. And at the end of the day, he's going to do that role the way he wants too, since he's a creator too. I don't like it when people have a bigger vote than me because I'm a control freak, so that drove me a little insane.


Are you used to writing and showrunning for the cadence of streaming networks by now? 


	Whether I'm doing 26 episodes of Scrubs or 10 episodes of the Steve Carell show, I have always found a way to be completely behind schedule. I don't know how I do it. I don't have the energy of a young writer anymore. They kick me out of the writer's room in the evenings now — I get grumpy, so they're like, why don't you just come back in the morning and see what we did? But one thing I'm going to watch really closely is The Pitt. I'm a huge fan of that show, and I love how quickly they seem to be turning it around. As a fan, I can get bummed out when there's a huge gap between seasons. We're starting to shoot the second season of Bad Monkey in a few weeks, and it was such a summer beach read last year, I wish the seasons were closer together.


Shrinking gained a lot of momentum despite the large gap between seasons, do you think there's a secret to that success?


	There are a few things. You gain a toehold into who the actors and actresses are, and the show gets stronger for it. The best example in Shrinking is Michael Urie. By the time the second season was starting, we'd seen him on Broadway in Once Upon a Mattress and the whole world was learning how dynamic he is. So the show got better by us realizing the sort of lines we could give him. I've also learned that the shows I like the most have a true beginning, middle and end. We're planning on doing a fourth season, knock on wood, and we know that if we started that season and Jason Segel's character was like, I've been thinking about it and I'm still really sad about my wife, people would be like wait you already told that exact story. They need to feel like the characters are going on new adventures.

	











This is truly no shade to The Bear because I still find it compelling, but that's sort of what is happening with Carmen's storyline.


	I swear, I'm not trying to slam it either! Here's one of the ways we look at things: We're rebooting Scrubs, and I don't get to work on it a ton because I'm at Warner Brothers and it's a Disney show, but a lot of the original writers and cast got to help out on the pilot. One of the first things Zach Braff said was, I cannot be a 50-year-old doing the same things. I have to be older, I have to be more mature. I remember once during like the eighth season of the original show, a journalist asking Zach how do you think your character has changed since the first year? He goes, I think I have a beard now. Television can't do that anymore.


Can you tell us anything about the new season of Shrinking?


	Right now our biggest goal is just locking it all down and making sure we get to make the show with the same cast. This is a business and these guys are all so good that they have one thousand options. But one of the best things for us is it starts from the top. I was excited to talk to you today specifically, because I saw Apple posted that video of Harrison on his birthday on set. What I'm assuming is going to happen is that we figure it out sooner rather than later and then we'll get Brett, me and Jason together to go talk to Harrison and the gang and say, here's the story, I hope you're up for signing up for it. We hope everyone's game for doing another one.

	











Can you envision what the endgame of the show will be?


	The way we approach Shrinking is that we know Jason's character's journey, which is grief, forgiveness and moving forward. That's a three-season tale. But if you're asking me, “What are the next three seasons going to be?” Well, they're therapists, and just because you've gotten over the biggest stick in the spokes of your life doesn't mean there's no more pathos. We intentionally put these people in a world that brings all of that to their doorstep, so there's always more story to tell. We definitely put some Easter eggs into the third season that will allow people to see what's coming.

The rising star, who will lead filmmaker Zach Cregger's 'Resident Evil' movie, also discusses how his time on set with Josh Brolin impacted their upcoming feature 'Whalefall.' 


							By 

	Brian Davids


Writer


[This story contains major spoilers for Weapons.]


Weapons is a watershed moment for star Austin Abrams. 




	The scene-stealer of Zach Cregger's mystery-horror film is on the verge of going from one of the names atop a call sheet to the name atop a call sheet. The 28-year-old Florida native has already booked the starring role in Cregger's next film, Resident Evil, and he's currently leading Brian Duffield's highly anticipated adaptation of Whalefall for 20th Century.

Weapons chronicles a collection of characters in Maybrook, PA, as they orbit the baffling disappearance of 17 schoolkids at 2:17 AM. Abrams was a part of Cregger's original cast that once featured the likes of Pedro Pascal. But due to the delay caused by 2023's WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, Pascal's crowded schedule forced him to exit the role of Archer Graff. The rest of the main cast also followed suit, but Abrams became the lone exception who was willing to wait it out and not pursue other work while Cregger reshuffled the deck.

	











	“I just wanted to do Weapons,” Abrams tells The Hollywood Reporter. “When [Cregger's Barbarian] cut to Justin Long [to begin its second act], I immediately thought, ‘Whoever the fuck made this movie, I fucking love this person.' So when I got out of the theater, I was like, ‘I need to figure out how to meet this guy and work with this guy.' And it's so rare that it actually happens.”


	As for his Resident Evil casting, Abrams can only speculate as to how much his loyal gesture influenced Cregger's decision to have him carry his original story in the video game-based franchise.

	











	“I don't think it hurt anything. If I did something else instead of Weapons, I certainly don't think that would've helped me do something like Resident Evil,” Abrams admits.


	(Spoilers ahead.) Josh Brolin ended up portraying the role that Pascal vacated in the now critical and commercial hit. His grieving father character eventually has a climactic confrontation with James, Abrams' homeless addict character, at the house where all the missing schoolchildren have congregated. James and Archer's borderline slapstick fight was already quite bizarre since Abrams' character was possessed by the same type of witch's spell that brought the kids to that particular home in the first place. But what makes it even more bizarre is that Brolin is currently playing Abrams' father in Duffield's aforementioned survival thriller about a scuba diver (Abrams) who's swallowed alive by a sperm whale. (The book includes a father-son flashback narrative.)


	“It was just really cool to come into something else and already have this weird connection with [Brolin],” Abrams says. “It almost feels like you're entering a different dimension, and while you've had an experience with this person, it's not the same person. So it's strange, but it's only helped things.”


	Abrams did not get to enjoy Cregger's highly sought-after script with the witchcraft twist intact, but the reading experience was still rewarding, as was his eventual perusal of Cregger's Resident Evil screenplay.

	











	“My freaking agent had spoiled it. I love him, but that was annoying,” Abrams recalls mid-laugh. “I still loved the script. I just couldn't stop reading it, which is insane and how it's been with all of Zach's scripts [Resident Evil included]. They keep feeling fresh, and they keep going into new territory.”


	Below, during a recent spoiler conversation with THR, Abrams also discusses why he pities his Weapons character, as well as the on-set story behind his instantly beloved reference to Willow. 


	***


Part of me was hoping you'd be doing this interview from the innards of a whale, but I  appreciate that you were able to squeeze this in on your one day off from Whalefall. 


	(Laughs.) Yeah, I needed a break from inside the whale. 


You were part of the Weapons cast when it was a completely different ensemble. The strike then affected Pedro Pascal's schedule, and Zach had to start over except for you. Did you just get lucky to not have any other conflicts? 


	No, not necessarily. I just wanted to do Weapons. When I first saw Barbarian in the theaters, I didn't really know what I was walking into. I didn't know about Zach. I didn't know about the movie at all. I just thought it was going to be a regular horror movie, and I wasn't super excited going into it. But my friend wanted to go, and I was like, “Sure, I'll go.” 


	So I knew nothing about the movie, and when I saw the first shot, I was like, “Okay, that's kind of sick.” The camera went through the main character's [Georgina Campbell's Tess] car window. And when it cut to Justin Long [to begin its second act], I immediately thought, “Whoever the fuck made this movie, I fucking love this person.” I then looked over at my friend and was like, “Holy shit.” We couldn't even sit next to each other because the theater was so packed. 

	











	So when I got out of the theater, I was like, “I need to figure out how to meet this guy and work with this guy.” And it's so rare that it actually happens. But I just thought he was so gutsy, and it was so refreshing to experience. Weapons then came together, and I only want to work on things that I want to work on.


Zach appreciated that you “hung tough” with him. He now calls you his “dude.” Do you think your loyal gesture factored into you landing Resident Evil?


	I have no idea, but I don't think it hurt anything. If I did something else instead of Weapons, I certainly don't think that would've helped me do something like Resident Evil.


Pedro's exit from Weapons allowed you to work with Josh Brolin, who is now also playing your father in Whalefall. Given your violent interactions in Weapons, have there been any jokes on Whalefall about your polar opposite dynamics?


	Maybe a few, but not too many. It was just really cool to have worked with him before and then come into something else and already have this weird connection with him. It almost feels like you're entering a different dimension, and while you've had an experience with this person, it's not the same person. So it's strange, but it's only helped things. I really loved him on Weapons and talking with him about things. So I feel a really deep connection with him at this point. 


Weapons' climax is so dark and disturbing, and yet Josh's character's inability to put James down was hilarious. Did it actually feel comedic on the day? 












	Well, I remember thinking, “You want me to get up again and then get up again over there?” So I don't know if I was really sure about it at the time, but I do remember it being funny. It was also super physical, but it was funny on the day.


As you were reading Weapons, did you accurately predict that witchcraft was at the root of it? 


	Well, my freaking agent had spoiled it. I love him, but that was annoying. (Laughs.) I still loved the script. I read it in one go in the middle of the night when I should have been sleeping. I just couldn't stop reading it, which is insane and how it's been with all of Zach's scripts. I just love them. I don't know what it is, really. I mean, it's Zach, but it's the sharpness of the dialogue and the action. They keep feeling fresh, and they keep going into new territory.


So when Josh's character unknowingly painted the cause of everything on Julia Garner's character's car, you immediately knew the game that Zach was playing.


	Yeah, I knew something [witchy] was going on, for sure, but I didn't know how the story was going to be told or anything like that. I didn't really know all of those dynamics, so I still unveiled a lot.


I've seen the film interpreted in a wide variety of ways, and I should preface this next question by saying that whatever take you offer today is by no means official. 


	No, it's official! (Laughs.)


But what is your own reading of the film?


	Zach has talked about it in a sense that even he doesn't know what a lot of it means. A lot of it is deep, unconscious, inner-working stuff. What does the [AR-15] rifle that just pops up in Archer's [Brolin] dream mean? I don't really know. I probably had a take a year ago [during filming], but I've been so focused on other things since then that I can't give you a great interpretation right now. But it's all deep unconscious stuff that just floods out of Zach, and he has the skill to make that unconscious stuff work, which might be why his work is so strong and impactful. I know that each different character represents a part of himself, but beyond that, I don't know. I just know that I love the story, even if I don't have a real solid interpretation of it, at least not at this moment. What do you think?

	











What I consider to be the lasting image of Weapons is the young kids chasing after the old witch. So, to me, the movie is about the younger generation turning the tables on the older generation and rejecting their trauma, their dangerous policies and the corrupt systems they uphold.


	Oh, fuck yeah. I like that. 


You mentioned that all of these characters are a reflection of Zach in some way. Can you recognize the James in Zach?


	Yeah, he's talked about it being him at his lowest and most desperate.


Do you feel pity for James since he operated under the spell of a witch and the spell of his own addiction?


	Yeah, of course. It's fucking terrible, man. Being addicted to drugs is hell. It's a nightmare. When I see someone on the street that is in a psychosis or something like that, that could be me, that could be you, that could genuinely be anyone. It just depends on what situation you grew up in, to a big degree. There's babies that are being raised by meth addicts. I don't know what's going to happen to them, but that's a hard hand to be dealt. So I feel complete empathy for James. 


“Oh fuck, Willow.” 


	(Laughs.)


James' reaction to the Willow DVD is a big hit on the internet. 


	Is it?


Yeah, is there a story behind that moment?


	I think the DVDs were just there, and maybe it was Zach who noticed it. So he was like, “Oh, can you just say Willow or something like that?” It was maybe that simple, but I don't remember that line being in the script. I think the DVD got placed there, and we just found it funny. And it is fucking funny.

	











When James was panhandling Julia's character for money to see his brother, we know that the brother part is true since he later called him and asked for money under false pretenses. But the optimist in me wants to believe that James, at that moment, genuinely wanted to go home and get help. Did Zach give you any more backstory for James?


	No, not really. At  least not that I remember. It just came down to research. But the interesting thing about James asking for money to see his brother, is that true? Is that not true? Because it could be true in that moment. But once he has some money, he then might say, “I've got to get high so that I can come up with a plan to go see him.” So it's not necessarily a lie, at least not in that moment when he asks Julia's character for money. But I definitely discussed a lot of it with Zach, and he was open to me trying things and throwing things at him. He's so smart, and I just really trust his direction. 


IMDb can sometimes be inaccurate prior to the official release, but it had your character name written as Anthony for the longest time. Was that his name on an old script or breakdown?


	Yeah, that was his name at first, but between Archer and Alex, there were too many other A-names.


You've had back-to-back foot chases in Wolfs and now Weapons. Did you feel more prepared for this one after going through that crucible on Wolfs?


	No. (Laughs.) I ended up dropping some weight for Weapons, so the running was a little challenging, sometimes. But I ran for a much shorter period than the Wolfs sequence.

	











Your Wolfs director Jon Watts used to be in a film school gang with Jake Schreier, so do you think Jake put you on Jon's radar all those years ago via Paper Towns?


	Yeah, they're really good friends, and I think Jon was in the editing room on Paper Towns, either watching or giving notes or just hanging out. But I know that he had seen me in that and that it kind of started things. 


Jon was going to make a Wolfs sequel until the movie's sudden lack of theatrical release rubbed him the wrong way. Did it ever get as far as you knowing whether you were coming back or not?


	Yeah, I think I was. George [Clooney] came up with a bit of a story or the start of a story, and that was the thought for a second.


When I last spoke to Brian Duffield for No One Will Save You, he told me how Nope became a source of anxiety after his movie had already gotten moving. They're both alien invasion thrillers on the surface, but completely different under the hood. Well, another movie with a nearly identical premise to Brian's Whalefall announced itself in May just as you guys were about to start shooting. Has this subject come up at all on set? 


	I didn't even know about it until weeks ago. So I really don't know much about it, but I've heard it might be a Spanish film or something like that. 


I do know that it's an independent. There's no studio behind it.


	But I don't know why I didn't know about it until later on. People had already been talking about it, but I don't feel concerned about anything like that. 

	











You're not returning for Euphoria season three, but your career and so many others have really accelerated from that show. Is that the biggest reason why the show has had such a tough time getting back on the screen? Are there just too many big careers to juggle?


	Yeah, probably. There were so many different factors, from everyone's schedules to COVID to Angus [Cloud] passing away. There were a lot of tough situations that made it difficult.


I know you're consumed by the innards of a whale right now, but Zach has already storyboarded Resident Evil. Have you also started wrapping your head around that role yet?


	Yeah, we've been wrapping. (Abrams smiles.) Zach is very, very prepared.

Acura's stock just went up. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	Some people's dream car is a Lamborghini, others may want a Maybach, but MGK's daughter, Casie Baker, had her eye on an Acura.


	MGK Day in Cleveland wasn't just all about the artist (formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly) on Sunday (Aug. 10), as Kells surprised Casie with her dream car, an Acura TLX, just a couple of weeks after celebrating her 16th birthday in July.


	Footage of the heartwarming moment went viral on social media, while Casie seemed genuinely surprised at the gift when the black car rolled up with a red bow on it, as she jumped into her dad's arms.

	











	Before she hopped behind the driver's seat, MGK had one special rule for Casie to follow: Don't drive like the musician.


	“What's the No. 1 rule?” he asked, to which Casie swiftly replied, “Don't drive like your dad.” MGK nodded in approval and said, “Exactly — don't drive like me.” All that's left for Casie is to pass her upcoming driving test to secure a license.




			Trending on Billboard		







	But the teen wasn't the only member of the family to receive a surprise on Sunday. At halftime of the Celebrity Shootout basketball game, MGK was presented with a guitar featuring a portrait his face that will forever live in the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.


	It was yet another epic MGK Day weekend for the multi-genre artist and his fans. MGK capped off the memorable weekend with a headlining performance on the Mall C lawn, debuting tracks from his new album, Lost Americana, for the attendance.


Lost Americana arrived on Aug. 8, as MGK looks to make it three consecutive No. 1 albums atop the Billboard 200.

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Following word this past spring that a package was coming together for a Rambo prequel, Millennium Media looks to have its man as sources tell Deadline that Noah Centineo is attached to star in John Rambo. Sisu director Jalmari Helander is set to direct from a screenplay by writing duo Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani.


	Sources say that the package still has a couple of hurdles to overcome, but things are headed in the right direction with hopes to shoot in the fall in Thailand. Insiders also add that while no deals are in place, Lionsgate is the front-runner to land the package. The studio has released the past two Rambo pics and also has a relationship with Helander having worked with him on Sisu.












	The film's plot is under wraps, but it will be the origin story of a young John Rambo during the Vietnam War. One of the most iconic action heroes in U.S. cinema, the character was created by David Morell in his novel First Blood. The original 1982 film saw saw Sylvester Stallone play the veteran Green Beret, who is forced by a cruel sheriff and his deputies to flee into the mountains and wage an escalating one-man war against his pursuers. The five movies in the franchise have generated more than $800 million worldwide; the most recent, 2019's Rambo: Last Blood, produced by Millennium and Sly's Balboa, made $92M at the box office.




			Watch on Deadline		







	As for Stallone, when Deadline first reported on the package, insiders told Deadline he was aware of the project but was not involved, and as of today that remains the same. Sources now say that Stallone has been alerted to Centineo's attachment.

	











	Producers on the latest installment are Kevin King-Templeton on behalf of Templeton Media, Les Weldon, Jonathan Yunger and Avi Lerner. Executive producers include Trevor Short and Bonfire Legends' Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmyk.


	As for Centineo, his star has been on the rise after breakout roles in the Netflix hit series To All the Boys I Loved Before and The Recruit, but this is sort of role that could launch a young star onto the A-list. Up next, he will star as Ken Masters in Legendary's live-action adaptation of Street Fighter, starring opposite Jason Momoa and Andrew Koji. Directed by Kitao Sakurai, the film is slated for release in 2026.


	Most recently, Centineo appeared in A24's Warfare from Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland, as well as in Oscar Boyson's directorial debut Our Hero, Balthazar, which he also produced under his Arkhum banner. The latter premiered at this year's Tribeca Film Festival.


	Centineo is repped by WME and Myman Greenspan Fox.

Taylor Swift has caught the attention of the most elite investigative team the world has ever seen: The Swifties. The singer sent fans into overdrive on Monday, after several social media posts appeared to point to Swift teasing her next era. Seemingly back to her masterminding and easter egg-dropping ways, both Taylor Nation and the New Heights podcast page shared similar cryptic posts that fans think hint at an upcoming announcement.


	Taylor Nation, an official branch of the pop superstar's marketing team, posted a series of photos from the Eras Tour where Swift is perhaps not-so-coincidentally wearing orange in every shot. And to be even more specific, the carousel included 12 photos — leading fans to believe it's a nod to the singer's next album, which would be her 12th release. But it was the caption that really sent Swifties spiraling: “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era… ,” Taylor Nation wrote. Of course, this is a callback to The Eras Tour book, where Swift signed off on her personal intro with that exact phrase, hinting at her next move.

	










A post shared by Taylor Nation (@taylornation)


	At the same exact time Monday morning, in what would ostensibly be another corner of the internet, Travis and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast teased their upcoming guest on their social media accounts. Swifties were quick to spot that the blacked out guest looked like a shadow of the singer. Additionally, eagle-eyed fans took note of the orange background, which matched the orange pictures Taylor Nation posted (and isn't the usual yellow background the New Heights podcast uses for thumbnails). In the teaser photo, the football stars both seem to be sporting Swift's merchandise — and just like clockwork, the dominoes cascaded in a line for Swiftie's TS12 theories.

	In May, Swift rocked the music industry with an announcement that was not about new music, but rather that she had finally gained back the master recordings to her first six albums. The singer shared the news in a letter on her website. “I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but never owned until now,” she wrote. Swift didn't end off the celebratory news with any cryptic message, but some fans noted that one word had 12 additional letters and was a nod to her 12th recording.


	Of course, in typical Swift fashion, this could all amount to nothing — but that's not nearly as fun as believing that this week could bring some major news to the Swiftie world. Even if there is an announcement, it still might not even be an album. It could literally be anything…or nothing! Either way, with Swift's newfound freedom, the groundwork has been laid for her next move, and possibly, a new era.

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Weapons and Barbarian.

Writer-director Zach Cregger's domestic anxieties have only gotten worse in the years since 2022's Barbarian. Leaving behind the specific issues of urban decay and gentrification, Cregger approaches broader themes for a wider audience in his major studio follow-up, Weapons. Broken into six chapters, Weapons tells of a community-wide tragedy from the perspective of six Maybrook households, with varying connections to the central disappearance of 17 schoolchildren. Continuing his idiosyncratic narrative structures, Cregger inverts Barbarian's form, shifting the question from “Whose house is this?” to “Whose house is that?” In doing so, his sprawling, Altman-meets-Twin Peaks dissection of a town shows how tragedy doesn't actually bring people together, but widens their divisions.

Drawing from America's real-life wealth of viral, chaotic PTA and school board meetings about guns, bathrooms, and books, a meeting in an auditorium is the only scene in Weapons where the town is shown together, and it immediately falls apart, leaving the attendees to break off into the night with no hopes of communal solutions. Cregger announces his structure shortly after, mirroring the fractured town by segmenting the film into interlocking stories that reveal how the disappearance of (almost) an entire elementary school class exacerbates pre-existing flaws. For the missing kids' teacher, Justine (Julia Garner), that means indulging her drinking problem and penchant for disastrous hookups. For Archer (Josh Brolin), the father of one of the missing, it means falling down the local conspiracy rabbit hole, poring over Ring cam footage for clues when he isn't painting “Witch” on the side of Justine's car. He doesn't even know how close he is to the answer.

Like a scary Short Cuts, Weapons creates a chain of cause and effect, with each character taking their pain out on a different neighbor. Archer harasses Justine, so Justine drinks too much and calls Paul (Alden Ehrenreich), a local cop and recovering alcoholic. Paul sleeps with Justine, gets caught, and takes his angry regret out on an unhoused meth addict, James (Austin Abrams). Ironically, in doing so, Paul prevents everyone from solving the central mystery, which James has the answer to. Cregger gives us a wider view of things, so we can squirm as Paul calls his wife two chapters after we saw him get with Justine. But the effect allows for a broader statement on how Americans treat each other when tragedy strikes. There is no community effort to find these kids, no sense of ongoing support or house-to-house searches, even though the entire class is only a few blocks away, standing in the basement of the house of the only kid who didn't run away. Clearly, Maybrook's antisocial tendencies existed before 2:17 A.M. As Archer learns, even the parents going through the same tragedy can't relate to one another; they've barely interacted.

Suburban, household horror is nothing new to Cregger. In Barbarian, he dug deep into the bones of an old house turned Airbnb. There's a specificity to Barbarian‘s primary location, 476 Barbary, the only home still standing in the decaying neighborhood of Brightmoor, Detroit. Cregger creates a layered narrative, starting at the top floor and digging down into the basement, sub-basement, and dungeon, revealing how deep the rot goes and the era that led to it. 

Barbarian kicked off a wave of movies about young people being lured into houses. Recently, Bring Her Back and Heretic saw innocent teens having their young lives upended by quirky adults who reveal themselves to be witches looking to shove them into an oven. Barbarian takes a different approach to a similar premise: Rather than spending the movie exploring what the villain wants, Barbarian wants to know who owns this space, and with every new revelation, we're introduced to another occupant and link in the chain that led to its current state. The movie takes us from Airbnb guests, gentrifying property managers, and absentee landlords, back to the homicidal original owner, whose terror lived in the Reagan era, when residents fled the area and allowed Brightmoor's urban blight to begin. This narrow focus allowed Cregger to address a specific problem facing cities. By moving to the suburbs, Weapons explores a broader issue of the antisocial surveillance state, where not even single-family fortresses are safe and nobody knows their neighbors.

In both films, Cregger places the same minotaur at the end of the labyrinth: A hag thriving off local strife. Like Barbarian‘s Mother (Matthew Patrick Davis), Weapons‘ central villain, Gladys (Amy Madigan), is a grotesque representation of an older woman playacting as a nurturing mother. Whether or not Cregger blames mothers for societal breakdown is between the filmmaker and his therapist, but they are manifestations of a persistent neglect. Gladys takes advantage of this, worming her way into the community by posing as a caretaker and letting the town do the rest. She lucked out by finding a place with no shared camaraderie, and school administrators who know nothing about their students.

Ironically, Weapons‘ expansiveness extends to Gladys' death. Instead of Mother's bullet to the brain for an audience of one, Weapons concludes with a tear through an entire neighborhood, introducing us to faces, backyards, and living rooms the characters never bothered to explore beforehand. For the first time since the school board meeting, the town gathers—this time to watch their children tear Gladys limb from limb. It's nice to see a community come together.

Obama and her brother's podcast, 'IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson,' taped live at Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival with Natasha Rothwell, discussing "what it means to be Black" when traveling and how "marriage should be a choice," not a social reflex. 


							By 

	Ronda Racha Penrice



	In front of a rapt Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival audience Aug. 9, Michelle Obama co-hosted with her brother a live taping of their podcast IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson, produced through their production company Higher Ground. The former First Lady returned to the fest, where she and former President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance in 2022 to support their Netflix documentary Descendant.


	Pinch-hitting for advertised guest Teyana Taylor, who stars in the upcoming feature One Battle After Another with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro, and who canceled due to unexpected vocal surgery, was The White Lotus‘ Emmy-nominated Natasha Rothwell.

					Why Jeff Probst Finally Let Mike White Return to 'Survivor' (and if He'd Make a 'White Lotus' Cameo)		
			









	During the conversation, Obama shared a moment she particularly enjoyed about Rothwell's twice Emmy-nominated role as Belinda. “Not only does Belinda get her groove thing on,” she said, “but one of my favorite scenes, because this is a luxury resort, [is] where you're having tea or lunch by yourself, and you spot a Black couple. And most of us know when you're doing something really nice somewhere, especially when you see other Black people,” — Obama indicated a look of acknowledgement of folks within the community — “yeah, and you got that, you know. I love that.” 


	Rothwell provided the backstory: “I pitched that to Mike [White, White Lotus creator]. He's such a collaborative writer-director, and season one, we started working together because he's very aware that he's not a Black woman,” she explained. “When we were working on season three, I was like, ‘Mike, there has to be a moment where Belinda sees someone who looks like her, and almost seeing what's possible for herself, because she's there under work circumstances, but that couple's there just for them. And so just to have that look make the cut, I was so thrilled,” she shared. “So many people bring that moment up because it's just authentic for the experience.”

	











	As the predominantly Black crowd co-signed her assertion, Obama added: “It tells a fuller story of what it means to be Black because we leisure, we travel, right? We leisure all up and down Martha's Vineyard, don't we? It's a beautiful thing to see. We've got to make sure the rest of the world knows that we are traveled, and we do things besides serve other people,” she said to enthusiastic applause.


	The trio swapped stories of their childhoods: Obama was a self-proclaimed introvert, Robinson “was always trying to be outside,” and Rothwell was “an introverted extrovert” from a military family background, for whose service Obama thanked them. Rothwell also discussed her parents' happy 47-year-marriage, and shared that she is “childless by choice” and content with being single. Robinson asked, “Would anybody be upset if we introduced you to somebody?” Rothwell responded: “God is good!”


	Obama shared how she tells her girls — Sasha and Malia — not to rush into marriage. “I'm trying to instill in my daughters right now that marriage should be a choice. And sometimes we send subliminal messages to our kids; they could be doing great things, and it's like, ‘Well, are you dating anyone?,'” she offered as an example. “Or you could be conquering the world, and it's like, ‘When are you going to have a baby?,' all the while sending the message that who you are isn't good enough until you are partnered or paired off.”


	Emphasizing her love for her husband, despite various reports, Obama explained why she shares the difficulty of marriage. “I talk openly about it, not because I don't love my husband. I'm happy to be married. We have a wonderful relationship, but [society] sometimes set young couples up,” she said. “What I don't want young couples to do is walk away from the hard, because that's just waiting for you.”

	











	The companionable conversation covered what it was like for Rothwell as a junior writer on Insecure — “After the first writers' room, I went to my car and sobbed because I felt so seen,” she recalled — as well as leading her award-winning series How to Die Alone as creator, writer, producer and star despite its cancellation. “I'm so grateful that the series saw the light of day, and it's on Hulu,” she said of the show that took her eight years to make.


	Obama also sought Rothwell's advice for others, including her own daughter Malia, who feel compelled to share their voice in Hollywood: “I have a young creative child. I think a lot of young creatives, especially kids of color, with all that's going on in the world, they wonder, ‘Is there still room for this?'”


	Rothwell responded: “I think it's so important for young creators to know that in their pocket is a phone that is a movie studio. Do not wait for someone else to give you permission to live your dream.”


	“There's still a lot of white space for really good, different, diverse stories. And I don't care what we're going through in the world, there's always room for us to tell our stories,” Obama, a producer herself, noted before inquiring about the latest project Rothwell is developing, with which she was unfamiliar.


	Rothwell admitted she was unfamiliar with the viral TikTok sensation, Who TF Did I Marry? by Reesa Teesa — who narrates the story of her marriage to a man she later learns is a pathological liar — until social media began attaching her to the project, which she learned about on a 25-member family group text chain while she was in Thailand.

	











	Later, when it became a viable Hollywood property, Rothwell was amazed that her fledgling production company Big Hattie Productions won it. “It was a six-way bidding war,” she said of the mega popular TikTok series. “There was like the Shondas and the Lee Daniels, everyone was throwing their hat in the ring, because to get 500 million people to sit down and watch something, Hollywood sits up and takes notice.”


	Closing out the conversation, Obama circled back to Rothwell's parents being thrilled that she was sitting down with Obama and her brother.  “Please tell your parents that you made them proud,” she said.

In Korean writer/director Park Syeyoung's 2022 debut feature, “The Fifth Thoracic Vertebra,” mold on an abandoned mattress births a parasitic creature that feasts on the vertebrae of any humans it touches. The film enters more unpredictable, oddly moving territory than its B-movie-like premise may initially suggest, but that basic logline wouldn't feel out of place amongst the demonizing government propaganda that recurs throughout Park's compelling follow-up feature, “The Fin,” in which even the lightest physical contact with a minority group is portrayed as being life-threatening. Don't let certain parts of them touch you or you'll get infected. Don't let them scream because the sound will kill you.Unlike a mattress monster that actually feeds on people, the othered beings in Park's second ostensible creature feature are recognizably human, even if the wider population is encouraged not to perceive them that way. Set in a speculative, post-unification Korea, “The Fin” tracks the relationship between brainwashed citizens and the underclass they've been trained to hate — and also to exploit.As a result of ecological devastation, a section of the Korean population — we're given little sense of how the rest of the world is doing — has undergone mutations that bring them closer to merfolk of legend. Known as Omegas, these mutated humans have fins and unusual feet, but otherwise look the same as the rest of their countrymen. To pass without hassle in Korea's various colonies, Omegas might cut off parts of their feet or fins, or conceal these appendages with prosthetics made by the rare “normal” person sympathetic to their plight. Any Omega discovered within a colony's borders is arrested to be exiled beyond the wall, or terminated on sight in cases where a trigger-happy government worker thinks their life is threatened by an Omega simply shouting.The non-mutated population is fed the suggestion that Omegas' screams are lethal outside of water, that their fins are full of toxins, and that when they die, they release radiation. The accuracy of all that remains fairly ambiguous across Park's film, but the belief drives the structure of society. In the case of East Colony 114, however, some Omegas are permitted to live around the beaches and cliffs just beyond The Great Wall, as long as they serve as the workforce to clean the polluted oceans.Within the colony, clean water is a precious commodity. Citizens are encouraged to reduce bathing for the greater good. Among the dirty-faced population, nostalgia for the sea and fishing becomes something that enterprising business owners can exploit. The film's opening narration draws on memories of water, infusing exposition about the dystopia with a personal touch. “They said the ocean used to be blue,” the voice of a young woman tells us. “They said many people died. My first memory is of a blood-red sky. Black raindrops fell onto my lips. Drop. Drop. Drop. They tasted bitter, and I was sick all night. Father spent the night coughing as well. And then Father disappeared.”Accompanying those words is a montage of photographs of people standing with fishing hauls of various sizes, with all of the human faces curiously blurred out. Eventually, we get to a photo that disrupts that formula: one where most faces remain blurred, except for that of a little girl. As this final photo in the montage starts to dissolve from view, a close-up of a young adult woman's face gradually appears in the center of the frame. This will turn out to be the grown version of both the narrator and the little girl who stuck out in the photograph. Named Mia (Yeji Yeon, “Pachinko”), she will be sought out by both an unnamed Omega (Goh-Woo), infiltrating East Colony 114 with a mission to find her and deliver a severed fin, and Sujin (Pureum Kim), a novice government recruit in the taskforce that both checks up on Omega workers collecting waste over the wall and hunts down anyone suspected of abnormalities.

Through Sujin, Park explores the mindset of someone following orders but beginning to doubt the state's ideology, and the subsequent contagion of fear that has infected so many in such unpleasant ways —  a notion that will prove all too timely in a good number of the countries where the film may be released. Sujin's ailing mother barely speaks, but when she does, it's mainly to spit venom at the mere mention of Omegas, suggesting that they should all be killed. Mia, meanwhile, represents the inner conflicts of the assimilated “other.” She passes by keeping elements of her identity a secret, buys into at least parts of the propaganda targeting the minority group she's secretly from, and is openly hostile when coming face-to-face with someone from that group reaching out to her.Patient in its pacing, “The Fin” is an engrossing mood piece rather than a dystopian tale based around constant clashes, even though the threat of violence is always looming. Like in “The Fifth Thoracic Vertebra,” Park, once again serving as his own cinematographer, gets a lot of mileage out of a strange kind of intimacy achieved through characters unwittingly being observed from a distance, be it through slightly open doors or high up from above. The wider aesthetic favors hazy saturation, the colors of city streets and the outside wilderness — each dead zones in their own way — at times recalling a post-apocalyptic touchstone like Konstantin Lopushansky's “Visitor to a Museum,” and in other places, Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson's recent collaborations like “The Forbidden Room.”As an independent production, “The Fin” is largely effective in its expressionistic solutions to budgetary limitations, with a pleasing tactility to the practical effects on display. That said, there is one dubious shortcut that leaves a sour taste in the mouth: Early in the movie, we're shown a government propaganda video about The Great Wall and the unified Korea. It's a propaganda ad in an explicitly dystopian story, so it's obviously supposed to make you feel unpleasant, but there's something a little off about the imagery and motion in these brief clips; an uncanny quality inherent to poor simulacra of real art direction.Then we reach one of the longest clips in the propaganda video and the depressing explanation becomes apparent. A shot of the backs of several yellow-jacketed figures looking at a faraway statue only lasts a few seconds, but within that time, many of the still figures warp shape. Some “people” blur together, while others see the lower halves of their legs suddenly separate from the rest of their bodies. If you've been unlucky enough to have working eyes in the past few years, you'll recognize this as unmistakably an example of generative AI being used instead of real footage being shot. With all due respect to the pressures of making an unconventional sci-fi film on a tight budget, using ecologically destructive technology for a story of ecological devastation, in which clean water is an increasingly rare resource, adds an unintentionally grim layer of irony to the tale.

	Carthen was a Love Island USA Season 7 fan favorite from the beginning as she showed her journey to finding love on the show. Initially coupled up with Taylor Williams, Carthen eventually found a connection with Vansteenberghe, with viewers shipping them as “Nicolandria.” The two had a friendly connection that blossomed into more when they decided to give each other an opportunity following their undeniable chemistry together.


	The Love Island USA Season 7 cast will be reunited for a special streaming on Monday, August 25, hosted by Ariana Madix and Andy Cohen, where “Nicolandria” will share an update on their status following the villa.


	Digital Brand Architects was co-founded in 2010 by CEO Raina Penchansky as the first digital influencer management company to recognize the rise of new media voices and manage them as individual talent. UTA acquired the firm in 2019, which will celebrate its 15th anniversary this November.

Swifties are also certain the pop star's next album will have an orange theme.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	There's a lot going on in the Taylor Swift fandom right now. Though the pop star has been keeping out of the spotlight in recent months, the internet is swimming with theories that she's about to make her comeback — and she just might make the big announcement on boyfriend Travis Kelce‘s podcast. 


	It all started Monday morning (Aug. 11), when New Heights — the podcast hosted by the Kansas City Chiefs tight end and his brother, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce — posted an image on X teasing its special guest for this week's episode. In the photo, the two NFL stars smile on either side of a blacked-out silhouette, which Swifties think happens to look a lot like a certain 14-time Grammy winner.

	











	“92%ers, we're coming back early for a special episode with a VERY special guest,” reads the photo's caption, which notes that the episode will drop on Aug. 13, coinciding with Swift's favorite number.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The New Heights teaser image also features a glittery orange background, aligning with long-held fan theories that Swift's next album will have an orange theme. Plus, Jason appears to be wearing an Eras Tour T-shirt. 


	But if those apparent Easter eggs weren't enough to get Swifties riled up, the message Taylor Nation posted just 12 minutes later definitely was. Sharing four images of the musician on stage at past Eras shows, wearing the color — you guessed it — orange in each one, the official fan account wrote, “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…'”


	Fueling the fire, Taylor Nation quickly followed that post up with two additional batches of four orange-themed Eras outfits in the replies, amounting to 12 pictures total. (Following 2024's The Tortured Poets Department, Swift's next album would be the 12th in her discography.)


	With all of that in mind, Swifties are absolutely losing their minds at the possibility that the singer has new music coming soon. “glittery orange background, taylor nation posted 12 minutes after new heights, the silhouette is shaped like taylor, Jason in eras merch, a ‘VERY' special guest…… what if she announces ts12 on Wednesday the 13th ON NEW HEIGHTS…..,” one person wrote on X.


	“TS12 IS ACTUALLY COMING THIS IS NOT A DRILL WHATS THE PROCEDURE!!” another excited fan posted.


	“travis looking to his left with his Taylor Smile, jason wearing merch, i can see the bangs from a mile away……but most importantly, the background…,” added a third Swiftie. “ts12 confirmed to be orange alert the troops.”


Billboard has reached out to Swift's rep for comment.


	Fans have been waiting to see what the musician will do next ever since the Eras Tour wrapped in December, tying a glittery bow on Swift's first two decades making music. Pulling in more than $2 billion in worldwide grosses, the trek went down in history as the highest earning tour of all time.

	











	And though Swift has never had trouble outdoing herself, her past few projects have left expectations quite high. Her 2022 album, Midnights, won album of the year at the Grammys — making the hitmaker the first artist to ever win the prize four times — while Tortured Poets spent 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200, the third-longest No. 1 run of any album in chart history.

It's fitting that the first good movie to meaningfully incorporate AI into its aesthetic should be about an undead bloodsucker that feeds on humanity in order to seem alive. And yet, for a three-hour film that opens with a chorus of computer-generated Vlad the Impalers staring into camera and demanding that we suck their cocks, Radu Jude's gleefully stupid “Dracula” proves much too expansive — and much too invested in the centuries of barbarism that paved the way toward Silicon Valley — to be misunderstood as a simple rebuke against the grotesqueries of algorithmic image-making. 

 










Jude is an erudite man of the people whose hyper-literate intellectualism is only matched by his Chaucer-like vulgarity, and his work has long reveled in an impish fascination with the relationship between art, labor, and technology. In that light, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that the guy behind the likes of “Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World” and “Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn” has a certain degree of affection for a tool that threatens to upend everything the arts hold sacred.

Related Stories Do the ‘Time Warp' Again When Cinespia Screens ‘Rocky Horror' This October ‘The Fin' Review: A Compelling Sci-Fi Drama About Mutated Outcasts in a Seemingly Unified Korea 

A quasi-picaresque anthology about an unnamed director (“Kontinental '25” standout Adonis Tanța) who relies on a Transylvanian bot to salvage his new vampire movie after it only earns an 80 percent approval score from its latest test audience, “Dracula” provides Jude a perfectly dumb excuse to unleash AI on the cinema, literature, and history of a civilization that had already been feeding on its own neck for a century or longer before ChatGPT first came online. 

Here is a film that feasts on AI image-making in its ugliest and most nascent form in order to argue that it really isn't anything new — that its cannibalistic appetite and taste for exploitation are precisely what make this technology such an honest expression of the culture that created it. As a bald man once said: The world is a vampire (sent to drain). With “Dracula,” Jude makes a fun and wildly freewheeling case that it sucks now in much the same way that it's sucked for the last several hundred years, and in doing so he suggests that AI might be more interesting for what it reveals about the way things haven't changed than it is for what it threatens to change about them. 

Having said all that, it would be a mistake to overstate the role that AI plays in Jude's anarchic hodgepodge. The technology is central to this project, as well as the ostensible author of the film's 14 segments, wraparound story, and framing device, but “Dracula” mostly relies on algorithmic kinks and chimeras to lubricate more analog examples of the past eating itself — to use images of, and stories about, Vlad the Impaler to illustrate how easily history is stripped of its meaning. 

 










Shot on an iPhone and steeped in its film's local bent (there's an inherent humor to the idea that Jude is tackling his country's most famous legend on such frivolous terms), the wraparound story forces “Dracula” back to that mission whenever it threatens to wander too far astray. Which is often. 

It hinges on a rundown theater in the heart of Transylvania's tourist district, where the director — Tanța, not Jude — emcees a low-rent immersive show that essentially bastardizes the legend of Vlad the Impaler into whatever the audience wants it to be. Whatever it means to Make Dracula Great Again.

Jude doesn't waste any time poking fun at the mass appeal madness of trying to create something for everyone. A group of American vacationers are seen in the crowd with their kids. The big guy sitting near them is wearing his clothes backwards and sporting the tattoo of a face on the back of his skull. One European woman, meanwhile, has clearly just come to work out her kinks, and leaps at the chance to bid on a backstage tryst with the limp-dicked old man playing the immortal vampire (Gabriel Spahiu as Sandu). Lest anyone imagined that Jude's film would offer a more reverent take on Romanian history, the sight of that naked theater-goer shouting “Lick my pussy, Dracula!” at the impotent actor behind her legs should be enough to put such thoughts to rest. 

 










Eventually, Sandu and his topless co-star (Oana Maria Zaharia as the otherwise unnamed “Vampira”) flee into the town square as the final act of the show, the audience chasing them with pitchforks and torches. One evening, however, the two actors conspire to make a break for it — to stay hidden from the horde of paying customers, escape from the exploitative conditions of their jobs, and use their meager earnings to start new lives in another country. In turn, the director of the show invites his audience to kill his cast for real; a serious gamble on his part, as Elon Musk and Donald Trump have supposedly booked their own private performance for the following month. 

Sitting at his desk and speaking to camera in between each of the film's segments, Tanța's character recognizes that we're curious about the fate of Sandu and Vampira, and graciously agrees to check in on them whenever the mood strikes. In the meantime, he busies himself by asking his AI bot to mock up a wide variety of Dracula riffs, most of which — per AI's functionality — are Frankensteined together from previous takes on the story and/or the published histories they ingested as part of their creation. 

One exploits the public domain status of F.W. Murnau's “Nosferatu” to stream footage from that vampire classic, only for the clips to be overrun with internet detritus like pop-up ads for penis-enlargement surgery and the like (it's a rare instance in which Jude's extremely cock-centric sense of humor deigns to use a more polite word for the male sex organ). Another runs into rights troubles when it tries to summon the multiplex eroticism of Francis Ford Coppola's “Dracula,” forcing the director to re-create that Eiko Ishioka-designed fever dream with a nightmare-inducing AI orgy that hallucinates bloody new sex organs into every fold of the human body. Later, the director asks to see Vlad reborn in the style of Samuel Beckett or Carl Theodor Dreyer, which results in a silent(ish) short where the toothache-ridden vampire pays a visit to Dr. Caligari D.D.S. 

 










Most of the vignettes tend to dig a bit deeper than mere cine-literate sight gags and in-jokes, even if they aren't substantially more highbrow for doing so. The first short, cheekily designated “Eutrophia” (a term describing the process by which a body, usually of water, becomes overly enriched with nutrients), is set in a rejuvenation clinic that was built as a youth hospital during Ceaușescu's reign of terror, and hosted a number of iconic Hollywood stars during their golden years. A wheelchair-bound grandma new to the facility is treated to a screening of some old Romanian films, when suddenly things go all “Sherlock Jr.” on her; the next thing she knows, Vlad the Impaler is standing before her in the flesh and demanding an exchange of fluids: He'll drink from her neck, and she'll give him a blow job. I suppose that's one way of staying young. Or two. 

Elsewhere, the past's hunger for the present — and the present's disinterest in the past — is explored in the weirdly adorable episode where a child-aged Vlad returns to his house, only to find that it's been renovated into a museum whose tour guide has little patience for interrupting kids. Jude later flips the script with a relatively dry and dutiful adaptation of Nicolae Velea's Romania-famous romance novel “Just So,” only to spoil the story's tragic emotional climax with a hilariously bad serving of gen-AI slop. I'm not sure that punchline is worth the 30 minutes or so it takes to set up (refreshing as it is to see Jude operate in a more classical mode for a while), but it's safe to say that no one will ever accuse the filmmaker of taking himself too seriously now that he's on the verge of displacing Cristian Mungiu as his country's most visible auteur. 

 










Of course, Jude's ascendency has long hinged on his eagerness to look for the absurdity in the serious, and the seriousness in the absurd. Compelled by the enduring savagery of a modern world that sells itself as being more evolved than the burial ground on which it was built, his films — as ultra-referential to the past as they are indifferent to it — have flourished at a time when history is being made by the same people who are most determined to erase it. As Wittgenstein is quoted here: “The thing about progress is that it always seems greater than it actually is.” 

That notion is most pronounced in a segment that plays on the Marxist concept of “dead labor,” undead in this case. It's called “Das Kapital,” and it finds Vlad returning to life as the ruthlessly capitalistic CEO of a gaming company whose employees farm experience points in order to sell their beefed-up accounts to lazy American players. (One of those employees is played by the great “Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World” star Ilinca Manoloche, the most recognizable of the 100+ actors who rotate into a variety of different parts throughout the movie.) 

Set on the site of a famous 20th century labor dispute but framed against a backdrop of MMORPGs and Twitter-era xenophobia, this ridiculous vignette — complete with Tanța as a boot-licking C-3PO — is the logical climax of a film that name drops both Umberto Eco and Britney Spears, and affords them roughly the same importance. In a far more pointed way than the film's stolid 50-minute re-creation of Romania's first vampire novel, or the similarly overstretched later chapter that offers a bawdy folk tale inspired by the author Ion Creangă (it starts with Jesus, and ends with Manoloche being pleasantly terrorized by a crudely animated flying dildo), “Das Kapital” collapses the distance between high and low, history and its end. The only distinction that matters in the end is what's alive and what's not, and Jude's exhaustingly exhilarating “Dracula” makes an effective case that it will only get harder to tell the difference from here.

 










“Dracula” premiered at the 2025 Locarno Film Festival. 1-2 Special will release it in the United States.

Political Editor


Donald Trump said Monday that he was deploying the National Guard in Washington, D.C. and placing the city's Metropolitan Police under federal control.


	Portraying the capital city as a crime-ridden hellhole, Trump told reporters that the city “is becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness.”


	“We're taking our capital back,” Trump said.


	Attorney General Pam Bondi will oversee the city's police department. She was present along with Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News host, FBI director Kash Patel, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

	











	While there is a crime problem in D.C., and while stats are meaningless to victims, the rate actual fell last year, per the Metropolitan Police, with violent crime down 26%.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump also has announced efforts to clean up the city and rid the area of homeless encampments, and said the city would no longer be a sanctuary for illegal aliens.


	Even before Trump's announcement, which was expected, Democrats cast it as an effort to change the subject from a sputtering economy and continued inflation, as well as the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. And as the president has tried to characterize himself as a president of law and order, opponents point to his pardoning of those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, including those who attacked police officers.


	Trump posited cases of suspects spitting on cops, and said that the federalized D.C. police force will be able to do “whatever the hell they want.”

	











	As Trump spoke, protesters were gathered on 16th Street, near Lafayette Park, singing “D.C. is our home. You can't have it Trump.” In the 2024 election, Kamala Harris received 90% of the district vote compared to Trump. The president also has created further dismay among city residents with the mass layoffs of federal workers, which has been a gut punch to the region's economy.


	The president's action is his latest effort to exert more control over D.C. and its institutions in his second term. He ousted Biden-appointed board members of the Kennedy Center and ensured that he was named chairman, while ousting the Librarian of Congress and paving over the grass lawn near the White House Rose Garden.


	Trump controls the National Guard in the city, and he cited a provision in the Home Rule Act in federalizing the city's police department. 


	Trump's action follows some high-profile incidents, including the assault of a staffer for the Department of Government Efficiency during a carjacking.


	Trump's press conference today was carried by major news networks, with coverage also on local network broadcast stations. MSNBC broke away at one point for commentary, but returned when the president took reporters' questions.


	In his remarks, Trump decried a “sick woke culture,” as he referred to the toppling of statues following the killing of George Floyd in 2020. The protests near Lafayette Park beset the area near the White House for about a week, with a fence barrier erected around the grounds.


	Trump also said that it was essential to clean up the streets — from sidewalks to medians — to make a show to foreign leaders and tourists on their visit.


	Trump's deployment of the National Guard follows his federalizing of troops in June in Los Angeles, as protests broke out over his administration's ICE raids.


	He also signaled that he planned to take action in other cities, including Chicago, with his actions in D.C. as a model.


	“Maybe they will self clean up; maybe they will self do this,” Trump said, while he also cited cities with cashless bail.


	As he tends to do, during his press conference, Trump veered off into other topics, including transgender men playing in women's sports, and that the 2020 election was “rigged,” adding fuel to Democrats' argument that his press conference was an attention ploy.


	“Trump is testing his ability to take over entire cities with military force. This is terrible federal overreach,” the Democratic National Committee said in an X post.


	California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office posted on X, “Washington, DC — here's what you can expect now that the president wants to cosplay as dictator in your city, too: Soldiers sitting around with nothing to do; Lies from all levels of the federal government; No meaningful impact.”

Distraction, in any form he can muster.

So when it's his supporters committing the violence and the vandalism and injuring police officers, that's the time to sit back and do nothing, especially if he's the entire reason they were there. And later pardon them. And even better, hire 'em in the DOJ.

But if you're homeless, an addict, or you're brown with a funny accent, the Gestapo's comin' for ya.

He also wants to take over cities with black mayors. Hmmm. Wonder what that is about.

Sick bloke culture: you refuse to call out the National Guard on Jan 6th for four hours, but you'll call them out to distract people from being all over the Epstein files.

Perfectly stated.

I wonder what the response would be if Biden or Obama tried to take over a Red city?

On Sunday's episode of Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver observed that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a.k.a. ICE, seems a bit desperate. “You know, there's an old saying in Hollywood: ‘If all you can get is Dean Cain, you are fucked,'” he joked. “Now, I'm not saying that ICE isn't finding people. I'm just saying, when you are reduced to pinning a badge on the 59-year-old star of The Dog Who Saved Christmas, The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation, The Dog Who Saved the Holidays, The Dog Who Saved Halloween, The Dog Who Saved Easter and The Dog Who Saved Summer, maybe you are in trouble.”

Cain has lately taken advantage of a general interest in Superman (a character he played nearly 30 years ago) to claw his way back into the zeitgeist—or at least adjacent to the zeitgeist. He generated some headlines for calling the latest Superman too woke and capitalized on the attention by announcing he was going to join ICE, which some out there (not us, you understand, but some) are calling extreme loser behavior. “Although, on the plus side, no need for that guy to wear a mask because the chances of anyone recognizing him are fucking zero,” Oliver snarked on his show. 

Dean Cain, who presented himself in an ICE recruitment video as a “sworn law enforcement officer as well as a filmmaker,” responded to the jabs on Twitter/X with a few crying-laughing emojis. “He stole that mask joke from the internet—and he also laughed hysterically when Trump said he was going to run for President. Case closed.” Unclear which case Cain was making or how he closed it, but okay. He also defended The Dog Who Saved… series by protesting that “those movies were sweet, by the way!” 

Oliver had bigger fish to fry than a handful of B-movies. During the segment dedicated to immigration under Donald Trump's administration, the comedian shared with his audience what to do if you're approached by ICE agents. “Attorneys told us the only two things you should say to them are: ‘Am I free to leave?' And ‘I want to speak to a lawyer.' That's it. You have the right to remain silent,” Oliver explained. “And I recognize that in some cases you may be unable to help yourself from saying, ‘Didn't you used to be Superman?' ‘I thought you died.' ‘I can't believe I'm meeting a filmmaker.' But that really is it.” You can watch the full video below.

One of daytime's most legendary actresses is relocating at the age of 86. Susan Flannery, who played Laura Spencer Horton on “Days of Our Lives” and Stephanie Douglas Forrester on “The Bold and the Beautiful,” is moving Down Under. Her daughter, Blaise, has lived in Australia for years with her children, so plenty of family time is in Susan's future!

Her close friend from Days, Susan Seaforth Hayes, shared the news in a new Instagram post.

The iconic soap star has been close to both Susan Seaforth Hayes and Suzanne Rogers since the earliest  “Days of Our Lives” era. According to Soap Opera Digest, Rogers credits Susan Flannery with getting her hired by the soap.

When speaking about getting the role of Maggie, she said, “Susan Flannery was a big influence. She was walking through the booth at the time the two of us were testing, and she said some very nice things about me, so I understand, and that's how I got the part. I've always had a warm place in my heart for Susan.”

All three ladies got together before Susan's big move. Much to the delight of soap fans, Susan Seaforth Hayes shared the occasion on Instagram.

“3 Susies have breakfast at Art's Deli.

The occasion: Susan Flannery, one of the great ladies of daytime or anywhere she turns up- is moving to Australia. Flannery was a beloved mentor and pal to Suzanne and me in our early Salem Days together.

Laughs, love, tears, hugs… just like Salem.We will miss her.”

A post shared by Bill & Susan Hayes (@billsusanhayes)

Flannery has always been extremely private. Back in 2002, she confirmed that she had an adopted daughter named Blaise. It was recently confirmed that Blaise now lives in Australia with her children.

The actress's soap career is a dream come true. She earned 10 nominations in the Outstanding Lead Actress category at the Daytime Emmys, winning on her first try, in 1975, for her work on “Days of Our Lives.” Three more wins followed for her portrayal of B&B's Stephanie. 

Flannery became the first actress ever to win the Lead Actress award for two different roles on two different soaps. After 25 years on B&B, Susan Flannery retired from acting. She remains close friends with former co-star Katherine Kelly Lang, who has frequently posted photos of the two of them together.

For the first time in his adult life, musician and TV personality Jaymes Vaughan can eat without getting sick, thanks to a successful surgery for a condition he's been suffering from for years. His husband, Hallmark star Jonathan Bennett, shared the emotional update on August 10, 2025. 

“This is the first time over the over 3,400 meals I've sat across from him where I didn't feel like he was fighting for his life just to get through it,” Bennett captioned a social media photo that showed Vaughan chewing his food at a restaurant and getting choked up — not by the meal, but by the sheer emotion of being able to swallow his food normally. 

“My husband has a condition that made it impossible for him to eat without throwing up for almost his entire adult life,” Bennett revealed, and then shared more about the procedure that is changing Vaughan's life. 

A post shared by Jonathan Bennett (@jonathandbennett)

Opening up about Vaughn's surgery, Bennett shared in his post, “Yesterday he got the procedure to open up his throat and this is his first meal after fixing what's called a Schatzki ring. A Schatzki ring, also known as a lower esophageal ring, is a ring of tissue that forms at the lower end of the esophagus, near where it connects with the stomach. It can make eating incredibly difficult.”

The symptoms of a Schatzki ring typically develop after the age of 25, according to the Cleveland Clinic, and can cause food to get stuck. A person with the condition then struggles to swallow and may experience burning or sharp pains in their chest when they eat. 

For two decades, Vaughan didn't know why he had so much trouble eating nor that he had a Schatzki ring, named for the radiologist who first discovered the condition, per Cleveland Clinic. 

“Sharing this in case it could help someone who has this condition but didn't know about it for 20 years like my husband,” Bennett wrote in his post. “Talk to your doctor and ask questions, you never know how much it can help your life.”

Social media followers flooded Bennett's video, in which Vaughan got teary-eyed as he marveled at being able to swallow with ease.  

Bennett's “The Groomsmen” co-star Heather Hemmens wrote, “Omg 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽” and Tyler Hynes left a healing heart emoji in the comments — “❤️‍🩹”

Another fellow Hallmark star, Hunter King, wrote, “❤️ this angel deserves the world!!!”

One of Bennett's followers who works in the medical field offered, “Being a Surgical RN, I'm familiar with the condition and procedure. So happy for him that he can now enjoy a delicious meal without worry. ❤️”

Hundreds of others celebrated the huge milestone for Vaughan, with one sweetly writing, “So, so happy for you both! He now knows the feeling of what we take for granted every day! I know it was hard watching him struggle, so happy for you too! ❤️❤️❤️”

Obama and her brother's podcast, 'IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson,' taped live with the HBO hit series' Natasha Rothwell as their guest, who offered advice for Malia on making it in Hollywood, among other notable moments of the companionable chat. 


							By 

	Ronda Racha Penrice



	In front of a rapt Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival audience Aug. 9, Michelle Obama co-hosted with her brother a live taping of their podcast IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson. The former First Lady returned to the fest, where she and former President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance in 2022 to support the Netflix documentary Descendant, which they produced through their production company Higher Ground.


	Pinch-hitting for advertised guest Teyana Taylor, who stars in the upcoming feature One Battle After Another with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro, and who canceled due to unexpected vocal surgery, was The White Lotus‘ Emmy-nominated Natasha Rothwell.

	During the conversation, Obama shared a moment she particularly enjoyed about Rothwell's twice Emmy-nominated role as Belinda. “Not only does Belinda get her groove thing on,” she said, “but one of my favorite scenes, because this is a luxury resort, [is] where you're having tea or lunch by yourself, and you spot a Black couple. And most of us know when you're doing something really nice somewhere, especially when you see other Black people,” — Obama indicated a look of acknowledgement of folks within the community — “yeah, and you got that, you know. I love that.” 


	Rothwell provided the backstory: “I pitched that to Mike [White, White Lotus creator]. He's such a collaborative writer-director, and season one, we started working together because he's very aware that he's not a Black woman,” she explained. “When we were working on season three, I was like, ‘Mike, there has to be a moment where Belinda sees someone who looks like her, and almost seeing what's possible for herself, because she's there under work circumstances, but that couple's there just for them. And so just to have that look make the cut, I was so thrilled,” she shared. “So many people bring that moment up because it's just authentic for the experience.”

	











	As the predominantly Black crowd co-signed her assertion, Obama added: “It tells a fuller story of what it means to be Black because we leisure, we travel, right? We leisure all up and down Martha's Vineyard, don't we? It's a beautiful thing to see. We've got to make sure the rest of the world knows that we are traveled, and we do things besides serve other people,” she said to enthusiastic applause.


	The trio swapped stories of their childhoods: Obama was a self-proclaimed introvert, Robinson “was always trying to be outside,” and Rothwell was “an introverted extrovert” from a military family background, for whose service Obama thanked them. Rothwell also discussed her parents' happy 47-year-marriage, and shared that she is “childless by choice” and content with being single. Robinson asked, “Would anybody be upset if we introduced you to somebody?” Rothwell responded: “God is good!”


	Obama shared how she tells her girls — Sasha and Malia — not to rush into marriage. “I'm trying to instill in my daughters right now that marriage should be a choice. And sometimes we send subliminal messages to our kids; they could be doing great things, and it's like, ‘Well, are you dating anyone?,'” she offered as an example. “Or you could be conquering the world, and it's like, ‘When are you going to have a baby?,' all the while sending the message that who you are isn't good enough until you are partnered or paired off.”


	Emphasizing her love for her husband, despite various reports, Obama explained why she shares the difficulty of marriage. “I talk openly about it, not because I don't love my husband. I'm happy to be married. We have a wonderful relationship, but [society] sometimes set young couples up,” she said. “What I don't want young couples to do is walk away from the hard, because that's just waiting for you.”

	











	The companionable conversation covered what it was like for Rothwell as a junior writer on Insecure — “After the first writers' room, I went to my car and sobbed because I felt so seen,” she recalled — as well as leading her award-winning series How to Die Alone as creator, writer, producer and star despite its cancellation. “I'm so grateful that the series saw the light of day, and it's on Hulu,” she said of the show that took her eight years to make.


	Obama also sought Rothwell's advice for others, including her own daughter Malia, who feel compelled to share their voice in Hollywood: “I have a young creative child. I think a lot of young creatives, especially kids of color, with all that's going on in the world, they wonder, ‘Is there still room for this?'”


	Rothwell responded: “I think it's so important for young creators to know that in their pocket is a phone that is a movie studio. Do not wait for someone else to give you permission to live your dream.”


	“There's still a lot of white space for really good, different, diverse stories. And I don't care what we're going through in the world, there's always room for us to tell our stories,” Obama, a producer herself, noted before inquiring about the latest project Rothwell is developing, with which she was unfamiliar.


	Rothwell admitted she was unfamiliar with the viral TikTok sensation, Who TF Did I Marry? by Reesa Teesa — who narrates the story of her marriage to a man she later learns is a pathological liar — until social media began attaching her to the project, which she learned about on a 25-member family group text chain while she was in Thailand.

	











	Later, when it became a viable Hollywood property, Rothwell was amazed that her fledgling production company Big Hattie Productions won it. “It was a six-way bidding war,” she said of the mega popular TikTok series. “There was like the Shondas and the Lee Daniels, everyone was throwing their hat in the ring, because to get 500 million people to sit down and watch something, Hollywood sits up and takes notice.”


	Closing out the conversation, Obama circled back to Rothwell's parents being thrilled that she was sitting down with Obama and her brother.  “Please tell your parents that you made them proud,” she said.

A revival of a beloved, iconic film? Groundbreaking, as Meryl Streep's “The Devil Wears Prada” character Miranda Priestly would say. 

But screenwriters, both those returning from some of the aughts' most beloved films, as well as the writers of new franchise editions for subsequent modern installments, are setting out to do just that: Make a sequel that's not only great, but necessary.

“Freakier Friday” is the latest film to get the legacyquel spin — and perhaps one of the first to be critically acclaimed as it hits theaters. Of course, “The Devil Wears Prada 2” already has high-brow power: While “Freakier Friday” boasts one Academy Award winner (Jamie Lee Curtis) among its ensemble, “Prada” is led by four Oscar nominees, with Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep both having won statues.

The productions of “Freakier Friday” and “The Devil Wears Prada 2” have ignited viral internet fandom, with “Freakier Friday” in part landing a theatrical release due to the online support that the announcement of the sequel generated.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Freakier Friday” being greenlit further seemed to open the floodgates for more 2000s nostalgic revivals: “Princess Diaries 3,” “Bend It Like Beckham 2,” “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” “My Best Friend's Wedding,” “The Holiday,” and even “Air Bud” are all getting millennial-centric installments. And that's not even including series sequels to '90s properties such as “And Just Like That” (RIP) and “Clueless,” which “Freakier Friday” scribe Jordan Weiss is writing for Peacock.

Are studios mining their existing films with 15th, 20th, and 25th anniversaries in mind, or are screenwriters pitching these revivals in droves based on their own childhood cinematic fandoms? Why is there this seemingly sudden push for rom-coms, or in millennial speak, girly pop films? 

And how much does “Barbie” have to do with all of it?

IndieWire spoke with “The Devil Wears Prada 2″ screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna, “Freakier Friday” screenwriter Jordan Weiss, and Elyse Hollander, who shares a co-story-by credit with Weiss on the “Freaky Friday” sequel, to unpack the nostalgic trend of 2000s films being brought into 2025 and beyond — and detail which early 21st century films they're each vying to revive.

The following interviews have been edited and condensed for length and clarity.
 










IndieWire: The overwhelming influx of 2000s films being turned into franchises has really marked a trend in recent years. Why do you think these millennial high concept favorites are getting newfound attention? Is this led by the studios or the creatives? 

Jordan Weiss: It was a combination of legacy producers [Kristin Burr and Andrew Gunn from the 2003 “Freaky Friday”] and millennial executives [such as Disney SVP of development Allison Erlikhman, who is also working on “Princess Diaries 3”] and a millennial screenwriter, who were all like, “We either love this movie because we worked on it” or “we were children when it came out and are obsessed with every part of it.” I think [Allison] being of this generation and having that close tie made her such an asset as a studio executive working on this.”

I think these revivals come about in a lot of different ways. Sometimes it's me picking up the phone and saying, “Hey, I have an idea for an interpretation of this piece of IP,” and sometimes it's a studio saying, “These two actors have remained in each other's lives and and are still friends and love each other and want to make another one of these because they've stayed so close over 20 years.” And then they find some fresh voices to bring in and help them work on that.

 










Aline Brosh McKenna: The desire to do this [“The Devil Wears Prada 2“] again came from the creative team. It didn't come from the studio. The only reason to do something like this is if you have something you want to say, something creative. I've certainly been approached with other remakes that, in other contexts, didn't make sense for me anyway. This was really coming from the folks on the creative team being the first ones coming together and wanting to continue this story.

I've talked to [“The Devil Wears Prada” director] David Frankel regularly over the last 20 years. A couple of years ago, I started saying to him, “You know, I actually think that there is a sequel here because the world that these characters live in is changing so dramatically and so rapidly. I really feel like there could be something there.” We just started mildly chatting about it, but really, I had no expectation and I was off doing other things. 

McKenna was the showrunner for “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and made her directorial debut with rom-com “Your Place or Mine.”

Aline, I know that in the 20 years since “The Devil Wears Prada” was released, some actors did publicly shut down the idea of a sequel. 

Hathaway famously said in 2022 that she wasn't sure the film could even warrant any other installments due to the death of the print magazine industry: “I don't know if there can be [a sequel]. I just think that movie was in a different era. Now everything's gone so digital and that movie is centered around the concept of producing a physical thing and it's just, it's just very different.”
 










McKenna: They all said no [for years]. None of us really felt like it made sense earlier, and then all of a sudden, it really did make sense. 

So, why now? What made those no's become yes's?

McKenna: One of the original producers of the movie, Wendy Finerman, said, “I've spoken to Meryl. If you have something to pitch her, she would like to hear it.” That is really what started the process. The most important consideration was figuring out what a story would be, to have a story that would hold up. The only reason to do something like this [a sequel] is if you have something you want to say, something creative. I've certainly been approached with other remakes that in other contexts didn't make sense for me. I felt like this was really about the folks on the creative team from the first one coming together again and wanting to continue this story. And having the original cast together was so important.

For “Freakier Friday,” as a screenwriter joining the franchise with the legacy sequel, was there added pressure since the core original cast was returning, too? 

Hollander: It's a big risk for everybody involved to come back. You don't want to ruin the legacy, you want add to it. I was like, “I cannot be responsible for ruining a beloved film and adding to a cash grab, schlock pile that would be once direct to DVD.”

 










Weiss: I don't know, I think there's a lot of pressure on every film to be great because everybody working on it cares about it a lot, whether it's streaming or theatrical or of any size, but I think that there are, different challenges and different things that are fun about joining a franchise. No matter what IP you're adapting, whether it's a comic book or a legacy sequel, you're still opening a blank document and being tasked with creating an original new story, whether that's an original story inspired by or including characters from the past or inspired by or including characters from your own personal history. You're making a new experience for the audience. 

I really don't feel as though I'm not being given the opportunity to be completely original and creative, even when I'm working as part of like big legacy titles. I feel like this is a privilege. You always want to honor where something came from, whether it came from my own personal heartbreak when I was 16 or whether it came from an amazing movie starring Lindsay Lohan from 2003.

There are things that are really fun about it when it's an original, and there are also things that are really fun and special when it's me getting brought into a group project that's existed for 25 years or 30 years. Whether it's original or building off of a piece of IP is of secondary importance to me.

 










There have been some backlash about there being “too many” legacy sequels announced. Do you think this is a gendered criticism as all of the films receiving their flack are women-led rom-coms? 

McKenna: I don't think [the criticism is] gendered. I think, from what I can tell, people are really excited about a lot of these, and I know “Freakier Friday” is opening really soon. I really think it just boils down to the story you have to tell. We're also experiencing our own sense of nostalgia and revisiting a film. I think that's what we're hoping to do for an audience, for them to have that feeling of a reunion, too.

Weiss: The thing that is funny to me is that there's a lot of conversation now of like, “Oh, my God, everything's a reboot, everything's a sequel. I miss the '90s and early 2000s when everything was original,” and I'm like, “Those were also all remakes.” There are probably so many movies that people don't realize were actually movies from the '30s or '40s. I'm like, “Hollywood's built on it.” Maybe we're always re-innovating, but I have embraced it. I think that all of these stories are original, and you still are creating something new. I've really tried to be optimistic about the potential with that. If a cynical person wants to say that all [legacy sequels] come from the same cash grab, that's just not my view of it. But maybe I've got rose colored glasses on.

 










Hollander: I think the rom-com genre has been everyone's guilty pleasure, and we need to get rid of the guilt and just accept that it's super fun and fantastic. And I've actually heard that in addition to whatever the online troll comments are, there also has been such a push for romance and a return to big, emotional movie star-driven films that are not about capes and explosions. I think “The Devil Wears Prada 2” is happening because you have huge movie stars [in it] as well. 

McKenna: “Top Gun: Maverick” really showed that there was an interest in these [legacy sequels]. They really updated [Tom Cruise's] character to reflect his age and his experience. To me, these don't necessarily seem like cynical money grabs, which is how I think they're often portrayed. I think often, as in our case, and as in the case of “Top Gun,” it stems from like a legitimate desire to see these characters again. And in the '30s and '40s, they routinely made tons of sequels, and there wasn't an embarrassment about wanting to revisit beloved characters. The audience has asked for more of this and in this case, it just happened over such a long period of time.

Is this wave of 2000s fandom in Hollywood in part also due to “Barbie” making box office history? What happened to the pause of high concept rom-coms? Did that happen along with the condescension of the “chick flick” genre label? 
 










Hollander: I think it's realizing there's still a marketplace for what I like to call DryBar movies. In the early days of DryBar [the salon], you'd go, you'd get a glass of champagne, you get your hair blown out. It was like a very female-centric space and they would have a movie playing, our favorite rom-coms like “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,” “Bride Wars,” “He's Just Not That into You,” “Never Been Kissed,” all those great movies. And then at a certain point, someone decided that it wasn't commercial anymore.

McKenna: One of the reasons the fandom for [“The Devil Wears Prada”] and all of these movies is so enduring is because the culture was so much more focused on a few pieces. … I guess people call it the monoculture, but the audience [in the 2000s] wasn't as fragmented. So a lot of people did see this movie when it came out, and then it had this amazing life on DVDs which don't exist anymore, but that was a huge. That extended its life. 

And then the deals that were made for it to be on TV. I mean, [“The Devil Wears Prada”] is always on TV. “Prada” and “27 Dresses” are on TV just so frequently, and the thing that people say to me the most is, “Oh, if that's on, I'll watch the whole thing.” It's not just based on the quality of the movie itself, but also definitely based on a feeling. At the time [in the early 2000s], there was just more of a sense of bringing people together. Everybody watched the “Friends” finale, you know, and so those are all things that you could talk about in common. 

 










I think, in a way, the popularity of these older movies has something to do with our longing to have something that cuts across the whole culture. I think that drives a lot of the interest and so it's living on in the internet and on television. This one [“The Devil Wears Prada”] has lived on, but I also think it represents not just the nostalgia for this particular movie, but sort of a nostalgia for mass moviegoing and a common shared culture.

Fans of the respective original films have already made set photos for both “Freakier Friday” and “The Devil Wears Prada 2” go viral. “Freakier Friday” star and producer Jamie Lee Curtis slammed the leaked pictures in 2024, calling them an “intrusion … into the creative process of filmmaking.” What is your opinion?

Weiss: The parasocial relationship between fans and franchises is always interesting to me.

McKenna: We knew there would be a lot of interest. I personally hadn't experienced this level of people coming out [to the set], but it's the world we live in. In many ways, we're speaking to a different world than we did in 2006. … It stems from like a legitimate desire to see these characters again. As long as everyone's safe, what an honor that people are still interested.

How do you approach writing a legacy sequel? Did you always know you wanted to tap into early 2000s IPs? 
 










Weiss: When I'm looking ahead in my career, it's less about, “Do I want to reboot this specific title?” and more about deciding I want to do more rom-coms, I want to do more mother-daughter stories. Having the opportunity to do a big rom com that's original, great, but if I have the opportunity to do a big rom-com that's the remake of a beloved '90s rom-com, also great. If someone is like, “Can you believe you're working on another reboot?” I would be like, “This is was completely my original idea.” I think that's the best way to utilize IP though is to have an independent, original concept and then having it be within the safe haven of an IP so studios can greenlight it.

I think there's a lot of crossover with stuff. “Dollface” was wholly original, but it was taking inspiration from things like “Clueless.” Literally Brenda Song's original character description was “Millennial Cher Horowitz” in the script. … I wish that there would have been more of an audience for “Dollface” to last 10 seasons, but I think ultimately like it's easier to find an audience when you have IP.

Hollander: I think you can lean into some of those IP titles and use them in a sneaky way in to do something new. In a dream world, every movie could be an interesting small A24 Celine Song, like something that makes you question art in the world and your perspective, and I think there's space for that. 

 










After this interview was conducted, it was announced that Song is now also getting into the nostalgic reboot game with “My Best Friend's Wedding,” which she is writing for Sony.

I think at the same time too, Hollywood has always been a business where you have to sell a product, whether it's entertainment or joy or happiness or nostalgia. And it's your job as the writer to slide in deeper themes that you want to explore. Like a four-way swap and with a blended family storyline across multiple generations [as the “Freakier Friday” plot], I could describe the movie in a way that sounds like an A24 film, like a body horror swap thing, and then you realize, “Oh wait, it's Freaky Friday.” I feel like that's when it's really successful, when you're not sure by the logline what shiny veneer marker it has on it.

Are there any other 2000s films you want to reboot? 

Hollander: I'd love for the ['90s] “Charlie's Angels” to come back. I'd love for “Bring It On” to return, especially with the rise of “Cheer” and the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders series. I'd love to see Kirsten Dunst reprising her role and, what does that look like 20 years later, when you've aged out of like being a performer or cheerleader? Kind of make it like an “F1” event that Brad Pitt had.

 










McKenna: I remember when I first came to Hollywood, I really wanted to remake “Cheaper by the Dozen” because it had been a really successful book and movie way, way back and nobody was interested. I was a baby writer and then that turned out to be a huge hit movie. I don't even know if people connected it to the fact that it was a remake; it had to stand on its own.

Aline, would you more open to revisiting any of your past films now after returning to write “The Devil Wears Prada 2”? And if not, would you be OK with another writer taking on one of your IPs like with what happened with “Freakier Friday”?

McKenna: I tried to do a TV show with “27 Dresses,” but I haven't quite gotten there yet. The wedding industry has just exploded since we made that movie. I mean, when I see what young people are going through now with weddings, that seems quaint. I think that's primed for something. Out of the things I've written, I would say that's the one. I'm not sure that there will be a “We Bought Another Zoo.”

“Freakier Friday” is currently in theaters. “The Devil Wears Prada 2” is expected in theaters May 2026. Both are Disney releases.

Donald Trump continued to rage at media figures overnight, this time former New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.


	Trump wrote on Truth Social late Sunday, “Paul Krugman of the New York Times has been predicting Doom and Gloom ever since my great election success in 2016. In other words, he has been wrong for YEARS, as ALL markets have been hitting new HIGHS, and are now higher than ever before. People stayed out of the ‘BEST MARKET IN HISTOY' [sic] because of this Trump Deranged BUM. Sue them!”


	Krugman left The New York Times late last year, but now writes a daily column on Substack. He's been especially hard-hitting on Trump's tariffs and the president's trade deals, while warning of stagflation.

	In his most recent column, posted on Monday morning, Krugman mocked Trump's effort to counter a recent dismal jobs report by holding a presentation in the Oval Office last week with economist Stephen Moore, with a chart that mistakenly labeled “median income”, “medium income.” Moore, Krugman wrote, “may be the last person on the planet you'd trust to tell you the economic truth.” Moore's figures, which showed a recent rise in median income with figures that were quickly challenged.

	“I don't mean that Moore is extremely right-wing, although of course he is,” Krugman wrote. “I don't even mean that he's a dishonest hack, although again of course he is. I mean that even among dishonest right-wing hacks Moore stands out for his pathological inability to get numbers and facts right.”

	











	As for Trump's attack on him, Krugman wrote, “Now this is flattering: Last night Donald Trump called me a ‘Deranged BUM.' Gonna add it to my profile.”

Dunno if Krugman is a “deranged ‘bum'” , but he certainly is a quack.

That's nice. Release the Epstein files.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN.

The Emperor has no clothes.

You sure about that? Trump is going to get Obergefell overturned, and it's a decision supported by a plurality of young voters. 

Meanwhile, Krugman has been exiled to “retirement”.

Overturning same sex marriage is not supported by a plurality of young voters, who can't even afford rent, bills, or home, let alone find jobs that pay a decent wage.  But go on…

Then why is everyone on TV constantly melting down?

I think people need to leave Trump  alone. He has done a good job so far.he has been criticized enough by the media. Also those democrats who left Texas need to  come back to work or lose their jobs. I am a navy veteran who is tired of democrats throwing hissy fits cause they didn't get there way

Quoth Marsha Stanley: “I am a navy veteran who is tired of democrats throwing hissy fits cause they didn't get there way”.
I think the English language requirement which the MAGAs are currently trying to implement would certainly put you on the ICE watchlist. Stop posting, go fishing.

Oh Marsha, Marsha, Marsha…….

As opposed to the sober, quiet Republicans?

Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam will celebrate its 15th anniversary in September, but as it turns out, the Disney Channel Original Movie didn't mark the last time its stars would rock out together. On Sunday, Jonas Brothers kicked off their Greetings From Your Hometown tour with a headlining performance at MetLife Stadium. Toward the end of the show, the venue erupted. “Ladies and gentlemen,” Joe Jonas began, “Demi Lovato.”


	The introduction came just after Joe performed “Gotta Find You” from Camp Rock. When Lovato emerged to the shrieks and squeals of the audience, she launched into “This Is Me,” the duet they performed as Mitchie Torres and Shane Gray during the climax of the movie. The former flames kept the fire burning with the Final Jam ballad “Wouldn't Change a Thing.”

After the show, Joe and Lovato shared a series of TikTok videos, including one set to “Wouldn't Change a Thing” and another to an interview clip where fellow alum Debby Ryan recalls sitting down with the president of Disney Channel and announcing, “I want to make history.” The reunion certainly felt historic for OG fans who grew up with both acts. When fans posted in shock that Lovato and Nick Jonas were in the same room again, the generational divide made itself clear as others asked in confusion, “Nick? I thought she dated Joe?” You just had to be there.

	










thanks for having me @Jonas Brothers 🫶


	Jonas Brothers might have saved their best surprise for last with Lovato, but the night wasn't without its fair share of special guests. Earlier in the set, Jesse McCartney took the stage to perform “Beautiful Soul,” and Switchfoot joined for “Meant to Live” and “Hold On.” Dean Lewis also made an appearance to perform their recently released collaboration “Loved You Better.”

	The Jonas20: Greetings From Your Hometown tour will continue this week in Washington, D.C., Camden, New Jersey, and Virginia Beach. Meanwhile, Lovato recently previewed her forthcoming ninth studio album with the single “Fast.”


	“Over the past few years, Demi has found love, joy, and newfound confidence, making the choice to approach life with much more lightness and fun,” a source close to the project recently told Rolling Stone, referring to Lovato's recent marriage to musician Jordan “Jutes” Lutes. “She took this sentiment into the studio, which can be felt in every track on this celebratory dance-pop album.”

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Gilded Age” Season 3, Episode 8, “My Mind Is Made Up,” including the ending.]

It starts, as it often should, with Audra McDonald.

Her “Gilded Age” character, Dorothy Scott, is trying on a dress for the upcoming Newport ball — feeling quite pleased with her lovely embroidered roses — when her archenemy, Mrs. Kirkland (Phylicia Rashad), strides into the fitting room to ruin her day. All season, in fact, Mrs. Kirkland has made a habit of spoiling Dorothy's fun. One might even say she savors it, and this day is no different.

 










The haughty mother of Dr. William Kirkland (Jordan Donica) feigns surprise that Mrs. Scott and her daughter, Peggy (Denée Brown), are still attending the ball. By Mrs. Kirkland's assessment (which is all that matters), the unmarried Scott should feel too ashamed for “duping” her son, Dr. Kirkland, to allow herself the pleasure of a fancy night out. “I had hoped Peggy would do the respectable thing and send her regrets,” Mrs. Kirkland says.

That does it. That is it. With the camel's back broken, Dorothy Scott, summoning all her righteous indignation (and channeled with maybe one-third of Audra McDonald's extraordinary talent, which is still enough to power the city of Manhattan), lets the snobby scold have it. “Perhaps you should get off your high horse,” Dorothy spits. “You have enjoyed a certain kind of privilege amongst our people here at Newport that has created an illusion for you — the kind that has allowed you to act without grace, manners, and impunity.”

Each word snaps off like a foot colliding firmly in Mrs. Kirkland's rump, forcing the typically uncontested aggressor to stand down. Sure, she tries to preserve a sense of superiority before she flees, reminding her suddenly effusive enemy that, no matter what accusations Dorothy tosses her way, Dr. Kirkland now knows better than to make Ms. Scott into a Mrs. The malevolent mother's whisper campaign did the trick. The Kirklands will win the long game, as the wealthy so often do, and the Scotts will have to sit there and take it, as is their lot in life.

Well, to paraphrase Cynthia Nixon's Ada later in the episode: “Societies change, bitch!”

Dr. Kirkland loves Peggy, he doesn't care about her past, and he tells his mother as much. Joined by his irate father, Frederick (Brian Stokes Mitchell), the good doctor chastises Mrs. Kirkland for spreading gossip and sullying Peggy's honest reputation. Then the patriarch puts his foot down. “WOMAN,” Frederick bellows. “You are not above reproach. You have sewn calamity and heartbreak — and this is not the first time. It stops now.”

 










Hell yes, Papa Kirkland! Get her ass! 

…OK, let's hit pause on the outrage for a second. It kind of sucks that only the men's admonishment matters here, especially since Dorothy delivers the very same message, and does so with greater purpose and passion. But hey, it's “The Gilded Age.” That's just how things work. At least Mrs. Kirkland gets what she deserves, and everything works out between Dr. William Kirkland and the future Mrs. Peggy Kirkland.

The same good fortune — and just comeuppance — also graces Ms. Charlotte Drayton (Hannah Shealy) and her mother, Mrs. Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy), respectively. The former host of the annual ball at first rejects a precedent-breaking invitation on behalf of Charlotte, her daughter, whose divorce is the very reason Mrs. Astor forfeited hosting duties to begin with.

“We cannot allow the scourge of divorce to infect the social circles we hold dear,” Mrs. Astor says. “If you receive them, it will become an epidemic, and I cannot be part of that.”

Except, she does become a part of that, choosing to attend the ball despite her daughter's scandalous appearance and her own promises to stay home. Bertha (Carrie Coon), ever the gracious host, only makes Mrs. Astor eat a morsel of crow when she slinks into the foyer, choosing instead to bask in one more season-ending victory over Old Money. (The opera house was only the beginning.)

 










And yet, Bertha's basking doesn't last. 

As the Newport Ball ends in picture-perfect fashion, Bertha tells George (Morgan Spector), “I just want what's best for us all.” And doesn't that sentiment sound familiar? Is that why George gives her a look of curious consideration when he should be expressing satisfied acknowledgement? Amid the Russells' latest victory lap, is something [gasp] amiss? 

Let's trace the echo back, shall we? What kicked off mid-revelry near the end of Episode 8 resounds all the way back to Episode 7, “Ex-Communicated,” when Larry (Harry Richardson) accused Bertha of meddling in his relationship with Marian (Louisa Jacobson).

“You must understand, I only want what's best for you,” Bertha says. “You want what's best for you,” her indignant (and misguided) son snaps back. “And if it doesn't suit your plan, you seek to destroy it.”

Earlier in the finale, the Astors shared a similar exchange. 

“Charlotte, I am trying to protect you,” Mrs. Astor says, regarding her daughter's presence at the ball. “No, mother,” Charlotte says. “As usual, you are just trying to protect yourself.”

And before that — the scene directly preceding it, in fact — Mrs. Kirkland tells Mr. Kirkland, “I just did what I thought was right.” To which he pointedly replies, “For whom?”

 










Children squaring off with their parents. The future battling for its freedom from the past. These are the wars raging in “The Gilded Age” Season 3 finale, and each brouhaha ends with happy children and positive progress. Peggy and Dr. Kirkland are engaged. Charlotte gets to attend the ball while maintaining her place in high society. Even Larry and Marian dance the night away, rekindling a romance no one outside of themselves gives two shits about.

But among the mourning mothers so deservedly and thoroughly embarrassed, one doesn't warrant the fate thrust upon her. One isn't a rightly vanquished intruder, but a wrongly abandoned victim. And while Bertha would never allow such a disparaging designation (she is, after all, impervious to her enemies' attacks), she's stuck with it anyway. She is yet another controlling matriarch scorned, and even though she knows her plans were proactive and important, she's devastated to discover her husband doesn't see them that way.

What separates Bertha from the bad moms in the rest of the episode (because, yes, she can be a bad mom sometimes) is both simple and systemic: It's misogyny. The Russell couple has always existed as two arms made to climb the ladder of American power. George's right hand commands the business realm, while Bertha's left hand guides the social circles. Both are needed to move up: Without George's money, Bertha couldn't outspend her opponents or hold court with dukes and duchesses. But without Bertha's savvy understanding of polite society, George wouldn't be able to court critical clients outside the office, sustain essential relationships, or properly position his family for upward mobility.

 










But what becomes horrifically clear in the Season 3 finale's twist ending is that TV's hottest power couple isn't who we thought they were. It's not just that they're fighting. It's that they don't respect each other — not equally — which is the fuel to their fiery alliance, for viewers and for the Russells themselves.

The next morning, after the ball, Bertha is shocked to learn her husband is still pissed. She thought she'd repaired whatever he believed was broken in the family — making things right with their daughter, proving she had nothing to do with her son's relationship struggles (like he needs any help), and throwing another goddamn perfect party — but George is still unsure.

“I don't blame you for being ruthless. I admire it. It's what we share,” he says. “But I'm ruthless in business, not with the people I love.”

“And I'm ruthless for the people I love, can you not see that?” Bertha shouts in stunned disbelief.

No, he cannot see the truth. For he is a man, and men are idiots. (I speak from first-hand experience.) George is happy to stomach the risk of bankrupting his family in order to realize his big railroad dreams; he's even happy to consider killing his own workers, one by one, if they continue striking for a living wage and safe working conditions (how dare they?); he's happy to hazard all sorts of financial, moral, and familial losses if it means making money, but he cannot stomach the temporary unhappiness of a daughter on her wedding day. 

 










At episode's end, he's still complaining that Bertha “forced [Gladys] into a marriage,” even when Gladys herself isn't complaining! She's happy! He's seen that she's happy! And why did he get to see his daughter being so happy, back in New York, reunited with her family? Oh yeah, because Bertha threw a perfect fucking ball again, no thanks to you, George. Gladys even tries to tell her parents she's pregnant, but George has already fucked off back to work before he can hear the good news. 

And thus, Season 3 ends on Bertha's devastated expression. She gazes out the window at a partner she can't recognize anymore — not after all his previous claims toward respecting her role in their marriage have been proven empty (or, at least, clueless) — but she's not angry. Not yet. Yes, she could exact her revenge in whatever ways she sees fit, probably before his carriage gets to the office. Yes, it would be a well-earned comeuppance, given how desperately she's tried to get her husband to honor her perspective all season. And yes, he's fallen catastrophically short. 

We've seen in Season 3 that women can now, at the turn of the 20th century, survive the once-fatal blow of divorce and other such scandals. What's left for Season 4 to decide is whether Bertha can survive a broken heart.

 










“The Gilded Age” is available on HBO Max. HBO has already renewed the series for Season 4.

	For seven years, Jon Batiste watched Stephen Colbert lead The Late Show night after night. The musician began serving as bandleader on the series with his house band Stay Human in 2015 and held the position through 2022. Now, Colbert is on his way out, too, following the cancellation of The Late Show. The musician is confident that his former colleague and collaborator will land on his feet


	“I'm very grateful to him and I think where he goes next, his voice won't be silenced,” Batiste told Rolling Stone AU/NZ in a recent interview. “The voice of free speech is challenge, but the soul of an individual cannot be cancelled. He's gonna find another megaphone, another outlet, I'm sure of it. I'm rooting for him.”


	When CBS announced in July that the late-night talk show would conclude in May 2026, it cited financial issues at the network as an explanation. “It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,” CBS wrote in its statement at the time, though many have speculated that the move was related to the recent merger between parent company Paramount and Skydance.

	The $8 billion merger, which closed last week after over a year of delays, required approval from the Trump administration. Donald Trump celebrated CBS' decision to axe the show, saying, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.” During a recent musical segment on The Late Show, Weird Al Yankovic and Lin-Manuel Miranda parodied the CEO affair at a Coldplay concert with an animated rendering of Trump cuddling up with the Paramount logo.

	











	“What happened to my friend Stephen is a symptom of big money,” Batiste said. “We're in a time where the right price can silence the voice of free speech, which we should be very, very conscious of. As artists, we have to constantly fight for free speech and fight for the ability to be able to share the authentic truth of our being.”

	In a recent op-ed for Rolling Stone, Lizz Winstead, who worked with Colbert on a segment when she was co-creator and head writer of The Daily Show, wrote, “Stephen isn't expensive. He's a threat. A wildly popular, truth-telling comic with moral clarity is dangerous in this moment. Especially when he's white, male, and too influential to be dismissed as fringe … Knowing Stephen and his values, I don't think we're at risk of losing his voice. I hope he takes his brilliance somewhere he has full creative control. We need him, and we need the brilliance of every political comic still brave enough to speak out.”

The Scott Cooper-written and -directed film stars Jeremy Allen White as the iconic musician alongside Jeremy Strong, Marc Maron, Stephen Graham, Gaby Hoffman, Paul Walter Hauser, David Krumholtz and Odessa Young.

Deputy Editor, East Coast


	The 2025 New York Film Festival has added the premiere of Scott Cooper‘s Bruce Springsteen biopic, Deliver Me From Nowhere, starring Jeremy Allen White as the iconic musician, as its Spotlight Gala selection.


	The film, adapted from Warren Zanes' 2023 best-selling book of the same name, is set in the early '80s at a key time in Springsteen's career as he was recording the personal, acoustic songs that would make up his Nebraska album while also working on demos for Born in the U.S.A. and navigating his growing fame. Cooper directs from his own script. In addition to White, Deliver Me From Nowhere stars Jeremy Strong as Springsteen's longtime manager Jon Landau as well as Marc Maron, Stephen Graham, Gaby Hoffman, Paul Walter Hauser, David Krumholtz and Odessa Young. Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson and Scott Stuber produce, with Tracey London and Zanes executive producing. 20th Century Studios is set to release Deliver Me From Nowhere in theaters Oct. 24.

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere will have its New York Film Festival premiere Sunday, Sept. 28, with Cooper, White, Strong, Young and Springsteen, himself, all expected to be in attendance.


	“The New York Film Festival has always felt like a spiritual home for the kind of cinema I believe in,” Cooper said in a statement. “To now arrive with a film about Bruce Springsteen — an artist whose music shaped not just a country but my own sense of storytelling — is something I could never have imagined. Getting to know Bruce, to explore his world and his spirit, has been one of the most profound creative experiences of my life. To share that experience with New York audiences, in a city that defines artistic possibility, is both an honor and a responsibility I hold with deep gratitude.”

	











	NYFF artistic director Dennis Lim added, “Taking its cue from the stark majesty of Bruce Springsteen's classic album Nebraska, Scott Cooper's Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere has an intimacy and immediacy that eludes most film biographies. Anchored by Jeremy Allen White's revelatory performance, this year's Spotlight Gala selection is a fitting tribute to a living legend.”


	The NYFF previously announced its currents lineup and main slate, including its opening-night film, Luca Guadagnino's Julia Roberts starrer After the Hunt, which also features Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield; centerpiece film Jim Jarmusch's Father Mother Sister Brother; and closing night film Bradley Cooper's Is This Thing On?


	Additional highlights from the 34-film main slate include Jafar Panahi's Cannes' Palme d'Or winner It Was Just an Accident, Kathryn Bigelow‘s A House of Dynamite, Noah Baumbach‘s George Clooney and Adam Sandler starrer Jay Kelly, Kelly Reichardt‘s The Mastermind, the Laura Poitras- and Mark Obenhaus-directed Seymour Hersh documentary Cover-Up, and Mary Bronstein's Rose Byrne and Conan O'Brien starrer If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.


	The 63rd New York Film Festival, presented by Film at Lincoln Center, is set to run Sept. 26 to Oct. 13.

Get ready for the walls of the Alice Tully Hall to reverberate with one plaintive cry in the coming weeks: “Bruuuuuuuucee!”

Film at Lincoln Center has today announced that Scott Cooper's “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” will celebrate its premiere (though, crucially in the wide world of fall festivals, it's unclear which premiere it will be and where else the film might be screening) as the Spotlight Gala selection of the 63rd New York Film Festival. The film will make its debut on Sunday, September 28, Cooper and cast members Jeremy Allen White, Jeremy Strong, and Odessa Young will be in attendance, along with Bruce Springsteen.

The much-anticipated feature stars White during a formative period in The Boss' life, as he set out to make the intensely personal album “Nebraska” while also dealing with his tremendous rising fame and starting to craft what would become the life-changing album “Born in the U.S.A.” Cooper himself adapted Warren Zanes' 2023 best-selling book of the same name for the film's script. 20th Century Studios will release the film in theaters on Friday, October 24.

Per today's NYFF announcement, “Jeremy Allen White inhabits a legend and lays bare his beating heart in this graceful, exceptionally moving film about a very specific part of peerless American rock icon Bruce Springsteen's life. … This biographical drama focuses with gratifying specificity on the nitty-gritty of Springsteen's songwriting, while never shying away from the realities of his familial traumas and personal depression. It's more than just a tour de force for its incandescent star — it's a reminder that the reason we love this seemingly larger-than-life hero is because he's always been palpably human.”

The film features an enviable supporting cast, including Jeremy Strong (as Springsteen's longtime manager and co-producer Jon Landau), Stephen Graham and Gaby Hoffmann (as Bruce's parents), Paul Walter Hauser, David Krumholtz, and Odessa Young. The film is produced by Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson, and Scott Stuber. Tracey Landon and Zanes executive produce. 

“The New York Film Festival has always felt like a spiritual home for the kind of cinema I believe in,” said Cooper in an official statement. “To now arrive with a film about Bruce Springsteen — an artist whose music shaped not just a country but my own sense of storytelling — is something I could never have imagined. Getting to know Bruce, to explore his world and his spirit, has been one of the most profound creative experiences of my life. To share that experience with New York audiences, in a city that defines artistic possibility, is both an honor and a responsibility I hold with deep gratitude.”

As previously announced, the Opening Night selection is the North American premiere of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt”; the North American premiere of Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother” is the Centerpiece selection; and the world premiere of Bradley Cooper's “Is This Thing On?” is the Closing Night selection. Last week, NYFF announced both its heavy-hitting main slate and its always compelling Currents section. The rest of the Spotlight slate, plus the Revivals lineup and Talks sections will be announced in the coming weeks.

The 2025 New York Film Festival will run from September 26 – October 13. 

The NYFF Main Slate and Spotlight selection committee is chaired by Dennis Lim, NYFF Artistic Director, and includes Florence Almozini, Justin Chang, K. Austin Collins, and Rachel Rosen. Violeta Bava, Michelle Carey, Leo Goldsmith, and Antoine Thirion are NYFF program advisors.

Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. each provided their own take on the conflict, as well as issuing a joint communique on Sunday (Aug. 10).

	All four members of U2 issued statements on Sunday (Aug. 10) expressing their fears that the nearly two-year war between Israel and Hamas has sent the region into “uncharted territory.” In a joint statement from Bono, The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton, the group wrote, “Everyone has long been horrified by what is unfolding in Gaza – but the blocking of humanitarian aid and now plans for a military takeover of Gaza City has taken the conflict into uncharted territory. We are not experts in the politics of the region, but we want our audience to know where we each stand.”

	The statements from the band came as experts are warning that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan for a renewed offensive in the Gaza Strip in which forces would take over Gaza City could further exacerbate a malnutrition and starvation crisis that has taken center stage on the eve of the two-year mark of the war.


	In his letter, singer and career-long activist Bono said that he has generally tried to avoid speaking on the politics of the Middle East — with the exception of marking the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on the Nova music festival on the day when Hamas killed more than 1,200 and took more than 250 hostages from Israel — not out of humility, but “more uncertainty in the face of obvious complexity.” 

	











	But as co-founder of the Arfrica-centered global anti-poverty, HIV/AIDS charity ONE, he felt his focus should be on the lives lost in the war in Sudan and Ethiopia, not to mention the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID and the U.S.'s life-saving PEPFAR initiative focusing on fighting HIV/AIDS.


	But, he wrote, “The images of starving children on the Gaza Strip brought me back to a working trip to a food station in Ethiopia my wife Ali and I made 40 years ago next month following U2's participation in Live Aid 1985. Another man-made famine. To witness chronic malnutrition up close would make it personal for any family, especially as it affects children. Because when the loss of non-combatant life en masse appears so calculated… especially the deaths of children, then ‘evil' is not a hyperbolic adjective… in the sacred text of Jew, Christian, and Muslim it is an evil that must be resisted.”


	Bono acknowledged that the rape, murder and abduction of Israelis at the Nova Festival was “evil” and that when he heard about the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas militants on Israel he didn't think of politics. Reacting in real time to the news from the stage of the Sphere where the band were in the midst of their venue-opening residency, he said he couldn't help but “express the pain everyone in the room was feeling and is still feeling for other music lovers and fans like us — hiding under a stage in Kibbutz Re'im then butchered to set a diabolical trap for Israel and to get a war going that might just redraw the map from ‘The river to the sea'… a gamble Hamas' leadership were willing to play with the lives of two million Palestinians… to sow the seeds for a global intifada that U2 had glimpsed at work in Paris during the Bataclan attack in 2015… but only if Israel's leaders fell for this trap that Hamas set for them.”

	











	The singer had pointed words for Israeli PM Netanyahu, as well as late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, lashing the latter for what he said was Hamas' deliberate positioning of soldiers amid civilian targets, while also asking when a “just war to defend the country turn[ed] into an unjust land grab? I hoped Israel would return to reason. I was making excuses for a people seared and shaped by the experience of Holocaust… who understood the threat of extermination is not simply a fear but a fact… I re-read Hamas' charter of 1988[3]… it's an evil read (Article Seven!)”


	To date, Gaza's Health Ministry has said that more than 61,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, with experts warning that the Palestinian territories under attack could tip into widespread famine soon if food aid is not dramatically increased. 


	Bono said he understands that Hamas doesn't speak for the Palestinian people as a whole, acknowledging their decades of “marginalization, oppression, occupation, and the systematic stealing of the land that is rightfully theirs. Given our own historic experience of oppression and occupation, it's little wonder so many here in Ireland have campaigned for decades for justice for the Palestinian people”; Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap has spoken out loudly and frequently in support of the Palestinian people, drawing a series of festival bans and police investigations over  the past six months for statements they've made on stage.


	“We know Hamas are using starvation as a weapon in the war, but now so too is Israel and I feel revulsion for the moral failure,” Bono continued. “The Government of Israel is not the nation of Israel, but the Government of Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu today deserves our categorical and unequivocal condemnation. There is no justification for the brutality he and his far right government have inflicted on the Palestinian people… in Gaza… in the West Bank. And not just since October 7, well before it too… though the level of depravity and lawlessness we are seeing now feels like uncharted territory.”

	











	Citing a number of instances in which he said the Israeli government has reportedly acknowledged using starvation as a tactic and made their desire to take over the territory plain, the singer wondered how the world had gotten to this point, again. “Is the world not done with this far, far right thinking? We know where it ends… world war… millenarianism,” Bono asked. “Might the world deserve to know where this once promising bright-minded democratic nation is headed unless there is a dramatic change of course? Is what was once an oasis of innovation and free-thinking now in hock to a fundamentalism as blunt as a machete? Are Israelis really ready to let Benjamin Netanyahu do to Israel what its enemies failed to achieve over the last 77 years? And disappear it from membership in a community of nations built around even a flawed decency?”


	A longtime believer in Israel's right to exist, and supporter of a long-sought two-state solution, Bono made clear the band's condemnation of Netanyahu's “immoral actions” and their call for an immediate cease fire. “Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood,” said Bono, who provided a list of article citations in the notes of his message. “We stand in solidarity with the remaining hostages and plead that someone rational negotiate their release.”


	He said the band urges Israelis to demand unfettered access for professionals to help those in need in Gaza and let the correct amount of aid trucks through while pledging to support and donate to the group Medical Aid For Palestinians. 


	Guitarist the Edge also expressed their shock and profound grief at watching the destruction and starvation in Gaza. He posited three questions to Netanyahu: 1) Does he believe that such devastation can happen without “heaping generational shame upon those responsible?” 2) If the end goal is to remove Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank to make way for a “Greater Israel” is that not “ethnic cleansing” or “colonial genocide?” 3) And, if Netanyahu's government rejects a two-state solution, what is their vision for ending the conflict? 

	











	“Simply perpetual conflict? A future of walls, blockades, military occupation?” Edge asked. “A state of permanent inequality? And if this apartheid state transpires don't you destroy the very argument for Israel's existence as a moral response to the horrors of the Holocaust? For if Israel comes to be seen as a state that systematically denies another people their rights, then the world will inevitably ask whether the only just and sustainable future, the only tolerable future, is a shared state — one where Jews and Palestinians live together as equals under the law.”


	Taking the long-running, bloody Troubles in Ireland from the 1960s through the late 1990s as an example of what happens when one side tries to force peace through dominance, Edge said history has taught that “peace is made when people sit down with their opponents — when they recognize the equal dignity of all, even those they once feared or despised. There can be no peace without justice. No reconciliation without recognition.” 


	The message from Clayton echoed the collective feeling that the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza “looks like revenge on a civilian population who are not responsible for Hamas' murderous attack,” warning that if Israel moves forward with colonizing Gaza it will, “permanently undo any possibility of lasting peace or solution for hostilities.” 


	Mullen Jr. wondered what Hamas was thinking when they undertook their bloody incursion, noting that a ground war and aerial bombardment from the militarily superior Israeli forces was a given, though what he described as the “indiscriminate decimation of most homes and hospitals in Gaza, with a majority of those killed being women and children” was not expected. Nor, he writes, was “imposing famine.” 

	











	The Netanyahu government has repeatedly denied that a famine is taking place or that Israel is attempting to starve Palestinians by choking off food aid into the territories — often claiming that, despite scant evidence, Hamas is looting the supplies. Mullen said that it was difficult to comprehend how “any civilized society can think starving children is going to further any cause and be justified as an acceptable response to another horror. To state the obvious, starving innocent civilians as a weapon of war is inhumane and criminal.”


	He wondered where the outrage was from within, and without, Israel about the reported famine, noting that “the power to change this obscenity is in the hands of Israel.”

"We're in a time where the right price can silence the voice of free speech, which we should be very, very conscious of," said Batiste.

	Jon Batiste is speaking out following CBS' decision to end The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in 2026.


	In a new interview with Rolling Stone AU/NZ, the Grammy-winning musician and former Late Show bandleader called the move “a symptom of big money,” warning about the impact of corporate decisions on free speech.


	“We're in a time where the right price can silence the voice of free speech, which we should be very, very conscious of,” said Batiste, who led the show's house band from 2015 to 2022. “As artists, we have to constantly fight for free speech and fight for the ability to be able to share the authentic truth of our being.”

	CBS announced last month that the show would end next year, citing financial reasons. However, the decision has stirred controversy and drawn criticism from several high-profile figures, including Jon Stewart and David Letterman, and prompted speculation about possible political motivations.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Batiste reflected on his seven-year tenure alongside Colbert to the publication, which began when he was in his 20s. “It meant so much to be on national television and learning the ropes of being on a nightly show with a band, and really being on camera and doing that for seven years. And to evolve as an artist in partnership with him,” he said. “I'm very grateful to him and I think where he goes next, his voice won't be silenced.”


	The cancellation of The Late Show comes 10 years after Colbert took it over from prior host David Letterman. CBS has made it clear that it won't be replacing the Daily Show alum with someone new, but is canning the program altogether.

	











	“We are proud that Stephen called CBS home,” the network added in its statement. “He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.”


	Batiste is set to release his new album Big Money later this year.

"We are not experts in the politics of the region, but we want our audience to know where we each stand," the band said in a joint introduction to the individual statements.

International Editor, Digital


	The four members of Irish rock supergroup U2 have weighed in on the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict, with each member — Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. — releasing individual statements. The four statements were shared on U2's official Instagram account and website Sunday, alongside the following joint message: “Everyone has long been horrified by what is unfolding in Gaza — but the blocking of humanitarian aid and now plans for a military takeover of Gaza City has taken the conflict into uncharted territory. We are not experts in the politics of the region, but we want our audience to know where we each stand.”

	Bono, the lead singer of the band and the most politically active member, released the longest of the four statements, nearly 1,250 words, in which he explained that he “generally tried to stay out of the politics of the Middle East,” not out of humility, but “more uncertainty in the face of obvious complexity.” The singer said he felt compelled to speak out about the Nova festival massacre on Oct. 7, an event which he described as “evil,” and which occurred while U2 was performing on stage at the Sphere in Las Vegas. Bono harshly criticized Hamas and its late leader Yahya Sinwar but he devoted much of his opprobrium on the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in particular, and he was at pains to separate the country's political leaders from its people. “We know Hamas are using starvation as a weapon in the war, but now so too is Israel and I feel revulsion for the moral failure,” Bono writes. He adds, that “the Government of Israel is not the nation of Israel, but the Government of Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu today deserves our categorical and unequivocal condemnation.”

	He continues, “Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood. We stand in solidarity with the remaining hostages and plead that someone rational negotiate their release.” Bono ends his statement calling on Israel and the international community to flood Gaza with aid. 


	In his statement, guitarist The Edge also lambasted Netanyahu and posed three questions for Israel's leader, adding that he asked “them in the hope of engaging the conscience and sanity of the people of Israel.” In his first question, The Edge wonders if Netanyahu's considers the impact of the situation on Gaza will have on the reputation of Israel and its people. “Do you not see that the longer this continues, the more Israel risks becoming isolated, mistrusted, and remembered not as a haven from persecution, but as a state that, when provoked, systematically persecuted a neighbouring civilian population?,” he writes. His second question takes Netanyahu's party Likud to task for its end goal in Gaza and the West Bank, and removing Palestinians from both occupied territories. And third, The Edge questions Netanyahu's political vision if he rejects a two-state solution. “Simply perpetual conflict? A future of walls, blockades, military occupation? A state of permanent inequality? And if this apartheid state transpires don't you destroy the very argument for Israel's existence as a moral response to the horrors of the Holocaust?”

	











	Clayton, U2's bassist, kept his statement short and questioned Israel's claims to have a superior technologically savvy army when it has wrought utter devastation in Gaza. “Preserving civilian life is a choice in this war,” Clayton writes. 


	And finally, Mullen, the band's drummer, acknowledged the horrors of Oct. 7 but also was disgusted by the imposition of man-made famine in Gaza by Israel. “To state the obvious, starving innocent civilians as a weapon of war is inhumane and criminal,” Mullen writes. He also lamented the silence over the famine. “Where is the outrage from within Israel, outside of a small, if increasingly vocal, minority? Where is the outrage from the diaspora? Beyond some reluctant and muted acknowledgement of a famine inflicted, nothing. Silence,” Mullen writes.


Bono's full statement:


Apart from the attack on the Nova music festival on October 7th, which felt like it happened while U2 were on stage at Sphere Las Vegas, I have generally tried to stay out of the politics of the Middle East… this was not humility, more uncertainty in the face of obvious complexity… I have over recent months written about the war in Gaza in The Atlantic and spoken about it in The Observer, but I circled the subject.


As a cofounder of the ONE Campaign, which tackles AIDS and extreme poverty in Africa, I felt my experience should be on the catastrophes facing that work and that part of the world. The hemorrhaging of human life in Sudan or Ethiopia hardly makes the news. Sudan alone is beyond comprehension, with a civil war that has left 150,000 dead and 2 million people facing famine.[1]












And that was before the dismantling of USAID in March and gutting of PEPFAR, life-saving programs for the poorest of the poor that ONE has fought for decades to protect… the cuts to which will likely lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children over the next few years.[2]


But but but…there is no hierarchy to such things.


The images of starving children on the Gaza Strip brought me back to a working trip to a food station in Ethiopia my wife Ali and I made 40 years ago next month following U2's participation in Live Aid 1985. Another man-made famine.


To witness chronic malnutrition up close would make it personal for any family, especially as it affects children. Because when the loss of non-combatant life en masse appears so calculated… especially the deaths of children, then ‘evil' is not a hyperbolic adjective… in the sacred text of Jew, Christian, and Muslim it is an evil that must be resisted.


The rape, murder, and abduction of Israelis at the Nova music festival was evil.


On that awful Saturday night/Sunday morning of October 7/8 2023, I wasn't thinking about politics. On stage in the Nevada desert, I just couldn't help but express the pain everyone in the room was feeling and is still feeling for other music lovers and fans like us — hiding under a stage in Kibbutz Re'im then butchered to set a diabolical trap for Israel and to get a war going that might just redraw the map from ‘The river to the sea'… a gamble Hamas' leadership were willing to play with the lives of two million Palestinians… to sow the seeds for a global intifada that U2 had glimpsed at work in Paris during the Bataclan attack in 2015… but only if Israel's leaders fell for this trap that Hamas set for them.












Yahya Sinwar didn't mind if he lost the battle or even the war if he could destroy Israel as a moral as well as an economic force. Over the next months as Israel's revenge for the Hamas attack appeared more and more disproportionate and disinterested in the equally innocent civilian lives in Gaza… I felt as nauseous as everyone, but reminded myself Hamas had deliberately positioned themselves under civilian targets, having tunneled their way from school to mosque to hospital. When did a just war to defend the country turn into an unjust land grab? I hoped Israel would return to reason. I was making excuses for a people seared and shaped by the experience of Holocaust… who understood the threat of extermination is not simply a fear but a fact… I re-read Hamas' charter of 1988[3]… it's an evil read (Article Seven!)


But I also understood that Hamas are not the Palestinian people… a people who have for decades endured and continue to endure marginalization, oppression, occupation, and the systematic stealing of the land that is rightfully theirs. Given our own historic experience of oppression and occupation, it's little wonder so many here in Ireland have campaigned for decades for justice for the Palestinian people.


We know Hamas are using starvation as a weapon in the war, but now so too is Israel and I feel revulsion for the moral failure. The Government of Israel is not the nation of Israel, but the Government of Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu today deserves our categorical and unequivocal condemnation. There is no justification for the brutality he and his far right government have inflicted on the Palestinian people… in Gaza… in the West Bank. And not just since October 7, well before it too… though the level of depravity and lawlessness we are seeing now feels like uncharted territory.












Curiously those who say these reports are not true are not demanding access for journalists and seem deaf to the revealing rhetoric. Examples that sharpen my pen include: Israel's Heritage Minister claiming that the government is racing to wipe out Gaza[4]… his Defense Minister and Security Minister arguing no aid should be let into the territory.[5],[6] “Not one grain of wheat.”[7] And now Netanyahu announces[8] a military takeover of Gaza City… which most informed commentators understand as a euphemism for the colonization of Gaza. We know the rest of the Gaza Strip… and the West Bank are next. What century are we in?


Is the world not done with this far, far right thinking? We know where it ends… world war… millenarianism… Might the world deserve to know where this once promising bright-minded democratic nation is headed unless there is a dramatic change of course? Is what was once an oasis of innovation and free-thinking now in hock to a fundamentalism as blunt as a machete? Are Israelis really ready to let Benjamin Netanyahu do to Israel what its enemies failed to achieve over the last 77 years? And disappear it from membership in a community of nations built around even a flawed decency?


As someone who has long believed in Israel's right to exist and supported a two-state solution, I want to make clear to anyone who cares to listen our band's condemnation of Netanyahu's immoral actions and join all who have called for a cessation of hostilities on both sides.












If not Irish voices, please please please stop and listen to Jewish ones – from the high mindedness of Rabbi Sharon Brous, to the tearful comedy of the Grody-Patinkin family – who fear the damage to Judaism, as well as Israel's neighbours. Listen to the more than 100,000 Israelis who this week in Tel Aviv protested for an end to the war.


Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood. We stand in solidarity with the remaining hostages and plead that someone rational negotiate their release. Could it be Marwan Barghouthi who the former head of Mossad Efraim Halevy described as “probably the most sane and the most qualified person” to lead the Palestinians?[9]


Wiser heads than mine will have a view, but surely the hostages deserve a different approach — and quick.


We urge more good people in Israel to demand unfettered access by professionals to deliver the critical care needed throughout Gaza and the West Bank that they best know how to distribute… and to let the correct number of trucks through. It will take more than 100 trucks a day to take seriously the need – more like 600[10] – but the flooding of humanitarian aid will also undercut the black marketing that has been happening to benefit Hamas.


The band is pledged to contribute our support by donating to Medical Aid For Palestinians.

The Edge's full statement: 












We are all deeply shocked and profoundly grieved by the suffering unfolding in Gaza. What we are witnessing is not a distant tragedy—it is a test of our shared humanity.


I have three questions for Prime Minister Netanyahu. I ask them in the hope of engaging the conscience and sanity of the people of Israel.


First: Do you truly believe that such devastation—inflicted so intentionally and relentlessly on a civilian population—can happen without heaping generational shame upon those responsible? Do you not see that the longer this continues, the more Israel risks becoming isolated, mistrusted, and remembered not as a haven from persecution, but as a state that, when provoked, systematically persecuted a neighbouring civilian population?


Second: If the end goal is, as the Likud platform suggests, the removal of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank to make way for a “Greater Israel,” then that is not peace—it is dispossession; it is ethnic cleansing, and, according to many legal scholars, colonial genocide. It is an injustice on a massive scale. And injustice, as we learned in Ireland, is never the path to security: it breeds resentment, it hardens hearts, and it guarantees that future generations will inherit conflict rather than peace. The oppressed do not forget. How can this course of action possibly make your people safer?


Third: If you reject the two-state solution—as your government now openly does—then what is your political vision? Simply perpetual conflict? A future of walls, blockades, military occupation? A state of permanent inequality? And if this apartheid state transpires don't you destroy the very argument for Israel's existence as a moral response to the horrors of the Holocaust? For if Israel comes to be seen as a state that systematically denies another people their rights, then the world will inevitably ask whether the only just and sustainable future, the only tolerable future, is a shared state—one where Jews and Palestinians live together as equals under the law.












We know from our own experience in Ireland that peace is not made through dominance. Peace is made when people sit down with their opponents—when they recognise the equal dignity of all, even those they once feared or despised.


There can be no peace without justice. No reconciliation without recognition. And no future unless we refuse to let the past be repeated.


The road to peace is difficult. But it is never too late, or too early, to begin walking it.


-The Edge


Adam Clayton's full statement: 


The humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by Israel's aid blockade and bombing looks like revenge on a civilian population who are not responsible for Hamas' murderous attack on October 7. If Israel moves to colonise the Gaza Strip, it will permanently undo any possibility of lasting peace or solution for hostilities. Forgetting the morality of the situation for a moment, doesn't the technical superiority of Israel's modern army make a boast of its precision targeting of individuals from thousands of miles away? And if so why are the IDF bombarding a civilian population from the skies indiscriminately destroying any bit of shelter and infrastructure?


Preserving civilian life is a choice in this war.


-Adam


Larry Mullen Jr.'s full statement: 


The images of the Hamas-led massacre of Israelis on October 7th and in particular the footage of innocent music fans being slaughtered, beaten and abused at the Nova Music Festival were harrowing to watch. Nothing was achieved except more misery for the region at the hands of Hamas and its allies.












So what did Hamas expect would happen when they committed mass murder and took the hostages?


Israel's response was expected.


After those attacks the total obliteration of Hamas was called for by Israel and its allies and was expected.


A ground war was expected.


Aerial bombardment and destruction were expected .


The indiscriminate decimation of most homes and hospitals in Gaza, with a majority of those killed being women and children, was not expected.


Imposing famine was not expected.


It's difficult to comprehend how any civilised society can think starving children is going to further any cause and be justified as an acceptable response to another horror. To state the obvious, starving innocent civilians as a weapon of war is inhumane and criminal.


Where is the outrage from within Israel, outside of a small, if increasingly vocal, minority?


Where is the outrage from the diaspora?


Beyond some reluctant and muted acknowledgement of a famine inflicted, nothing.


Silence.


The power to change this obscenity is in the hands of Israel


I undoubtedly support Israel's right to exist and I also believe Palestinians deserve the same right and a state of their own.


Silence serves none of us.


-Larry

Bobby Whitlock, the singer-keyboardist and co-founder of 1970s blues-rock band Derek & the Dominos alongside Eric Clapton, has died, according to his manager, Carol Kaye. In a statement to Variety, Kaye shared that Whitlock died earlier this morning following a cancer diagnosis. He was 77.

Born in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 18, 1948, Robert Stanley Whitlock gravitated toward music at a young age, both as a fan and a student interested in learning the keyboard and organ. As a teenager, Whitlock started befriending artists in the Stax Records orbit, including Booker T. & the M.G.'s, the Staples Singers, Albert King, and others, eventually weaseling his way into their circuit by way of that respectful admiration. After he earned his first proper recording credit performing handclaps on Sam & Dave's single “I Thank You,” he signed to Stax—making him the first white artist to join the label's roster—and played organ regularly around the local scene, in part with the soul bands Short Cuts and the Counts.

Though Stax mentor Steve Cropper took him under his wing and Donald “Duck” Dunn and Don Nix were planning to produce a pop album by him, Whitlock decided to leave Memphis to pursue music with the rock and soul duo Delaney & Bonnie. He played keys and contributed additional vocals on their two 1969 albums, Home and Accept No Substitute. While touring with the duo, Whitlock met numerous musicians that he would collaborate with later on in his career, like Bobby Keys and Jim Price, as well as future Derek & the Dominos members Carl Radle and Jim Gordon. When Delaney & Bonnie opened for Clapton's supergroup Blind Faith, Whitlock and Clapton crossed paths for the first time. (Looking back on that leg, Clapton would describe Whitlock as “the most energetic sideman I had ever seen.”)

Once Delaney & Bonnie dropped their live album On Tour with Eric Clapton in 1970, Whitlock was eager to test his skills in a new band. He reunited with Clapton, Radle, and Gordon for a quick session before getting an invite to join Clapton on his debut solo album, Eric Clapton, and to accompany George Harrison in the studio as he recorded All Things Must Pass, the late guitarist's third solo album and first following the Beatles' breakup. Whitlock contributed heavily to that Billboard No. 1 album, playing organ, piano, harmonium, tubular bells, and backing vocals on most tracks, including the hits “My Sweet Lord” and “What Is Life.”

Upon regrouping, the four musicians started Derek & the Dominos as a blues-rock group focused on forming ideas at a natural pace and reveling in their relaxed friendship. After welcoming guitarist Dave Mason and coming up with their new band name, a rushed idea-turned-bungled onstage introduction, Derek & the Dominos played their first show and then entered the studio in June 1970 to record the singles “Tell the Truth” and “Roll It Over” with Phil Spector. That autumn, after Mason's departure, they hit up producer Tom Dowd to track their debut full-length: the 1970 double album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.

Together, Whitlock and Clapton wrote effortlessly romantic blues-rock hits like “Bell Bottom Blues” and “Layla,” the latter a seven-minute sprawler that, belatedly, became a staple of classic rock radio and a highlight of Clapton's career overall. They recorded only one studio LP together, but it's since considered to be a classic of the genre for its songwriting and performances—including one from the Allman Brothers Band's Duane Allman, who brought extensive contributions on lead and slide guitar, although he was not technically a member of the band. Halfway through writing their second album, Derek & the Dominos dissolved in a fit of tension and depression following the death of numerous friends in the months prior; Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident, and Jimi Hendrix died suddenly in his girlfriend's apartment.

Whitlock's songwriting ideas continued to flow freely, and he returned to the studio to start his own solo career. He released his self-titled debut studio album in 1972 and followed it with Raw Velvet later that same year. He went on to record four more solo albums, a few live LPs, and a handful of collaborative full-lengths with his partner Coco Carmel. Whitlock also steadily contributed to other artists' records, including Dr John's The Sun, Moon & Herbs, Clapton's The History of Eric Clapton, and Manassas' Down the Road. Whitlock also famously appeared, uncredited, on the Rolling Stones' essential 1972 album, Exile on Main St.

In 2024, Whitlock was awarded a Brass Music Note on Memphis' own Beale Street Walk of Fame for his work. “My business is to try to conduct myself as a decent person and a gentleman as much as I can, get through this world, navigate through this without making too many waves. But when you make them, make them big—ones to remember,” Whitlock told local outlet Everything Knoxville. “I know the role that I've been playing in everyone's music that I was a part of. Because my addition made that music mine as well—whether it's a Jeff Healy record or whatever. I put my stamp on it.”

Jennifer Lopez handled an unexpected onstage visitor like a total pro. While performing during her Up All Night: Live in 2025 tour stop in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on Aug. 10, the 56-year-old superstar kept singing even as a large cricket crawled up her dress & onto her neck, before tossing it aside with a laugh.

A post shared by On The JLo (@onthejlo)

The former “American Idol” judge, 56, was in the middle of her Up All Night: Live in 2025 tour stop in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on Aug. 10 when a large cricket crawled up her dress in full view of the crowd.

While singing in front of a microphone, the insect made its way up her torso & onto her neck. Without missing a note, Lopez calmly grabbed the cricket & tossed it to the side of the stage.

“It was tickling me,” she laughed, telling fans before jumping right back into her performance.

In a video shared by Lopez's official fan account, the lighthearted caption read: “Plot twist: @JLo just started rehearsals for Kiss of the Cricket Woman … on stage … in real time. 😂💋🦗.”

The reference was a playful nod to her upcoming film “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” set to premiere this fall.

A fan wrote: “She is just the best! 🩷✨ really fun moment but so professional at the same time! 🦗✨” 

Another fan praised JLo and shared: “This is Hilarious OMG 😂hahahah love her” Third one chimed in and wrote: “My Brave Woman !Stay Blessed❤️”

The cricket cameo wasn't Lopez's only headline-making onstage moment this summer. On July 25, during her show in Warsaw, Poland, she experienced a wardrobe malfunction when her glittery skirt unexpectedly snapped off & fell to the floor.

Smiling & strutting around the stage in her underwear, Lopez laughed it off: “I'm out here in my underwear. That's gonna be everywhere.”

She later joked, “I'm glad they reinforced that costume. And I'm glad I had underwear on. I don't usually wear underwear.”

The lighthearted stage moments haven't slowed Lopez's tour momentum. Her Up All Night: Live in 2025 shows have been packed with high-energy performances & fan-favorite hits.

Later this year, she will star in “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” a new film adaptation of the 1993 Broadway classic, proving that whether on stage or screen, J.Lo knows how to keep audiences talking.

The existence of UFOs has long been an ongoing debate and marked with scepticism, but you may want to hear what this whistleblower has to claim about the US government's knowledge regarding this phenomenon.

A recent Capitol Hill hearing is what has rekindled talks around Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the potential of extraterrestrial life.

In the UAP briefing in May, physicist Dr Eric Davis - who is well known for working on top-secret Pentagon projects - captured listeners' attention by claiming there are four different types of aliens that have a possibility of being operators of unidentified crafts.

The four distinct alien types he claims are 'Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians'.

Advert

So, what are the distinct differences between each of these claimed alien types? I'm glad you asked.

The idea of Grays took popularity in the mid-1960s, mainly due to the famous abduction case of Betty and Barney Hill. The couple said the abduction was performed by small humanoids with smooth grey skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and had a lack of typical human features like noses or ears.

Nordics, on the other hand, are described as tall, slender beings, similar to Scandinavian humans, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and light skin.

Advert

Insectoids, as the name suggests, are described as having more insect-like traits like multiple limbs, exoskeletons, mandibles, and sometimes antennae.

Lastly, the Reptilian theory - this was popular in the late 20th century through conspiracy theorist David Icke and claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens.

Missouri Representative Eric Burlison, a member of the House Oversight Committee and UAP caucus, shared on The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher that he had heard these same four classifications in private discussions.

“I've heard those four classifications discussed in meetings in this office by others,” Burlison said. “But what I wasn't expecting was for him to say it. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that.”

Advert

However, a self-claimed sceptic, Burlison admitted that he was uncertain about Davis' sources.

He noted that the physicist's comments may come from firsthand knowledge or secondhand reports, indicating uncertainty, saying: "If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment. But if it is true, the government has no right to keep such a secret from the public it serves."

However, he is aware that the acknowledgement of there being a possibility of aliens could invite more scepticism.

Advert

"Some will think we're nuts," Burlison acknowledged. But he defended the investigation, stating that taxpayers help to fund Pentagon, intelligence, and energy department programs studying UAPs.

"I owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this," he said.

He noted that the physicist's comments may come from firsthand knowledge or secondhand reports, indicating uncertainty, saying: "If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment. But if it is true, the government has no right to keep such a secret from the public it serves."

However, he is aware that the acknowledgement of there being a possibility of aliens could invite more scepticism.

"Some will think we're nuts," Burlison acknowledged. But he defended the investigation, stating that taxpayers help to fund Pentagon, intelligence, and energy department programs studying UAPs.

"I owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this," he said.

The existence of UFOs has long been an ongoing debate and marked with scepticism, but you may want to hear what this whistleblower has to claim about the US government's knowledge regarding this phenomenon.

A recent Capitol Hill hearing is what has rekindled talks around Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the potential of extraterrestrial life.

In the UAP briefing in May, physicist Dr Eric Davis - who is well known for working on top-secret Pentagon projects - captured listeners' attention by claiming there are four different types of aliens that have a possibility of being operators of unidentified crafts.

The four distinct alien types he claims are 'Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians'.

So, what are the distinct differences between each of these claimed alien types? I'm glad you asked.

The idea of Grays took popularity in the mid-1960s, mainly due to the famous abduction case of Betty and Barney Hill. The couple said the abduction was performed by small humanoids with smooth grey skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and had a lack of typical human features like noses or ears.

Nordics, on the other hand, are described as tall, slender beings, similar to Scandinavian humans, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and light skin.

Insectoids, as the name suggests, are described as having more insect-like traits like multiple limbs, exoskeletons, mandibles, and sometimes antennae.

Lastly, the Reptilian theory - this was popular in the late 20th century through conspiracy theorist David Icke and claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens.

Missouri Representative Eric Burlison, a member of the House Oversight Committee and UAP caucus, shared on The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher that he had heard these same four classifications in private discussions.

“I've heard those four classifications discussed in meetings in this office by others,” Burlison said. “But what I wasn't expecting was for him to say it. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that.”

However, a self-claimed sceptic, Burlison admitted that he was uncertain about Davis' sources.

He noted that the physicist's comments may come from firsthand knowledge or secondhand reports, indicating uncertainty, saying: "If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment. But if it is true, the government has no right to keep such a secret from the public it serves."

However, he is aware that the acknowledgement of there being a possibility of aliens could invite more scepticism.

"Some will think we're nuts," Burlison acknowledged. But he defended the investigation, stating that taxpayers help to fund Pentagon, intelligence, and energy department programs studying UAPs.

"I owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this," he said.

A24 has come out on top of a competitive bidding war for The Undertone, securing worldwide rights to the debut feature from Toronto-based writer/director Ian Tuason.

Per Deadline, who reported the news earlier today, a deal was made for 7 figures with A24 beating six other buyers to the hot horror title that's been recommended for fans of Skinamarink and I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives In The House.

Starring Nina Kiri (The Handmaid's Tale),The Undertone follows Evy, a paranormal podcast host who returns home to care for her dying mother. Thereafter, she begins receiving recordings from a married couple plagued by strange noises in their house, pulling her into a spiral of fear and paranoia.

The Undertone had its premiere at Fantasia Film Festival earlier this year, where programming director Carolyn Mauricette called it a “slow-burn nightmare that will make hackles on your neck rise and your blood chill.”

Per Deadline, The Undertone was produced by Dan Slater for Slaterverse Pictures and Cody Calahan for Black Fawn Films. Exec producers include Steven Schneider and Roy Lee (It, Weapons) for Spooky Pictures, Chad Archibald for Black Fawn Films, Brit MacRae and Daril Fannin for Kino Studios, and DimensionGate.

Look out for more on The Undertone as we get it!

Timothy Gallaudet—former Chief Oceanographer of the U.S. Navy—believes the U.S. government should study “unidentified submersible objects.”

USOs are similar to UFOs, but sighted in the world's oceans.

The retired rear admiral claims that these USOs could be a threat to maritime security.

A retired U.S. Navy admiral believes that the government should look to the oceans to help solve a mystery in the skies. Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, former Oceanographer of the U.S. Navy, cited a 2019 sighting by a Navy warship as evidence that the phenomena of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified submersible objects (USOs) are linked.

The sighting, recorded off the coast of San Diego, involved a hovering spherical object that appeared to abruptly enter the water.

Gallaudet made the case for studying underwater UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), in a recent paper titled, “Beneath the Surface: We May Learn More about UAP by Looking in the Ocean.” Gallaudet writes that “transmedium” USOs and UAPs, defined as unidentified objects that appear to travel both in the atmosphere and the water, “jeopardize U.S. maritime security.” The retired rear admiral makes the case that the under-surveyed underwater realm is a threat to maritime security—the oceans form the bedrock of international trade and the American economy, and are where the U.S. Navy operates.

Gallaudet argues that the lack of knowledge about the undersea world poses hazards for submarines such as collisions with other submarines—such as the independent crashes of the submarines USS San Francisco and USS Connecticut, both of which were incidents that resulted in severe damage to the ships and one crew fatality—and undetected underwater seamounts. Further study of this realm, he believes, could shed additional light on these UFO/UAP sightings.

One incident to which Gallaudet points in particular is a July 19, 2019 encounter between the Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Omaha and a so-called transmedium UAP. In the incident, the crew of the Omaha (sailing off the coast of San Diego) used their AN/KAX-2 electro-optical sensor to record a spherical UAP hovering just over the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The AN/KAX-2 is a stabilized sensor turret built for maritime environments that includes a digital video camera, night vision camera, and laser rangefinder.

The video, seen here, is a recording of a screen showing the output of the AN/KAX-2. The video appears to have been taken with the night vision camera, which uses imaging infrared to record objects in darkness. The object seemingly moves, tracked by the sensor operator, and then stops to hover. The object stops and hovers a short distance above the surface of the ocean. At the end, the object disappears, with sailors remarking that it made a splash as it entered the water. Meanwhile, one sailor off camera radios the other ships in the area—the guided missile destroyers Pinckney, Kidd, and Rafael Peralta—asking for a MH-60 helicopter to be launched as soon as possible. 

The video was leaked to UFO investigator Jeremy Corbell Lockyer, and was later verified as genuine by the Navy. A search of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (the Pentagon's web site for releasing official photos and video) shows three of the warships in the encounter—Pinckney, Kidd, and Omaha—in formation in the Eastern Pacific six days later, on July 25.

Gallaudet also references another sighting from 2013, spotted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol personnel. The sighting—which took place near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico—was filmed using a similar imaging infrared camera. The video, shown here, depicts another spherical object appearing to enter the water and then re-emerge without losing any speed. The retired admiral writes, “Over three minutes, the object appears to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 miles per hour, enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum underwater velocity of 95 miles per hour, and at one point split into two parts before entering the water again.”

Other possible evidence cited by the admiral includes an incident in 2022, in which the NOAA underwater exploration ship Okeanos Explorer discovered an unusual series of holes on the North Atlantic seafloor at a depth of 1.6 miles. The centimeter-sized holes were in an unusually straight line and scientists are apparently at a loss to explain their origin.

Gallaudet entered the U.S. Navy in 1989 after attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Gallaudet, according to his official biography, received “masters and doctoral degrees in oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1991 and 2001 respectively.” He served with a number of naval oceanography and meteorology commands, and was superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory. He assumed command of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command in 2014, and served as Oceanographer of the Navy from 2016 until retirement in 2017.

After his Navy career, Gallaudet served for two years as acting administrator in charge of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Today, he sits on the advisory board for Americans for Safe Aerospace, which describes itself as a “nonprofit organization dedicated to aerospace safety and national security with a focus on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).” ASA is led by Ryan Graves, a former U.S. naval aviator who reports having his own UAP sighting on active duty in 2014. In a 2023 op-ed published in The Hill, Gallaudet called UAPs the “story of the century,” and clearly did not rule out an extraterrestrial cause for them.

It's rare for a high-ranking U.S. military officer to directly address UAP issues, even in retirement, and the incidents Gallaudet calls attention to are unusual, to say the least. Barring flat-out hoaxing by military and civilian government personnel, the videos and photographic evidence are not easily explained. Whether this will result in greater research to the same extent as the UFO/UAP issue remains to be seen.

TV series Alien: Earth captures “the aesthetic” of Sir Ridley Scott's original film, an executive producer has said. The sci-fi drama, from Emmy-winning producer Noah Hawley, is based on the acclaimed franchise, which began with Sir Ridley's 1979 film starring Sigourney Weaver as warrant off…

It's one thing to be hired to portray a new lifeform. It's quite another to play it.

“In my head, I think I've created the rules: ‘This is who I am,'” says actress Sydney Chandler. “And then you get to (the) set and it's all different. Everything changes. You realize your job is to show up and be as open and free and present as possible and roll with whatever anyone else is throwing your way.”

That's the world of “Alien: Earth,” an eight-part series that expands what Ridley Scott created with the film, “Alien,” some 46 years ago.

Sydney Chandler stars as Wendy in "Alien: Earth," a new FX series. 

In it, Chandler plays a humanoid robot with human consciousness, two years before the events of “Alien.” She's an advancement in the race for immortality and part of a group who discovers mysterious life forms that could be threatening.

Humans, cyborgs and synths are like toys, manipulated by five corporations living in “Alien: Earth.” Xenomorphs, an extraterrestrial species that hunts humans (and figured into the films) are here, too.

Chandler, the daughter of actor Kyle Chandler, says she saw the film “Alien” at a young age “and the Xenomorph visited me in my nightmares many a time. It was a full-circle moment to be chased by a real Xeno instead of just dreaming about it.”

Filmed in Thailand, the series brought actors into a lush world bursting with humidity and other natural phenomena. Toss in those creatures and it was very much the “wild, wild west” of filmmaking, Chandler says.

She and other actors — including Alex Lawther, who plays her brother — talked about the possibility of something like “Alien: Earth” occurring.

“Tomorrow some development might be made that changes how we figured it out today,” she says. Playing out new scenarios “would be really, really, really fun, especially because I have no idea where (creator Noah Hawley) would take it. You can't guess where Noah's imagination will go. There's so much to explore and such a massive ensemble.”





In addition to Chandler and Lawther, the cast includes Timothy Olyphant, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay and others playing different chess pieces in the game of lifeforms.

Those big sets, Lawther says, make it feel like a world has been built. Populate it with unknown creatures and “it's scary in a sense.”

Hawley says that was necessary to be able to sustain eight episodes or more.

“There's this discovery process that, after seven movies, we can't get back,” he says. “But if I introduce new creatures and you don't know how they reproduce or what they eat, then you feel that dread every time they're on screen. Or they're not visible but you know they're out there because you're not sure what's going to happen next. For me, it was just function over form. What function do they provide in the story? And then I just tried to gross myself out as much as possible as I went through the process.”

Chandler says she and Lawther didn't meet until they got to Thailand but “the relationship was really natural. Alex made me feel so comfortable and safe and able to play and try new things … and take a breath.”

The setting, Lawther adds, did bond members of the cast. “I think, for most of us, it was our first time in Thailand. We were there for longer than six months,” he says. “There's a lot of sweat in the show but I'm sure a good 50 percent of that has to do with the 90% humidity of Thailand's climate.”

The bonds, Chandler says, “forged very quickly.” The Thai crew helped make the atmosphere attractive. “I've never seen such hard-working, kind, funny, warm people.”

Some 650 cast and crew worked on the set every day. “Everyone worked at 110% capacity,” Chandler says. “It's such a game of endurance. I felt like I was able to go to the most exquisite acting class in the coolest rooms every day … and everyone was boots on the ground.”

Now it's a matter of seeing how audiences will receive “Alien: Earth.” If there's a second season, Chandler says, she's game. “I want to see everyone else's storylines follow through.”

    "I think a lot of it had to do with management."

Throughout rock history, quite a few rock bands have become massive in England but never truly obtained the same level of fame and success Stateside. For some reason, quite a few of these "close but no cigar" artists emerged in the '70s: T. Rex, Slade, Status Quo, Thin Lizzy, and certainly UFO.

For much of the decade, UFO featured the great Michael Schenker shredding on his Flying V, and was an era that gave us such rock anthems as "Lights Out," "Rock Bottom," and "Doctor Doctor," as well as what is largely considered to be one of the greatest live rock recordings of all-time, 1979's "Strangers in the Night."

During an interview with Talk Louder Podcast, longtime UFO drummer Andy Parker was a guest, and was willing to share his thoughts concerning why the band came oh so close to breaking through in the US market. But ultimately, failed to do so.

"We were so close," Parker admitted (transcribed by Ultimate Guitar). "'Lights Out' did really well, and 'No Place to Run' did well. But it just never quite…and whether it was Michael leaving, I think a lot of it had to do with management."

Parker further explained that, additionally, things that were out of their hands ultimately proved to be a disadvantage to UFOs, particularly from the business side of things.

"And also, towards the end, the record company was moving in a different direction. They were really good. They stuck with us for a long, long time. But they're a business, they go, 'Y'know, I wish there was more Blondie and Spandau Ballet,' than Jethro Tull and UFO and Ten Years After and stuff."

"Things change. But they're still behind [UFO], they've gradually gone through that catalog, and they're already planning 'The Wild, the Willing' remaster."

As Parker just mentioned, Chrysalis is doing a splendid job expanding and reissuing UFO's classic albums, as evidenced by the recent double CD and triple vinyl release of their 1980 "No Place to Run," which was their first offering post-Schenker.

"I've already been contacted about 'The Wild, the Willing' [as the next reissue], so I know that one's coming," Parker said. "And I have no reason to believe they won't do the others. Chrysalis owned, basically, anything we recorded, so they've got all this stuff. And I'm amazed, it's actually held up. It's tape, for God's sake."

A recent discussion on Capitol Hill has brought new attention to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the idea of life from other worlds. In a May briefing about UAPs, physicist Dr. Eric Davis surprised people by talking about possible alien types. Davis, who has worked on secret Pentagon projects, mentioned "Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians" as beings that might be piloting unidentified flying objects or UFOs. He said these figures are human-like in shape and size, and could be part of hidden programs to study captured tech.

Missouri Rep. Eric Burlison, part of the House Oversight Committee and a UAP group, started the talk. On the podcast "The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher" last week, he shared that he had heard these same four types in closed-door meetings."

I've heard those four classifications discussed in meetings in this office by others," Burlison said. "But what I wasn't expecting was for him to say it. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that."

Burlison calls himself a doubter and is not sure where Davis got his info — maybe from direct experience or just stories from others. "If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment," Burlison said. "But if it is true, the government has no right to keep such a secret from the public it serves."

The idea of Grays became well-known in the 1960s after the Betty and Barney Hill case, where the couple claimed small gray-skinned beings with big black eyes took them, per Daily Mail. Nordics are seen as tall, slim people like Scandinavians, with light hair and skin, often tied to old UFO stories from the 1950s. Insectoids, with bug-like features such as extra arms and hard shells, date back to early 1900s tales and even a 1902 movie. Reptilians gained fame through conspiracy ideas in the late 1900s, claiming lizard-like shape-shifters rule Earth, with links to ancient Asian myths.

Even though Davis listed these in the briefing, Burlison thinks UAPs are more likely advanced tech made by humans, perhaps from private companies. He pointed to progress in science like finding the Higgs Boson and quantum studies, wondering why no one has built better engines yet. Some people criticise the hearings as silly, with talk of reptilians and insectoids sounding like fantasy. But Burlinson stands by the work, since public money pays for UAP studies by the Pentagon and other agencies. "I owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this," he said.

Burlison thinks people could deal with proof of aliens. "Most would just read the headline and move on," he predicted. Still, he says the truth must come out. "The government belongs to the people, not the other way around," Burlison stressed adding that "Keeping such monumental secrets would betray the trust of the public."
