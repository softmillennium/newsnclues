Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from some semiconductor sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Kevin O'Leary tells CNN's John Berman that the deal keeps the country tied to American technology, even if the arrangement feels like “funky chicken” and “a form of blackmail.”

            A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury materials from the Ghislaine Maxwell sex trafficking case.
    


            The Justice Department has sought to release grand jury testimony and exhibits from cases involving Jeffrey Epstein in New York.
    


            Judge Paul Engelmayer issued a scathing opinion, saying unsealing the materials in Maxwell's case is not a matter of historical or public interest and calling the premise of the DOJ's argument false.
    


            “The Court therefore denies the Government's motion to unseal at the threshold. Contrary to the Government's depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a matter of significant historical or public interest. Far from it,” Engelmayer wrote.
    


            “Its entire premise – that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them – is demonstrably false,” Engelmayer said.
    


The latest on Trump's presidency as he's expected to hold news conference



            The judge also pointed to the fact that much of the grand jury material that the DOJ is seeking has already been public and was presented during Maxwell's trial in 2021.
    


            “It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two law enforcement agents. And the information it contains is already almost entirely a matter of longstanding public record, principally as a result of live testimony by percipient witnesses at the 2021 Maxwell trial,” Engelmayer wrote.
    


            Engelmayer went into great detail in his ruling about the evidence that was introduced during Maxwell's trial, making a point that the government was not familiar with it.
    


            “It established that Maxwell had been instrumental in an approximately decade-long scheme with Epstein to entice, groom, transport, and traffic numerous young women and underage girls to engage in sexual activity with Epstein,” Engelmayer wrote.
    


            The judge continued to pay particular attention to the government's lack of familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, “because a number of details that it identified as non-public in fact had been testified to during the trial.”
    


            “A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do notcontribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion – aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such.”
    


            Engelmayer wrote in his ruling that any person looking to review the grand jury materials the government has requested to learn new information regarding Epstein and Maxwell's crimes, “would come away feeling disappointed and misled.”
    


            Several victims, who remained anonymous, submitted letters to the court on their opinion as to whether grand jury materials should be unsealed. Many victims were not opposed to the release of grand jury materials, but they said there would need to be heavy redactions to protect their identities. Some victims cited the “political warfare” that they were being used for and the lack of respect the administration had shown towards victims.
    


            Engelmayer highlighted that the only reason victims were not more opposed to the unsealing of grand jury transcripts was that they had been misled that the materials would reveal new information.
    


            “The victims' interest in reviewing the grand jury materials appears to be premised on the understandable but mistaken belief that these materials would reveal new information,” Engelmayer said.
    


            On Friday, the Justice Department had asked both the judges overseeing its requests in Maxwell and Epstein's cases to refrain from ruling on sealing grand jury materials until August 14. DOJ explained to the court that it notified victims in the case to the extent their names appeared in transcripts and exhibits and wanted time for the victims to receive the notice.
    


            The release of grand jury transcripts in Maxwell and Epstein's cases has been the subject of ongoing battle between the Justice Department and the courts. The government asked the court to unseal grand jury materials on July 18 after mounting pressure from Trump's political base, Democrats and the public for the administration to release the Epstein files.
    


CNN previously reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi notified Trump in May that his name appeared several times in the Epstein files.
    


            Judge Richard Berman, who is overseeing the request for grand jury transcripts and exhibits in Epstein's case, has not ruled on the motion yet.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.

At least five Al Jazeera staff members have been killed in an Israeli airstrike on a journalist camp in Gaza. Among the victims was Anas al-Sharif, a well-known correspondent who has been recognized for his reporting on the local humanitarian crisis. 

The attack occurred on Sunday evening, when the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) struck a tent outside the main gate of Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. The Qatar-based media outlet immediately confirmed that four of its journalists - al-Sharif, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, and Mohammed Noufal - had been found dead. It later added that cameraman Moamen Aliwa was also among the victims, along with two others, bringing the death toll to seven.

Al-Sharif's last post on X featured a video of Israeli strikes hitting Gaza City. Posted moments before he was killed, the missive described the “relentless bombardment” by Israeli warplanes.

Hani Mahmoud, an Al Jazeera reporter who was just a block away at the time, heard a massive explosion near Al-Shifa Hospital. 

“I saw the sky light up, and soon after, news spread that it was the journalist camp at the hospital's main gate,” he wrote, adding that the drone strike hit after things had “quieted down” and journalists had gathered in one place.

The director of Al-Shifa Hospital told Al Jazeera that the IDF is likely to have targeted the tent directly.

Israel's military acknowledged it had targeted al-Sharif, claiming he was the head of a Hamas “terrorist cell” operating under the guise of a reporter.

Al Jazeera denied these allegations, describing them as part of a “campaign of incitement” against its journalists. 

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) condemned the attack, stating that Israel provided “no evidence” to support its claims that al-Sharif was a Hamas member. 

“This is part of a pattern that we have seen from Israel... going back decades in which it kills journalists,” CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg has said. 

Since Israel's war on Hamas began in October 2023, at least 237 journalists have been killed, according to the Government Media Office in Gaza, with Al Jazeera alone losing 10 staff members.

US President Donald Trump has directed White House staff to move portraits of three former presidents, including Barack Obama, to a staircase where visitors cannot see them, CNN reported on Sunday, citing two sources familiar with the matter.

The reported move comes weeks after Washington began declassifying documents alleging that top officials under then-President Obama worked with intelligence agency heads to support unsubstantiated claims that  Russia colluded with Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

Two of Trump's other predecessors were also targeted: 43rd president George W. Bush and his father George H. W. Bush, whose term started in 1989 after he served as vice president during the Ronald Reagan administration. All three portraits were moved to the top of the Grand Staircase, where they will remain out of view of visitors touring the White House, the sources told CNN.

Trump had reportedly feuded with both Bushes for years. The elder Bush, a fellow Republican who passed away in 2018, called the US president a “blowhard” in his biography and supported Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.

George W. Bush, whom Trump has described as a “failed and uninspiring” president, and his wife Laura Bush attended the 2025 inauguration but skipped the luncheon afterward.

The sources also told CNN that Trump is often involved in aesthetic changes of any scale at the White House. The Obama portrait has been relocated before. Earlier this year, it was shifted to a different spot in the White House's Grand Foyer and replaced with a painting depicting a dramatic scene of Trump surviving an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania.

There is no legal requirement regarding how portraits of former presidents must be displayed in the White House, but tradition, overseen by the White House Historical Association and the White House curator, generally gives the most prominent placement to the most recent presidents, making them visible to guests during official events and public tours.

Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has described Ukraine as “grass being trampled by elephants” as he warned Kiev that it will suffer for being part of the West's “unsuccessful strategy to weaken Russia.”

Last week, US President Donald Trump announced that he will meet his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in Alaska on August 15 to discuss the possible settlement of the conflict between Moscow and Kiev. Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky has not been invited to the talks.

Fico said in a video message on Facebook on Saturday that he is closely following the “fuss” surrounding the summit, while expressing hope that the Russian and US leaders can find “a meaningful solution” to the crisis.

However, Fico, who survived an assassination attempt by a pro-Ukraine activist last year over his opposition to arming Zelensky's government, claimed that Kiev will nonetheless “pay dearly for the unsuccessful strategy of the West to weaken Russia by supporting the war in Ukraine.”

“Do you remember the old African proverb that I love so much? Would you like me to repeat it? It does not matter if the elephants are fighting or having sex, the grass always suffers. No matter how the meeting of the elephants on August 15 turns out, the grass will suffer – in this case, it is Ukraine,” he said.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry reacted to Fico's comments on Sunday, accusing him of resorting to “openly offensive rhetoric towards Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, who are fighting… in the interests of the security of the whole of Europe.”

The Slovak leader responded in another Facebook post a few hours later, insisting that he has the right to say what he thinks.

Fico dismissed Kiev's accusations, but noted that he understands the “tension and nervousness that must prevail in the political leadership of Ukraine” due to the upcoming talks between Putin and Trump.

""The war in Ukraine has deformed freedom of speech in the EU. Any opinion other than a compulsory opinion is harshly criticized and condemned, even if it is based on objective information. I reject such deliberate deformation of fundamental rights,” Fico said.

HONG KONG, August 11. /TASS/. Taiwan plans to purchase 28 additional sets of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) launchers from the United States, the Taipei Times quoted sources as saying.

Taipei previously procured 29 HIMARS from Washington and received the first 11 sets in 2024. Once the planned purchases are completed, Taiwan would have 57 sets of HIMARS, the newspaper reported.

Also, the island's Ministry of National Defense is weighing buying nine additional sets of National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) from the United States, military sources told the newspaper. Earlier, Taiwan and the United States signed a contract for three NASAMS systems.

Taiwan has been governed by its own administration since 1949, when the remnants of the Kuomintang forces led by Chiang Kai-shek (1887-1975) fled there after their defeat in the Chinese Civil War. Beijing considers Taiwan a province of the People's Republic of China (PRC), a position supported by the majority of countries, including Russia.

Washington severed diplomatic relations with the island in 1979 and established ties with China. While recognizing the One China principle, The United States maintains contacts with the Taipei administration. And the United States is the largest supplier of weapons to Taiwan. China has estimated that, in the past few years, the US has sent weapons worth over $70 bln to the island.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

DOHA, August 11. /TASS/. Four Al Jazeera journalists including correspondent Anas al-Sharif have been killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City, Qatar's TV channel said.

The journalists were in a tent for media workers outside al-Shifa Hospital when the strike using a drone was launched minutes before midnight local time (GMT +3), killing seven people.

In turn, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck ""the terrorist Anas Al-Sharif, who posed as a journalist for the Al Jazeera network."" According to the Israeli military, he led a terrorist cell in the radical Palestinian movement and ""was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops.""

According to the TV channel, its journalists were among 48 Palestinians killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip over the past day. The Palestinian enclave said on August 5 that the number of reporters killed there had risen above 230. And the Gaza Health Ministry reported on August 10 that the total death toll since the Gaza conflict escalated in October 2023 had climbed to 61,430, with more than 153,000 people injured.

The situation in the Middle East deteriorated sharply after armed supporters of the Palestinian Hamas movement from the Gaza Strip entered Israeli territory on October 7, 2023, killing residents of border settlements and taking hostages. The radicals called this attack a response to Israel's actions against the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Israel blockaded Gaza and launched a military operation in the strip to free the hostages and dismantle Hamas's fighting capability. In March, Israel resumed fighting in the Gaza Strip, breaking a ceasefire established in January. Several rounds of negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States failed.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

WASHINGTON, August 11. /TASS/. Ukraine's positions will only deteriorate further down the road, and ""everyone knows"" that Vladimir Zelensky will have to trade land for peace, Director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University Peter Kuznick told TASS, commenting on plans to hold a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US leader Donald Trump in Alaska on August 15.

""Zelensky says he won't trade land for peace, but everyone knows he will have to. If he doesn't know it, Ukraine will have to find a leader who does,"" the prominent US political analyst and Professor of History said.

""There is no way Ukraine is joining NATO in the foreseeable future or clawing back the land that Russia has seized,"" Kuznick emphasized. According to him, continued hostilities will only mean more death on both sides and Russia ""occupying more and more Ukrainian land."" ""This is actually the strongest position Ukraine will be in given its shortage of manpower, weapons, strategy, finances, and morale,"" the expert noted.

Trump said on Friday that he expects to meet with Putin in Alaska on August 15. The date and venue for the upcoming talks were later confirmed by Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov, who said that Putin and Trump will focus on discussing scenarios of reaching a lasting peace in Ukraine. Ushakov stressed that the Kremlin expects any follow-up meeting between the two leaders to take place on Russian soil after their talks in Alaska.

Zelensky said on August 9 that the answer to Ukraine's territorial question already is in the country's Constitution and ""no one will deviate from this."" Trump explained on August 8 that a potential deal could require Ukraine to surrender significant parts of its territory and Russia to return some land to Ukraine as he warned that Zelensky ""will have to get ready to sign something.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Trump declares ‘public safety emergency' despite record crime low; DC mayor says ‘any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false'

Trump vows to ‘clean up' DC crime despite sharp drop in violence

Trump is placing Washington DC police under federal control and deploying the national guard. He said he was taking “historic action” to combat crime and homelessness in the US capital by invoking a section of the DC Home Rule Act, which allows him to place the DC Metropolitan police department under direct federal control. This provision would typically last for 48 hours, but Trump suggested that this could last longer. He added that he'll be “making the appropriate notifications to Congress and to the mayor”, possibly referring to the rule's requirement that the relevant congressional committee members on DC legislative matters are informed if he extends the provision beyond two days.

Trump was joined by key members of his cabinet, including attorney general, Pam Bondi, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, FBI director Kash Patel, secretary of the interior Doug Burgum, and newly-minted US attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro. Trump said that the police, under Bondi's direction, would “immediately begin massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”.

Trump said that there will be 800 national guardsmen assisting local law enforcement to start, but that number would increase if necessary. DC doesn't have control over its own national guard, unlike other states. Instead, the troops are under the command of the president.

Trump declared, repeatedly, that there is a “public safety emergency” in DC. However, violent crime in the capital hit a 30-year-low in 2024, according to the justice department.

The president also vowed to remove homeless encampments throughout DC. He said that while the administration would “help them as much as you can help”, people experiencing homelessness in the city would “not be allowed to turn out capital into a wasteland”.

Throughout the press conference, Trump and his team decried – what they claim is – overall weakness within the criminal justice system. The president said that DC's “no cash bail” policy was a “disaster”, and said he would count on Republicans in Congress to help “change the statute”.

Pirro added that that the juvenile justice system in the city was too lenient. “I can't arrest them. I can't prosecute them,” she said. “They go to family court, and they get to do yoga and arts and crafts. Enough, it changes today.”

The president also took questions on his upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin, scheduled for Friday in Alaska. He said that while Volodymyr Zelenskyy wouldn't be a part of the summit, he would speak to him as soon as he saw a “fair deal” for a ceasefire emerge. He also didn't rule out the possibility of a future trading relationship with Russia.

A trade truce between the US and China was set to expire on Tuesday, threatening an escalation of economic tensions between the world's two largest economies.

Chinese officials said they hoped the United States would strive for “positive” trade outcomes on Monday, as the 90-day detente reached between the two countries in May was due to expire.

“We hope that the US will work with China to follow the important consensus reached during the phone call between the two heads of state ... and strive for positive outcomes on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” a foreign ministry spokesman, Lin Jian, said in a statement.

Chinese and US officials said they expected the pause to be extended after the most recent round of trade talks held last month in Stockholm. Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, said last week the US had “the makings” of a trade deal with China and that he was optimistic about a path forward.

Donald Trump has yet to confirm any extension to the pause. “We'll see what happens,” he told reporters on Monday. “They've been dealing quite nicely — the relationship is very good with President Xi and myself.”

Failure to reach a deal would have major consequences. Trump had threatened tariffs on China as high as 245% with China threatening retaliatory tariffs of 125%, setting off a trade war between the world's largest economies.

The New York Times is reporting that the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is intended to last for 30 days, citing a White House official.

Here is the full text of Donald Trump's presidential memorandum “Restoring Law and Order in the District of Columbia”.

Section 1. Background. As President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, it is my solemn duty to protect law-abiding citizens from the destructive forces of criminal activity. That obligation applies with special force in our Nation's capital, where, as Commander in Chief of the District of Columbia National Guard, I must also ensure that all citizens can avail themselves of the right to interact with their elected representatives, and that the Federal Government can properly function, without fear of being subjected to violent, menacing street crime.

The local government of the District of Columbia has lost control of public order and safety in the city, as evidenced by the two embassy staffers who were murdered in May, the Congressional intern who was fatally shot a short distance from the White House in June, and the Administration staffer who was mercilessly beaten by a violent mob days ago. Citizens, tourists, and staff alike are unable to live peacefully in the Nation's capital, which is under siege from violent crime. It is a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world. It is my duty to our citizens and Federal workers to secure the safety and the peaceful functioning of our Nation, the Federal Government, and our city.

Sec. 2. Mobilizing the District of Columbia National Guard. Pursuant to my authority under the Constitution and laws of the United States and the District of Columbia, I direct the Secretary of Defense to mobilize the District of Columbia National Guard and order members to active service, in such numbers as he deems necessary, to address the epidemic of crime in our Nation's capital. The mobilization and duration of duty shall remain in effect until I determine that conditions of law and order have been restored in the District of Columbia. Further, I direct the Secretary of Defense to coordinate with State Governors and authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.

Sec. 3. General Provisions. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

DONALD J. TRUMP

Following Trump's press conference, the Democratic Mayors Association released the following statement:

Let's be clear: Crime is down in most major cities – including Washington, DC – in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him. If Trump actually cared about reducing crime, he wouldn't have made unprecedented cuts to public safety programs that actually work. If Trump actually cared about our communities, he would be working with our cities, not against them. But the truth is Trump doesn't care – he only wants to create yet another political charade to serve his own interests and distract Americans from his failures. While Trump may try to vilify Mayors and take credit for their work, Democratic Mayors will never stop fighting to protect and strengthen our communities because that's what they do – they get things done.

During that press conference, Donald Trump previewed his Friday meeting with Vladimir Putin, claiming he will know “probably in the first two minutes” whether a peace deal can be made. The US president told reporters:

I am going in to speak to Vladimir Putin and I will be telling him you have to end this war. You have to end it. And he wasn't going to mess with me.

I thought it was very respectful that the president of Russia is coming to our country as opposed to us going to his country or even a third party place. [Though Trump did earlier get geographically confused on this point.]

He confirmed that there were no plans for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to attend but Trump intends to call him straight after.

We're going to see what the parameters are – then I'm going to call up President Zelensky and the European leaders right after the meeting and I'm going to tell them what kind of a deal … It's not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both.

Ominously, however, he complained about the Ukrainian president and referred once again to “land swapping”:

I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelenskyy was saying I have to get constitutional approval. He has approval to go to war and kill everybody but he needs approval to do a land swap because there will be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia.

I get along with Zelenskyy but, you know, I disagree with what he has done. Very, very severely disagree. This is a war that shouldn't have happened.

Reverting to his previous mindset as a property developer, Trump acknowledged that Russia had taken some “oceanfront property” and promised:

We're going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine.

There will be some changes in land … Russia has taken some very prime territory. They've taken largely ocean – in real estate we call it oceanfront property – that's always the most valuable property.

During last year's election campaign, Trump promised to end the war on his first day in office. But on Monday he conceded that he might walk away with nothing resolved.

I'm going to meet President Putin and we're going to see what he has in mind and if it's a fair deal … I may say lots of luck, keep fighting, or I may say we can make a deal.

Probably in the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made.

A reporter asked: “How will you know that?”

Trump replied: “Because that's what I do – I make deals.”

Then, despite getting it right earlier in the briefing, for the second time on Monday Trump said: “We're going to Russia.” For those keeping up, the meeting will be held in the US state of Alaska.

The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has invited Donald Trump to join emergency virtual talks with EU leaders and Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Wednesday, as European demands grow that the US president agree red lines before Friday's summit in Alaska with Vladimir Putin.

Neither Zelenskyy nor European leaders have been invited to Trump's meeting with the Russian president.

Merz's office said in a statement that the virtual talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” and “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security”.

It is not clear whether or not Trump has accepted the invitation to the call.

There was another once unthinkable spectacle when Jeanine Pirro, a controversial former Fox News host, stood behind the lectern bearing the presidential seal.

Now the US attorney for the District of Columbia, Pirro told reporters:

We need to recognise that the people who matter are the law-abiding citizens – and it starts today ... President Trump is going to make sure these emboldened criminals understand: we see you, we're watching you, and we're going to change the law to catch you.

Pirro, a longtime personal friend of Donald Trump, added:

We need to go after the DC council and their absurd laws.

Trump is placing Washington DC police under federal control and deploying the national guard. He said he was taking “historic action” to combat crime and homelessness in the US capital by invoking a section of the DC Home Rule Act, which allows him to place the DC Metropolitan police department under direct federal control. This provision would typically last for 48 hours, but Trump suggested that this could last longer. He added that he'll be “making the appropriate notifications to Congress and to the mayor”, possibly referring to the rule's requirement that the relevant congressional committee members on DC legislative matters are informed if he extends the provision beyond two days.

Trump was joined by key members of his cabinet, including attorney general, Pam Bondi, defense secretary Pete Hegseth, FBI director Kash Patel, secretary of the interior Doug Burgum, and newly-minted US attorney for DC Jeanine Pirro. Trump said that the police, under Bondi's direction, would “immediately begin massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”.

Trump said that there will be 800 national guardsmen assisting local law enforcement to start, but that number would increase if necessary. DC doesn't have control over its own national guard, unlike other states. Instead, the troops are under the command of the president.

Trump declared, repeatedly, that there is a “public safety emergency” in DC. However, violent crime in the capital hit a 30-year-low in 2024, according to the justice department.

The president also vowed to remove homeless encampments throughout DC. He said that while the administration would “help them as much as you can help”, people experiencing homelessness in the city would “not be allowed to turn out capital into a wasteland”.

Throughout the press conference, Trump and his team decried – what they claim is – overall weakness within the criminal justice system. The president said that DC's “no cash bail” policy was a “disaster”, and said he would count on Republicans in Congress to help “change the statute”.

Pirro added that that the juvenile justice system in the city was too lenient. “I can't arrest them. I can't prosecute them,” she said. “They go to family court, and they get to do yoga and arts and crafts. Enough, it changes today.”

The president also took questions on his upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin, scheduled for Friday in Alaska. He said that while Volodymyr Zelenskyy wouldn't be a part of the summit, he would speak to him as soon as he saw a “fair deal” for a ceasefire emerge. He also didn't rule out the possibility of a future trading relationship with Russia.

The president said earlier that “the number of carjackings has more than tripled, murders in 2023 reached the highest rate – probably ever.”

A quick fact check and some important context here. According to the non-partisan Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ), the number of carjackings in DC did peak in June 2023. Their data comes from the DC Metropolitan police department.

But when you compare June 2023 to June 2025, carjackings actually fell by 75 %.

And on homicides, the city did experience a peak in August 2023, but that has fallen by 65% compared to June of this year.

Overall, the homicide rate in DC fell by 19% in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year, according to CCJ.

Now, on the subject of Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, the president confirms that Volodomyr Zelenskyy will not be part of Friday's summit.

He adds “we're going to see what he [Putin] has in mind,” and then will call Zelenskyy first “out of respect” if it's a fair deal. He says that afterwards he'll inform European Union leaders and Nato.

He goes on to say that there is a world where the US and Russia can be trading partners down the line, or if Friday's meeting goes well.

“Russia has a very valuable piece of land, if Vladimir Putin would go toward business instead of toward war,” he says.

Pivoting, the president says “we'll see what happens”, when it comes to the tariff deadline for China set for later today.

“They've been dealing quite nicely. The relationship is very good with President Xi and myself.”

In response to a question about how personal the issue of crime and homelessness is to the president, Donald Trump says that he wants leaders or dignitaries to come through the capital “beautifully”. He adds, “if our capital is dirty, our whole country is dirty, and they don't respect us”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

B'Tselem publishes film showing killing of Awdah Hathaleen after suspect released by court over ‘weakened' evidence

Middle East crisis – latest updates

Awdah Hathaleen, the prominent Palestinian activist who was killed late last month by an extremist Jewish settler in the West Bank, filmed the moment he was shot, newly released video footage reveals.

Hathaleen, who worked on the filming of the Oscar-winning documentary No Other Land, which examined settler violence against the Palestinian community of Masafer Yatta, was killed by Yinon Levi, a settler who was already under sanctions in the UK and EU for violent acts against Palestinians.

The footage – released by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem – appears to offer clear evidence of Levi's direct involvement in the killing of Hathaleen, an English teacher and activist resident in Umm al-Khair in the south Hebron hills, on 28 July, in an incident that sparked international outrage.

Levi was arrested over the killing but quickly released by a court after a ruling that the evidence he had fired at Hathaleen had “weakened”.

Levi has denied he fired the shot that killed Hathaleen. However, the footage filmed by Hathaleen himself shows Levi draw his weapon and fire in Hathaleen's direction. Hathaleen is then heard groaning and falling to the ground.

Hathaleen was filming settlers operating an earth mover when he was shot. According to witnesses, a confrontation that was taking place between Levi and Palestinian residents became more heated when the digger attempted to approach a fenced-off grove belonging to a Palestinian family, with at least one stone thrown.

The footage, filmed from some distance away, shows Levi waving a gun and scuffling with residents as they attempt to block the earth mover.

Levi can then be seen taking several steps to his right before raising his gun, aiming it in Hathaleen's direction, and firing. The footage sharply contradicts claims by Levi's lawyer, Avichai Hajbi, that he had been “forced to fire his weapon into the air” because he felt his life was in danger.

Hathaleen's footage is backed up by witness evidence provided to B'Tselem, including by his brother-in-law Alaa Hathaleen, who was present at the time of the killing and is seen in the footage remonstrating with Levi at close quarters and attempting to film the events himself with his phone.

“The settler Yinon Levi arrived,” Alaa Hathaleen told B'Tselem. “The residents shouted at him, and he drew his gun. I tried to film him pulling out the gun, but he attacked me and grabbed my phone.

“Suddenly, while we were trying to move people away and the excavator was already on the road leading to the settlement, Yinon Levi fired one shot, and then another shot.

“I heard shouts: ‘Awdah! Awdah!' I turned around and found my cousin Awdah lying in the public garden of Umm al-Khair's community centre. He was bleeding heavily from the chest and mouth. It turned out he had been shot while filming the events, from about 40 meters away, behind a metal fence we had put up around the garden.”

Levi was sanctioned by the UK in 2024, along with others, because he “used physical aggression, threatened families at gunpoint, and destroyed property as part of a targeted and calculated effort to displace Palestinian communities”.

Levi's treatment by the courts since the shooting is in line with a long history of lenient treatment by both the Israeli civilian and military courts of Israelis who kill Palestinians.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Three arrested and San Pedro cactus plants also found at rural properties that hosted lucrative ‘astral journeys'

Police in eastern Spain have arrested three people and seized 11 litres of ayahuasca, 117 San Pedro cactus plants and several bottles of toad poison after raiding two rural properties that were used to host lucrative spiritual retreats promising “astral journeys”.

Officers from the Guardia Civil force began investigating the business in the Pedreguer municipality of Alicante province five months ago after receiving a complaint from a former customer. They discovered that the retreat, which advertised online and billed itself as an award-winning and internationally renowned spiritual centre, offered “traditional curative medicine” breaks that were especially popular among European visitors.

“The three-day and five-day packages on offer cost an average of €1,000 [£865] and included lodgings, support and the substances to be taken,” the force said in a statement.

“The retreats comprised groups of up to 20 people, who were accompanied on their ‘astral journeys' by six of the organisation's employees. Several such retreats took place each week, leading investigators to conclude that the group made hundreds of thousands of euros over the past year – most of which was paid in cash that was not declared and which therefore left no trace. A large number of bank accounts in different countries were used.”

The Guardia Civil said 16 people had been on a retreat when the raids took place, adding that the centre did not have the necessary equipment to deal with cases of poisoning and that the concoctions were prepared in a “homemade, rudimentary laboratory that lacked hygiene measures”.

A Guardia Civil spokesperson said that ayahuasca, San Pedro, toad poison, wild rue and mimosa pudica were prohibited substances in Spain, adding that their consumption was not authorised because, while they were natural substances, they could be highly dangerous to human health.

Police photographs showed a large room, filled with mattresses, buckets and tissues, where the “astral journeys” took place.

Two men and a woman – thought to be the group's leaders – were arrested, while five others who served as “spiritual guides” are under investigation. All are suspected of drug trafficking, money laundering and belonging to a criminal organisation.

Officers also seized 945 Ritalin tablets as well as an assortment of plant products, all of which were sent to the laboratory for testing.

While the Guardia Civil has not suggested that anyone was physically harmed as a result of the centre's activities, they stated: “Ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus, toad secretions, wild rue and mimosa pudica are naturally derived products that can be highly damaging for humans and whose effects are difficult to predict because they depend on various factors, including an individual's metabolism and the amounts administered. That risk increases when the toxic substances are administered by people who lack healthcare training and when they are produced in a homemade fashion.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Baku may consider lifting its ban on supplying Ukraine with weapons from its arsenal if Russia continues targeting Azerbaijani interests in Ukraine, Azerbaijani outlet Caliber.Az reported on Aug. 10, citing unnamed sources.

The reported shift follows a series of Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure linked to Azerbaijan. In the latest attack overnight on Aug. 8, Russian forces launched five Shahed drones at a SOCAR oil depot in Odesa Oblast, sparking a fire and damaging a diesel pipeline. Four SOCAR employees were seriously injured, according to news reports. 

The strike marked the second recent Russian attack on Azerbaijani-linked facilities in Ukraine. In late June, Russian forces targeted a gas distribution station near Orlivka, a key part of the Trans-Balkan pipeline, through which Azerbaijani gas began flowing into Ukraine following a July 28 deal.

Caliber.Az said Russian forces had ""systematically"" struck Azerbaijani energy facilities in Ukraine in recent weeks, warning that such actions could trigger a policy reversal in Baku on weapons exports to Kyiv. Azerbaijan has so far refrained from supplying arms to Ukraine during the full-scale war.

The possible policy shift was reportedly discussed during an Aug. 10 phone call between President Volodymyr Zelensky and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev. The two leaders condemned the strikes and discussed bilateral energy cooperation.

""These are deliberate attacks not only on these facilities, but also on our cooperation,"" Zelensky said after the call. ""President Aliyev assured me, and this is also Ukraine's position, that we will continue cooperation despite any challenges.""

Azerbaijan and Ukraine have maintained close energy and trade ties for years, with Kyiv importing Azerbaijani oil and gas and SOCAR expanding its investments in Ukraine's fuel infrastructure. 

Before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Baku also supplied Ukraine with certain military equipment, including drones and armored vehicles. 

Since the start of the all-out war, however, Azerbaijan has officially maintained a policy of not providing lethal aid to either side, while offering humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, such as providing energy equipment, financial aid, and infrastructure support, with the value of assistance exceeding $40 million as of mid-2025.

Editor's note: The article was expanded with additional information.

A planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will be a test for the Kremlin leader, and Ukraine will be involved in upcoming peace efforts if the summit goes well, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Aug. 10.

""(W)hen it comes to peace talks, the ceasefire, and what happens after that on territories, on security guarantees for Ukraine, Ukraine will have to be and will be involved. But on Friday, it is important to see how serious Putin is,"" Rutte said in an interview with CBS News.

Trump and Putin are set to meet in Alaska on Aug. 15 as the U.S. intensifies efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.

There will be no peace deal signed between Trump and Putin in Alaska without Ukraine's participation, Rutte noted.

""It will not be the final say on this. There will not be a final deal on this. Of course, Ukraine will have to be involved,"" he said.

""What will happen on Friday is testing Putin by President Trump. And I commend him for the fact that he organised this meeting,"" Rutte said.

The NATO leader described Putin as ""the main threat to the Western alliance"" amid Russia's war.

""(W)hen it comes to the geostrategic position of Ukraine in the future, when it comes to whatever is the size of the Ukrainian military, when it comes to NATO's posture on the eastern flank in countries like Latvia and Lithuania, Estonia, Finland, Poland, that Putin has absolutely no say on any of these issues,"" he said.

Leaders of Poland, the Baltic countries, and the Nordic countries have stressed the importance of Ukraine's presence at the negotiating table.

""I believe President Zelensky will be invited; there's some information emerging today that there's a chance President Zelensky will be present at President Trump's meeting with Putin,"" Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said, according to the Polish Press Agency.

""That would be the best solution, and I believe it will happen.""

In a joint statement on Aug. 10, leaders of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden said they welcome Trump's initiative to end the war but noted that a ""diplomatic solution must safeguard the vital security interests of both Ukraine and Europe.""

The Nordic and Baltic leaders also stressed that negotiations ""can only take place in the context of a ceasefire"" and that the ""path to peace cannot be charted without Ukraine's voice.""

""No decisions on Ukraine without Ukraine, and no decisions on Europe without Europe,"" the leaders said in their statement, pledging continued support for Kyiv and adding that Russia must be consistently pressured to end the war.

Russia has issued maximalist demands to Kyiv in previous direct peace talks, including that Ukraine give up its NATO aspirations and demilitarize.

Months earlier, U.S. attempts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia failed. Kyiv and Moscow later held three rounds of direct peace talks in Istanbul, which were largely inconclusive.

In direct talks, Ukraine and Russia agreed to several prisoner exchanges, but progress toward a ceasefire was not made amid Russia's maximalist demands.

Trump previously announced an Aug. 8 deadline for Russia to reach a ceasefire in its war against Ukraine. Despite Russia's refusal to halt hostilities, Trump never imposed sanctions on Moscow once the deadline passed.

Ukrainian refugees in Germany are receiving ""unjustified"" social payments and should return to their home country, a co-leader of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, Tino Chrupalla, said in an interview on Aug. 10.

Talking to the ZDF news channel, the co-leader of Germany's strongest opposition party said that ""there are refugees who have come to Germany (from Ukraine), who are also receiving unjustified Bürgergeld (a form of unemployment benefits) here, and who have to return to their own country.""

Roughly 5.6 million Ukrainian refugees remain abroad after fleeing Russia's full-scale invasion, according to U.N. data. The largest number, around 1.2 million, reside in Germany, a country that has provided extensive military, economic, and humanitarian support to Kyiv.

As of August, 272,000 Ukrainian refugees in Germany were employed and paid their contributions to social insurance funds, Deutsche Welle reported. Some 700,000 Ukrainians were eligible to receive Bürgergeld as of March, a drop of 4,300 people from last year, according to the German public broadcaster.

The AfD, a radical party that saw a surge in popularity in recent months, has consistently criticized Berlin's pro-Ukraine policy, speaking out against the provision of arms and other support to the war-torn country.

The nationalist party has been classified as ""extremist"" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, and its members have been under investigation for ties to Russian and Chinese espionage networks.

Chrupalla's co-chair in the AfD party, Alice Weidel, also criticized social benefits for Ukrainain refugees, saying on Aug. 7 that Bürgergeld payments for Ukrainians should be abolished and replaced with lower-level payments for asylum seekers.

In the ZDF interview, Chrupalla urged a quick end to the war in Ukraine, adding that there might be no alternatives to Kyiv ceding territory for the sake of peace.

Describing Ukraine's partially occupied eastern Donbas region as composed of ""primarily pro-Russian areas,"" the far-right leader also noted that ""over 3 million Ukrainians have fled to Russia.""

At least 2.8 million Ukrainians are believed to have left for Russia in the wake of the full-scale war, including those forcibly deported, lacking other routes of escape due to hostilities, or those with family or other ties in Russia.

""Do we really believe that we can defeat the world's largest nuclear power and, what's more, win this war, which is not ours?"" Chrupalla said.

The comments come ahead of a high-level summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15, as Trump signaled the Kremlin is interested in ""swapping"" land as part of a ceasefire deal.

A source in Ukraine's Presidential Office told the Kyiv Independent that Moscow's demands include Kyiv's full withdrawal from two of the partly occupied Ukrainian regions — Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts.

It remains unclear whether President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has already rejected any territorial concessions to Russia, will be invited to the meeting.

He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. Martin studied at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, holding a bachelor's degree in security studies and history and a master's degree in conflict and democracy studies.



During the press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump added that he was ""a little bothered"" by Zelensky's words regarding ""constitutional approval"" for land swaps as part of a potential peace agreement.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has organized an online meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and key European leaders. 

""Next Friday will be important because it will be about testing (Vladimir) Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end,"" Mark Rutte said.

We asked Ukrainians on the streets of Kyiv how they feel about Trump's plan to negotiate a peace agreement with Putin without Ukraine's involvement, and what they think about such a territorial exchange.

Russian forces launched 71 Shahed-type attack drones and decoy drones against Ukraine overnight, the Air Force reported. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 59 Russian drones, while 12 drones hit six different locations.

""This is what the situation in the war looks like. And the situation in diplomacy must correspond accordingly,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X.

The suspected move comes as the Kremlin intensifies efforts to create what it calls a ""sovereign internet"" disconnected from global networks, trying to replace Western services with domestic ones.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he holds ""lots of fears and lots of hope"" about the planned summit.

Major General Denis Putilov is at least the eighth senior defense official jailed since former Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was dismissed in 2024.

At any other time in recent history, the Trump administration's behaviour would immediately be called out for what it is: imperialism – plain and simple.Jessica Koscielniak/Reuters

Dani Rodrik is a professor of international political economy at Harvard Kennedy School.

America's critics have always depicted it as a selfish country that throws its weight around with little regard for others' well-being. But President Donald Trump's trade policies have been so misguided, erratic and self-defeating as to make even the most cartoonish of such descriptions seem flattering. Still, in a twisted way, his trade follies have laid bare other countries' failures as well, by forcing them to consider what their responses say about their own intentions and capabilities.

It is said that one's true character is revealed in the face of adversity, and the same goes for countries and their political systems. Mr. Trump's frontal assault on the world economy was a shock to everyone, but it also gave Europe, China and various middle powers an opportunity to make a statement about who they are and what they stand for. It was an invitation to articulate a vision of a new world order that could overcome the imbalances, inequities and unsustainability of the old one, and that would not depend on the leadership – for better or worse – of a single powerful country. But few rose to the challenge.

In this respect, the European Union has perhaps been the greatest disappointment. In terms of purchasing power, it is almost as large as the United States – accounting for 14.1 per cent of the world economy, compared to 14.8 per cent for the U.S. and 19.7 per cent for China. Moreover, despite the recent rise of the far right, most European countries have avoided backsliding into authoritarianism. As a collection of democratic nation-states whose geopolitical ambitions do not threaten others, Europe has both the power and the moral authority to provide global leadership. Instead, it dithered and then submitted to Mr. Trump's demands.

Opinion: Brace yourself for the rest of Trump 2

Europe's ambitions were always narrowly parochial; but in folding to Mr. Trump, it is not even clear that it served its own immediate interests. The July handshake deal between Mr. Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen leaves 50 per cent tariffs on European exports of steel and aluminum, places 15 per cent tariffs on most other exports, and commits Europe to ridiculously high levels of energy imports from the U.S. Rarely has the EU's structural weakness as a confederation of countries without a collective sense of identity been on starker display.

China has played a tougher game, retaliating forcefully with its own tariffs and restricting exports of critical minerals to the U.S. Mr. Trump's vindictive, self-defeating foreign policies have helped China extend its influence and enhance its credibility as a reliable partner for the developing world. But the Chinese leadership has also failed to articulate a practical model for a post-neoliberal global economic order. Notably, China has shown little interest in addressing the two global imbalances that it has caused with its own large external surplus and excess of domestic savings over investment.

Meanwhile, smaller countries and middle powers have mostly played the quiet game, pursuing independent bargains with Mr. Trump and hoping to limit the damage to their own economies. The exception is Brazil, whose president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has emerged as the rare exemplary leader who refuses to grovel at Mr. Trump's feet. Despite facing punitive 50 per cent tariffs and pointed personal attacks, he has proudly defended his country's sovereignty, democracy and independent judiciary. 

Opinion: Other U.S. presidents could have subjugated Canada. They just chose not to act like imperialists

Such leadership has been sorely lacking around the world. In India, the political commentator Pratap Bhanu Mehta points out that many business and political elites are searching for ways to accommodate Mr. Trump. But in doing so, Mr. Mehta argues, they are misreading him and the world he is creating. At any other time in recent history, the Trump administration's behaviour would immediately be called out for what it is: imperialism – plain and simple.

Imperialism must always be challenged – not accommodated – and that requires both power and purpose. It would defy political logic and the laws of economic gravity if a country controlling only 15 per cent of the world economy could dictate the rules of the game to everyone else. 

Finding common purpose is perhaps the bigger challenge. If Mr. Trump “wins,” it will be because other large economies were unable (or unwilling) to articulate an alternative framework for the global economy. Pining after traditional multilateralism and global co-operation – as many targets of Mr. Trump's ire have done – is of little use and merely signals weakness.

Mr. Trump's actions have held up a mirror to others, and most should recognize that their reflection is not a pretty sight. Fortunately, their apparent helplessness has been self-imposed. It is not too late to choose self-confidence over humiliation.

U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that the American capital 'has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.'JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was deploying 800 National Guard troops to the U.S. capital and putting Washington's police department under federal control to combat what he said was a wave of lawlessness, despite statistics showing that violent crime hit a 30-year low in 2024.

“I'm deploying the National Guard to help re-establish law, order and public safety in Washington, D.C.,” Trump told reporters at the White House, flanked by administration officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney-General Pam Bondi. “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.”

Trump's announcement is his latest effort to target Democratic-run cities by exercising executive power over traditionally local matters, and he has shown particular interest in asserting more control over Washington.

The Republican president has dismissed criticism that he is manufacturing a crisis to justify expanding presidential authority in a heavily Democratic city.

Hundreds of officers and agents from over a dozen federal agencies, including the FBI, ICE, DEA, and ATF, have already fanned out across the city in recent days.

Andrew Coyne: The final obstacle to Trump's dictatorship may be the people he needs to borrow from

Trump said he would also send in the U.S. military “if needed,” and Hegseth said he was prepared to call in additional National Guard troops from outside Washington. Bondi will oversee the police force takeover, Trump said.

In making his announcement, Trump described Washington as a hellscape of bloodthirsty criminals and unchecked violence.

The Democratic mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, has pushed back on Trump's claims, saying the city is “not experiencing a crime spike” and highlighting that violent crime hit its lowest level in more than three decades last year.

Violent crime fell 26 per cent in the first seven months of 2025 after dropping 35 per cent in 2024, and overall crime dropped 7 per cent, according to the city's police department.

Over the past week, Trump has intensified his messaging, suggesting he might attempt to strip the city of its local autonomy and implement a full federal takeover.

The District of Columbia, established in 1790, operates under the Home Rule Act, which gives Congress ultimate authority but allows residents to elect a mayor and city council. Trump said last week that lawyers are examining how to overturn the law, a move that would likely require Congress to revoke it.

In taking over the Metropolitan Police Department, Trump invoked a section of the act that allows the president to use the force temporarily when “special conditions of an emergency nature” exist. Trump said he was declaring a “public safety emergency” in the city.

Trump's own Federal Emergency Management Agency is cutting security funding for the National Capital Region, an area that includes D.C. and nearby cities in Maryland and Virginia. The region will receive US$20-million less this year from the federal urban security fund, amounting to a 44-per-cent year-on-year cut.

The deployment of National Guard troops is a tactic the Republican president used in Los Angeles, where he dispatched 5,000 troops in June in response to protests over his administration's immigration raids. State and local officials objected to Trump's decision as unnecessary and inflammatory.

Opinion: Where is the global resistance to Trump?

A federal trial was set to begin on Monday in San Francisco on whether the Trump administration violated U.S. law by deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines without the approval of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom.

The president has broad authority over the 2,700 members of the D.C. National Guard, unlike in states where governors typically hold the power to activate troops. Guard troops have been dispatched to Washington many times, including in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters.

During his first term as president, Trump sent the National Guard into Washington in 2020 to help quash mostly peaceful demonstrations during nationwide protests over police brutality following the murder of George Floyd. Civil rights leaders denounced the deployment, which was opposed by Bowser.

The U.S. military is generally prohibited under law from directly participating in domestic law enforcement activities.

Since the 1980s, Trump has used crime, especially youth crime in cities, as a political tool. His 1989 call for the death penalty in the Central Park jogger case, involving five Black and Latino teens later exonerated of raping and beating a woman, remains among the controversial moments of his public life.

The “Central Park Five” sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during a presidential debate last year that they had pleaded guilty.

Over a dozen buildings collapsed as a result of the tremor, which was felt as far as Istanbul.

An earthquake with a 6.1 magnitude hit Turkey's western province of Balikesir on Sunday, killing one person.

Over dozen buildings collapsed as a result of the quake.

The epicenter of the tremor was the town of Sindirgi. It sent shocks that were felt all the way to Istanbul, some 200 kilometers (125 miles) away.

Turkey's Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said an 81-year-old person died after being pulled from under the rubble. Twenty-nine people were injured, Yerlikaya said, adding that 16 buildings had collapsed.

Search and rescue operations were concluded, with no further signs of serious damage or casualties, the minister said.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan wished all those affected by the earthquake well, saying that steps were immediately taken to help those affected.

""May God protect our country from any kind of disaster,"" he posted on his X account.

Earthquakes in Turkey are common as the country lies on top of major fault lines.

More than 53,000 people were killed when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 hit the country in 2023.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","The recycling dilemma: Most plastic still ends up as waste","https://www.dw.com/en/plastic-pollution-hazardous-chemicals-additives-solutions-can-we-recycle-more/a-73498838","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 09:50:42 GMT","

Of the record volumes of plastic being produced, less than 10% is made into something new. Is it time to rethink recycling?

It is often said that the world can't recycle its way out of the plastic pollution crisis. And statistics underscore the reality of that statement.

To date,less than a tenth of all the plasticever made has been given a new lease of life. And just 1% has been recycled twice.

The rest ends up in landfills and incinerators. Or it lands in the environment, contaminating soil, air and the oceans — which take up roughly one garbage truck of plastic every minute.

""Just because something is recyclable doesn't mean it's getting recycled,"" said Moritz Jäger-Roschko, a plastics expert at Greenpeace Germany. ""Currently, it is simply cheaper to just make a new plastic product than to collect it and recycle it."" 

One of the main hurdles to greater re-use is plastic type. Of the thousands out there, some, like cross-linked polymers, are hard to handle. 

""Recycling doesn't really work in the mechanical sense because you cannot split them up and bring them back into their original state,"" said Marc Kreutzbruck, head of the institute of plastics engineering at Germany's University of Stuttgart.

But being robust, durable and heat-resistant, they are exactly the type of plastics used in aerospace, electronics and automobiles.

""Everything in transportation that is focused on lightweight construction relies on these kinds of plastics,"" Kreutzbruck added.

Another major sticking point is that plastics are often custom formulated with additives that make them more flexible, stronger or cheaper to produce.

Sarah Perreard, co-director of global Plastic Footprint Network coalition, said the number of additives that have been invented and used in the past decade ""has increased drastically.""

""We have almost created this sort of monster that we don't fully control anymore,"" Perreard said. 

The problems are as complex as the plastics themselves. Firstly, many additives are hazardous to both human health and the environment and can leach out during recycling or even during use in recycled products. And recycling streams contaminated with hazardous additives can be flagged as toxic waste by regulatory agencies, making re-use more complicated or even illegal.

Equally, when recycled together, additives can mix unpredictably and degrade the quality of end material, making it unattractive to manufacturers.

Other types of plastics — like PET and HDPE, used in drinking and detergent bottles respectively — are easier to recycle because the materials they're made from are easier to identify. Yet still, they are often discarded. 

""If it is technically recyclable but there is no infrastructure in many of the places where this plastic is put on the market, it will not be recycled. It will not even be well managed,"" Perreard said. 

Then there is composite packaging — like chip bags or coffee pods — made from a combination of plastic and aluminum or paper. They are nearly impossible to separate, and most recycling plants can't process them at all.  

Experts say it is critical to rethink the way plastics are recycled — and some are already finding new ways to turn even the most difficult-to-recycle waste into something useful.

Veena Sahajwalla, a materials scientist at the University of New South Wales in Australia, challenges the notion that every product must come back in the exact same form when recycled.

""The journey for us started at that point where we're saying, what do people mean when they say this is not recyclable? But what if we could remanufacture completely different products out of it?"" she said.

Sahajwalla is pioneering 'microfactories' that transform mixed plastic waste like e-waste plastics — which are usually difficult to recycle — into high-value materials. 

""We create pools of plastic filaments that are made from 100% recycled materials out of all the difficult plastics that are in all the hardware like IT printers. And these recycled plastic filaments are then fed into a 3D printer,"" she said.

The idea is to use the new material for remanufacturing — right at the source.

""So, for example, our microfactory is located in the warehouse where our industry partner is basically now taking that plastic and producing these plastic filaments right there in the warehouse itself in Sydney.""

A piece that's needed to fix a broken computer or printer, for instance, can be created right there in the 3D printers from recycled plastic.

""So, let's not say the problem is with the raw material. Let's talk about how we can design and redesign our manufacturing processes,"" Sahajwalla said.

Recycling alone won't fix the crisis without cutting production, though, according to Jäger-Roschko. That's why policy matters, too. What's really needed, experts say, is effective regulation.

And Pereard from the Plastic Footprint Network calls for global rules that apply to every country. ""Even businesses want these rules,"" she said.

The latest round of UN Plastic Treaty negotiations offers a historic chance to tackle plastic pollution and recycling issues. Greenpeace is calling for a 75% reduction in plastic production by 2040, according to Jäger-Roschko.

Yet, the fossil fuel industry,which provides the oil and gas from which plastic is derived, is holding firm.

""Countries that produce oil are not in favor of a strong treaty because we see that with the shift towards renewable energy, a lot of the oil is going to be reduced over time, and plastic is a great outlet for countries that produce oil,"" Perreard said.

She is pushing for policies that would hold companies accountable for packaging throughout their lifecycle.

After all, experts say these big companies helped create the plastic crisis, and they have a responsibility to redesign packaging, cut down on single-use plastics, and invest in real reuse systems.

More girls and young women in Germany are being hospitalised for eating disorders. 

Official figures released by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) show hospital admissions have doubled, rising from 3,000 cases in 2003 to 6,000 in 2023.

The number of 10- to 17-year-olds treated has doubled over the past two decades, from 3,000 in 2003 to 6,000 in 2023.

They now make up nearly half of all inpatient cases, with anorexia nervosa the most common diagnosis. 

Women account for over 93% of those treated. In contrast, only around 820 men were receiving inpatient treatment for eating disorders in 2023.

Patients are also staying longer in hospital, averaging 53 days, far above the national average of just over seven.

Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, is ramping up its social media presence by joining TikTok in an effort to reach younger audiences.

""If you ask young people where they get their news, it's TikTok,"" Bundestag President Julia Klöckner told the DPA news agency.

While acknowledging concerns over TikTok, she said it would be counterproductive not to use the platform to inform the public about parliamentary work.

TikTok is under scrutiny in Europe over how it stores and processes the data of European users, particularly regarding potential transfers to China.

Despite those concerns, the German chancellor, politicians and several political parties have a presence on the platform.

The Bundestag already has a presence on several other social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Bluesky.

Official data obtained by Germany's socialist Left Party shows more than 11% of people deported from Germany in 2024 were children or teenagers.

The Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) media group reported the data shows authorities deported 20,084 people, including 2,316 aged between six and 18 years old. 

In the first half of 2025, 1,345 children and teenagers were among 11,807 deportees, or 11.4%, the data given in response to a Parliamentary question by the Left Party shows.

""What sense does it make to deport children who are learning here, growing up here, are integrating here — the skilled workers of tomorrow, along with their families,"" Left lawmaker Dietmar Bartsch asked. 

Germany has recorded its highest-ever number of overnight stays in the first half of the year.

Official figures released by the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis) show 223.3 million bookings at hotels and guesthouses, slightly surpassing last year's record.

The increase comes despite a 12.7% drop in foreign visitors compared to the same period last year, when Germany hosted the UEFA European Football Championship.

German travelers accounted for more than 80% of all stays so far this year.

June saw a sharp rise in domestic bookings, totaling 50.5 million overnight stays, boosted by school holidays in several states.

An AI chatbot on Donald Trump's social media platform has been found to consistently contradict the US president, including by claiming he proliferates “baseless claims” about election fraud.

Truth Social, which Mr Trump started after he was kicked off Twitter, now X, rolled out the AI search engine last week to rival Elon Musk's Grok chatbot and Mark Zuckerberg's Meta AI.

But the chatbot contradicts Mr Trump by claiming that tariffs are a tax on Americans, the 2020 election wasn't stolen, and his family's crypto investments pose a conflict of interest.

It also said riots at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, were an “insurrection” linked to the president's “baseless claims of widespread election fraud”.

The tool, unveiled on Wednesday, was developed by Perplexity, which said it offered “direct, reliable answers” and would “bring powerful AI to an audience with important questions”.

AI search engines, which include ChatGPT, Grok, and Google's Gemini, are trained by being fed large amounts of information from across the web.

But system developers are not fully able to control what the chatbots are likely to say.

A question posed by The Telegraph to Mr Trump's new chatbot about who is the most popular president of the century would likely anger the president given that the answer was Barack Obama.

But this newspaper's question also revealed that the chatbot's sources draw primarily from conservative outlets. All five sources listed by the chatbot were Fox News, Mr Trump's favourite TV channel.

A Perplexity spokesman told the Washington Post that Truth Social had used a “source selection” feature to limit the websites the AI tool relied on but that it was not involved in deciding what those websites were.

“This is their choice for their audience, and we are committed to developer and consumer choice. Our focus is simply building accurate AI,” the spokesman said.

The development comes after Mr Trump signed an executive order last month attacking “woke AI”.

He said the AI tools should be “truth-seeking”, “neutral”, and not developed with “partisan or ideological judgements”.

Mr Musk previously claimed that Grok had been wrongfully siding with Liberal ideology, prompting him to develop an update.

But the chatbot soon sparked controversy when it started sharing Nazi messaging, including by calling itself the “MechaHitler”.

Grok officials later said a code update had asked the chatbot not to “blindly defer to mainstream authority or media” or be “too afraid to offend”.

The Amazon Labor Union leader exemplifies how Black and Palestinian freedom struggles have converged throughout history.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

“Black and Brown [people] always stood together in struggles from the beginning of time,” said Christian Smalls, explaining his pro-Palestinian activism. The Amazon Labor Union leader spoke to me on July 24, 2025, from the Handala, a ship bound for Gaza bearing medical supplies and baby formula.

“Palestinians, they are right in our communities. They are our brothers and sisters, they are our neighbors, and we love one another … we [are] standing together side by side in this struggle to end this illegal siege that Israel has imposed,” Smalls said. His goal in sailing to Gaza was to highlight Amazon's cloud computing contracts with Israeli weapons manufacturers, as well as to urge labor unions in the United States to block arms shipments to Israel, as Greek dockworkers recently did.

Unlike many who, after nearly two years of silence, are now speaking up against Israel's forced famine in Gaza, Smalls has been committed to Palestinian liberation for years. Just after Israel began its latest genocidal chapter in Gaza in October 2023, the labor activist posted a message of solidarity on social media saying, “The people united will never be defeated so yes it's Free Palestine because we're not Free until we're all Free from the river to the Sea!”

Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day.

And when college students across the U.S. launched powerful Gaza-solidarity campus protests in 2024, the New Jersey-based Smalls showed up at Columbia University's campus, giving speeches and supporting students. “I visited many campuses across the world,” he said. “The younger generation is not going to give up.”

Within days of our conversation, Israeli forces boarded the Handala and seven of them assaulted Smalls — the only Black activist on board. According to the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, “They choked him and kicked him in the legs, leaving visible signs of violence on his neck and back … This level of force was not used against other abducted activists.”

While horrific, Smalls's assault was not surprising. “As a Black man in America, I guess I'm born with a target on my back,” he said. “This is not my first rodeo going up against the status quo.”

Black people in the U.S. and Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank face similar tactics from armed agents of the state. That's no coincidence. There is a long history of U.S.-Israeli joint police training; a 2018 report by Jewish Voice for Peace detailed how Palestinians face the same sort of systematic racial profiling and violence from Israeli forces as Black and Brown Americans do at the hands of U.S. police.

“People had no idea that Israeli military and United States police officers were training together and sharing technologies,” said Ijeoma Oluo, a writer, speaker, and best-selling author of So You Want to Talk About Race.

“Every justification used for [Israel's] genocide is also used against us, and used to justify locking our people in prisons. It's used every time that a Black person is killed by police,” Oluo pointed out.

It's not just the similarities in being victimized by harsh policing; it's also an intimate understanding of the horrors of colonization that ties the two communities together.

Acclaimed author and social justice activist adrienne maree brown sees the indisputable cruelty of Israel's colonization clearly. “The idea that like, I need to go from where I am … and I need to go to another place where people are, and I need to take over that place, and then that's gonna be how I have my safety and my abundance — like, it's such a delusional thought,” said brown. 

An August 2025 Economist/YouGov poll found that 33 percent of Black Americans sympathized with Palestinians. And 47 percent of Black people polled wanted the U.S. to decrease military aid to Israel while 40 percent supported increasing aid to Palestinians — the largest fractions of any racial group.

“It's remarkable the solidarity that you see, that people of color feel … towards Palestinians,” brown said. “Even if we don't know too many details about the issue, it seems very obvious to us, any of us who've come from lands that have once been colonized, or … been part of communities that have faced erasure.”

That solidarity has seeped into mainstream culture too. Grammy Award-winning singer and rapper Doechii used her BET award acceptance speech in June 2025 to “speak up for all oppressed people,” including “the people in Gaza.” She has since continued speaking up, chanting, “Free Palestine” on her Instagram live shows.

There is a sense among some people of color that if Israel succeeds in wiping Palestine off the map, they themselves may be next. Conversely, beating Israel back would be a blow to modern-day colonialism. “Oppressive powers [are] coming together and saying, this must succeed, this genocide must be allowed to continue,” Oluo said. “They understand that the more that we know how these systems work together, the more that we can see the ties of capitalism and global colonialism into this violence and oppression.”

Israel's apartheid agenda has been symbolic of Western hegemony for decades. It's no wonder that links between Black Americans and Palestinians have deep roots. Khury Petersen-Smith, the Michael Ratner Middle East Fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, has been a leading voice in the Black4Palestine network and pointed out how “our freedom struggles converge … And that has happened throughout history.”

When African nations were in the process of decolonizing in the 1950s and ‘60s, “Palestinians were in alignment with those decolonization struggles,” Petersen-Smith said, while “Israel was lined up with the United States, with South Africa, with European powers.” As part of his internationalist work with Black anti-colonial leaders, Malcolm X visited Jerusalem in 1959 and Gaza in 1964, and later denounced Zionism as a “new form of colonialism.”

More recently, the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by the police-perpetrated killing of Mike Brown, a Black teenager, coincided with one of Israel's ongoing wars on Gaza. The two exercises in state violence taking place in summer 2014, on opposite sides of the planet, prompted many comparisons between the plight of both peoples.

The 2014 uprising “was this moment of horror and violence, but also resistance and solidarity,” said Petersen-Smith. “Black folks rose up in Ferguson, and Palestinians in Palestine sent messages of solidarity, sent statements of solidarity and sent suggestions on social media about how to deal with tear gas and things like that.” Black delegations even traveled to the occupied West Bank that year to witness firsthand the links between the two communities.

Similarly, when George Floyd's 2020 murder in Minneapolis precipitated a historic racial justice uprising across the U.S., Palestinians once again offered Americans advice via social media on how to treat the effects of tear gas and avoid rubber bullets.

Setting aside the historical and contemporary threads stitching together Black people and Palestinians, there's also basic human empathy at work.

Smalls, who had pledged to go on hunger strike while in Israeli custody, explained that, “as a father of three beautiful children, I cannot live and see every day … babies and women and children and innocent Palestinians being killed and slaughtered.” He added, “I don't want to see my children grow up in the world that we are experiencing right now.”

Smalls returned to the U.S. on July 31, receiving a hero's welcome at the airport in New York as he walked into a crowd of activists chanting “Gaza.” The Palestinian Youth Movement released a statement calling him “an example to us all of principled comradeship, courage, and solidarity with the oppressed.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

For years, military theorists and political scientists have argued that airpower is overrated and, in some ways, outmoded. Some point to the proliferation of small, cheap unmanned drones as evidence that traditional air superiority—the ability to control the skies—has been rendered obsolete. According to this view, technological innovation has made “air denial”—merely restricting an adversary's ability to operate freely in the air—a sufficient replacement.

Others cite a “smart bomb trap,” the idea that leaders have grown overconfident in the ability of precision airstrikes to coerce states into submission. These critics argue that airpower alone cannot achieve political objectives and in fact often leads to endless, pointless bombing campaigns. The political scientist Robert Pape, for example, asserted in 1996 that “no strategic bombing campaign has ever yielded decisive results.” Underneath these critiques is a clear message: airpower is too limited, too expensive, or too reliant on the promises of technological innovations to matter much.

Then, in June, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, an air campaign against Iran. Over the course of just 12 days, Israel's air force flew around 1,500 combat sorties, conducted more than 600 aerial refuelings, and struck over 900 Iranian targets, including hardened nuclear facilities, missile batteries, and military command centers. The results were decisive: Iran's nuclear program was significantly disrupted, key elements of its air defense network were shattered, and Tehran's military leadership suffered serious blows. All the while, not a single manned Israeli aircraft was lost.

Although Israel did not fully eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities, its air campaign delayed, degraded, and deterred Iran's ambitions, and further transformed the Middle East's political landscape. Rising Lion was a stunning demonstration of what a modern air force, backed by sound strategy and political resolve, can accomplish. It reaffirmed airpower's ability to achieve meaningful political outcomes without a drawn-out ground war.

The 1991 U.S.-led Desert Storm air campaign established the tenets of modern air warfare: gain air superiority, simultaneously strike key enemy centers of gravity, use stealth and precision, and prioritize desired effects over attrition of forces alone. Israel adapted those lessons. The Israeli air force used stealth F-35I fighter jets to suppress and destroy Iranian surface-to-air missile batteries. These aircraft provided real-time targeting information to nonstealth F-15I and F-16I fighters, which carried out precision strikes on additional targets. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) collected intelligence, jammed communications, and allowed Israel to deliver additional precision-guided munitions.

This devastating combination of stealth, precision, and persistent surveillance allowed Israel to quickly gain and maintain air superiority. By degrading Iranian defenses, Israel also cleared the way for the United States' Operation Midnight Hammer, in which B-2 stealth bombers struck deeply buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz, reachable only by U.S. Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs.

Some critics have pointed out that the campaign failed to destroy all of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. But Israel's objective in Operation Rising Lion was to disrupt and delay Iran's nuclear weapons program while retaining the ability to strike again—not to eradicate it. By those standards, Rising Lion was a resounding success. By crippling key enrichment and weapons-support sites, eliminating senior military and scientific personnel, and gaining air superiority over Iran, Israel imposed a strategy of denial by delay—all without committing ground forces to Iran or becoming entangled in a prolonged conflict. Indeed, any Iranian efforts to enrich uranium or rebuild facilities will now occur under the shadow of Israeli precision air attacks.



Critically, Israel achieved all its aims efficiently and effectively. It gained air superiority despite the thousands of miles separating it from Iran, in 12 days, and with zero casualties. Such results were possible only via airpower. No ground campaign could have hit these facilities so quickly, with such precision and intensity, and without any casualties.

To be sure, Rising Lion was not an air-only campaign. It was a tightly integrated, multidomain operation. Cyber-operations disrupted Iranian command and control. Space-based and airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms provided near-real-time targeting data. Electronic warfare helped disrupt enemy radars. Covert ground teams inside Iran used small drones to suppress defenses and relay coordinates. And an extensive set of military actions waged over several years in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria had already severely degraded Iran's regional proxies, blunting Tehran's ability to retaliate.

Together, these elements gave Israel an overwhelming advantage. But it was airpower that played the predominant role. It provided the tempo, reach, and the punch that made Rising Lion such an unqualified success.

Leading-edge airpower capabilities have improved markedly since Desert Storm, when aircraft lacked accurate sensing technology, real-time connectivity, and all-weather munitions. Today's fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-35, can integrate data from a variety of onboard sensors, fuse it into accurate targeting information, and share it with other aircraft. F-35s function as integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensor-shooters, giving users more information and digital connectivity that they can use to precisely strike targets as they are revealed. Their stealth allows them to operate inside contested airspace. As a result of these innovations, fewer fifth-generation aircraft are needed to achieve what would otherwise require dozens of less capable nonstealth aircraft.

Technological advances are not restricted to modern combat aircraft, however. Air defenses have become cheaper and more adaptable than ever. Artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons systems, and advanced information integration are changing the character of warfare. In the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, for example, Azerbaijan used a network of Bayraktar TB2 drones, loitering munitions, and real-time targeting data to devastating effect against Armenian forces. But even in the face of evolving modes of warfare, airpower's inherent advantages endure. Airpower can still be used to change adversary behavior, enforce strategic redlines, and reshape regional military balance—all without bleeding a country's treasury or excessively risking its sons and daughters. In fact, Russia's inability to achieve air superiority over Ukraine turned what the Kremlin assumed would be a fast and simple invasion into a grinding war of attrition. Israel, by contrast, used modern airpower to avoid such a trap. It did not involve significant ground forces and has thus avoided falling into an endless war—Washington's fate in Afghanistan and Iraq.

All this doesn't mean air campaigns alone can do everything: operations from any domain never achieve victory in isolation. Critics of airpower, however, miss that airpower does not simply enable the use of other kinds of operations. Rather, it is a unique instrument of strategic leverage. In the modern era, air superiority is not just a prerequisite for joint success; it can be the decisive factor. In other words, Israel's air campaign did not just set back Iran's nuclear program. It reaffirmed that airpower can be the foundation of modern military success. U.S. defense planners should pay attention. Investing in air superiority is not optional for American security. It is essential.

The global trading system as we have known it is dead. The World Trade Organization has effectively ceased to function, as it fails to negotiate, monitor, or enforce member commitments. Fundamental principles such as “most favored nation” status, or MFN, which requires WTO members to treat one another equally except when they have negotiated free-trade agreements, are being jettisoned as Washington threatens or imposes tariffs ranging from ten to more than 50 percent on dozens of countries. Both the “America first” trade strategy and China's analogous “dual circulation” and Made in China 2025 strategies reflect a flagrant disregard for any semblance of a rules-based system and a clear preference for a power-based system to take its place. Even if pieces of the old order manage to survive, the damage is done: there is no going back.

Many will celebrate the end of an era. Indeed, although U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive use of tariffs and disregard for past agreements have put the final nails in the coffin, the turn against global trade has been embraced by both Democrats and Republicans in Washington over the past several years. But before critics revel in the death of the rules-based trading system, they should consider the costs and tradeoffs that come with its dismantlement—and think carefully about the elements that should be rebuilt, even if in altered forms, to avert considerably worse outcomes for the United States and the global economy.

If Washington continues on its current course—defined by unilateralism, transactionalism, and mercantilism—the consequences will be grim, especially as Beijing continues on its own damaging course of subsidized excess capacity, predatory export policies, and economic coercion. The risk of the United States and China playing by their own rules, with power the only real constraint, is contagion: if the two largest economies in the world operate outside the rules-based system, other countries will increasingly do the same, leading to rising uncertainty, drags on productivity, and lower overall growth.

Yet clinging to the old system and pining for its restoration would be deluded and futile. Nostalgia is not a strategy; nor is hope. Looking beyond the existing structures does not mean simply accepting a Hobbesian state of nature. The challenge is to create a system of rules outside the rules-based system of old.

That will require starting over. The best option for moving forward is to craft a system made up of coalitions of the like-minded, which together would constitute a network of open plurilateral relationships—smaller and more flexible than the multilateral trading system. Some coalitions would be mechanisms for trade integration and liberalization. Others might serve to secure supply chains or even to restrict trade in the service of national security. Some countries would be members of multiple coalitions with varied purposes, and coalitions would likely have overlapping memberships and variable geometry. From a purely economic point of view, this system would be suboptimal and less efficient than the global trading system was. But it might well be the most politically sustainable outcome that could—crucially—prevent unilateralism from spinning out of control. It would, in short, allow for a global economy shaped by rules even without a global rules-based system.

The global trading system developed as one part of the multilateral economic structure that the United States led in building, starting during World War II and continuing into the early years of this century. Along with institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Washington established first the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade—the GATT, which laid out a set of rules, such as MFN, and created a process by which countries negotiated market-opening commitments—and then, in 1995, the WTO. The 1994 Uruguay Round agreement, which established the WTO, introduced a range of new trade disciplines and a binding dispute-settlement procedure, marking a major step forward in strengthening the multilateral rules-based system. At its founding, the WTO had 76 member countries; today, it has more than 160, which account for 98 percent of global trade.

In the wake of the Cold War, U.S. policymakers hoped that the rules-based trading system that had taken shape in much of the noncommunist world in the preceding decades would expand to encompass former U.S. adversaries, such as Russia, and emerging markets, such as China. The rules would enhance stability, promote openness and integration, and facilitate the peaceful resolution of economic disputes, to the United States' economic and strategic benefit. Yet even before this system was fully in place, opposition to it emerged, beginning in the early 1990s with the fierce debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The first WTO ministerial meeting held in the United States, in Seattle in 1999, was met with massive, headline-grabbing protests.

Trade policy has gotten both more credit and more blame than it deserves in the economic debates of recent decades. Critics of the system tend to conflate the effects of globalization with those of trade policy. Globalization itself had less to do with trade agreements than with technology—particularly the invention of the shipping container and the spread of broadband. From the 1960s on, containerization drastically reduced the cost of shipping goods by sea and land, and there were improvements in the efficiency of air freight, as well. A 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Sharat Ganapati and Woan Foong Wong found that from 1970 to 2014, the cost of transporting goods by weight fell between 33 and 39 percent and the cost of transporting goods by value fell between 48 and 62 percent. All of this made the development of global supply chains for goods increasingly attractive. The same was true for trade in services with the spread of computers and Internet access. Seamless connectivity meant that everything from customer and back-office processing to coding and data analytics could be done almost anywhere on earth.

The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment—one of the primary harms in the United States attributed to trade—also flowed mainly from technological change. Researchers at Ball State University have calculated that “almost 88 percent of job losses in manufacturing [between 2000 and 2010] can be attributable to productivity growth, and the long-term changes to manufacturing employment are mostly linked to the productivity of American factories.” Trade, they found, accounted for just 13.4 percent of job loss.

Indeed, that decline in manufacturing employment, which occurred across advanced industrialized countries, started well before Washington signed any major trade agreements. The percentage of U.S. employment in manufacturing shrank by around two to five points per decade from the 1970s through the first decade of this century, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Germany, broadly considered a manufacturing powerhouse, experienced a similar decline. China's emergence as the manufacturing floor for the global economy accelerated this trend, but it did not cause it entirely on its own. In developed economies with robust manufacturing sectors, the secular decline of manufacturing employment long predates the era of peak globalization.

Still, a key driver of today's wariness of trade is that the rules of the rules-based system did not sufficiently anticipate the challenge of China. The emergence of China as an export-driven economic powerhouse resulted in what has become known as the “China shock”—the rapid closure of factories in particular communities in the United States.

It is true that the multilateral trading system suffered from design flaws that proved to be particularly salient with the rise of China—and consequently planted the seeds of the system's demise. These included the weakness of certain restrictions on state subsidization and the nonmarket behavior of state-owned enterprises, as well as the protection of intellectual property rights; the difficulty of graduating members from developing-country status, which allowed them more lenient treatment; and a consensus, one-country-veto decision-making process that made reform all but impossible. At the time of China's accession to the WTO, in 2001, there was reason to believe that Beijing was on an irreversible path toward market reform and liberalization. Such hopes rested not just on the rhetoric of China's leaders at the time but also on the painful actions they took to restructure significant portions of the economy. Yet hopes were dashed as reform stalled under President Hu Jintao and then in some ways went into reverse under President Xi Jinping.

WTO rules on intellectual property, subsidies, and state-owned enterprises proved insufficient in the face of the emergence and integration of a China that reformed its economic approach less than expected. And the challenge was not just that China played by its own set of rules; it was also the problem of scale. China's surplus of manufactured goods—which approached $1 trillion last year—far exceeds those of earlier manufacturing giants, such as Germany and Japan. By the UN Industrial Development Organization's estimate, China is well on its way to producing 45 percent of global industrial output by the end of the decade.

Such industrial overcapacity, sustained by domestic preferences, state-directed subsidies, and market protections, bears a considerable share of the blame for the current situation. As China's economic strategy increasingly challenged the integrity of a trading system designed to promote integration and interdependence, Washington grew skeptical of the system itself. In 2015, the Obama administration called it quits on the Doha Round of global trade negotiations, concerned that the resulting agreement would have locked in preferential treatment for China at the expense of the United States and the rest of the world. In his first term, Trump showed broad disregard for the multilateral system, preferring to revert to the pre-WTO period in which the United States, as the largest economy in the world, wielded its power unilaterally. And the Biden administration did nothing meaningful to reform the WTO.

Today, the three major functions of the WTO have ground to a halt. As a negotiating forum, it has in recent years managed to conclude only marginal multilateral agreements, such as one on trade facilitation that expedites the entry of goods at customs. As a body for monitoring members' trade practices, it has had no recourse when large economies simply ignore their obligations to report policies. And as a dispute-settlement organization, it has been hobbled by disagreements over the mandate and functioning of its appellate body. In response to such disagreements, Washington, across several administrations, objected first to the reappointment of certain members of the body and ultimately to the appointment of any new members, effectively preventing any meaningful effort to settle disputes.

Self-flagellation about the failures of the trading system has practically become the price of entry to discussions about the global economy's future. The standard account of those has become the starting point for a supposed “new Washington consensus.” Yet those failures should be weighed against the benefits, for it is all too easy to take the international economic system and the institutions that maintain it for granted.

For one thing, the global trading system has played a central role in lifting as many as a billion people out of poverty. The World Bank has concluded that “trade has been a powerful driver of economic development and poverty reduction.” Between 1990 and 2017, global GDP nearly tripled, developing countries' share of exports increased from 16 to 30 percent, and global poverty plummeted from 36 to nine percent.

Another common fallacy in today's debate about trade is that it has benefited only other countries, not the United States. The clearest benefit has been for American consumers, by giving them access to more, and more varied, goods at lower prices. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that a ten percent reduction in U.S. import costs brings welfare gains to both high- and low-income households. The greatest benefits, however, go to low-income households, with welfare gains of the poorest households 4.5 times as high as those of the richest. The economist Michael Waugh, who wrote the report, noted that “in layman's terms, a dollar price reduction is of higher value to the poor than the rich.”

Trade agreements also made it easier to export U.S.-made products and services by eliminating both tariff and nontariff barriers in other markets (which, as Trump himself has noted, have generally been higher than barriers in the U.S. market). They thereby reduced the impetus to move production abroad to serve those markets, where nearly all global consumers live, and supported jobs that on average pay more than nonexport-related jobs in the United States. Since the inception of the WTO, exports of goods have grown more than 150 percent, adjusted for inflation, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. (Imports grew more than 250 percent adjusted for inflation over this period.) A U.S. Census Bureau report found, based on data from 1992 to 2019, that firms engaged in trade “exhibit higher net job creation rates than non-traders controlling for firm size, age, and sector.” In an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Gary Hufbauer and Megan Hogan calculated that U.S. GDP in 2022 would have been $2.6 trillion lower without gains from post–World War II trade—averaging to gains of $19,500 per American household.



Trade policy has also worked to level the playing field for American workers by pressing other countries to adopt better environmental, labor, intellectual property, regulatory, and anticorruption practices. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example, would have not only opened markets long closed to U.S. products, such as Japan, but also introduced enforceable standards on labor rights, environmental protection, and subsidization of state-owned enterprises in emerging markets, such as Malaysia and Vietnam—key ingredients of “fair trade.” In effect, the TPP dangled a reduction of already low U.S. tariffs as an incentive to get other countries to adopt policies consistent with U.S. interests and values while creating a U.S.-led alternative to Chinese economic power. (Before the first Trump administration, U.S. tariffs were relatively low, with the average applied tariff around three percent and significant restrictions in place in few sectors, such as shoes, clothing, sugar, dairy, and trucks.)

Yet such arguments have always been a tough sell politically, since the benefits of trade liberalization are broadly shared but largely invisible. No one walks out of a Walmart and exclaims, “Thank goodness for the WTO!” Meanwhile, the costs of trade are acutely felt by a small number of workers in specific industries. Globalization could be blamed for introducing competition from other countries with lower labor costs, putting downward pressure on manufacturing wages in the United States and creating incentives to move production abroad.

The China shock was an especially dramatic demonstration of this dynamic—less because of its overall scale than because of how concentrated its losses were in particular communities. The economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson concluded that between 1999 and 2011, Chinese imports resulted in the loss of some two million jobs, including one million manufacturing jobs. That loss is relatively modest in the context of the overall U.S. economy: every year, some 50 million American workers experience “job separations,” including resignations and layoffs. Yet these losses were geographically concentrated, resulting in the devastation of individual communities heavily reliant on industries that could not withstand a flood of Chinese imports, with the effects of closures spilling over into the rest of the local economy. Although “creative destruction” might have worked in aggregate, it meant little to specific towns or cities that had no way to replace gutted industries with new ones on a relevant timeline. And there was little understanding of the need for domestic policies, such as effective worker transition assistance, lifelong learning and upskilling programs, and place-based economic development strategies, that aggressively addressed the localized effects of globalization—a gap that has yet to be adequately addressed.

For years now, Washington's response to the shortcomings of the global trading system has been ad hoc at best. The first Trump administration imposed broad tariffs on China and targeted ones on allies and partners. It also negotiated what was essentially a purchase and sale agreement, rather than a trade agreement, with China, requiring it to buy more commodities and other products from the United States (which China did not in the end fulfill).

The Biden administration kept most of the Trump tariffs in place and added a few more. Despite questioning both the economic and national security value of tariffs imposed on Chinese products such as footwear and apparel, the administration did not want to “reward” Beijing by reducing them. It also innovated the use of export controls, foreign investment restrictions, and industrial policy. Although such measures were focused on strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles, administration officials did not fully develop a clear framework, with guardrails and limiting principles, to prevent the list of products and technologies essential to national security from growing indefinitely and evolving over time into a policy of simple protectionism. Initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity and the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity aimed to draw countries and their supply chains closer to the United States, but without the possibility of market access—deemed too politically sensitive—the impact was marginal.

Still, the Biden administration called for reform of the WTO, rather than for its destruction, and in most ways acted according to the principles of the rules-based system. The second Trump administration appears to have a different goal in mind: nothing less than the dismantling of the global trading system, rooted in the president's strong preference for unilateral action and belief that bilateral trade deficits are an existential threat. On April 2, his so-called Liberation Day, Trump declared a national emergency and announced “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50 percent on scores of countries. Since then, he has repeatedly moved the goalposts for agreements while also threatening tariffs as a cudgel on nontrade issues, such as migration, fentanyl, the war in Ukraine, and even the judicial system in Brazil. And he has sought to impose “deals” unilaterally when negotiations have run aground.



Wherever tariff levels precisely land, the current trade wars are almost certain to end with significantly higher barriers to trade. These will impose both costs on American consumers and challenges to American businesses. More than half of U.S. imports today are intermediate goods—inputs into the production of final goods. Accordingly, more expensive or less accessible inputs will make U.S. products less competitive, as was well documented after Trump's first term. In 2018, Trump imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel and a ten percent tariff on aluminum. “Tariffs on steel may have led to an increase of roughly 1,000 jobs in steel production,” the economists Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox later concluded. “However, increased costs of inputs facing U.S. firms relative to foreign rivals due to the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum likely have resulted in 75,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in firms where steel or aluminum are an input into production.” The Council on Foreign Relations' Benn Steil and Elisabeth Harding calculated that productivity, or output per hour, in the U.S. steel industry has dropped by 32 percent since 2017. If the Trump administration's goal is to create more manufacturing jobs, its approach is likely to have exactly the opposite effect.

Then there is the cost of retaliation and imitation, as other governments respond and follow the U.S. example by imposing tariffs and restrictions of their own. If countries retaliate, it will harm U.S. exports, including agriculture. Imitation might also involve radically expanding the use of the emergency and national security justifications for weaponizing trade, as the United States has. The U.S. position has long been that no one else could tell the United States what was necessary for its national security. But until recently, Washington rarely invoked the national security justification. Trump has expanded the use of this tool to impose restrictions on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, including from close allies. Other countries have since followed suit. In 2024, a rec­ord 95 “Technical Barriers to Trade” regulations at the WTO cited national security concerns, applied to everything from cocoa beans to alcoholic beverages to animal feed.

Exacerbating all these costs is the uncertainty that results from Trump's approach. Consumers, companies, and investors tend to sit on the sidelines when they are unsure about the general economic outlook and the specific tariffs or other trade measures they might face. The potential impact of tariffs on reducing growth and even triggering a recession could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.

The United States thus finds itself the subject of a grand experiment in which long-standing assumptions about economics and global trade are being questioned, with significant near-term costs and uncertain long-term benefits. The Trump administration has, in effect, turned the political economy of trade on its head. The costs of its policies are likely to be highly visible and felt immediately by most Americans, while the promised benefits, to the extent they come, are likely to be enjoyed by comparably few workers several years in the future. It will soon become clear if the public is willing to accept near-term sacrifice for the sake of Trump's vision for reindustrializing the U.S. economy. But no matter how fierce the eventual political reaction, there is no going back to the trading system that existed before.

Given the experience of the first half of the twentieth century in trade and beyond, it would seem obvious that international cooperation achieves better outcomes than the raw exercise of unconstrained power. Yet today's trade policy represents a return to a form of power politics in which might makes right. The United States is acting unilaterally because, as the largest economy and consumer market in the world, it can. And China, lip service to multilateralism notwithstanding, is increasingly doing the same.

Contagion could follow, spurring cycles of unilateralism and transactionalism that could easily spin out of control. Some countries might follow the current U.S. example and explicitly reject the rules-based system. Others might follow China's example and celebrate the system in word while undermining it in deed. Either way, the proliferating barriers to trade will reduce growth and damage productivity. Gutted rules will create uncertainty and friction, which could lead to instability and conflict.

Over time, the global economy could come to resemble the pre–World War II system, which was marked by the frequent use of trade as a weapon. For dominant economies, the short-term benefits of this raw use of power and disregard for constraints might appear to balance out the costs, but over the longer term, there are likely to be unintended consequences. Meanwhile, smaller and poorer countries will find themselves with insufficient market power to use tariffs and other trade restrictions in the same way.

Other governments may at first strive to maintain the old order, no matter what the United States and China do, well aware that an abandonment of the system altogether would mean a return to a beggar-thy-neighbor world. For some countries, this effort reflects an ideological commitment to the multilateral rules-based system. The entire European project, for example, is rooted in the notion of rules and regulatory-based integration, making it difficult for the European Union to pursue an entirely unilateralist strategy. Developing countries, meanwhile, lack the power and leverage to influence major trading partners and so have relied on the WTO and the dispute-resolution system to level the playing field.

There is thus likely to be a caucus of countries that continue to extol the virtues of the multilateral rules-based system, hoping that ultimately the United States will return to that system and China will modify its economic strategy to comply with it. This effort would play out in much the same way as the climate change regime has, with some countries coming together around a set of rules while many of the most important players choose their own paths instead. And as in the case of climate change, this caucus of countries will likely be frustrated.

If an anarchical trade system is undesirable, but a return to the status quo ante is impossible, that leaves one clear task: developing a new system of rules even as the global economy moves away from a fully multilateral rules-based system. The most viable option is to build a new system around open plurilateralism: coalitions of countries that share interests in specific areas and come together to adopt high standards on certain issues, and then remain open to other countries that share similar interests and are prepared to implement those standards.

For some countries, these coalitions could focus on trade liberalization, based on a shared willingness to provide market access to one another, in whole or in part, in order to further integration and economic efficiency. For others, coalitions could be avenues for pursuing regulatory harmonization or taking on new issues, such as AI, even if in an informal and nonbinding manner, similar to the role of the Financial Stability Board, an international body formed after the 2008 financial crisis that coordinates recommendations for financial regulation. And with any of these, any individual government could simply opt not to join if it considers the costs of compromise on the relevant issues greater than the benefits.

In some cases, a coalition of countries with similar national security interests could coordinate on technology transfer and industrial policy—in other words, around a common approach to restricting trade rather than facilitating it. A coalition could, for example, discourage its members from importing certain products and services, such as telecommunications infrastructure, from countries that pose a national security threat while encouraging the development of secure supply chains among its members. Or it could align export controls and establish common rules for the use of state subsidies. The United States could forge a coalition aimed at building a competitive, collective industrial base to meet the challenge posed by China's scale, as former Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and the Council on Foreign Relations' Rush Doshi recently recommended in these pages.



How should the United States incentivize countries to join such coalitions? The negotiation of traditional trade-liberalizing agreements appears to be off the table politically, at least for now. Threatening to impose tariffs—that is, using sticks rather than carrots—might secure agreement in the short run, but to be durable, the other members of the coalition must see it as in their interest to align themselves with the United States rather than hedge their bets with China or remain on the sidelines altogether.

One option for the United States is to take advantage of its innovation ecosystem—the unique combination of world-class universities, R & D investment, rule of law, deep capital markets, access to risk capital, and entrepreneurial culture. Many of these assets are currently under threat by Trump administration policies, but over the long run, the value of maintaining U.S. scientific and technological leadership should be self-evident, particularly in the context of great-power rivalry. The U.S. innovation ecosystem might evolve but survive. A club of countries could secure preferential access to these opportunities and to those offered by other members of the club in exchange for alignment on a broader array of economic and national security interests.

These coalitions would be open, meaning that countries that are able and willing to live by the standards are eligible to join. Some might be quite small, focused on securing semiconductor supply chains, for example, and include, say, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. Others could represent larger groups of countries willing to agree to a broader set of rules to govern trade and investment relations generally, such as the successor to the TPP, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, which was finalized without U.S. participation. The membership of coalitions could grow over time, and there could be overlapping membership among different coalitions.



In the absence of a fundamental change in Beijing's economic strategy and more, it is hard to imagine China as a candidate for membership in a coalition of this sort that involves the United States any time soon (although there might be room for coalitions cooperating on global public goods, such as pandemic preparedness). It is possible, over time, that Chinese policymakers will change strategy based on their own judgments, driven by demographic, financial, and other pressures. A structure of open plurilateralism, built with allies and partners, might expedite that decision. But after years of trying, U.S. policymakers should by now be quite humble about their ability to directly convince Beijing to change its approach and instead focus on using coalitions to shape China's external environment.

In this world, the WTO might wither entirely, or it might persist in rump form for countries that have no more attractive coalitions to join. It could also be the repository for technical work and a venue for dispute settlement for countries that opt in. The network of free-trade agreements would continue to exist and could become the foundation for broader coalitions, such as the EU potentially following the United Kingdom's lead in joining the CPTPP.

A key benefit of open plurilateralism is the flexibility it provides. Not being beholden to holdouts in a system in which each country has a veto, the approach creates opportunities to move forward on issues among those with a common view and a capacity to take on new issues as they arise and new members as they meet the standards. In terms of economic efficiency, this is a second-best solution. By definition, the benefits would be shared only among members. Principles such as MFN would be effectively consigned to the dustbin of history. And the variable geometry of custom-tailored plurilateral agreements could be as messy and inefficient as a spaghetti bowl of bilateral trade agreements. But although such a network would be more complex than the multilateral trading system, it might also prove more politically sustainable. It is a pragmatic response to the current challenge: maintaining at least some rules without the multilateral rules-based system.

Whatever the benefits of the postwar global trading system—for growth, poverty alleviation, consumer welfare, and more—there were, at the end of the day, losers as well as winners. Neither the costs nor the benefits were equally shared, and the distributional issues rarely got adequate attention from policymakers. These downsides will remain even in the best-designed system, and it will be essential to find better solutions for the harms. Any new system must come with an accompanying set of domestic policies designed to ensure that American workers and communities can thrive in a rapidly changing economy, whether that change comes from trade, technology, or immigration. Past administrations have made modest attempts at place-based economic development and worker retraining, but never with the seriousness of purpose or degree of prioritization that will be necessary.

Such policies may be even more urgently needed in the wake of the Trump trade wars. The costs of the current approach—in terms of growth, inflation, and productivity—are likely to fall most on the people Trump claims to be championing. Low-income Americans spend a disproportionate share of their income on imported goods. Industries that employ blue-collar workers depend on imported inputs. And the incomes of farmers and ranchers are highly sensitive to retaliation by other countries.

Meanwhile, as the United States grapples with those consequences, the coming impact of artificial intelligence on workers could well dwarf the impact of globalization. The China shock contributed to the elimination of an estimated two million jobs between 1999 and 2011; the widespread application of AI could eliminate tens of millions of jobs over a similar period. So while attention is focused on tariffs, policymakers should be devoting at least as much effort to preparing for the AI-driven restructuring of the American workforce. As with trade, the benefits might be widely shared. But in this case, the costs might be, as well.

Ahead of Presidents Trump and Putin meeting in Alaska this week, Russian hockey stars tell CNN's Fred Pleitgen they hope sport could help bring the two nations -- and people -- closer.

Al Jazeera correspondent Anas Al-Sharif was killed in a targeted strike in Gaza on Sunday alongside multiple other journalists. The Israeli military accused Al-Sharif of leading a Hamas cell, an allegation Al-Sharif had previously denied.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Monday that Australia will recognize a Palestinian state at the General Assembly of the United Nations in September. Australia joins the UK, France and Canada in announcing plans to recognize a Palestinian state. The move leaves the US increasingly isolated from some of its closest allies in its defense of Israel's escalating military campaign that's decimated the besieged enclave after almost two years of war.

Wildfires have been raging across Europe over the past few days, with several countries, such as Italy and Spain, experiencing severe heatwaves.

A 14-year-old boy was killed by an airdropped aid package in Gaza on Saturday, according to Al-Awda hospital. The UN has warned that airdrops of aid are ineffective, expensive and dangerous in heavily populated areas.

In the UK, hundreds have been arrested by London police for protesting the British government's decision to ban the group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws. The group, which opposes weapons sales to Israel, is challenging the ban. Earlier, police had cautioned they would arrest anyone showing support for the proscribed group. CNN's Isobel Yeung reports.

As US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to meet in Alaska to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine, residents in Kyiv told CNN how they felt about the meeting that, so far, excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

As US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to meet in Alaska to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine, residents in Kyiv told CNN how they felt about the meeting that, so far, excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

President Donald Trump said he'll be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss a potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine that could include “some swapping of territories.” But as CNN's Nick Paton Walsh explains, the conditions around Friday's summit so wildly favor Moscow, it's hard to see how a deal emerges that does not eviscerate Ukraine.

Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a video address after President Trump's announcement to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin that Ukraine is ""ready to work together with President Trump,"" but quashed the idea of any territory concessions.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's military escalation in Gaza, which he claims will capture the city and eliminate Hamas, brings doubtful Israeli citizens to the streets in protest. Palestinians in Gaza scramble for safety and brace for impact as the war intensifies.

As Palestinians rushed toward an aid package airdropped in Gaza City, a balcony collapsed under the weight of the crowd. It is not clear how many people were injured in this incident.

Israel's security cabinet has approved a plan to take over Gaza City. The deadline for the first phase of the offensive is October 7, according to an Israeli source.

Live Updates


• DC crackdown: President Donald Trump announced he is placing the Washington, DC, police department “under direct federal control” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation's capital. The move comes after Trump ordered a seven-day surge in federal law enforcement within the city last week, pointing to several high-profile crimes.
    


• Later this week: Looking ahead to his Friday summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said Volodymyr Zelensky “could” attend but expressed skepticism that the Ukrainian leader's presence would make a difference in reaching a peace deal. US officials are rushing to finalize the details of the meeting in Alaska.
    


• Revenue for export licenses agreement: Meanwhile, chip giants Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for export licenses, an unprecedented quid pro quo arrangement that came together after Nvidia's CEO met with Trump last week.
    


            The Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department, including Chief Pamela Smith, along with Mayor Muriel Bowser, did not know of President Donald Trump's move to take over the department before his announcement Monday, three sources familiar told CNN.
    


            Bowser has remained largely deferential to Trump's moves over the past few days to increase the presence of federal agents on the streets of DC. The Democratic mayor went so far as to highlight her “shared priorities” with Trump during an interview Sunday, saying she is “interested in being in neighborhoods and fighting crime.”
    


            Requests for comment to both the MPD and the mayor's office on Trump's takeover have gone unanswered.
    


            The details of Trump's move and how it could change MPD's strategies to address crime are sparse, one source told CNN, noting that leadership has been out of the loop.
    


            One source in the DC government told CNN they were surprised by the announcement Monday, especially because Trump and Bowser have been on OK terms recently and because the White House and the mayor's office have previously been in almost constant contact.
    


            DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb, meanwhile, slammed Trump's moves in a statement.
    


                    “The Administration's actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful. There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year. We are considering all of our options and will do what's necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,” he said.
                





            President Donald Trump said Monday that Ukrainian President Zelensky “could” attend his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday but expressed skepticism that it would make a difference in reaching a peace deal.
    


                    “He wasn't a part of it. I would say he could go, but he's been to a lot of meetings. You know, he's been there for three and a half years. Nothing happened,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
                





            “We're going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin, and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” Trump said.
    


            “How will you know that?” a reporter pressed.
    


            “Because that's what I do. I make deals,” Trump said.
    


            The president later added that a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be necessary.
    


            “Ultimately, I'm going to put the two of them in a room. I'll be there, or I won't be there, and I think it'll get solved,” Trump said.
    


            The president said that “there could be many definitions” of a good deal, but he also seemed to lower expectations ahead of Friday's summit.
    


            “I expect to have a meeting with Putin that I think it'll be good, but it might be bad,” Trump said.
    


            House Oversight Chair James Comer praised President Donald Trump for placing Washington, DC, police under federal control and said he plans to follow up with a hearing with city officials when lawmakers return to Washington.
    


            The committee confirmed Monday it had received notification from the White House about the president's federal takeover of DC police.
    


                    President Trump is rightly using executive power to take bold and necessary action to crack down on crime and restore law and order in Washington, DC.
                


                    Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky
                


            Comer said the committee will hold a congressional hearing in September with DC District Attorney General Brian Schwalb, DC Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Mayor Muriel Bowser. Lawmakers are currently in their home districts for Congress' August recess.
    


            The panel, Comer said, “is also advancing legislative solutions to protect Americans in their capital city.”
    


For context: Trump can retain control of the city's police department for a longer period if he notifies the chairs and ranking members of the congressional committees that handle legislative matters related to Washington, DC, including the House Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Any request of over 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            As President Donald Trump formally declared a public safety emergency in Washington, DC, and federalized the local police, one significant budget issue facing the city went without mention Monday at the White House.
    


            House Republicans have yet to restore $1 billion in funding for the District of Columbia, following a budgetary fight in Congress earlier this year. The Senate passed a funding bill that restored funding, but the measure stalled in the House and remains in procedural limbo. Local leaders have warned the hole could result in cuts to a wide range of city services, including police.
    


            The White House urged the House to “immediately” pass the fix. Speaker Mike Johnson said in May that he would work to pass the bill “as quickly as possible,” but no action has been taken on the matter for months.
    


            “I don't like being up here, talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was,” Trump said Monday, delivering a bleak and blistering assessment of Washington, DC, despite police statistics that show falling violent crime.
    


            The budget fight in Congress left a hole of about $1 billion after DC was forced to revert to last year's funding levels for the city.
    


            In March, the Senate approved a measure to allow Washington, DC, to maintain control over its funds after Democrats warned the Republican funding package would cut $1.1 billion of the city's funding.
    


            Instead of taking up that measure, the House passed a series of Republican policies in June to impose on the Democratic-run city, including a bill that would prohibit non-US citizens from voting in the district that was never taken up by the Senate.
    


            President Donald Trump said he's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday to see what the parameters of a peace deal could be before he speaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders.
    


            “I'm going to meet with President Putin and we're going to see what he has in mind, and if it's a fair deal I'll reveal it to the European Union leaders and to the NATO leaders and also to President Zelensky,” Trump said, noting that he'll call Zelensky first “out of respect.”
    


            But Trump stressed that it's not up to him to make a deal.
    


            “I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal. I think a deal should be made for both,” Trump said, adding that the next meeting should include both Putin and Zelensky.
    


            And he cautioned that Friday's meeting may not necessarily result in any movement.
    


            “Now I may leave and say ‘good luck' and that'll be the end. I may say, ‘This is not going to be settled,'” Trump said.
    


            “I mean there are those that believe that Putin wanted all of Ukraine. I happen to be one of them by the way,” Trump said.
    


            President Donald Trump left the door open to further extending a trade truce with China, saying Monday that he's been “dealing very nicely” with the nation.
    


            “We'll see what happens,” Trump said during a White House press briefing. “They've been dealing quite nicely. The relationship is very good with President Xi and myself.”
    


Some context: The current 90-day pause on a series of aggressive trade penalties that the two countries agreed to in May is set to expire on Tuesday.
    


            US and Chinese officials have since suggested that the truce could be extended, though the two sides have yet to reach a formal agreement.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, telling reporters at the White House that officials will make a decision in the “next few weeks.”
    


            “We're only looking at that,” Trump said. “That's early.”
    


                    “Some people like it. Some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana, because if it does bad for the children, it does bad for people that are older than children. But we're looking at reclassification,” Trump said.
                





Some context: CNN reported last week that Trump is privately mulling how to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug.
    


            This would move marijuana from its classification as a Schedule 1 drug to Schedule 3, which includes “drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.
    


            Nearly a year ago, Trump suggested his return to the White House would usher in a new era for marijuana, one that would make it easier for adults to access safe products and give states greater leeway to pursue legalization. He signaled support for removing marijuana from the same legal category as dangerous narcotics like heroin. The pronouncement set him apart from many of his Republican predecessors and came as Trump courted younger Americans, minority groups and libertarian-leaning voters.
    


            Charles Allen, a member of the DC Council, quickly slammed President Donald Trump's move to take over the capital's police force, writing on social media Monday that the action is an “extreme, outrageous, and dangerous move for our city and the safety of all our residents.”
    


            Allen, who represents an area of DC that includes parts of downtown and the Capitol Hill neighborhood, wrote that “today's announcement will put untrained and unaccountable members of the military in an untenable position in our communities.”
    


                    “Over the last two years, DC has experienced a 52% drop in violent crime and is now at a 30-year low. While any crime is one too many, every local leader in DC is committed to the work and progress of safer communities and preventing violence,” Allen wrote.
                





            He concluded: “It's unnecessary, unwarranted, & a dangerous escalation of power in the Nation's Capital simply because he can.”
    


Some context: Trump has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC. But so far this year, overall crime numbers are lower than in 2024, according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC's Metropolitan Police Department — following a  similar trend of declining crime rates in major US cities.
    


            President Donald Trump said the Department of Defense stands ready to deploy active-duty military to address crime in Washington, but added that he doesn't think it'll be necessary.
    


                    “You're going to have a lot of essentially military — and we will bring in the military if it's needed, by the way,” Trump told reporters in the White House Briefing Room. “We're going to have National Guard, but (Defense Secretary) Pete Hegseth will tell you about, we will bring in the military, if needed… I don't think we'll need it, I think we've got so many great people, including the people that are in the police department.”
                





            Trump later added that “if necessary, we're going to move service members directly to joining the guardsmen.”
    


            Per Hegseth, the operationalization of the National Guard will be led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll.
    


            “You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week,” Hegseth said Monday. “At your direction as well, sir, there are other units we are prepared to bring in — other National Guard units, other specialized units.”
    


            President Donald Trump said that his administration is going to change the statues relating to cash bail in cities like New York City, Chicago and Washington, DC.
    


            “This dire public safety crisis stems directly from the abject failures of the city's local leadership. The ‘radical left' city council adopted no cash bail. By the way, every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster. That's what started the problem,” Trump claimed at a news conference.
    


            DC largely removed cash bail in 1992.
    


            Referencing New York and Chicago, Trump said they would “change the statue” regarding cash bail systems with the help of Congress.
    


            “We're going to end that in Chicago,” Trump said. “We're going to change the statute, and I'm going to have to get the Republicans to vote, because the Democrats are weak on crime.”
    


            “But we're going to change no cash bail. We're going to change the statute and get rid of some of the other things, and we'll count on the Republicans in Congress and Senate to vote,” Trump added.
    


            President Donald Trump said he's embarrassed that he has to address crime in Washington, DC, ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.
    


                    “It's embarrassing for me to be up here. You know I'm going to see Putin,” Trump told reporters at the White House this morning, adding that, “I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was.”
                





            US officials are rushing to finalize the details of a summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska on Friday.
    


            It was Trump's decision to call Monday's event to talk about crime in DC, where so far this year, overall crime numbers are lower than last year's, according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC's Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            President Donald Trump said he is designating Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.
    


            Trump said that Cole is one of the “top in the country” and told him to run the department “tough.”
    


            Cole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23. During his confirmation process, Trump touted Cole's work in Virginia overseeing 11 state public safety agencies with more than 19,000 employees.
    


            President Donald Trump on Monday announced the federal government would take control of the DC Metropolitan Police Department to address crime.
    


            The Home Rule Act of 1973 allows the president to take control of the city's police for 48 hours if he “determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist,” which requires the department's use for federal purposes. Trump said Monday he was declaring a public safety emergency.
    


            Before Monday, there had never been a federal takeover of DC police under the Home Rule Act.
    


            The president can retain control of the department for a longer period if he notifies the chairs and ranking members of the congressional committees that handle legislative matters pertaining to DC. It is not clear whether the president has taken that step.
    


            Any request of control over the city's police department for over 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is placing the DC Metropolitan Police Department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to the city, saying the move is aimed at restoring order in the nation's capital.
    


            “I'm officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, you know what that is, and placing the DC Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control,” Trump said during a White House news conference.
    


            The president told a crowd of reporters that his actions come as “something's out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly, like we did on the southern border.”
    


            Trump also announced the deployment of National Guard troops to assist local law enforcement.
    


            “I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC, and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly,” Trump added.
    


            The Home Rule Act of 1973 allows the president to take control of the city's police for 48 hours if he “determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist,” which requires the department's use for federal purposes. The president can retain control of the department for a longer period if he notifies the chairs and ranking members of the congressional committees that handle legislative matters pertaining to DC. Any request of control over the city's police department for over 30 days must be passed into law.
    


            The president indicated he intends to extend the federal takeover beyond the initial 48-hour window and will formally notify the relevant parties.
    


            “I'll be making the appropriate notifications to Congress and to the mayor,” Trump said.
    


            “We will have full, seamless, integrated cooperation at all levels of law enforcement, and will deploy officers across the district with an overwhelming presence,” he added.
    


            Officers, Trump said, will have authority to do “whatever the hell they want,” he said, adding this will go beyond the country's capital. “We're not going to lose our cities over this, and this will go further.”
    


            Flanked by top administration officials, Trump also vowed to take aggressive action to address homelessness and blight in the capital. “We have slums here. We're getting rid of them. I know it's not politically correct,” Trump said.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            President Donald Trump is expected to announce the activation of hundreds of DC National Guard troops this morning as part of his effort to address crime in the nation's capital, two US officials told CNN.
    


            The DC National Guard forces are expected to be providing safety and security support to law enforcement, though one of the officials said many of the operational specifics still remain unclear, such as where they will be placed throughout the city, what their command-and-control chain will be, and for how long they will be activated.
    


            Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are expected to be at the announcement with Trump.
    


            The official said up to roughly 800 troops in the DC National Guard are expected to be activated. Among the subordinate units of the DC Guard is a military police battalion, complete with maintenance and medical support, and an aviation support battalion.
    


            While National Guard units around the country report to their state's governors, the DC National Guard falls under the authority of the president, which is typically delegated to the secretary of the Army.
    


            President Donald Trump says he will announce a plan Monday morning to make Washington, DC, “GREAT AGAIN!” and “stop violent crime” in the nation's capital.
    


            As president, Trump has broad authority over parts of the city's affairs, including aspects of law enforcement. But he will need approval from Congress to exert control over DC in the way he says he wants to.
    


            There are dozens of federal law enforcement agencies in the city that answer to the Trump administration, and the president has already ordered a surge of hundreds of federal officers supplement the city's police department in some neighborhoods.
    


            Those include plans for scores of FBI agents to patrol the city's streets. Trump also has the authority as president to deploy the DC National Guard.
    


            DC is managed under Home Rule, a 1973 law that gave Congress oversight and authority over the capital city but allowed district residents to have some control over how it is run.
    


            This law would need to be overturned if Trump wants to completely federalize the district, but such a move is unlikely to happen under today's closely divided Congress. Trump has said he wants his administration to look into turning over Home Rule.
    


            Still, the law does allow the president to temporarily take over the city's police department.
    


            “Washington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today!” he said Monday morning on Truth Social.
    


            US officials are rushing to finalize details ahead of Friday's summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, with both logistical and geopolitical issues still unsettled four days ahead of the momentous sit-down.
    


            As of Monday, no venue for the summit had been announced. Administration officials were still making their way to Alaska — selected for its centrality to Washington and Moscow — to scope out where, exactly, the US and Russian presidents would meet.
    


            Officials were also working to clarify the contours of the two men's expected discussion, which Trump hopes can yield significant progress toward ending the war in Ukraine.
    


            And a number of questions hang over the preparations. Among them: whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would be invited.
    


            Ukrainian officials made clear Zelensky was prepared to travel to Alaska if invited by Trump. But they also acknowledged much would hinge on how the Trump-Putin meeting unfolds.
    


            President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day” in Washington, DC, in a social media post this morning ahead of a White House news conference.
    


                    “LIBERATION DAY IN D.C. WE ARE TAKING OUR CAPITAL BACK!!!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.






            Trump is expected to speak this morning on safety in the nation's capital, though he has yet to provide specific details. It comes despite a preliminary year-to-date comparison from DC Police showing that 2025 crime numbers in the city are lower than last year's.
    


            Trump has threatened to assert federal control over the capital city, following an assault last week on a well-known employee of the Department of Government Efficiency.
    


            The president claimed the country's capital “will be liberated today” in a follow-up social media post on Monday.
    


            “Washington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today! Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR. I will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN! The days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER! I quickly fixed the Border (ZERO ILLEGALS in last 3 months!), D.C. is next!!!” Trump wrote.



            President Donald Trump has called a news conference at the White House today to address his federal crackdown on Washington, DC.
    


            In a series of posts on social media over the weekend, Trump claimed his announcement — scheduled for 10 a.m. ET in the press briefing room — will “essentially stop violent crime” in the nation's capital.
    


            He also said he will announce “Beautification” and “Cleanliness” efforts, which would apparently involve removing homeless people from the city.
    


            “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital,” Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday.  “The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong. It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border.”
    


            The post included pictures of tents and trash throughout the city.
    


            The president said DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is “a good person who has tried,” but claimed the city “only gets dirtier and less attractive.”
    


            We'll be covering the press conference as it happens today. Stay with us for the latest.
    


Some context: The Trump administration ordered an increase of federal law enforcement in the US capital last week, deploying officials from different agencies in a push to crack down on crime.
    


            In announcing the increase, the White House pointed to several high-profile crimes in DC, including the killing of two Israeli Embassy staff members in May.
    


            But according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC Police, 2025 crime numbers are lower than last year's.
    


            The federal government's plans for a surge of law enforcement in Washington calls for up to 130 FBI agents to patrol with officers from the city-run DC Metropolitan Police Department, according to one person familiar.
    


            President Donald Trump launched the initiative last week with a White House official saying Saturday up to 450 federal law enforcement officers are expected participate.
    


            It's not typical for FBI agents to patrol with local police departments. The Washington Post first reported on the use of FBI agents.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Caffeinated coffees are mostly free of toxins, with a few exceptions","https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/11/health/coffee-toxins-study-wellness","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            That cup of joe that jolts you awake in the morning is pretty safe when it comes to contaminants and toxins, a new investigation has found. Well … almost.
    


            “While some contaminants were present, most were found at minimal levels and well below the European Union's safety limits per 6-ounce serving. This means coffee is generally safe,” said Molly Hamilton, executive director of the nonprofit Clean Label Project, which conducted the investigation into caffeinated coffees.
    


            That's great news because coffee has a stellar résumé: Studies have found drinking about 3 cups of black coffee a day provides health benefits, such as reducing risk for such issues as heart disease, multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, liver disease, prostate cancer, stroke, dementia and more.
    


            But here's the grind — the testing found traces of a worrisome herbicide called glyphosate and one of its byproducts. Glyphosate is a popular herbicide that has been linked to hormone disruptions and neurotoxic effects, including the development of autism and other developmental disorders in children.
    


            The first MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) Commission report, released in May, raised concerns about the impact of glyphosate and other pesticides on children's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory bodies, however, say numerous studies and risk assessments have shown no adverse effects of glyphosate at levels found in the food supply.
    


            In addition to glyphosate, testing found some coffees also contained small amounts of phthalates, a plasticizer found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children's toys.
    


            Phthalates have been linked with reproductive problems, such as genital malformations and undescended testes in baby boys and lower sperm counts and testosterone levels in adult males. Studies have also linked phthalates to asthma, childhood obesity and cancer.
    


            Testing found the highest levels of phthalates in coffee sold in cans, followed by pods and finally bags. The reason for that isn't yet clear, “so our next study is going to be analyzing the packaging assembly line to discover why there is a change in contaminants,” Hamilton said.
    


            “The Clean Label Project plays an important role in post-market testing for contaminants in everyday consumer products, including this recent report on coffee,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer for the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group that maintains a database on personal care products that contain toxins.
    


            “The higher phthalate levels found in coffee pods and canned coffee suggest that packaging could be a meaningful source of exposure to these chemicals of concern,” Andrews said.
    


            The National Coffee Association, which represents the US coffee industry told CNN that it was “highly irresponsible to mislead Americans about the safety of their favorite beverage.”
    


            “Decades of independent scientific evidence show that coffee drinkers live longer, healthier lives,” NCA President and CEO William “Bill” Murray said in an email.
    


            The Clean Label Project measures levels of heavy metals, pesticides and plasticizers in food and consumer products. The organization also checks to see whether the tested products' labels list those contaminants.
    


            To do the testing, Clean Label obtained samples of coffee from 45 popular brands — which they did not name. Coffee beans were grown in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kenya, Peru and Hawaii.
    


            A certified lab conducted over 7,000 tests looking for pesticides, including glyphosate; heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium; mycotoxins, which are toxic chemical compounds produced by some molds that grow on crops; and phthalates, a plasticizer found in consumer products such as food wrapping, food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children's toys.
    


Viva la coffee shop: Why we need to meet up in them, now!



            The tests found scant glyphosate, but “significant” amounts of aminomethylphosphonic acid, or AMPA, a byproduct of glyphosate as it breaks down in the environment, according to the report.
    


            The half-life of AMPA is longer than that of glyphosate, which means it can persist in the environment and is easily absorbed by plants from soil and water.  In addition, AMPA has been shown to damage cellular DNA in prostate cells and cause an increased risk of liver inflammation and metabolic disorders in young adults.
    


            Testing found organic coffees bested conventional coffees in total amounts of contaminants, but there was one oddity — there were levels of AMPA in all of the 12 organic coffees tested. Of the 45 samples of conventionally grown coffees, only 29 tested positive for aminomethylphosphonic acid, according to the report.
    


            While certified organic coffee growers cannot use pesticides like glyphosate, it's possible for organic fields to be contaminated by runoff from neighboring conventional farms, Hamilton said.
    


            “Still, the detection of AMPA in 100% of organic samples we tested is definitely a wake-up call,” she said. “We definitely need stronger safeguards and greater transparency in our food system.”
    


            Levels of heavy metals depended on where the coffee was grown. Africa has some of the lowest levels of heavy metals, while the highest were found in Hawaiian coffee. Hawaii, however, is a volcanic island and therefore expected to have more significant levels of heavy metals in the soil.
    


            An analysis also found 100% of the tested coffee samples contained small amounts of acrylamide, a colorless, odorless chemical formed when certain foods are cooked at high temperatures, such as when frying, baking and roasting.
    


            Acrylamide has been linked to cancer in animals when they are exposed to extremely high doses. However, the chemical is not thought to be toxic to humans at small levels of consumption. Despite that, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised manufacturers to attempt to lower levels in the food supply.
    


            Clean Label's testing found levels of acrylamide varied with the degree of roasting of coffee beans. The highest levels of acrylamide were found in medium roasts, followed by light roasts and dark roasts.
    


            “The dark coffees are the best choice because they are roasted at lower temperatures for a longer period of time so acrylamide levels don't rise,” Hamilton explained. “The light coffees are roasted minimally, so here too, acrylamide levels don't build up.
    


            “However, medium roasts have the higher levels of acrylamide because they are roasted at higher temperatures long enough to darken the beans,” she said.
    


            What could a coffee lover take away from the testing?
    


            “When you decide which coffee to buy, choose darker or the lightest roasts in bags or pods and consider where coffee is grown, which can impact the levels of heavy metals,” Hamilton said.
    


            “But I want to stress that it's important to put these findings into context,” she added. “Caffeinated coffee is still one of the cleanest product categories we've ever tested.
    


            “Our report isn't meant to raise alarm or keep consumers from drinking coffee, but rather to empower people on how to choose the cleanest, safest cup of coffee.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Food and Drug Administration official is getting his job back as the agency's top vaccine regulator, less than two weeks after he was pressured to step down at the urging of biotech executives, patient groups and conservative allies of President Donald Trump.

Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of the FDA center that regulates vaccines and biotech therapies, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Monday.

Prasad left the agency late last month after drawing ire of right-wing activists, including Laura Loomer, because of his past statements criticizing Trump.

A longtime a critic of FDA's standards for approving medicines, Prasad briefly ordered the maker of a gene therapy for Duchenne's muscular dystrophy to halt shipments after two patient deaths. But that action triggered pushback from the families of boys with the fatal condition and libertarian supporters of increased access to experimental medicines.

Prasad's decision to pause the therapy was criticized by The Wall Street Journal editorial board, former Republican Sen. Rick Santorum and others. The FDA swiftly reversed its decision suspending the therapy's use.

Loomer posted online that Prasad was “a progressive leftist saboteur,” noting his history of praising liberal independent Sen. Bernie Sanders.

But Prasad has had the backing of FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who have both called for scrutinizing the use of COVID-19 vaccines. Under Prasad, the FDA restricted the approval of two new COVID-19 shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna and set stricter testing requirements for future approvals.

MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Erin formed Monday in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean, just west of the Cabo Verde Islands, as Hurricane Henriette strengthened in the Pacific Ocean well away from Hawaii, forecasters said.

There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect for either storm, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, but Erin could become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season this week.

Erin was about 280 miles (451 kilometers) west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph), the NHC said. It was moving west at about 20 mph (32 kph).

Gradual strengthening was forecast over the next several days.

Hurricane Henriette was a Category 1 storm on Monday. Henriette had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (137 kph), the NHC said, and was about 525 miles (845 kilometers) northwest of Honolulu.

Additional strengthening was possible Monday, with weakening over the next few days.

Also in the Pacific, remnants of what once was Tropical Storm Ivo degenerated on Monday, the NHC said. They were about 615 miles (990 kilometers) west of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico, with no thread to land.

President Donald Trump says he's placing the Washington, D.C., police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to make the nation's capital safer

President Donald Trump said Monday he's placing the Washington, D.C., police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to make the nation's capital safer.

Trump has promised new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets.

Ahead of a news conference, Trump said Monday on social media that the nation's capital would be “LIBERATED today!” He said he would end the “days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people.”

Other news we're following:








Following President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that he would deploy National Guard troop to take over the city's police department, civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton warned of the move's potential long-term repercussions.

“Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” Sharpton said in a statement. 

“Let's call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration's handling of the Epstein files.”

Sharpton said D.C.'s leadership must push back on the president's use of Washington D.C. and its residents as “political props.”

“We cannot, nor will we, take this lying down,” he said. “Threatening to hit if people spit, calling all Black and low-income neighborhoods slums, and throwing away the humanity of homeless people by equating them to criminals is the beginning of the end if we don't stand up. This is the ultimate affront to justice and civil rights many of us have dedicated our lives to protecting and expanding.”

The top prosecutor in the nation's capital is calling Trump's move to take over the city's police department “unnecessary and unlawful.”

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb says crime is not an emergency levels. After a spike in 2023, violent crime hit its lowest level in decades last year and has continued to sink in 2025, he said.

The federal takeover could face a challenge in court, and Schwalb said his office is “considering all of our options.”

Trump said a couple of times during the press briefing that he would be traveling to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin -- but their summit is taking place in Alaska.

“I'm going to Russia on Friday,” he said in one instance.

He also made an erroneous reference at another time to the summit being next week instead.

The president began the briefing Monday by commenting on the large crowd of journalists gathered for the news conference. He said he'd never seen the media briefing room as crowded as it was. Later during the briefing, he joked they may be violating fire codes.

“I've done this for years now, hard to believe,” he said. “I've never seen this room so packed. In fact, I'm sure it's a violation of every fire code.”

“Now I may leave and say ‘good luck,' and that'll be the end,” Trump said.

Trump says he can see a scenario where the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations if things go well at his meeting with Putin later this week.

“I do, yeah,” he responded when asked about the prospect ahead of the Alaska meeting.

He said “Russia has a very valuable piece of land” and mused about what would happen if “Putin would go toward business instead of war.”

As for the prospect of progress at that meeting? Trump said: “I think it'll be good, but it might be bad.”

That came during a news conference after Trump was asked whether he plans to extend his 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China.

The U.S.-China trade truce ends Aug. 12 and if it isn't extended, rates on Chinese goods could climb back to over 80%.

“They've been dealing quite nicely,” Trump said, adding that he has a good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The president said he was open to meeting with Putin first and then meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or meeting with both together — though he didn't say he'd push for a three-person meeting.

Trump said “President Putin invited me to get involved” and even said he thought it was very respectful that Putin is coming to U.S. territory for the meeting in Alaska, instead of insisting that Trump go to Russia.

He said he'll tell Putin that it's time to end Russia's war with Ukraine.

“We're looking at reclassification,” Trump said, adding “it's early.”

He said he planned to make a determination in the coming weeks.

The president said marijuana “does bad for the children,” but that easing penalties associated with it is a “very complicated subject” because some people support doing so.

Trump said he'd “heard great things having to do with medical” use of marijuana.

A potential move to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I controlled substances to a Schedule III drug would make it significantly easier to buy and sell cannabis.

Trump said he hopes other cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, are watching the steps he's announced in D.C. and would take steps to “self-clean up.”

He said that if needed, the administration would take similar steps in other cities and criticized their leadership at the local and state levels.

In addition, Trump also said “we will bring in the military if it's needed” but added “I don't think we'll need it.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth compared sending the Guard into the nation's capital to deployments to the southern U.S. border and Los Angeles.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

Hegseth said the D.C. National Guard will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.”

He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units, other specialized units.”

The president said he signed an executive order and presidential memorandum in the Oval Office before holding his news conference.

One executive order invoked presidential powers under the Home Rule Act to take over Washington's police force.

He also signed what the administration called statutorily required notification letters to DC Mayor Bowser and relevant congressional leaders.

Trump also signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy the National Guard in the nation's capital.

The polarizing Food and Drug Administration official is getting his job back less than two weeks after being pressured to step down at the urging of conservative activists.

Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of FDA's center for vaccines and biotech therapies, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.

Prasad left the agency last month after drawing ire of right-wing activists, including Laura Loomer, who flagged his past statements criticizing President Trump.

He was also targeted by biotech executives and patient groups for briefly halting shipments of a therapy for muscular dystrophy, due to safety concerns.

But Prasad has also had the backing of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Under Prasad, the FDA restricted the approvals of two new COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.

Trump complained about potholes and graffiti in the city and said it was “embarrassing.”

“This is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,” Trump said. “I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was, with graffiti all over the walls.”

Trump also said he would bring in the military if needed.

“This is not a big area,” Trump said. “What you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them.”

Trump said he wants to “rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.” The Democratic mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, has noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023.

Trump cited a number of recent high-profile incidents, including the killing of a 21-year-old Congressional intern and the beating of a DOGE staffer during an attempted carjacking.

“This is liberation day in D.C. and we're going to take our Capitol back,” the president said.

Trump said he would start with D.C., but the wider crackdown on crime would go further to other Americans.

“We're going to clean it up real quick, very quickly,” he said.

The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement that the Trump administration is to get a 15% cut from U.S. chips sales in China in exchange of granting export licenses, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.”

, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.

“Our export control regime must be based on genuine security considerations, not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,” he said. “Chip export controls aren't bargaining chips, and they're not casino chips either. We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.”

The U.S. has placed export controls on most powerful U.S. computing chips, banning their sales in China to prevent them from being used to boost China's military capabilities.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has invited President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the NATO secretary general and several European leaders to a virtual meeting Wednesday ahead of the Trump-Putin summit later this week.

The German chancellery said in a statement Monday that the talks would focus on “the current situation in Ukraine with a view to the planned meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin.”

It said the talks will focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” as well as “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security.”

Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit Friday in Alaska.

Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell won't be released, a judge decided Monday.

Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said in a written ruling that the government had suggested the materials could be released publicly “casually or promiscuously,” which would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised” and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before future grand juries.

“And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials, because they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell's trial, would be innocuous. The same could be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in support of charges that later proceeded to trial,” he added.

About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to combat on crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday.

More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Marshals Service are also contributing officers.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters. The Justice Department didn't immediately have a comment Monday morning.

The White House last week announced plans for an increased presence of federal law enforcement in Washington as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on crime.

But the Europeans concede that Moscow is unlikely to give up control of Ukrainian land it holds.

Ahead of the summit in Alaska on Friday, President Trump suggested that a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories,” but the Europeans see no sign that Russia will offer anything to swap. Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit.

European Union foreign ministers are meeting on Monday following talks on Ukraine among U.S. and European security advisors over the weekend. They are wary that President Vladimir Putin will try to claim a political victory by portraying Ukraine as inflexible.

The only thing on Trump's schedule today is a news conference at 10 a.m., where he's expected to announce plans to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington.

Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital.

Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.”

“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Sunday. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.”

Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.”

Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency.

BRUSSELS (AP) — Ukraine and its European backers on Monday sought talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in an effort to protect their security interests ahead of his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this week.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has so far been excluded from the U.S.-Russia summit in Alaska on Friday, and the Europeans are unlikely to be invited. All are wary that Putin and Trump might agree, without Ukraine's participation, to land swaps of Ukraine's territory or other terms that might favor Russia. 

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz organized a series of meetings for Wednesday. He invited Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Zelenskyy, NATO's chief and several European leaders to attend. The chancellery said the talks would focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” as well as “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security.”

The European Commission confirmed that President Ursula von der Leyen will take part “in the calls organized by Chancellor Merz.” The leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Italy and Poland are also set to join the “various discussion groups,” the chancellery said.

Ukraine and its backers in Europe insist that Trump and Putin cannot decide on land swaps behind their backs at the summit, but the Europeans concede that Moscow is unlikely to give up control of Ukrainian land it holds.




“There'll be some land swapping going on. I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody. To the good, for the good of Ukraine. Good stuff, not bad stuff. Also, some bad stuff for both,” Trump told reporters on Monday.

He did not confirm whether he would take part in the talks convened by Merz, but said: “I'm going to get everybody's ideas” before meeting with Putin.

Concerns have mounted in Europe that Kyiv may be pressed to give up land or accept other curbs on its sovereignty. Ukraine and its European allies reject the notion that Putin should lay claim to any territory even before agreeing to a ceasefire. They want a ceasefire first.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports Europe lawmakers say the US and Russia cannot agree to a deal on Ukraine land swaps.

In Europe, a “coalition of the willing” has been formed by countries ready to deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia. French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Merz are organizing a coalition meeting, also on Wednesday, to coordinate.

Poland is also part of that coalition. Prime Minister Donald Tusk said “it must be obvious to Poland and our European partners — and I hope to all of NATO — that state borders cannot be changed by force.” Any land swaps or peace terms “must be agreed upon with Ukraine's participation,” he said, according to Polish news agency PAP.

Still, it's hard to ignore the reality on the ground.




Russia in 2022 illegally annexed the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Ukraine's east, and Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south, even though it doesn't fully control them. It also occupies the Crimean Peninsula, which it seized in 2014.

On the 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, Russia's bigger army has made slow but costly progress with its summer offensive. The relentless pounding of urban areas has killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to U.N. estimates.

“In the end, the issue of the fact that the Russians are controlling at this moment, factually, a part of Ukraine has to be on the table” in any peace talks after the Alaska summit, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on CBS on Sunday.

Rutte said Ukraine's Western backers “can never accept that in a legal sense,” but he suggested that they might tacitly acknowledge Russian control.

He compared it to the way that the U.S. hosted the diplomatic missions of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from 1940 to 1991, “acknowledging that the Soviet Union was controlling those territories, but never accepting (it) in a legal sense.”

Giving up any territory, especially without a ceasefire agreement first, would be almost impossible for Zelenskyy to sell at home after thousands of troops have died defending their land.

Ultimately, Putin is seen by some analysts as being not so much interested in land itself, but rather in a more “Russia-friendly” Ukraine with a malleable government unlikely to try to join NATO, just as pro-Russian breakaway regions in Georgia have complicated that country's quest to become a member.

Zelenskyy insists that a halt to fighting on the front line should be the starting point for negotiations, and the Europeans back him. They say that any future land swaps should be for Ukraine to decide and not be a precondition for a ceasefire.

Claims on land could also be part of negotiations on the kind of security guarantees that Ukraine might receive to ensure another war does not break out.

The Europeans believe Kyiv's best defense is strong armed forces to deter Russia from striking again. They insist there should be no restrictions on the size of Ukraine's army and the equipment, arms and ammunition it can possess or sell.

Beyond that, they say Ukraine should not be constrained in its choice of joining the EU or being forced to become a neutral country.

The Trump administration has already taken Ukraine's membership of NATO off the table for the foreseeable future.

For the Europeans, maintaining unity is also key. After chairing a meeting of foreign ministers on Monday, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said they had agreed to “work on more sanctions against Russia, more military support for Ukraine and more support for Ukraine's budgetary needs.”

“Transatlantic unity, support to Ukraine and pressure on Russia is how we will end this war and prevent future Russian aggression in Europe,” Kallas posted on social media.

President Donald Trump shared new details on Monday about his plan to take control of public safety in Washington, D.C., following a brutal attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, but D.C. residents aren't convinced. 

Trump announced on Monday that he is activating the District of Columbia National Guard and seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department after floating the idea since last week's assault in Washington's Logan Circle. 

Some Washington residents who spoke to Fox News Digital called it a ""terrible idea"" that ""doesn't make a lot of sense.""

""I think D.C. politics should stay with D.C., and, unfortunately, the federal government is apparently overstepping their bounds right now, so I hope that D.C. is allowed to govern itself, as well as police itself,"" one Washington resident told Fox News Digital ahead of Trump's announcement.

Trump controversially federalized the California National Guard amid anti-ICE protests that delved into riots in Los Angeles in June. Protesters were rejecting the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportations and Trump's robust immigration crackdown.

The president bypassed Gov. Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy National Guard troops to support ICE deportation. It was the first time a president federalized the National Guard without the governor's request in more than 60 years. 

Now, the tension between local and federal powers is unfolding in the nation's capital. But just like in California, many Washington residents have concerns about seeing ""troops on our streets.""

""We have laws for a reason,"" one resident told Fox News Digital. 

""Privatizing security is a terrible idea, and I think anything that Trump does is garbage,"" another Washington resident added.

Despite their apprehension about National Guard troops patrolling the nation's capital, many residents said something needs to be done to address crime in Washington, D.C.

While the Department of Justice indicated a 30-year low in violent crime last year, concerns about the city's safety linger, with one resident telling Fox News Digital, ""The city is getting dangerous.""

""I think it's a good idea,"" one resident said of Trump's new plan. ""It's something that needs to be done for the city to be safe. Right now, we're not safe. The kids and the teenagers are doing everything. So yeah, I think that's a great idea.""

And another Washington resident said, ""We need all the protection that we can get in the city, because the city is really getting dangerous,"" telling Fox News Digital that she has to ""make sure to come home before sundown"" and she is afraid of getting robbed when she gets off public transportation.

""Things do seem out of control and desperate, but I don't know what kind of numbers to take, what numbers to read. One minute they'll say crime is out of control. Next minute, they will say crime is down a certain percentage. It's kind of confusing, and I don't know who to believe in and which way to go, to be honest,"" a Washington resident said, articulating the dichotomy between the low crime statistics and the alarming crime stories. 

But another D.C. resident said, ""There's no way he should be in control of anything,"" and Washington, D.C., ""should be a state,"" so the district has more power to make decisions for itself. 

""I don't think it's necessary,"" another Washington resident added. ""I do think there needs to be some change within [the] Metropolitan [Police Department] because safety is an issue.""

Mayoral candidate Cory Bowman weighs in on city policies following the viral brawl that left six injured in downtown Cincinnati. (Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital) 

Local police chiefs are sounding off after viral footage of a brutal Cincinnati assault shined new light on what local leaders are saying is a consistent failure regarding violent offenders being released onto the city's streets. 

In a statement released by the Hamilton County Association of Chiefs of Police on Aug. 8, the organization blasted local leaders for ""gaps in the judicial process"" within the local government. 

""It is not enough to arrest violent offenders if they are swiftly released back into our neighborhoods due to lax bail practices or insufficient sentencing,"" the statement said.

The association vowed to host a roundtable discussion with local leaders within the next 30 days to address the community's concerns regarding safety after the July 26 beatdown on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets left six injured and led to six arrests. 

""The goal is to foster open, solution-focused dialogue around strengthening public safety while ensuring fairness and integrity across the entire justice process,"" the statement said. 

The update comes as police response time to the fight has been heavily criticized after Cincinnati Police Chief Theresa Theetge revealed only 11 officers were stationed downtown when the beatdown occurred.

The city's bail policies have also come under fire from Republican mayoral challenger Cory Bowman, who is looking to unseat incumbent Mayor Aftab Pureval, a Democrat, in the upcoming election. 

""There are things from City Hall that are showing that the police are not supported the way they need to,"" Bowman, Vice President JD Vance's half-brother, told Fox News Digital. ""They are unable to do their jobs because they've been told time and time again that they have to use restraint in certain things instead of enforcing the law. They're told to dial back, and then what happens is that we have prosecutors and judges that have a catch-and-release system."" 

The mayor's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

While citywide data indicates crime throughout Cincinnati has remained on par with last year's numbers, Bowman echoed the sentiments of the police department, blaming the city's leadership for the reason police feel unsupported while carrying out their duties. 

""So many officers have come to me, and they've said they don't even see a point in making arrests because the criminals are just going to be back on the streets the very next day,"" Bowman said. ""We have to put pressure on all the judges and prosecutors, and we have to be able to let the officers know, ‘Do your job, see your training and do your job properly, and you're going to have all of City Hall to back you up in that circumstance."" 

On Friday, a grand jury indicted the six individuals arrested in connection with the violent assault that sent shockwaves through the community.

Patrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, are each charged with three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital. 

Merriweather was previously indicted just two weeks before the violent attack for allegedly receiving stolen property, weapons under disability, improper transportation of a firearm and other charges, according to the Cincinnati Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) Queen City Lodge #69. 

The order also revealed that at the time of the beatdown, Merriweather was out of jail on $4,000 bond, though he only needed to post 10% – or $400 – to be released. 

""This is your court system,"" the FOP said in a social media post. 

The association is looking to fellow leaders within Cincinnati's government to provide further transparency surrounding bail laws as they look to keep violent offenders off the streets.

""Just as law enforcement is held to high standards and evaluated on our daily practices, we must also understand the outcomes taking place in courtrooms and who is responsible for them,"" the association said. ""Let us be clear: we will not allow the dedication and sacrifice of our law enforcement professionals to be rendered meaningless by systemic failures or the absence of shared responsibility.""

President Donald Trump announced Aug. 11, 2025, during a press conference from the White House that he is federalizing the Washington, D.C., police and deploying the National Guard to address spiraling crime issues.

President Donald Trump claimed crimes in Washington, D.C., trounce data from notoriously violent cities in nations such as Mexico and Colombia during his Monday morning press conference announcing he is federalizing the D.C. police department to curb spiraling violence. 

""The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,"" Trump said Monday. ""This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse."" 

Trump whipped out charts showing the media that the nation's capital allegedly suffers worse crime trends than other cities worldwide, calling on them to ""take a look at numbers"" as he rattled off the data's findings. 

""Look at these. Baghdad is … we doubled up on Baghdad. Panama City, Brasilia, San Jose, Costa Rica, Bogota, Colombia. Heavy drugs. Mexico City, I mentioned Lima, Peru, all double and triple what they are. So do you want to live in places like that? I don't think so. I don't think so. And I think the people in this room, if you wrote correctly, you'd see. Look at the kind of numbers we have. D.C. 41 per 100,000 (for homicides in 2023). Number one that we can find anywhere in the world. Other cities are pretty bad, but they're not as bad as that. That the way you want to live? The reporters of the world? Juvenile offenders and crimes against persons as they say, it's getting worse, not getting better. It's getting worse,"" he continued. 

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

The White House directed Fox Digital to a pair of graphs published on the White House Rapid Response's X account on Monday when asked for copies of the charts, data and its citations. The graphs published to X show D.C.'s murder rate in 2024 sat at 27.54 per 100,000, according to FBI data – reportedly higher than the stats in cities such as Bogota and Mexico City. 

The nation overall saw an uptick in violent crimes in 2020, when protests and riots broke out in cities across the nation at the height of the pandemic. That year notched a nearly 30% increase in murders compared to the year prior, according to FBI data, marking the largest single-year increase in killings since the agency began tracking the crimes.

The nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June. 

Trump announced Monday that he was federalizing the local police department starting Monday under section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume emergency control of the capital's police force.

President Donald Trump announced plans Aug. 11, 2025, to deploy the National Guard and to takeover the Metropolitan Police Department to address crime in the nation's capital.

President Donald Trump announced Monday that he is activating approximately 800 National Guard troops and is taking over the Metropolitan Police Department to tackle crime in Washington, after beefing up federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital Saturday. 

""I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC,"" Trump told reporters at a Monday press conference. ""And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.""

Trump also said that he would federalize the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington to respond to crime, placing it under the authority of Attorney General Pam Bondi. 

National Guard troops are reserve forces that are mobilized in response to state and federal operations, including natural disasters, and are typically overseen by their respective state governments. However, Trump controversially deployed National Guard troops from California to respond to immigration riots in June, bypassing California Gov. Gavin Newsom to dispatch the troops. 

The federal government oversees the District of Columbia National Guard.

Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said that Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll will operationalize the D.C. National Guard, and signaled that more National Guard troops could be roped into the deployment down the line. 

""You will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week,"" Hegseth told reporters Monday. ""At your direction as well, sir, there are other units we are prepared to bring in. Other National Guard units, other specialized units. They will be strong, they will be tough, and they will stand with their law enforcement partners."" 

Trump's remarks come just after he promised Washington would be ""LIBERATED"" from ""Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum"" in a post on Truth Social Monday morning. He said in the post that the ""days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER!"" 

Trump floated the idea of taking over Washington's Metropolitan Police Department and utilizing National Guard troops to manage crime in Washington Wednesday, following the assault of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer on Aug. 3 in Washington's Logan Circle.

""What a shame – rate of crime, the rate of muggings, killings and everything else, we're not going to let it, and that includes bringing in the National Guard, maybe very quickly, too,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday at the White House. 

Trump also told reporters at the time he was open to taking over Washington's Metropolitan Police Department because crime in the nation's capital is ""ridiculous."" 

While a temporary federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department is justified in cases of emergency, Trump's move will likely be challenged in court over whether the situation in Washington qualifies as an emergency. 

Trump has historically railed against violence in Washington, and said Tuesday that crime is ""totally out of control"" in the nation's capital. 

Meanwhile, crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington's Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.

Washington's Mayor Muriel Bowser challenged Trump's description of the city during an interview with MSNBC Sunday, and voiced concerns about the possibility of activating the National Guard to tackle the city's crime. 

""Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,"" Bowser said.

President Donald Trump suggested it is time to federalize law enforcement in the nation's capital city and bring in the National Guard to stamp out rampant crime.

President Donald Trump is weighing whether to deploy up to 1,000 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., as early as this week, Fox News has learned, in an effort to help deal with what he characterized as a surge in violent crime. 

The plans come just one day after Trump vowed on Truth Social to evict homeless persons from that nation's capital. ""The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,"" Trump said on social media. ""We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.""

Trump's plans, which are expected to be detailed further at a 10 a.m. press conference Monday, would likely involve members of the D.C. National Guard, or the 2,700-member National Guard force that acts at the express authority of the commander in chief.

Unlike other branches, Trump would not have to get the sign off of local authorities to act — likely making their activation a tempting option.

When speaking to reporters in the Oval Office last week, Trump railed against what he described as a ""ridiculous"" level of crime in the nation's capital, buffeted most recently by the assault on a former DOGE staffer earlier this month.

""We want to have a great, safe capital,"" Trump said last week. ""And we're going to have it.""

Trump also told reporters that his White House lawyers are looking into ending the Home Rule Act, a law passed by Congress in 1973 that gave Washington, D.C., residents the right to elect their own mayor and local representatives. 

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters last week that Trump had ordered law enforcement personnel to increase their presence in the capital, though the additional details on the scope and timeframe of that presence remain unclear. 

Trump is expected to address those plans in a press conference Monday morning. 

However, for Trump, delivering on this promise could be fraught with long-term legal complications — in part, because crime in the city is actually down to its lowest point in nearly 30 years.

FEDERAL JUDGES GRILL TRUMP LAWYERS OVER 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS ON EVE OF ENFORCEMENT

Violent crime in the first seven months of 2025 has dropped by roughly 26% compared to 2024, according to data compiled by the D.C. Police Department and released earlier this month. Overall, crime in the nation's capital has dropped by roughly 7%.

On Sunday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in an interview with NewsNation that Washington, D.C., ""is more violent than Baghdad."" 

Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, for her part, told MSNBC in an interview Sunday that ""Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.""

However, it's not the first time Trump has sought to crack down on crime in the nation's capital — an effort he has returned to frequently, including during his first term in office.

Trump in March signed an executive order, ""Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force."" (Reuters/Leah Millis)

Trump in March signed an executive order, ""Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force,"" designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as ""filthy,"" ""horribly run"" and ""crime-ridden,"" among other things. ""We want to have a great, safe capital,"" he told reporters. ""And we're going to have it. And that includes cleanliness and it includes other things.""

However, those powers aren't indefinite, experts explained to Fox News Digital.

Trump does have the authority to activate the 2,700-member D.C. National Guard without the approval of local officials. Guard troops provide ""mission-ready personnel and units for active duty in the armed services"" in Washington, D.C., according to their website.

Beyond that, Trump's ability to exercise authority in the nation's capital is bound by the Home Rule Act. 

In the more than 50 years since that law was passed, ""there really hasn't been a serious conversation about ending home rule governance,"" George Derek Musgrove, a history professor at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County, told Fox News in an interview.

""And the problem with our federal system is that there are places where Trump really doesn't have any supporters, and therefore, with the limits of executive power, really doesn't have that much sway,"" Musgrove said. ""And he's constantly probing for ways around that.""

Other options available to Trump aren't without their own limits. In order to call up the local police force for any meaningful length of time, as Trump has suggested, a president must be able to assert ""special conditions of an emergency nature,"" according to the 1970s law.

""If D.C. doesn't get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take federal control,"" Trump said last week. 

However, that's easier said than done, individuals familiar with the law told Fox News Digital.

""DC is just a tempting target because there's not even a lot of legal gymnastics you have to do in order to exert tremendous power [in a city with ]a 90% Democratic jurisdiction. He has it already,"" Musgrove said.

""But it is morally questionable, I think, and violates democratic principles,"" he added.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries argued crime in Washington, D.C. is not a major issue on Monday after President Donald Trump federalized the Metropolitan Police Department.

Jeffries released a statement on X following Trump's unprecedented move, which included calling for the deployment of some 800 National Guardsmen to the city.


""Violent crime in Washington, D.C. is at a thirty-year low. Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost,"" Jeffries wrote.





D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb condemned President Donald Trump's takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department on Monday.

Schwalb argued that the law Trump used to take over the police force should not apply, due to there being no crime emergency in the nation's capital in his view.

""The Administration's actions are unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,"" Schwalb wrote on X. ""There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year.""


""We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,"" he continued.

Trump federalized the MPD under the Home Rule Act, which allows the president to take over the force for a up to 30 days if certain Congressional Committees are notified.





President Donald Trump predicted that ""land swapping"" would likely play a role in any potential peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine on Monday.

Trump made the statement during a press conference ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Trump criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for appearing unwilling to agree to such a swap.


""I was a little, bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, well, I have to get constitutional approval,"" Trump said, adding that he knows ""through Russia"" that ""there will be some swapping.""

We're going to change the lines. The battle lines. Russia's occupied a big portion of Ukraine. They've occupied some very prime territory. We're going to try and get some of that territory back for Ukraine. But they've taken some very prime territory,"" Trump said, noting in particular Russia's occupation of much of Ukraine's coast.





President Donald Trump suggested that he will know within the first two minutes of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin
 whether a deal can be made to end the war in Ukraine.

Trump made the claim during a wide-ranging press conference at the White House on Monday. Trump also said he would be speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as well as European leaders ahead of the meeting.

""We're going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin. And at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,"" Trump said.


""I go into that thing fully loaded right up there, and we're going to see what happens. Now, I think one of two things is going to happen. It could be a good meeting, and we'll go a step further. We'll get it done. I'd like to see a ceasefire very, very quickly, very quick. I'd like to see it immediately, but I'd like to see it very quickly. And, we're going to be dealing with the European leaders and, we're going to be dealing with President Zelensky and hopefully we're going to have a great success,"" he added.





President Donald Trump put Chicago and New York City on notice Monday as he declared a federal takeover of Washington's police force to crack down on crime.

Trump and several of his top cabinet officials lamented the state of the nation's capital, with ""young punks"" committing violent crimes and homelessness visible on nearly every street. He then called out Chicago and New York City, saying he may intervene there as well if they don't address their own crime and homelessness issues.


""I'm going to look at New York in a little while. Let's do this. Let's do this together. Let's see. It's going to go pretty quickly,"" Trump said.

""And if we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago, which is a disaster. We have a mayor there who is totally incompetent. He's an incompetent man. And we have an incompetent governor there. [J.B.] Pritzker's an incompetent. His family threw him out of the business, and he ran for governor. And now I understand he wants to be president, but I noticed he lost a little weight. So maybe he has a chance. You know, you never know what happens,"" he continued.

Trump's threat comes as New York City mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani
 has centered his campaign around opposition to Trump.





U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro vowed that criminals in the nation's capital are ""not going to get away with it anymore"" as President Trump administration announced a crime crackdown.

Pirro called out ""young punks"" for committing violent crimes across the city and making Americans fear to bring their families to experience the history of the nation's capital.

""I see too much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can get together in gangs and crews and beat the hell out of you or anyone else. They don't care where they are. They can be in Dupont Circle, but they know that we can't touch them,"" Pirro said, going on to blame ""weak"" laws.


""I can't touch you if you're 14, 15, 16, 17 years old and you have a gun. I convict someone of shooting another person with an illegal gun on a public bus, in the chest, with intent to kill. I convict him. You know what the judge gives him? Probation. Says you should go to college,"" she added.

Pirro went on to say the federal government needs to ""go after"" the D.C. city council and end its ""absurd laws.""

President Donald Trump announced his picks to lead reform after federalizing Washington, D.C.'s police force on Monday.

Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi will command the Metropolitan Police Department, and Terry Cole will serve as interim D.C. police commissioner. Cole has been serving as head of the Drug Enforcement Agency since his swearing-in ceremony last month.


""Our new DEA administrator, who is one of the top in the country. He better be, Terry, if you're not I'm going to get rid of you so fast, Terry Cole,"" Trump said. ""We just just got him, the most highly recommended person. And, you'll be designated as the interim federal commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Department. Okay? And you run them tough. They're good. You have a lot of good people. You have people that should be there. You also have people that shouldn't be there.""





President Donald Trump rejected claims that more police are needed to effectively keep the peace in the nation's capital on Monday.

Trump, announcing the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, said he'd heard complaints of a lack of staffing among the police force, but argued the problem was with leadership, not with numbers.


""I was told today, sir, they want more police. I heard a number, 3,500 police. That's a lot of police, 3,500. I thought they're going to say we only have 30 policemen or women. They said we have 3500. We need more. You don't need more. That's so many I never heard. That's like an army,"" Trump said.

""How could you need more than three thousand? It just happened two minutes ago, sir. They've requested more police. What do they have? About 3,500. I said 3,500--this is not a big area. It's ridiculous. What you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them. And we have the right people here that I can tell you,"" Trump added.

Trump spoke alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials. The president installed Terry Cole as interim D.C. police commissioner on Monday. Cole has served as the administrator for the Drug Enforcement Agency since his swearing-in in July.

President Donald Trump pointed to no-cash bail as a major source of crime problems in Washington, D.C. on Monday.

Trump made the statement during his press conference announcing the federal takeover of the capital's police force, saying cashless bail is a root of lawlessness from Chicago to New York City.

""This dire public safety crisis stems directly from the abject failures of the city's local leadership. The radical left City Council adopted no cash bail,"" Trump said. ""Every place in the country where you have no cash bail is a disaster. That's what started the problem in New York. And they don't change it. They don't want to change it. That's what started it in Chicago. I mean, bad politicians started it, bad leadership, started it. But that was the one thing that's central. No-cash bail. Somebody murders somebody and they're out on no-cash bail before the day is out.""


Trump went on to say the state of America's capital is embarrassing for him as the head of state, referencing his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

This is an excerpt from an article by Fox News' Digital's politics team





President Donald Trump has directed federal law enforcement to increase its presence throughout Washington, D.C. amid his efforts to crack down on crime in the city.


The operation, which uses both local and federal law enforcement agencies, including Homeland Security Investigations, the FBI, DEA and others, began August 7 and will initially last for seven days with the option to extend ""as needed.""

In a statement to Fox News, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt announced ""there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C.""

""Washington, DC is an amazing city, but it has been plagued by violent crime for far too long,"" Leavitt said. ""President Trump has directed an increased presence of federal law enforcement to protect innocent citizens. Starting tonight, there will be no safe harbor for violent criminals in D.C.""

She added, ""President Trump is committed to making our Nation's capital safer for its residents, lawmakers, and visitors from all around the world.""

Authorities announced the arrest of two teens in connection with the brutal beating of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) last week, an incident that drew President Donald Trump's attention to the crime and homelessness in the nation's capital.

The victim, Edward Coristine, nicknamed ""Big Balls,"" was assaulted around 3:00 a.m. August 4 by a group of teenagers in the city's Logan Circle neighborhood. The teens attempted to carjack him and a woman, whom police identified as his significant other, according to authorities.

Police said Coristine pushed the woman into the vehicle for safety and turned to confront the group. At least several of the teens then attacked him, police said, until officers patrolling nearby intervened. As officers moved toward the group, the teens fled on foot.


Coristine, one of the most visible figures of President Donald Trump's DOGE, was left bloodied in the attack, according to a photo the president shared on his Truth Social platform.

President Donald Trump is considering the deployment of up to 1,000 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. as part of his plan to clean up the nation's capital, Fox News has learned.

The troops would most likely be called up from the D.C. National Guard, a U.S. official told Fox. Trump is expected to announce concrete plans during a press conference at the White House scheduled for 10 am Monday.


Trump said on social media on Sunday that the news conference on crime and ""beautification"" will ""not only involve ending the Crime, Murder, and Death in our Nation's Capital, but will also be about Cleanliness and the General Physical Renovation and Condition of our once beautiful and well maintained Capital.""

Trump described D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser – who publicly clashed with Trump during the George Floyd riots in 2020 – ""a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive."" 

Fox News' Liz Friden and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report





President Donald Trump vowed to rid Washington, D.C. of ""crime, savagery, filth and scum"" on Monday ahead of a planned press conference in the nation's capital.


Trump is expected to announce measures to combat crime and homelessness in the city, ranging from deploying federal law enforcement to taking direct control over the the city's government.

Trump may also deploy National Guard troops to patrol the city.

""Washington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today! Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR. I will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN!

A federal judge on Monday denied a request from the Trump administration to unseal grand jury material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and is the longtime associate of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

In a 31-page order issued Monday morning, Judge Paul Engelmayer of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected the Justice Department‘s bid to release the transcripts and exhibits from the grand jury in Maxwell's prosecution. Grand jury records are typically kept under seal, but prosecutors argued the circumstances of Maxwell's case warranted an exception. Engelmayer dismissed that claim.

“The Government's invocation of special circumstances, however, fails at the threshold,” Engelmayer wrote. “Its entire premise — that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them — is demonstrably false.”

After reviewing the records, Engelmayer said they contained “virtually nothing … that isn't public already” and would “not reveal new information of any consequence.” He added that anyone expecting significant revelations “would come away feeling disappointed and misled,” concluding there was “no ‘there' there.”

In a particularly sharp rebuke, Engelmayer said “the one colorable argument” for unsealing the transcripts would be to “expose as disingenuous the Government's public explanations” for requesting their release.

Maxwell, who has maintained her innocence, was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and related charges for helping Epstein recruit and abuse underage girls. Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Authorities ruled it was suicide, which has since fueled years of speculation, conspiracy theories, and renewed demands for transparency.

Maxwell was recently transferred to a minimum-security prison in Texas following an interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a move that has drawn scrutiny amid her cooperation with the DOJ. Efforts to secure her testimony before the House Oversight Committee have since been postponed while the Supreme Court weighs whether to hear her appeal at its Sept. 29 long conference.

Maxwell's petition argues that her prosecution violated a nonprosecution agreement Epstein obtained from federal prosecutors in Florida in the 2000s, which she said should have shielded her from charges. The DOJ has urged the justices to reject her case.

COMER CONFIDENT IN TRUMP VOW TO RELEASE EPSTEIN FILES AFTER SUBPOENA: ‘I TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD'

In July, a judge in Florida declined to unseal transcripts related to a criminal case brought against Epstein for sex charges in the early 2000s.

A separate judge in New York is still weighing whether to release grand jury files from his 2019 sex trafficking charges, which never went to trial before authorities found Epstein dead in his cell on Aug. 10 of that year.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The deputy head of the International Atomic Energy Agency is headed to Iran on Monday, the first visit by an official from the top nuclear watchdog since the United States bombed three of the regime's nuclear sites in June.

The aim of the IAEA's visit is to “determine a framework for cooperation” after Iran suspended its ties with the watchdog in early July, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced on Sunday.

That earlier move from Iran, which came after after the 12-Day War with Israel devastated the regime's top military brass and U.S. strikes set back its nuclear ambitions, has effectively kept its nuclear program in the dark. Shortly before that decision, the regime also banned the head of the IEAE Rafael Grossi from its nuclear sites and removed surveillance cameras from them.

While the scheduled Monday visit signals Iran is willing to reopen lines of communication with the nuclear watchdog, Araghchi was clear that it will not include any inspection of its nuclear sites.

“A deputy director general of Grossi will come to Tehran tomorrow, while there are no plans to visit any nuclear sites until we reach a framework,” he said.

Iran previously reached a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in its war with Israel in late June, just days after the U.S.'s bombing of the nuclear sites.

While the ceasefire remains, the regime has left the door open for a broader peace deal in the Middle East.

In early July, Araghchi laid out a condition for his country to reengage in talks that derailed just before the summer.

“In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations. And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time,” he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has previously not appeared willing to reenter negotiations with the regime, saying in late June that he would not be offering Iran “anything” while also trashing former President Barack Obama's Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced on Monday that Australia will recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September.

“Australia will recognize the right of the Palestinian people to a state of their own predicated on the commitments Australia has received from the Palestinian Authority,” Albanese said at a press conference in Canberra.

Those commitments from the Palestinian Authority included Hamas having no future role in a possible Palestinian state and government reform, among others. The authority also reaffirmed Israel's right to exist in peace and security, Albanese noted.

Albanese was joined by his foreign minister, Penny Wong, who revealed that she spoke to her U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ahead of the announcement as a “matter of diplomatic courtesy.”

According to a State Department statement released late Sunday night, the pair discussed issues in the Indo-Pacific and Middle East, as well as “global efforts to combat antisemitism.”

“Secretary [Rubio] also underscored the importance of the U.S.-Australia alliance for upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the statement added.

The decision is unsurprising for the Indo-Pacific country, as Albanese was already “actively considering” the decision over the weekend, previously telling reporters on Saturday it's a “matter of when, not if.”

But it does mean that they have joined a now-growing list of countries announcing the move ahead of the September meeting of the U.N. General Assembly. 

Some of those countries include France, Canada, and the United Kingdom, though the U.K.'s recognition is contingent on Israel failing to take steps to end the war in Gaza.

The Israeli military campaign is only intensifying, however.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new offensive with the goal of controlling Gaza City and removing Hamas terrorists from the area.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","How the antifa movement has metastasized","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3493802/antifa-organization-movement-has-metastasized/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

By design, antifa is a decentralized, left-wing movement of loosely knit “resistance” networks operating primarily in Democratic strongholds. But in recent years, antifa's forces have become highly organized and increasingly sophisticated, with organized crime cells cropping up across the country. Part 1 of this Washington Examiner series, Antifa, Inc., will dispel the modern mythos and misconceptions surrounding antifa as well as document its rise in America, recruitment practices, and well-coordinated crimes.

“Antifa is an idea, not an organization,” Joe Biden, then the Democratic presidential nominee, declared on the 2020 debate stage.

“Not a militia,” Biden insisted, amid more than 100 consecutive nights of antifa-led attacks on federal property, police precincts, and downtown businesses in Portland, Oregon.

Antifa, short for antifascist, is indeed an extremist ideology, a blend of anarcho-communist beliefs opposed to adversaries and policies perceived as “fascist.” However, its left-wing teachings have incited self-identified members to assemble, form factions, and commit crimes in the name of so-called “antifascist” activism.

As Democrats and liberal media outlets downplay the threat of antifa militancy by portraying antifa as a right-wing bogeyman, this nationwide movement is growing in numbers and evolving into high-level criminal operations.

With origins in interwar Europe, the political phenomenon known as antifa was born out of a “red united front” against Nazi Germany's regime. In 1932, the German Communist Party established a new paramilitary unit, Antifaschistische Aktion, “Antifascist Action,” to serve as foot soldiers in this fight.

Today, antifa activists tout a modernized black-and-red version of Antifascist Action's insignia while rioting in the streets and on online platforms to affirm their allegiance to the Marxist cause. In antifa's contemporary two-flag logo, red represents communism, and black stands for anarchy.

The advent of antifa in America, a mutation of its European predecessor, was brought about by British influence. Antifascism first found a foothold in Britain's 1970s punk subculture scene, where antiauthoritarian and anarchist views naturally aligned. Eventually, this cultural overlap migrated to the United States and burgeoned especially on the West Coast.

But the first-known antifa offshoot actually emerged out of the Midwest with the Minneapolis Baldies, a gang of skinheads who proclaimed to “hunt down” neo-Nazis. Circa the mid-1980s, the group set up Anti-Racist Action, a precursory confederation meant to spread “bare-fisted” antifascism nationally. At the time, organizers framed the fight as “anti-racist,” believing that combating “racism” was more familiar to Americans than fighting “fascism.”

While skeptics claim that antifa has no organizational structure, the movement is subdivided into localized chapters, some of which are allied organizations, coalescing in most major U.S. cities.

In riot-torn Portland, Rose City Antifa, formerly the ARA Portland branch, remains America's oldest antifa chapter bearing “antifa” in its name and arguably the most influential.

Founded in 2007, RCA belongs to the national Torch Network, a spin-off of ARA, alongside 11 other chapters stationed all over America, including Antifa Sacramento, Rocky Mountain Antifa, Pacific Northwest Antifascist Workers Collective, and Atlanta Antifascists.

The Minneapolis Police Department deemed Torch Network the “most radical” of antifa cohorts, “responsible for accreditation and recognition of national antifa chapters.”

RCA's followers, like other cell members, are systematically taught violent street-level strategies to “destroy the enemy” or “bash the fash.”

“Practice things like eye-gouging,” RCA cadets are told, according to a hidden-camera Project Veritas video of the recruitment process. “It takes very little pressure to injure someone's eyes.”

Project Veritas also once embedded at The Base, a New York City anarchist center teaching hand-to-hand combat. In these sessions, “fight instructors” coach antifa activists to “basically cut off both arteries.”

In 2019, investigative journalist Andy Ngo was brutally beaten, pelted with projectiles, and left hospitalized with a brain bleed by RCA militants on the streets of Portland. He has since successfully sued the RCA over his injuries in Ngo v. Rose City Antifa.

JOURNALIST ANDY NGO SAYS HE FLED PORTLAND AFTER DEATH THREATS FROM ANTIFA

Ngo said the RCA and other Portland-area antifa cells have quieted down compared to newly forged antifa networks.

“I think they are afraid of being prosecuted with federal conspiracy charges,” Ngo told the Washington Examiner, “and they are feeling demoralized after several of their militants were exposed in my civil trial and other criminal trials that have led to convictions.”

RCA's inner workings were shrouded in secrecy until an undercover Project Veritas operative, codenamed “Lion,” infiltrated the antifa chapter and was conditionally approved to join on a probationary basis. In 2017, cell leadership sent Lion a welcome email, blocking out a six-month onboarding process and curriculum.

Prospects are only allowed to enlist upon completion of this vetting program and the unanimous consent of current RCA members, as stipulated in the instructions. Full-fledged RCA members, as part of the Torch Network, must pledge to uphold the “Points of Unity,” aka vows to disrupt “fascist” activity, not cooperate with the criminal justice system, oppose “oppression,” and act in solidarity with others outside of the network who have similar aims, such as Black Lives Matter.

WHY YOU SHOULD NEVER USE THE TERM ‘ANTI-FASCIST'

Lion's classes consisted of PowerPoint presentations such as “Intro to Firearms,” lessons on the history of militant antifascism, and an instructional course for performing reconnaissance, among other lectures outlined in the syllabus, such as seminars exploring how class, gender, and race relate to “the struggle against fascism.” Lion also learned about doxing, an intimidation tactic that entails publicly posting victims' private or identifying information, such as their home addresses.

As one of Lion's initial tasks, RCA instructed him to install a medley of computer applications used to bypass digital surveillance and maintain anonymity, including VeraCrypt, an encryption software; Tor, which enables access to anonymous browsing; and Tails, an operating system aimed at “preserving privacy.” RCA issues communications on an “anti-colonial” server “built by and for anarchists.”

Lion's training took place at a feminist Portland bookstore called In Other Words.

“Community centers” and bookstores stocked with left-wing literature have historically functioned as fronts for antifa training. Slingshot Collective, a radical-left newspaper, advertises all such spaces, broken down by state, under its “radical contacts” list.

One of Slingshot's co-ops, Firestorm Cafe and Books, a shop in liberal Asheville, North Carolina, is regarded as a regional antifa hub. Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook is proudly displayed in Firestorm's storefront. Its “Community Calendar” is filled with anarchist-oriented events, such as a book club dedicated to abolishing prisons and whose members include “incarcerated comrades.”

In 2019, concerned Asheville residents reportedly spoke out at a Council of Independent Business Owners meeting, accusing Firestorm of ushering in vagrancy through its syringe-exchange initiative as a means of reversing “gentrification.”

“It's no accident, in my opinion, that you've got a bookstore fronting for an act of anarchy executed through the needle exchange program,” city employee John Miall said at the meeting.

Many of antifa's indoctrination materials intended to radicalize and train recruits are publicly available “resources” published online.

CrimethInc, a leftist propaganda site, circulates a pamphlet popular among antifa activists called Why We Break Windows: The Effectiveness of Political Vandalism. The think piece, free to print as a PDF file, teaches that window-smashing is an act of protest against capitalism, classism, and racial inequality, shattering “the social construct of property rights.”

For “further reading,” the CrimethInc handout recommends follow-up reference material from friendly media outlets, including Time magazine's “In Defense of Rioting” and “A Beginner's Guide to Targeted Property Destruction,” a tribute to the writings of a biweekly Seattle-based anarchist gazette.

It's Going Down, an antifa-aligned organization, is another revolutionary-left digital platform hosting columns such as “This Week in Fascism,” a weekly roundup of doxes and calls-to-action, as well as first-person anonymous accounts of property destruction.

The Anarchist Cookbook, a do-it-yourself guide for manufacturing homemade explosives, is also widely disseminated in left-wing quarters. Its “recipes,” mostly gleaned from U.S. military and special forces manuals, include detailed instructions for making Molotov cocktails or incendiary devices, improvised weaponry, and tear gas. Firestorm sells an “action-oriented” rendition of the 160-page Anarchist Cookbook, similar to other copycat works marketed as sequels.

Antifa's prescribed uniform, universally worn while rioting, is an ensemble of “black bloc” and riot gear: all-black clothing such as ski masks helps conceal identities from law enforcement detection, paired with gas masks, body armor, and tactical shields to protect against police's mob-dispersal measures.

During the anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement uprisings in Los Angeles, antifa rioters allegedly used handheld radios to coordinate movement and evade capture, forcing hourslong standoffs with police. Hurling commercial-grade fireworks, bricks, glass bottles, and other projectiles at police is a typical antifa tactic, as is vandalizing government property, all to exhaust city resources. Antifa activists have also formed human blockades to trap police personnel inside precincts that they then set on fire.

MEET THE ANTIFA CELL CHARGED WITH TERRORISM AND ATTEMPTED MURDER OVER ‘AMBUSH' AT TEXAS ICE FACILITY

Calls-to-action, dubbed “direct actions” in antifa circles, are often posted on social media to get the word out about planned nights of rioting, typically staged outside police stations or in public parks ahead of smash-and-grabs targeting nearby small businesses.

Seattle's Cal Anderson Park, near where antifa activists created the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone in the summer of 2020, is still a common staging ground for antifa activities.

CHAZ, later renamed the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest, was a six-block commune erected at the corners of Cal Anderson Park and fortified by stolen police barricades. A militia-style security detail guarded the encampment at the behest of Seattle Antifascists. Many rifle-wielding activists appeared wearing patches of the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club, an antifascist “community defense” gun group named after a radical pre-Civil War abolitionist.

In addition to armed security, antifa activists frequently employ the help of ad hoc “mutual aid” allies, who supply material support ranging from food to weapons to bail money.

LIBERAL JUDGE FREES FEDERALLY CHARGED ANTI-ICE RIOTERS IN PORTLAND

In George Floyd-era Portland, Riot Ribs was a pop-up kitchen cooking hot meals for rioters. The Equitable Workers Offering Kommunity Support, a team of volunteer “street medics,” treated riot-related injuries. PDX Shieldsmiths provided makeshift shields to be used alternatively as bludgeons. PDX Hydration Station distributed batons and umbrellas for assaulting police and blocking on-scene footage, respectively. PDX Community Jail Support camped outside the Portland Police Bureau's central precinct to offer riot arrestees legal assistance upon release from pretrial detention.

To fund these activities, antifa activists generally rake in grassroots funding through payment processors such as Venmo and CashApp. Of the most profitable and more formalized fundraising campaigns, the Portland General Defense Committee's GoFundMe page had amassed more than $1.39 million at the peak of the 2020 George Floyd riots. The massive windfall went toward bailing out rioters, covering legal expenses, and paying for transitional housing, seemingly to streamline catch-and-release.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The country gave its citizens the right to die. Doctors are struggling to keep up with demand.

Listen to more stories on hark

The euthanasia conference was held at a Sheraton. Some 300 Canadian professionals, most of them clinicians, had arrived for the annual event. There were lunch buffets and complimentary tote bags; attendees could look forward to a Friday-night social outing, with a DJ, at an event space above Par-Tee Putt in downtown Vancouver. “The most important thing,” one doctor told me, “is the networking.”

Which is to say that it might have been any other convention in Canada. Over the past decade, practitioners of euthanasia have become as familiar as orthodontists or plastic surgeons are with the mundane rituals of lanyards and drink tickets and It's been so long s outside the ballroom of a four-star hotel. The difference is that, 10 years ago, what many of the attendees here do for work would have been considered homicide.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

When Canada's Parliament in 2016 legalized the practice of euthanasia—Medical Assistance in Dying, or MAID, as it's formally called—it launched an open-ended medical experiment. One day, administering a lethal injection to a patient was against the law; the next, it was as legitimate as a tonsillectomy, but often with less of a wait. MAID now accounts for about one in 20 deaths in Canada—more than Alzheimer's and diabetes combined—surpassing countries where assisted dying has been legal for far longer.

It is too soon to call euthanasia a lifestyle option in Canada, but from the outset it has proved a case study in momentum. MAID began as a practice limited to gravely ill patients who were already at the end of life. The law was then expanded to include people who were suffering from serious medical conditions but not facing imminent death. In two years, MAID will be made available to those suffering only from mental illness. Parliament has also recommended granting access to minors.

At the center of the world's fastest-growing euthanasia regime is the concept of patient autonomy. Honoring a patient's wishes is of course a core value in medicine. But here it has become paramount, allowing Canada's MAID advocates to push for expansion in terms that brook no argument, refracted through the language of equality, access, and compassion. As Canada contends with ever-evolving claims on the right to die, the demand for euthanasia has begun to outstrip the capacity of clinicians to provide it.

There have been unintended consequences: Some Canadians who cannot afford to manage their illness have sought doctors to end their life. In certain situations, clinicians have faced impossible ethical dilemmas. At the same time, medical professionals who decided early on to reorient their career toward assisted death no longer feel compelled to tiptoe around the full, energetic extent of their devotion to MAID. Some clinicians in Canada have euthanized hundreds of patients.

The two-day conference in Vancouver was sponsored by a professional group called the Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers. Stefanie Green, a physician on Vancouver Island and one of the organization's founders, told me how her decades as a maternity doctor had helped equip her for this new chapter in her career. In both fields, she explained, she was guiding a patient through an “essentially natural event”—the emotional and medical choreography “of the most important days in their life.” She continued the analogy: “I thought, Well, one is like delivering life into the world, and the other feels like transitioning and delivering life out.” And so Green does not refer to her MAID deaths only as “provisions”—the term for euthanasia that most clinicians have adopted. She also calls them “deliveries.”

Gord Gubitz, a neurologist from Nova Scotia, told me that people often ask him about the “stress” and “trauma” and “strife” of his work as a MAID provider. Isn't it so emotionally draining? In fact, for him it is just the opposite. He finds euthanasia to be “energizing”—the “most meaningful work” of his career. “It's a happy sad, right?” he explained. “It's really sad that you were in so much pain. It is sad that your family is racked with grief. But we're so happy you got what you wanted.”

From the June 2023 issue: David Brooks on how Canada's assisted-suicide law went wrong

Has Canada itself gotten what it wanted? Nine years after the legalization of assisted death, Canada's leaders seem to regard MAID from a strange, almost anthropological remove: as if the future of euthanasia is no more within their control than the laws of physics; as if continued expansion is not a reality the government is choosing so much as conceding. This is the story of an ideology in motion, of what happens when a nation enshrines a right before reckoning with the totality of its logic. If autonomy in death is sacrosanct, is there anyone who shouldn't be helped to die?

Rishad Usmani remembers the first patient he killed. She was 77 years old and a former Ice Capades skater, and she had severe spinal stenosis. Usmani, the woman's family physician on Vancouver Island, had tried to talk her out of the decision to die. He would always do that, he told me, when patients first asked about medically assisted death, because often what he found was that people simply wanted to be comfortable, to have their pain controlled; that when they reckoned, really reckoned, with the finality of it all, they realized they didn't actually want euthanasia. But this patient was sure: She was suffering, not just from the pain but from the pain medication too. She wanted to die.

On December 13, 2018, Usmani arrived at the woman's home in the town of Comox, British Columbia. He was joined by a more senior physician, who would supervise the procedure, and a nurse, who would start the intravenous line. The patient lay in a hospital bed, her sister next to her, holding her hand. Usmani asked her a final time if she was sure; she said she was. He administered 10 milligrams of midazolam, a fast-acting sedative, then 40 milligrams of lidocaine to numb the vein in preparation for the 1,000 milligrams of propofol, which would induce a deep coma. Finally he injected 200 milligrams of a paralytic agent called rocuronium, which would bring an end to breathing, ultimately causing the heart to stop.

Usmani drew his stethoscope to the woman's chest and listened. To his quiet alarm, he could hear the heart still beating. In fact, as the seconds passed, it seemed to be quickening. He glanced at his supervisor. Where had he messed up? But as soon as they locked eyes, he understood: He was listening to his own heartbeat.

Many clinicians in Canada who have provided medical assistance in dying have a story like this, about the tangle of nerves and uncertainties that attended their first case. Death itself is something every clinician knows intimately, the grief and pallor and paperwork of it. To work in medicine is to step each day into the worst days of other people's lives. But approaching death as a procedure, as something to be scheduled over Outlook, took some getting used to. In Canada, it is no longer a novel and remarkable event. As of 2023, the last year for which data are available, some 60,300 Canadians had been legally helped to their death by clinicians. In Quebec, more than 7 percent of all deaths are by euthanasia—the highest rate of any jurisdiction in the world. “I have two or three provisions every week now, and it's continuing to go up every year,” Claude Rivard, a family doctor in suburban Montreal, told me.

Rivard has thus far provided for more than 600 patients and helps train clinicians new to MAID. This spring, I watched from the back of a small classroom in a Vancouver hospital as Rivard led a workshop on intraosseous infusion—administering drugs directly into the bone marrow, a useful skill for MAID clinicians, Rivard explained, in the event of IV failure. Arranged on absorbent pads across the back row of tables were eight pig knuckles, bulbous and pink. After a PowerPoint presentation, the dozen or so attendees took turns with different injection devices, from the primitive (manual needles) to the modern (bone-injection guns). Hands cramped around hollow steel needles as the workshop attendees struggled to twist and drive the tools home. This was the last thing, the clinicians later agreed, that patients would want to see as they lay trying to die. Practitioners needed to learn. “Every detail matters,” Rivard told the class; he preferred the bone-injection gun himself.

The details of the assisted-death experience have become a preoccupation of Canadian life. Patients meticulously orchestrate their final moments, planning celebrations around them: weekend house parties before a Sunday-night euthanasia in the garden; a Catholic priest to deliver last rites; extended-family renditions of “Auld Lang Syne” at the bedside. For $10.99, you can design your MAID experience with the help of the Be Ceremonial app; suggested rituals include a story altar, a forgiveness ceremony, and the collecting of tears from witnesses. On the Disrupting Death podcast, hosted by an educator and a social worker in Ontario, guests share ideas on subjects such as normalizing the MAID process for children facing the death of an adult in their life—a pajama party at a funeral home; painting a coffin in a schoolyard.

Autonomy, choice, control: These are the values that found purchase with the great majority of Canadians in February 2015, when, in a case spearheaded by the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, the supreme court of Canada unanimously overturned the country's criminal ban on medically assisted death. For advocates, the victory had been decades in the making—the culmination of a campaign that had grown in fervor since the 1990s, when Canada's high court narrowly ruled against physician-assisted death in a case brought by a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. “We're talking about a competent person making a choice about their death,” one longtime right-to-die activist said while celebrating the new ruling. “Don't access this choice if you don't want—but stay away from my death bed.” A year later, in June 2016, Parliament passed the first legislation officially permitting medical assistance in dying for eligible adults, placing Canada among the handful of countries (including Belgium, Switzerland, and the Netherlands) and U.S. states (Oregon, Vermont, and California, among others) that already allowed some version of the practice.

The new law approved medical assistance in dying for adults who had a “grievous and irremediable medical condition” causing them “intolerable suffering,” and who faced a “reasonably foreseeable” natural death. To qualify, patients needed two clinicians to sign off on their application, and the law required a 10-day “reflection period” before the procedure could take place. Patients could choose to die either by euthanasia—having a clinician administer the drugs directly—or, alternatively, by assisted suicide, in which a patient self-administers a lethal prescription orally. (Virtually all MAID deaths in Canada have been by euthanasia.) When the procedure was set to begin, patients were required to give final consent.

The law, in other words, was premised on the concept of patient autonomy, but within narrow boundaries. Rather than force someone with, say, late-stage cancer to suffer to the very end, MAID would allow patients to depart on their own terms: to experience a “dignified death,” as proponents called it. That the threshold of eligibility for MAID would be high—and stringent—was presented to the public as self-evident, although the criteria themselves were vague when you looked closely. For instance, what constituted “reasonably foreseeable”? Two months? Two years? Canada's Department of Justice suggested only “a period of time that is not too remote.”

Provincial health authorities were left to fill in the blanks. Following the law's passage, doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and lawyers scrambled to draw up the regulatory fine print for a procedure that until then had been legally classified as culpable homicide. How should the assessment process work? What drugs should be used? Particularly vexing was the question of whether it should be clinicians or patients who initiated conversations about assisted death. Some argued that doctors and nurses had a professional obligation to broach the subject of MAID with potentially eligible patients, just as they would any other “treatment option.” Others feared that patients could interpret this as a recommendation—indeed, feared that talking about assisted death as a medical treatment, like Lasik surgery or a hip replacement, was dangerous in itself.

Early on, a number of health-care professionals refused to engage in any way with MAID—some because of religious beliefs, and others because, in their view, it violated a medical duty to “do no harm.” For many clinicians, the ethical and logistical challenges of MAID only compounded the stress of working within Canada's public-health-care system, beset by years of funding cuts and staffing shortages. The median wait time for general surgery is about 22 weeks. For orthopedic surgery, it's more than a year. For some kinds of mental-health services, the wait time can be longer.

As the first assessment requests trickled in, even many clinicians who believed strongly in the right to an assisted death were reluctant to do the actual assisting. Some told me they agreed to take on patients only after realizing that no one else—in their hospital or even their region—was willing to go first. Matt Kutcher, a physician on Prince Edward Island, was more open to MAID than others, but acknowledged the challenge of building the practice of assisted death virtually from scratch. “The reality,” he said, “is that we were all just kind of making it up as we went along, very cautiously.”

On a rainy spring evening in 2017, Kutcher drove to a farmhouse by the sea to administer the first state-sanctioned act of euthanasia in his province. The patient, Paul Couvrette, had learned about MAID from his wife, Liana Brittain, in 2015, soon after the supreme-court decision. He had just been diagnosed with lung cancer, and while processing this fact in the parking lot of the clinic had turned to his wife and announced: “I'm not going to have cancer. I'm going to kill myself.” Brittain told her husband this was a bit dramatic. “You know, dear, you don't have to do that,” she recalls responding. “The government will do it for you, and they'll do it for free.” Couvrette had marveled at the news, because although he was open to surgery, he had no interest in chemotherapy or radiation. MAID, Brittain told me, gave her husband the relief of a “back door.” By early 2017, the cancer had spread to Couvrette's brain; the 72-year-old became largely bedridden. He set his MAID procedure for May 10—the couple's wedding anniversary.

Kutcher and a nurse had agreed to come early and join the extended family—children, a granddaughter—for Couvrette's final dinner: seafood chowder and gluten-free biscuits. Only Brittain would eventually join Couvrette in the downstairs bedroom; the rest of the family and the couple's two dogs would wait outside on the beach. There was a shared understanding, Kutcher recalled, that “this was something none of us had experienced before, and we didn't really know what we were in for.” What followed was a “beautiful death”—that was what the local newspaper called it, Brittain told me. Couvrette's last words to his wife came from their wedding vows: I'll love you forever, plus three days.

Kutcher wrestled at first with the sheer strangeness of the experience—how quickly it was over, packing up his equipment at the side of a dead man who just 10 minutes earlier had been talking with him, very much alive. But he went home believing he had done the right thing for his patient.

For proponents, Couvrette epitomized the ideal MAID candidate, motivated not by an impulsive death wish but by a considered desire to reclaim control of his fate from a terminal disease. The lobbying group Dying With Dignity Canada celebrated Couvrette's “empowering choice and journey” as part of a showcase on its website of “good deaths” made possible by the new law. There was also the surgeon in Nova Scotia with Parkinson's who “died the same way he lived—on his own terms.” And there were the Toronto couple in their 90s who, in a “dream ending to their storybook romance,” underwent MAID together.

Such heartfelt accounts tended to center on the white, educated, financially stable patients who represented the typical MAID recipient. The stories did not precisely capture what many clinicians were discovering also to be true: that if dying by MAID was dying with dignity, some deaths felt considerably more dignified than others. Not everyone has coastal homes or children and grandchildren who can gather in love and solidarity. This was made clear to Sandy Buchman, a palliative-care physician in Toronto, during one of his early MAID cases, when a patient, “all alone,” gave final consent from a mattress on the floor of a rental apartment. Buchman recalls having to kneel next to the mattress in the otherwise empty space to administer the drugs. “It was horrible,” he told me. “You can see how challenging, how awful, things can be.”

In 2018, Buchman co-founded a nonprofit organization called MAiDHouse. The aim was to create a “third place” of sorts for people who want to die somewhere other than a hospital or at home. Finding a location proved difficult; many landlords were resistant. But by 2022, MAiDHouse had leased the space in Toronto from which it operates today. (For security reasons, the location is not public.) Tekla Hendrickson, the executive director of MAiDHouse, told me the space was designed to feel warm and familiar but also adaptable to the wishes of the person using it: furniture light enough to rearrange, bare surfaces for flowers or photos or any other personal items. “Sometimes they have champagne, sometimes they come in limos, sometimes they wear ball gowns,” Hendrickson said. The act of euthanasia itself takes place in a La-Z-Boy-like recliner, with adjacent rooms available for family and friends who may prefer not to witness the procedure. According to the MAiDHouse website, the body is then transferred to a funeral home by attendants who arrive in unmarked cars and depart “discreetly.”

Since its founding, MAiDHouse has provided space and support for more than 100 deaths. The group's homepage displays a photograph of dandelion seeds scattering in a gentle wind. A second MAiDHouse location recently opened in Victoria, British Columbia. In the organization's 2023 annual report, the chair of the board noted that MAiDHouse's followers on LinkedIn had increased by 85 percent; its new Instagram profile was gaining followers too. More to the point, the number of provisions performed at MAiDHouse had doubled over the previous year—“astounding progress for such a young organization.”

In the early days of MAID, some clinicians found themselves at once surprised and conflicted by the fulfillment they experienced in helping people die. A few months after the law's passage, Stefanie Green, whom I'd met at the conference in Vancouver, acknowledged to herself how “upbeat” she'd felt following a recent provision—“a little hyped up on adrenaline,” as she later put it in a memoir about her first year providing medical assistance in death. Green realized it was gratification she was feeling: A patient had come to her in immense pain, and she had been in a position to offer relief. In the end, she believed, she had “given a gift to a dying man.”

Green had at first been reluctant to reveal her feelings to anyone, afraid that she might be viewed, she recalled, as a “psychopath.” But she did eventually confide in a small group of fellow MAID practitioners. Green and several colleagues realized that there was a need for a formal community of professionals. In 2017, they officially launched the group whose meeting I attended.

There was a time when Madeline Li would have felt perfectly at home among the other clinicians who convened that weekend at the Sheraton. In the early years of MAID, few physicians exerted more influence over the new regime than Li. The Toronto-based cancer psychiatrist led the development of the MAID program at the University Health Network, the largest teaching-hospital system in Canada, and in 2017 saw her framework published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

It was not long into her practice, however, that Li's confidence in the direction of her country's MAID program began to falter. For all of her expertise, not even Li was sure what to do about a patient in his 30s whom she encountered in 2018.

The man had gone to the emergency room complaining of excruciating pain and was eventually diagnosed with cancer. The prognosis was good, a surgeon assured him, with a 65 percent chance of a cure. But the man said he didn't want treatment; he wanted MAID. Startled, the surgeon referred him to a medical oncologist to discuss chemo; perhaps the man just didn't want surgery. The patient proceeded to tell the medical oncologist that he didn't want treatment of any kind; he wanted MAID. He said the same thing to a radiation oncologist, a palliative-care physician, and a psychiatrist, before finally complaining to the patient-relations department that the hospital was barring his access to MAID. Li arranged to meet with him.

Canada's MAID law defines a “grievous and irremediable medical condition” in part as a “serious and incurable illness, disease, or disability.” As for what constitutes incurability, however, the law says nothing—and of the various textual ambiguities that caused anxiety for clinicians early on, this one ranked near the top. Did “incurable” mean a lack of any available treatment? Did it mean the likelihood of an available treatment not working? Prominent MAID advocates put forth what soon became the predominant interpretation: A medical condition was incurable if it could not be cured by means acceptable to the patient.

This had made sense to Li. If an elderly woman with chronic myelogenous leukemia had no wish to endure a highly toxic course of chemo and radiation, why should she be compelled to? But here was a young man with a likely curable cancer who nevertheless was adamant about dying. “I mean, he was so, so clear,” Li told me. “I talked to him about What if you had a 100 percent chance? Would you want treatment? And he said no.” He didn't want to suffer through the treatment or the side effects, he explained; just having a colonoscopy had traumatized him. When Li assured the man that they could treat the side effects, he said she wasn't understanding him: Yes, they could give him medication for the pain, but then he would have to first experience the pain. He didn't want to experience the pain.

What was Li left with? According to prevailing standards, the man's refusal to attempt treatment rendered his disease incurable and his natural death was reasonably foreseeable. He met the eligibility criteria as Li understood them. But the whole thing seemed wrong to her. Seeking advice, she described the basics of the case in a private email group for MAID practitioners under the heading “Eligible, but Reasonable?” “And what was very clear to me from the replies I got,” Li told me, “is that many people have no ethical or clinical qualms about this—that it's all about a patient's autonomy, and if a patient wants this, it's not up to us to judge. We should provide.”

And so she did. She regretted her decision almost as soon as the man's heart stopped beating. “What I've learned since is: Eligible doesn't mean you should provide MAID,” Li told me. “You can be eligible because the law is so full of holes, but that doesn't mean it clinically makes sense.” Li no longer interprets “incurable” as at the sole discretion of the patient. The problem, she feels, is that the law permits such a wide spectrum of interpretations to begin with. Many decisions about life and death turn on the personal values of practitioners and patients rather than on any objective medical criteria.

By 2020, Li had overseen hundreds of MAID cases, about 95 percent of which were “very straightforward,” she said. They involved people who had terminal conditions and wanted the same control in death as they'd enjoyed in life. It was the 5 percent that worried her—not just the young man, but vulnerable people more generally, whom the safeguards had possibly failed. Patients whose only “terminal condition,” really, was age. Li recalled an especially divisive early case for her team involving an elderly woman who'd fractured her hip. She understood that the rest of her life would mean becoming only weaker and enduring more falls, and she “just wasn't going to have it.” The woman was approved for MAID on the basis of frailty.

Li had tried to understand the assessor's reasoning. According to an actuarial table, the woman, given her age and medical circumstances, had a life expectancy of five or six more years. But what if the woman had been slightly younger and the number was closer to eight years—would the clinician have approved her then? “And they said, well, they weren't sure, and that's my point,” Li explained. “There's no standard here; it's just kind of up to you.” The concept of a “completed life, or being tired of life,” as sufficient for MAID is “controversial in Europe and theoretically not legal in Canada,” Li said. “But the truth is, it is legal in Canada. It always has been, and it's happening in these frailty cases.”

Li supports medical assistance in dying when appropriate. What troubles her is the federal government's deferring of responsibility in managing it—establishing principles, setting standards, enforcing boundaries. She believes most physicians in Canada share her “muddy middle” position. But that position, she said, is also “the most silent.”

In 2014, when the question of medically assisted death had come before Canada's supreme court, Etienne Montero, a civil-law professor and at the time the president of the European Institute of Bioethics, warned in testimony that the practice of euthanasia, once legal, was impossible to control. Montero had been retained by the attorney general of Canada to discuss the experience of assisted death in Belgium—how a regime that had begun with “extremely strict” criteria had steadily evolved, through loose interpretations and lax enforcement, to accommodate many of the very patients it had once pledged to protect. When a patient's autonomy is paramount, Montero argued, expansion is inevitable: “Sooner or later, a patient's repeated wish will take precedence over strict statutory conditions.” In the end, the Canadian justices were unmoved; Belgium's “permissive” system, they contended, was the “product of a very different medico-legal culture” and therefore offered “little insight into how a Canadian regime might operate.” In a sense, this was correct: It took Belgium more than 20 years to reach an assisted-death rate of 3 percent. Canada needed only five.

In retrospect, the expansion of MAID would seem to have been inevitable; Justin Trudeau, then Canada's prime minister, said as much back in 2016, when he called his country's newly passed MAID law “a big first step” in what would be an “evolution.” Five years later, in March 2021, the government enacted a new two-track system of eligibility, relaxing existing safeguards and extending MAID to a broader swath of Canadians. Patients approved for an assisted death under Track 1, as it was now called—meaning the original end-of-life context—were no longer required to wait 10 days before receiving MAID; they could die on the day of approval. Track 2, meanwhile, legalized MAID for adults whose deaths were not reasonably foreseeable—people suffering from chronic pain, for example, or from certain neurological disorders. Although cost savings have never been mentioned as an explicit rationale for expansion, the parliamentary budget office anticipated annual savings in health-care costs of nearly $150 million as a result of the expanded MAID regime.

The 2021 law did provide for additional safeguards unique to Track 2. Assessors had to ensure that applicants gave “serious consideration”—a phrase left undefined—to “reasonable and available means” to alleviate their suffering. In addition, they had to affirm that the patients had been directed toward such options. Track 2 assessments were also required to span at least 90 days. For any MAID assessment, clinicians must be satisfied not only that a patient's suffering is enduring and intolerable, but that it is a function of a physical medical condition rather than mental illness, say, or financial instability. Suffering is never perfectly reducible, of course—a crisp study in cause and effect. But when a patient is already dying, the role of physical disease isn't usually a mystery, either.

Track 2 introduced a web of moral complexities and clinical demands. For many practitioners, one major new factor was the sheer amount of time required to understand why the person before them—not terminally ill—was asking, at that particular moment, to die. Clinicians would have to untangle the physical experience of chronic illness and disability from the structural inequities and mental-health struggles that often attend it. In a system where access to social supports and medical services varies so widely, this was no small challenge, and many clinicians ultimately chose not to expand their practice to include Track 2 patients.

There is no clear official data on how many clinicians are willing to take on Track 2 cases. The government's most recent information indicates that, in 2023, out of 2,200 MAID practitioners overall, a mere 89 were responsible for about 30 percent of all Track 2 provisions. Jonathan Reggler, a family physician on Vancouver Island, is among that small group. He openly acknowledges the challenges involved in assessing Track 2 patients, as well as the basic “discomfort” that comes with ending the life of someone who is not in fact dying. “I can think of cases that I've dealt with where you're really asking yourself, Why? ” he told me. “Why now? Why is it that this cluster of problems is causing you such distress where another person wouldn't be distressed? ”

Yet Reggler feels duty bound to move beyond his personal discomfort. As he explained it, “Once you accept that people ought to have autonomy—once you accept that life is not sacred and something that can only be taken by God, a being I don't believe in—then, if you're in that work, some of us have to go forward and say, ‘We'll do it.' ”

For some MAID practitioners, however, it took encountering an eligible patient for them to realize the true extent of their unease with Track 2. One physician, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized by his hospital to speak publicly, recalled assessing a patient in their 30s with nerve damage. The pain was such that they couldn't go outside; even the touch of a breeze would inflame it. “They had seen every kind of specialist,” he said. The patient had tried nontraditional therapies too—acupuncture, Reiki, “everything.” As the physician saw it, the patient's condition was serious and incurable, it was causing intolerable suffering, and the suffering could not seem to be relieved. “I went through all of the tick boxes, and by the letter of the law, they clearly met the criteria for all of these things, right? That said, I felt a little bit queasy.” The patient was young, with a condition that is not terminal and is usually treatable. But “I didn't feel it was my place to tell them no.”

He was not comfortable doing the procedure himself, however. He recalled telling the MAID office in his region, “Look, I did the assessment. The patient meets the criteria. But I just can't—I can't do this.” Another clinician stepped in.

In 2023, Track 2 accounted for 622 MAID deaths in Canada—just over 4 percent of cases, up from 3.5 percent in 2022. Whether the proportion continues to rise is anyone's guess. Some argue that primary-care providers are best positioned to negotiate the complexities of Track 2 cases, given their familiarity with the patient making the request—their family situation, medical history, social circumstances. This is how assisted death is typically approached in other countries, including Belgium and the Netherlands. But in Canada, the system largely developed around the MAID coordination centers assembled in the provinces, complete with 1-800 numbers for self-referrals. The result is that MAID assessors generally have no preexisting relationship with the patients they're assessing.

How do you navigate, then, the hidden corridors of a stranger's suffering? Claude Rivard told me about a Track 2 patient who had called to cancel his scheduled euthanasia. As a result of a motorcycle accident, the man could not walk; now blind, he was living in a long-term-care facility and rarely had visitors; he had been persistent in his request for MAID. But when his family learned that he'd applied and been approved, they started visiting him again. “And it changed everything,” Rivard said. He was in contact with his children again. He was in contact with his ex-wife again. “He decided, ‘No, I still have pleasure in life, because the family, the kids are coming; even if I can't see them, I can touch them, and I can talk to them, so I'm changing my mind.' ”

I asked Rivard whether this turn of events—the apparent plasticity of the man's desire to die—had given him pause about approving the patient for MAID in the first place. Not at all, he said. “I had no control on what the family was going to do.”

Some of the opposition to MAID in Canada is religious in character. The Catholic Church condemns euthanasia, though Church influence in Canada, as elsewhere, has waned dramatically, particularly where it was once strongest, in Quebec. But from the outset there were other concerns, chief among them the worry that assisted death, originally authorized for one class of patient, would eventually become legal for a great many others too. National disability-rights groups warned that Canadians with physical and intellectual disabilities—people whose lives were already undervalued in society, and of whom 17 percent live in poverty—would be at particular risk. As assisted death became “sanitized,” one group argued, “more and more will be encouraged to choose this option, further entrenching the ‘better off dead' message in public consciousness.”

For these critics, the “reasonably foreseeable” death requirement had been the solitary consolation in an otherwise lost constitutional battle. The elimination of that protection with the creation of Track 2 reinforced their conviction that MAID would result in Canada's most marginalized citizens being subtly coerced into premature death. Canadian officials acknowledged these concerns—“We know that in some places in our country, it's easier to access MAID than it is to get a wheelchair,” Carla Qualtrough, the disability-inclusion minister, admitted in 2020—but reiterated that socioeconomic suffering was not a legal basis for MAID. Justin Trudeau took pains to assure the public that patients were not being backed into assisted death because of their inability to afford proper housing, say, or get timely access to medical care. It “simply isn't something that ends up happening,” he said.

Sathya Dhara Kovac, of Winnipeg, knew otherwise. Before dying by MAID in 2022, at the age of 44, Kovac wrote her own obituary. She explained that life with ALS had “not been easy”; it was, as far as illnesses went, a “shitty” one. But the illness itself was not the reason she wanted to die. Kovac told the local press prior to being euthanized that she had fought unsuccessfully to get adequate home-care services; she needed more than the 55 hours a week covered by the province, couldn't afford the cost of a private agency to take care of the balance, and didn't want to be relegated to a long-term-care facility. “Ultimately it was not a genetic disease that took me out, it was a system,” Kovac wrote. “I could have had more time if I had more help.”

Earlier this spring, I met in Vancouver with Marcia Doherty; she was approved for Track 2 MAID shortly after it was legalized, four years ago. The 57-year-old has suffered for most of her life from complex chronic illnesses, including myalgic encephalomyelitis, fibromyalgia, and Epstein-Barr virus. Her daily experience of pain is so total that it is best captured in terms of what doesn't hurt (the tips of her ears; sometimes the tip of her nose) as opposed to all the places that do. Yet at the core of her suffering is not only the pain itself, Doherty told me; it's that, as the years go by, she can't afford the cost of managing it. Only a fraction of the treatments she relies on are covered by her province's health-care plan, and with monthly disability assistance her only consistent income, she is overwhelmed with medical debt. Doherty understands that someday, the pressure may simply become too much. “I didn't apply for MAID because I want to be dead,” she told me. “I applied for MAID on ruthless practicality.”

It is difficult to understand MAID in such circumstances as a triumphant act of autonomy—as if the state, by facilitating death where it has failed to provide adequate resources to live, has somehow given its most vulnerable citizens the dignity of choice. In January 2024, a quadriplegic man named Normand Meunier entered a Quebec hospital with a respiratory infection; after four days confined to an emergency-room stretcher, unable to secure a proper mattress despite his partner's pleas, he developed a painful bedsore that led him to apply for MAID. “I don't want to be a burden,” he told Radio-Canada the day before he was euthanized, that March.

Nearly half of all Canadians who have died by MAID viewed themselves as a burden on family and friends. For some disabled citizens, the availability of assisted death has sowed doubt about how the medical establishment itself sees them—about whether their lives are in fact considered worthy of saving. In the fall of 2022, a 49-year-old Nova Scotia woman who is physically disabled and had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer was readying for a lifesaving mastectomy when a member of her surgical team began working through a list of pre-op questions about her medications and the last time she ate—and was she familiar with medical assistance in dying? The woman told me she felt suddenly and acutely aware of her body, the tissue-thin gown that wouldn't close. “It left me feeling like maybe I should be second-guessing my decision,” she recalled. “It was the thing I was thinking about as I went under; when I woke up, it was the first thought in my head.” Fifteen months later, when the woman returned for a second mastectomy, she was again asked if she was aware of MAID. Today she still wonders if, were she not disabled, the question would even have been asked. Gus Grant, the registrar and CEO of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia, has said that the timing of the queries to this woman was “clearly inappropriate and insensitive,” but he also emphasized that “there's a difference between raising the topic of discussing awareness about MAID, and possible eligibility, from offering MAID.”

And yet there is also a reason why, in some countries, clinicians are either expressly prohibited or generally discouraged from initiating conversations about assisted death. However sensitively the subject is broached, death never presents itself neutrally; to regard the line between an “offer” and a simple recitation of information as somehow self-evident is to ignore this fact, as well as the power imbalance that freights a health professional's every gesture with profound meaning. Perhaps the now-suspended Veterans Affairs caseworker who, in 2022, was found by the department to have “inappropriately raised” MAID with several service members had meant no harm. But according to testimony, one combat veteran was so shaken by the exchange—he had called seeking support for his ailments and was not suicidal, but was told that MAID was preferable to “blowing your brains out”—that he left the country.

In 2023, Kathrin Mentler, who lives with concurrent mental and physical disabilities, including rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of chronic pain, arrived at Vancouver General Hospital asking for help amid a suicidal crisis. Mentler has stated in a sworn affidavit that the hospital clinician who performed the intake told her that although they could contact the on-call psychiatrist, no beds were available in the unit. The clinician then asked if Mentler had ever considered MAID, describing it as a “peaceful” process compared with her recent suicide attempt via overdose, for which she'd been hospitalized. Mentler said that she left the hospital in a “panic,” and that the encounter had validated many of her worst fears: that she was a “burden” on an overtaxed system and that it would be “reasonable” for her to want to die. (In response to press reports about Mentler's experience, the regional health authority said that the conversation was part of a “clinical evaluation” to assess suicide risk and that staff are required to “explore all available care options” with patients.)

MAID advocates dispute the charge that disabled Canadians are being quietly or overtly pressured to consider assisted death, calling it a myth generated by what they view as sensationalized accounts in the press; in parliamentary hearings, lawmakers, citing federal data, have emphasized that “only a small number” of MAID recipients are unable to access the medical services and social supports they require. Even so, this past March, the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons With Disabilities formally called for the repeal of Track 2 MAID in Canada—arguing that the federal government had “fundamentally changed” the premise of assisted dying on the basis of “negative, ableist perceptions of the quality and value” of disabled lives, without addressing the systemic inequalities that amplify their perceived suffering.

Marcia Doherty agrees that it should never have come to this: her country resolving to assist her and other disabled citizens more in death than in life. She is furious that she has been “allowed to deteriorate,” despite advocating for herself before every agency and official capable of effecting change. But she is adamantly opposed to any repeal of Track 2. She expressed a sentiment I heard from others in my reporting: that the “relief” of knowing an assisted death is available to her, should the despair become unbearable, has empowered her in the fight to live.

Doherty may someday decide to access MAID. But she doesn't want anyone ever to say she “chose” it.

Ellen Wiebe never had reservations about taking on Track 2 cases—indeed, unlike most clinicians, she never had reservations about providing MAID at all. The Vancouver-based family physician had long been comfortable with controversy, having spent the bulk of her four decades in medicine as an abortion provider. As Wiebe saw it, MAID was perfectly in keeping with her “human-rights-focused” career. Over the past nine years, she has euthanized more than 430 patients and become one of the world's most outspoken champions of MAID. Today, while virtually all of her colleagues rely on referrals from MAID coordination centers, Wiebe regularly receives requests directly from patients. Coordinators also call her when they have a patient whose previous MAID requests were rejected. (There is no limit to how many times a person can apply for MAID.) “Because I'm me, you know, they send those down to Ellen Wiebe,” she told me. I asked her what she meant by that. “My reputation,” she replied.

In the summer of 2024, Wiebe heard from a 53-year-old woman in Alberta who was experiencing acute psychiatric distress—“the horrors,” the patient called them—compounded by her reaction to, and then withdrawal from, an antipsychotic drug she was prescribed for sleep. None of the woman's doctors would facilitate her desire to die. This was when, according to the version of events the woman's common-law husband would later submit to British Columbia's supreme court, she searched online for alternatives and came across Wiebe. At the end of their first meeting, a Zoom call, Wiebe said she would approve the woman for the procedure. On her formal application, the woman gave “akathisia”—a movement disorder characterized by intense feelings of inner restlessness and an inability to sit still, commonly caused by withdrawal from antipsychotic medication—as her reason for requesting an assisted death. According to court filings, no one the woman knew was willing to witness her sign the application form, as the law requires, so Wiebe had a volunteer at her clinic do so over Zoom. And because the woman still needed another physician or nurse practitioner to declare her eligible, Wiebe arranged for Elizabeth Whynot, a fellow family physician in Vancouver, to provide the second assessment. The patient was approved for MAID after a video call, and the procedure was set for October 27, 2024, in Wiebe's clinic.

Following the approval, detailed in the court filings, the Alberta woman had another Zoom call with Wiebe; this time, her husband joined the conversation. He had concerns, specifically as to how akathisia qualified as “irremediable.” Specialists had assured the woman that if she committed to the gradual tapering protocol they'd prescribed, she could very likely expect relief within months. The husband also worried that Wiebe hadn't sufficiently considered his wife's unresolved mental-health issues, and whether she was capable, in her present state, of giving truly informed consent. The day before his wife was scheduled to die, he petitioned a Vancouver judge to halt the procedure, arguing that Wiebe had negligently approved the woman on the basis of a condition that did not qualify for MAID. In a widely publicized decision, the next morning the judge issued a last-minute injunction blocking Wiebe or any other clinician from carrying out the woman's death as scheduled. “I can only imagine the pain she has been experiencing, and I recognize that this injunction will likely only make that worse,” the judge wrote. But there was an “arguable case,” he concluded, as to whether the criteria for MAID had been “properly applied in the circumstances.” The husband did not seek a new injunction after the temporary order expired, and in January, he withdrew the lawsuit altogether. Wiebe would not comment on the case other than to say she has never violated MAID laws and does not know of any provider who has. The lawyer who had represented the husband said she could not comment on whether the woman is still alive.

A number of similar lawsuits have been filed in recent years as Canadians come to terms with the hollow oversight of MAID. Because no formal procedure exists for challenging an approval in advance of a provision, many concerned family members see little choice but to take a loved one to court to try to halt a scheduled death. What oversight does exist takes place at the provincial or territorial level, and only after the fact. Protocols differ significantly across jurisdictions. In Ontario, the chief coroner's office oversees a system in which all Track 2 cases are automatically referred to a multidisciplinary committee for postmortem scrutiny. Since 2018, the coroner's office has identified more than 480 compliance issues involving federal and provincial MAID policies, including clinicians failing to consult with an expert in their patient's condition prior to approval—a key Track 2 safeguard—and using the wrong drugs in a provision. The office's death-review committee periodically publishes summaries of particular cases, for both Track 1 and Track 2, to “generate discussion” for “practical improvement.”

There was, for example, the case of Mr. C, a man in his 70s who, in 2024, requested MAID while receiving in-hospital palliative care for metastatic cancer. It should have been a straightforward Track 1 case. But two days after his request, according to the committee's report, the man experienced sharp cognitive decline and lost the ability to communicate, his eyes opening only in response to painful stimuli. His palliative-care team deemed him incapable of consenting to health-care decisions, including final permission for MAID. Despite that conclusion, a MAID clinician proceeded with the assessment, “vigorously” rousing the man to ask if he still wanted euthanasia (to which the man mouthed “yes”), and then withholding the man's pain medication until he appeared “more alert.” After confirming the man's wishes via “short verbal statements” and “head nods and blinking,” the assessor approved him for MAID; with sign-off from a second clinician, and a final consent from Mr. C mouthing “yes,” he was euthanized.

Had this patient clearly consented to his death? Finding no documentation of a “rigorous evaluation of capacity,” the death-review committee expressed “concerns” about the process. The implication would seem startling—in a regime animated at its core by patient autonomy, a man was not credibly found to have exercised his own. Yet Mr. C's death was reduced essentially to a matter of academic inquiry, an opportunity for “lessons learned.” Of the hundreds of irregularities flagged over the years by the coroner's office, almost all have been dealt with through an “Informal Conversation,” an “Educational Email,” or a “Notice Email,” depending on their severity. Specific sanctions are not made public. No case has ever been referred to law enforcement for investigation.

Wiebe acknowledged that several complaints have been filed against her over the years but noted that she has never been found guilty of wrongdoing. “And if a lawyer says, ‘Oh—I disagreed with some of those things,' I'd say, ‘Well, they didn't put lawyers in charge of this.' ” She laughed. “We were the ones trusted with the safeguards.” And the law was clear, Wiebe said: “If the assessor”—meaning herself—“believes that they qualify, then I'm not guilty of a crime.”

Despite all of the questions surrounding Track 2, Canada is proceeding with the expansion of MAID to additional categories of patients while gauging public interest in even more. As early as 2016, the federal government had agreed to launch exploratory investigations into the possible future provision of MAID for people whose sole underlying medical condition is a mental disorder, as well as to “mature minors,” people younger than 18 who are “deemed to have requisite decision-making capacity.” The government also pledged to consider “advance requests”—that is, allowing people to consent now to receive MAID at some specified future point when their illness renders them incapable of making or affirming the decision to die. Meanwhile, the Quebec College of Physicians has raised the possibility of legalizing euthanasia for infants born with “severe malformations,” a rare practice currently legal only in the Netherlands, the first country to adopt it since Nazi Germany did so in 1939.

As part of Track 2 legislation in 2021, lawmakers extended eligibility—to take effect at some point in the future—to Canadians suffering from mental illness alone. This, despite the submissions of many of the nation's top psychiatric and mental-health organizations that no evidence-based standard exists for determining whether a psychiatric condition is irremediable. A number of experts also shared concerns about whether it was possible to credibly distinguish between suicidal ideation and a desire for MAID.

After several contentious delays, MAID for mental illness is now set to take effect in 2027; authorities have been tasked in the meantime with figuring out how MAID should actually be applied in such cases. The debate has produced thousands of pages of special reports and parliamentary testimony. What all sides do agree on is that, in practice, mental disorders are already a regular feature of Canada's MAID regime. At one hearing, Mona Gupta, a psychiatrist and the chair of an expert panel charged with recommending protocols and safeguards for psychiatric MAID, noted pointedly that “people with mental disorders are requesting and accessing MAID now.” They include patients whose requests are “largely motivated by their mental disorder but who happen to have another qualifying condition,” as well as those with “long histories of suicidality” or questionable decision-making capacity. They may also be poor and homeless and have little interaction with the health-care system. But whatever the case, Gupta said, when it comes to navigating the complex intersection of MAID and mental illness, “assessors and health-care providers already do this.”

The argument was meant to assuage concerns about clinical readiness. For critics, however, it only reinforced a belief that, in some cases, physical conditions are simply being used to bear the legal weight of a different, ineligible basis for MAID, including mental disorders. In one of Canada's more controversial cases, a 61-year-old man named Alan Nichols, who had a history of depression and other conditions, applied for MAID in 2019 while on suicide watch at a British Columbia hospital. A few weeks later, he was euthanized on the basis of “hearing loss.”

As Canadians await the rollout of psychiatric MAID, Parliament's Special Joint Committee on Medical Assistance in Dying has formally recommended expanding MAID access to mature minors. In the committee's 2023 report, following a series of hearings, lawmakers acknowledged the various factors that could affect young people's capacity to evaluate their circumstances—for one, the adolescent brain's far from fully developed faculties for “risk assessment and decision-making.” But they noted that, according to several parliamentary witnesses, children with serious medical conditions “tend to possess an uncommon level of maturity.” The committee advised that MAID be limited (“at this stage”) to minors with reasonably foreseeable natural deaths, and endorsed a requirement for “parental consultation,” but not parental consent. As a lawyer with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan told the committee, “Parents may be reluctant to consent to the death of their child.”

Whether Canadian officials will eventually add mature minors to the eligibility list remains unclear. At the moment, their attention is largely focused on a different category of expansion. Last year, the province of Quebec took the next step in what some regard as the “natural evolution” of MAID: the honoring of advance requests to be euthanized. Under the Quebec law, patients in the province with cognitive conditions such as Alzheimer's can define a threshold they don't wish to cross. Some people might request to die when they no longer recognize their children, for example; others might indicate incontinence as a benchmark. When the threshold seems to have been reached, perhaps after an alert from a “trusted third party,” a MAID practitioner determines whether the patient is indeed suffering intolerably according to the terms of the advance request. Since 2016, public demand for this expansion has been steady, fueled by the testimonies of those who have watched loved ones endure the full course of dementia and do not want to suffer the same fate.

In parliamentary hearings, Quebec officials have discussed the potential problem of “pleasant dementia,” acknowledging that it might be difficult for a provider to euthanize someone who “seems happy” and “absolutely doesn't remember” consenting to an assisted death earlier in their illness. Quebec officials have also discussed the issue of resistance. The Netherlands, the only other jurisdiction where euthanizing an incapable but conscious person as a result of an advance request is legal, offers an example of what MAID in such a circumstance could look like.

In 2016, a geriatrician in the Netherlands euthanized an elderly woman with Alzheimer's who, four years earlier, shortly after being diagnosed, had advised that she wanted to die when she was “no longer able to live at home.” Eventually, the woman was admitted to a nursing home, and her husband duly asked the facility's geriatrician to initiate MAID. The geriatrician, along with two other doctors, agreed that the woman was “suffering hopelessly and intolerably.” On the day of the euthanasia, the geriatrician decided to add a sedative surreptitiously to the woman's coffee; it was given to “prevent a struggle,” the doctor would later explain, and surreptitiously because the woman would have “asked questions” and “refused to take it.” But as the injections began, the woman reacted and tried to sit up. Her family helped hold her down until the procedure was over and she was dead. The case prompted the first criminal investigation under the country's euthanasia law. The physician was acquitted by a district court in 2019, and that decision was upheld by the Dutch supreme court the following year.

In Quebec, more than 100 advance requests have been filed; according to several sources, at least one has been carried out. The law currently states that any sign of refusal “must be respected”; at the same time, if the clinician determines that expressions of resistance are “behavioural symptoms” of a patient's illness, and not necessarily an actual objection to receiving MAID, the euthanasia can continue anyway. The Canadian Association of MAiD Assessors and Providers has stated that “pre-sedating the person with medications such as benzodiazepines may be warranted to avoid potential behaviours that may result from misunderstanding.”

Laurent Boisvert, an emergency physician in Montreal who has euthanized some 600 people since 2015, told me that he has thus far helped seven patients, recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's, to file advance requests, and that they included clear instructions on what he is to do in the event of resistance. He is not concerned about potentially encountering happy dementia. “It doesn't exist,” he said.

The Canadian government had tried, in the early years of MAID, to forecast the country's demand for assisted death. The first projection, in 2018, was that Canada's MAID rate would achieve a “steady state” of 2 percent of total deaths; then, in 2022, federal officials estimated that the rate would stabilize at 4 percent by 2033. After Canada blew past both numbers—the latter, 11 years ahead of schedule—officials simply stopped publishing predictions.

And yet it was never clear how Canadians were meant to understand their country's assisted-death rate: whether, in the government's view, there is such a thing as too much MAID. In parliamentary hearings, federal officials have indicated that a national rate of 7 percent—the rate already reached in Quebec—might be potentially “concerning” and “wise and prudent to look into,” but did not elaborate further. If Canadian leaders feel viscerally troubled by a certain prevalence of euthanasia, they seem reluctant to explain why.

The original assumption was that euthanasia in Canada would follow roughly the same trajectory that euthanasia had followed in Belgium and the Netherlands. But even under those permissive regimes, the law requires that patients exhaust all available treatment options before seeking euthanasia. In Canada, where ensuring access has always been paramount, such a requirement was thought to be too much of an infringement on patient autonomy. Although Track 2 requires that patients be informed of possible alternative means of alleviating their suffering, it does not require that those options actually be made available. Last year, the Quebec government announced plans to spend nearly $1 million on a study of why so many people in the province are choosing to die by euthanasia. The announcement came shortly after Michel Bureau, who heads Quebec's MAID-oversight committee, expressed concern that assisted death is no longer viewed as an option of last resort. But had it ever been?

It doesn't feel quite right to say that Canada slid down a slippery slope, because keeping off the slope never seems to have been the priority. But on one point Etienne Montero, the former head of the European Institute of Bioethics, was correct: When autonomy is entrenched as the guiding principle, exclusions and safeguards eventually begin to seem arbitrary and even cruel. This is the tension inherent in the euthanasia debate, the reason why the practice, once set in motion, becomes exceedingly difficult to restrain. As Canada's former Liberal Senate leader James Cowan once put it: “How can we turn away and ignore the pleas of suffering Canadians?”

In the end, the most meaningful guardrails on MAID may well turn out to be the providers themselves. Legislative will has generally been fixed in the direction of more; public opinion flickers in response to specific issues, but so far remains largely settled. If MAID reaches a limit in Canada, it will happen only when practitioners decide what they can tolerate—morally or, in a system with a shrinking supply of providers, logistically. “You cannot ask us to provide at the rate we're providing right now,” Claude Rivard, who has decided not to accept advance requests, told me. “The limit will always be the evaluation and the provider. It will rest with them. They will have to do the evaluation, and they will have to say, ‘No, it's not acceptable.'”

Lori Verigin, a nurse practitioner who provides euthanasia in rural British Columbia, understands that people are concerned about their “rights”—about “not being heard.” Yet she is the person on the line when it comes to ensuring those rights. This is what is often lost in Canada's conversation about assisted dying—about the push for expansion in the academic papers or in the rarefied halls of Parliament. It is not the lawmaker or lawyer or pundit who must administer an injection and stop a heart.

On a Thursday morning in June, I joined Verigin in her white Volkswagen as she drove to a MAID appointment near the town of Trail. I had not come to witness the provision, to be a stranger in the room. I was with Verigin because I wanted to understand the before-and-after of MAID, the clinical and emotional labor involved in helping someone die. After eight years, Verigin had developed a familiar set of rhythms. She had her preferred pharmacy, the Shoppers Drug Mart close to her home, in Castlegar. This morning she had arrived as the doors opened, prescription in hand; the pharmacist greeted her by name before placing on the counter a medium-size case resembling a tackle box. Verigin unsnapped the lid and confirmed that everything was in place: the vials of midazolam, lidocaine, propofol, and rocuronium.

Verigin had known the patient she was about to visit for some time, she told me. Roughly a year ago, the patient, suffering from metastatic cancer, had first asked about MAID; two weeks earlier, the patient had looked at her and said: “I'm just done.” Verigin sipped from a to-go cup of coffee, decaf, as she drove. “I try not to have too much caffeine before,” she said.

En route to the patient's home, we stopped by the hospital to pick up Beth, an oncology nurse who often assists Verigin. Beth has a gift for assessing the energy of the room, Verigin told me, knowing when someone suddenly needed a hand held or a Kleenex, thus allowing Verigin to fully focus on the injections. Beth's mother, Ruth, had also helped solve a problem Verigin had experienced early in her MAID practice—how obtrusive it felt rolling a clattering tray of syringes into the already fragile atmosphere of a patient's home. A quilter, Ruth had designed a soft pouch with syringe inserts that rolled up like a towel. The fabric was tie-dyed and the soft bundle was secured with a Velcro strap.

We parked outside the patient's ranch-style home, the white sun glaring in a clear sky. At exactly 10 a.m., the two clinicians walked to the door, where moments later they were greeted by one of the patient's grown children. The door clicked faintly behind them.

I remained in the car, and for the next while watched the slow turn of other Thursdays: the neighbors across the street chatting in their sunroom, a dog lazing in front of a box fan. Then, at 11:39 a.m., a text message from Verigin: “We're done.”

The clinicians were quiet as they slid into the car. “Things weren't as predictable today,” Verigin said finally. Finding a vein had been unusually hard, and they worried momentarily that they might not succeed, at one point leaving the room to discuss their options. “It's always been a challenge,” the patient had reassured Beth. “You're very gentle. It's not hurting.” The patient had remained calm, unfazed. “I'm sure they were doing that for the kids, to be honest,” Beth said. “And probably me too.”

Once the IV was in place, the provision had unfolded as planned: midazolam, lidocaine, propofol, rocuronium, death. Afterward, the family had thanked and hugged the clinicians. “I think the end outcome was good,” Verigin said. “I probably would be feeling different if we couldn't fulfill the patient's wish, because it's also that big buildup and the anticipation.”

Verigin described a checklist of follow-up tasks, including the paperwork that has to be submitted within 72 hours. But for the rest of the day, her duties as a nurse practitioner would take priority. Only later that night, she said, would she finally have the space to reflect on the events of the morning. When the syringes and vials have been packed up, and the goodbyes to the survivors have been said, it is Lori Verigin who sits in her garden alone. “We are not just robots out there—we're human beings,” she said. “And there has to be some respect and acknowledgment for that.” Verigin told me she never wants to feel “comfortable” providing assistance in dying. The day she did, she said, would be the day she knew to step back.

For Verigin, providing MAID to Track 1 patients and even to some Track 2 patients has “felt sensible.” She explained: “Yes, I may be nervous. Yes, I may be sad. Yes, I may have a lot of, you know, emotions around it, but I feel like it's the right thing.” But when it comes to minors, or patients solely with mental disorders, or patients making advance requests, “I don't know if I'll feel that way.”

After dropping Beth off at the hospital in Trail, Verigin headed to the Shoppers Drug Mart in Castlegar to return the tackle box. Verigin told the pharmacist she would be back on June 18—the date of her next provision. The pharmacist was grateful for the notice. She would go ahead and order the propofol.

Deciding what's enriching for children to watch requires more homework than ever.

Julia, a Muppet on Sesame Street, is a 4-year-old girl with bright-orange hair who likes singing, painting, and playing with her stuffed bunny, “Fluffster.” She's also autistic—which means, as the show made clear during the character's TV debut, in 2017, that Julia expresses herself in a manner some might not understand. When Big Bird worries that Julia's silence means she doesn't like him, his fellow Muppet Abby explains that Julia does things “in a Julia sort of way.” By the end of the episode, Big Bird and Julia are friends, even harmonizing in song.

Neurodivergence is rarely portrayed authentically on-screen, let alone in a way children can grasp. But Julia, who went on to become a regular presence on the show, is the result of a collaboration between Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit company behind Sesame Street, and a team of researchers who study child development and autism. And her introduction did more than demonstrate what neurodivergence can look like; the show emphasized that she has an identity of her own and is as worthy of friendship as anyone else. Those are complex concepts, carefully constructed for young viewers to comprehend.

In the years ahead, such meticulous work may be harder to accomplish. In May, President Donald Trump's executive order pulling federal dollars from public networks such as PBS and PBS Kids led to the abrupt termination of Ready to Learn, a grant designed in part to financially provide for the development of children's shows. Last month, Congress approved the Trump administration's rescission package, revoking $1.1 billion previously allocated to public radio and television. Canceling such funding, PBS Kids' senior vice president and general manager Sara DeWitt told me recently, “really puts a lot of our future planning in jeopardy”—planning that involves ensuring that their children's shows are in line with the “high quality” educational TV established by Sesame Street. Not helping matters is the fact that, despite being arguably the most consequential children's show in history, Sesame Street has spent this past year being passed around like a hot potato by different streaming partners.

The series' turbulent journey to stay on the air reflects, in some ways, how precarious and expansive the children's-TV landscape has become. Before the streaming boom, parents could depend on a handful of publicly funded or dedicated networks for well-curated, enriching children's programming. But as newer media platforms have become more prevalent, kids' television has become more sprawling—and more difficult for families to navigate. Streamers such as Netflix now offer kids' programming, with their own siloed-off sections and parental controls; YouTube, too, is packed with content creators making children's videos. Koyalee Chanda, a creative executive at Lion Forge Entertainment, a production company geared toward family-friendly projects, describes the current multiplatform landscape as “preschool Tinder,” a realm in which young viewers can swipe endlessly through videos, seeking a match without always knowing the difference between one show's intentions and another's—and in which it's harder for show creators to make their work stand out. “Essentially,” Chanda told me, “you only are as valuable as your thumbnail.”

As such, children's television has become a diffuse field. Linda Simensky, a former executive for Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon who helped create shows such as Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls, told me she fears that the genre has ballooned out of control. The industry's changing priorities and shaky quality assurance have left her disenchanted by the business. “I spent more than 30 years building this industry,” she said, “and I feel like it's just all falling apart now.”

Think of a beloved character from your childhood—a Teletubby, maybe, or Thomas the Tank Engine. What comes to mind? Nostalgia, probably. But according to a study by UCLA's Center for Scholars & Storytellers that was published earlier this year, a toddler's favorite characters can also promote the development of lifelong behaviors and skills. Take Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, the animated spin-off of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood that began airing in 2012. The show has consulted childhood-development experts to ensure that the 4-year-old Daniel behaves like many of the preschoolers who watch him: If he gets mad, he expresses his anger; if he is disappointed, he makes that clear. Afterward, he sings a “strategy song,” teaching his audience social-emotional skills while simultaneously relating to them. The UCLA survey reported that 21 percent of teenagers who had grown up watching Daniel were still making use of the skills they'd learned years earlier.

The goal for many of those working in children's entertainment, DeWitt explained, is to make shows that help viewers retain a variety of skills, emotional and otherwise. That's certainly the approach behind Sesame Street: “Our guiding principle has been to center the preschooler in our storytelling, always,” Halcyon Person, the head writer for the show's upcoming season, told me over email. She explained that by observing kids' needs, “we know not only that we're making something that will teach them, but something that will stick with them as they grow.” Doing this has become harder, however, as the industry becomes more fragmented. In the past, child-development experts were often included in the making of kids' television, DeWitt said, but now “a lot of the new content that's being created for kids is being created by anyone and is uploaded into a space that isn't heavily regulated and also doesn't have curation tied to it.” Plus, children themselves have become content creators, even small-screen stars. A preschooler can learn their ABCs from Elmo in one video, then watch another made by someone their own age, encouraging them to like and subscribe.

The proportion of self-produced work to network-commissioned programming started to change as soon as YouTube became a significant player in the entertainment industry, in the 2010s. The company is reportedly on track to outpace even Disney in revenue, as a majority of younger consumers find creator-driven, social-media efforts more relevant than traditional media. “There are stars, characters, and IP on YouTube that have bigger and deeper fan bases than what we're seeing on linear television,” Chris Williams, the founder and CEO of PocketWatch, a studio that harnesses the popularity of internet-driven talent, told me. His company partners with channels and creators that have major followings, such as Ryan Kaji, the now-teenage host of Ryan's World, and builds upon the content they've already developed. “We kind of curate it, enrich it, package it,” Williams said of PocketWatch's aim. “We basically turn it into TV.”

That strategy is similar to what's deployed at Moonbug, the company that acquired and distributes Blippi and CoComelon. The latter show—a juggernaut on YouTube, attracting billions of views with its bobble-headed animated characters and earworm-y nursery songs—often came up as an example for, as one parent put it to me, the “brain rot” their family encounters on YouTube. When I told Moonbug's chief creative officer Richard Hickey that some parents are wary of CoComelon, he sounded dismayed. He told me that Moonbug is a “creative first” company, cultivating its shows with what he refers to as a “story trust” that's concerned with finding storytelling elements that will resonate with their audience. “Of course, yes, we are a business,” he said. “We're looking for successful properties that we can then build on and try and create franchises from—but really, at the heart of it, how does that content connect with our viewers?”

Williams pointed out that, in some ways, companies such as PocketWatch are simply trying to expand the reach of content that's already popular and considered good for kids, therefore streamlining the painstaking process of choosing what to watch. “Parents have been media-shamed about YouTube for a really long time, like, Everything on YouTube's bad, right?” Williams said. “99.99 percent of everything on YouTube for kids is bad, but we're mining for the .01 percent.”

Making sure that children's videos on YouTube are better than the majority of what's available is a task that Katie Kurtz, the managing director and global head of youth and learning at YouTube, tackles for a living. She told me that when a creator marks a video or channel as age-appropriate on the YouTube platform, an algorithm—fine-tuned by machine learning and, at times, by human moderators—studies whether it follows the company's “quality principles,” which educators and developmental psychologists helped establish in 2021. (Not all content labeled this way ends up on YouTube Kids. YouTube occasionally marks videos as “Made for kids” based on its own algorithmic findings, although creators can appeal the label if they believe it's inaccurate.) The platform then recommends videos that promote the outlined principles, such as self-care, learning, and creativity, while burying submissions that don't meet these standards. YouTube also invites experts to host workshops that train creators on how to refine their videos in accordance with quality expectations. “For us, it's really not enough to be a safe experience,” Kurtz said. “We want it to be an enriching experience as well.”

One of those experts is Yalda Uhls, the founder and CEO of the Center of Scholars & Storytellers at UCLA. Although she helps shape the direction of YouTube's content standards and has praised their impact, she has doubts about whether what's being produced will always enrich children. “Companies are focused on money and engagement and the most eyeballs,” she told me. “To continuously try to come up with a mechanism to get them to want to work with you on supporting their audience's well-being, it's just hard.” She recalled a meeting years ago in which a YouTube executive in charge of a former division making children's content asked experts which programs creators should draw inspiration from—only to bristle when they suggested Mister Rogers. (YouTube declined to comment.) “‘I would never make a show like that, because it's too slow,'” she recalled the executive saying. “And we were all like, What?!”

Of course, the children's-television genre today isn't devoid of series like Mister Rogers; Uhls herself pointed to Ms. Rachel, the popular YouTuber who specializes in toddler-friendly music, as a worthy successor. Yet young viewers have fewer sources directing them toward shows of this nature. The defunding of public networks has made the decentralization of kids' TV more stark, while individual companies and studios differ on what's considered worthwhile programming. “We're trying to make the most nourishing content we can,” Hickey, the Moonbug executive, said. But in the end, caregivers should take charge, he argued: “I don't think there's any shortcut.”

Even creating guidelines for a single household, though, can get complicated quickly. Tetyana Korchynskyy, one of the parents I spoke with, told me that when her son began watching television just before his first birthday, she set ground rules for what he could view. There'd be no horror, no violence, and nothing meant for grown-ups. Screen time would not happen first thing in the morning or right before bed. She'd aim to allow up to three hours of daily viewing while also making sure he played outside, ideally with other kids.

Korchynskyy's son is now 3, and maintaining those guardrails has often felt like a job in and of itself. Even though she tries to control the apps he can access and monitor which shows leave him glued to the screen, his media consumption can be “very difficult to really control,” she told me. His preferences, too, can complicate the task; after liking Ms. Rachel for a while, he suddenly began rejecting her videos.

This abandonment of Ms. Rachel—poor Ms. Rachel!—reminded me of something Simensky, who helped develop series such as The Ren & Stimpy Show and Rocko's Modern Life, observed about her work as a former creative executive. She'd know something was resonating if she saw children playing pretend with the characters. She called it “the yard platform”—as in, were the kids putting the show on in the yard? If so, that meant they were passionate enough about what they were watching to become active participants rather than just passive viewers.

In other words, children's interests and tastes can help greatly in the design of kids' shows—if not in the studio, then in focus groups and research studies. Chanda, the Lion Forge executive, recalled her early days of directing Blue's Clues, when she learned that the show followed a specific rhythm—one that could feel slow for adults. Children, studies indicate, seem to struggle to perform tasks after watching fast-paced content. Conventional wisdom may dictate that not much is required to hold a preschooler's attention—“There's always been an attitude of ‘Kids will watch whatever you give them,'” Simensky said—but Blue's Clues aimed to also enrich its young viewers' minds.

The history of the genre is one of constant disruption: Kids grow up quickly, the tech industry innovates rapidly, financial support fluctuates often, and societal norms are always changing. Lately, the combined disruption has become more acute—the funding more sharply slashed, the landscape more difficult to navigate—which, in turn, is threatening the quality control that children's programming needs. But key to finding a way forward through the uncertainty, Chanda pointed out, is understanding that a clear constant exists amid all the shakiness. “Everyone who works in kids' TV knows who their boss really is,” she said. “Their boss is that kid.”

We had a playbook for handling biothreats. Then Trump pushed out the people who knew how to use it.

As of last month, there is no one left in the White House whose sole job is to keep the nation safe from biological threats. The leader of the National Security Council's biosecurity directorate recently resigned. His staff had been pushed out, and his unit is now defunct. The Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy, established by Congress in 2022, has dwindled from a staff of about 20 under President Joe Biden to a staff of zero.

The Trump administration has said that it's just reorganizing the bureaucracy and is prepared to handle biothreats. But our experience suggests otherwise. Without a leader from the NSC embedded in the White House and ready to coordinate other agencies, more people—including Americans—will get sick and die.

We have spent years helping lead the U.S. government's efforts to contain the deadliest biological threats. One of us, Beth Cameron, helped found the NSC's biosecurity office, in 2016—created as a response to a deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa that had begun a couple of years earlier. Ebola is a gruesome, highly contagious disease that causes its victims' organs, blood vessels, and immune cells to fail. The average lethality rate is about 50 percent. That outbreak killed more than 11,000 people across West Africa and cost the U.S. government billions of dollars to help contain. Despite our government's best efforts, 11 cases ultimately reached the U.S., and two were fatal.

President Donald Trump terminated the NSC's biosecurity office during his first term, but Biden reestablished it—and just in time. In early February 2021, an ominous email came to the White House from federal health officials: reports of Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The cases were close to the borders of Uganda and Rwanda, major travel hubs for the region.

The White House was already managing the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic crisis. But leaving Guinea and Congo to handle the Ebola outbreaks on their own was risky. So we activated a system developed through hard-learned lessons from past deadly outbreaks, designed to help contain them at their sources and to prepare for the worst at home.

We sent public-health professionals to advise the affected countries. We took inventory of vaccines and other supplies so we would be ready to deploy them. We relied on a painstaking system of testing, vaccinations, and predeparture screenings in Congo and Guinea. We ensured that anyone who had been to an affected country and was seeking to come to the United States was funneled to one of a handful of American airports. The CDC and the Department of Homeland Security activated a program for tracing and contacting passengers after their arrival. One of us, Jon Finer—the principal deputy national security adviser at the time—led a team of senior health and national-security officials from across the government; it met every day to coordinate all of the moving parts, and to keep the president and other senior officials informed.

It worked. The disease was entirely contained within the two source countries—no cases reached the U.S.—and 18 people died, a number that could have been exponentially higher.

To strengthen our responses to future pandemics, lawmakers soon established the position of a U.S. coordinator for global health security; one of us, Stephanie Psaki, was the first person to hold that job. They also created the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy in the White House. The Trump administration, tasked with upholding the law, is supposed to be staffing these offices. Not only has it failed to do that, but in just six months, it also has dismantled many of the early-warning-and-response systems that were built over decades.

In Trump's second term, his team has fired thousands of public-health experts at the CDC, the FDA, and other agencies. It has canceled investments in safeguards against pandemic influenza, undermined confidence in vaccines, and cut funding for potential future outbreaks. It killed USAID and is scaling down the CDC's global role, canceling many of the programs that maintained ties to countries where disease outbreaks occur. It has withdrawn the U.S. from the World Health Organization. And it has created confusion about who in the U.S. government is in charge of the system for tracking deadly biothreats, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate.

Put another way: The second Trump administration inherited a playbook, and then pushed out the people who knew how to run the plays.

The United States is dealing with many biological threats at home and abroad, such as the bird flu and measles—with the latter, America is already facing the worst outbreak in decades. Scientists estimate about a 50–50 chance of another pandemic as severe as the coronavirus occurring in the next 25 years. The probability is even higher for smaller-scale threats, such as periodic Ebola outbreaks. Deadly biothreats are more and more likely to emerge for a range of reasons, including increased interaction between humans and animals, labs without sufficient biosecurity systems, easier public access to the information and technology needed to create or manipulate a bioagent, and continued concerns about the development of biological weapons by nefarious actors. The risk of death and economic disruption is only growing.

America rebuilt the system of disease detection and response after the first Trump administration damaged it. That will be harder to do this time around. Far more officials have left the government. Will they be willing to come back, given the degree to which their work has been disparaged and their job security eviscerated?

Stopping deadly diseases from reaching the United States is challenging at the best of times. Absent trusting relationships and, truth be told, a fair amount of pressure, affected countries aren't always forthcoming with information. (We dealt with one case that required resorting to threats to withhold U.S. support if the other government didn't share more data about an emerging outbreak.) Health imperatives can collide with political ones, such as when a country has to consider restricting travel. Questions can arise about how much of a vaccine or treatment should be shared with other countries, and how much should be kept at home (if a vaccine or treatment exists at all).

But these are all reasonable policy debates that assume the system is basically functioning. In a worst-case scenario, we might not even know about a disease until it has started spreading in a major city with an international airport. With no warning, we will have less ability to stop the disease at its source, and less power, if it reaches our shores, to save American lives. The odds of us facing that scenario have now gone way up. This would be a terrible tragedy, and all the more so because it would be self-inflicted.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Beef-tallow moisturizer is just the beginning of cow-based wellness.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

A not-insignificant number of TikToks aim to convince the viewer that beef-tallow moisturizer will not make your face smell like cow. The beauty influencers who tend to appear in these videos—usually clear-skinned women rubbing tallow into their face as they detail their previous dermatological woes—describe the scent as “buttery” or “earthy” or grass-like. Many of them come to the same conclusion: Okay, even if the tallow does smell a little bit, the smooth skin it leaves behind is well worth it.

Beef tallow (as both a moisturizer and an alternative to seed oils) is one of many cow-based products that have crowded the wellness market in the past five or so years. Beef-bone broth is a grocery-store staple. Demand for raw milk has grown, despite numerous cases of illness and warnings from public-health officials that drinking it can be fatal. In certain circles, raw cow organs—heart, liver, kidney—are prized superfoods. Target and Walmart sell supplements containing bovine collagen (a protein found in cowhide and bone) and colostrum (the rich liquid that mammals produce for their newborn offspring); they promise healthier skin, a happier gut, and stronger immunity, and come in flavors such as watermelon lime, lemon sorbet, and “valiant grape.” You can buy cow-placenta pills for postpartum healing, or powdered bull testicle for testosterone support. The slightest interaction with clean-beauty Instagram can fill your feed with ads for beef-tallow lip balms, cleansing creams, sunscreen, and deodorants. (One brand even offers creamsicle-flavored beef-tallow personal lubricant, which is currently out of stock online.) Influencers praise tallow for clearing their acne and eczema—and offer discount codes so you can experience the same.

Even the government's recent public-health messaging has veered toward the bovine. During his tenure as health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has championed cooking in beef tallow (which he says is healthier than seed oils) and drinking raw milk (one of many items that he claims are suppressed by the FDA). Casey Means, President Donald Trump's nominee for surgeon general, also supports raw milk; she has suggested that Americans can decide whether a given bottle is safe to drink by looking the dairy farmer in the eye and petting his cow. Means and Kennedy have largely avoided engaging with the many public-health experts who reject their views. But in May, after months of such critiques, Kennedy took shots of raw milk at the White House to celebrate the release of the “Make America Healthy Again” report.

Woo-woo, it seems, is becoming moo-moo. America has entered its cowmaxxing era.

Like most wellness offerings, cow products are marketed with vague health claims that are virtually impossible to confirm or deny, such as “deeply nourishes and supports the skin barrier,” “activate cellular health,” and “supports memory.” One of the many promises of the Ancestral Supplements Starter Pack of organ-based capsules is simply “vitality.” (The company also includes a disclaimer that the FDA has not reviewed said vitality benefits.) Advocates of these goods tend to be more specific in their praise. Raw-milk enthusiasts claim that unpasteurized milk contains bioactive chemicals that improve human health. In one video, a woman drinks raw milk that's been in the fridge for more than a month; she claims it is safer to consume than store-bought pizza or salad and that it reduces rates of eczema, fevers, and respiratory infections. One smooth-skinned influencer, who says she hasn't washed her face in two years, claims that beef tallow is “bioidentical” to the sebum produced by human skin. (It's not, because it's from cows.)

Read: The real appeal of raw milk

Some of these products are more likely to provide benefits than others. Bone broth is indeed rich in collagen (which, when produced by the human body, strengthens hair and skin). Whey powder, made from leftover cheese water, does contain protein. But very few studies support the idea that eating more collagen strengthens hair and skin. Whey protein can help build lean muscle, but the body can only absorb so much at a time. Some dermatologists say tallow can strengthen and hydrate the skin; others say it clogs pores and should be avoided. Other products can be downright dangerous: Just this week, Florida officials announced that 21 people fell sick after consuming contaminated raw milk.

At least part of the appeal of cowmaxxing is the cows themselves: The products evoke the pastoral ideal of a cow grazing freely in the plains, milked lovingly by human hands. It's an image that's been embedded in American culture for centuries. Consider how Laura Ingalls Wilder, who was no stranger to the harsh reality of farm life, described cow-raising in Little Town on the Prairie: “Warm and sweet, the scent of new milk came up from the streams hissing into the rising foam, and it mixed with the scents of springtime.” It's enough to persuade a microbiologist to drink raw milk.

In 21st-century America, cows still summon images of fields and clover and wide blue sky, enough to trigger the human tendency to believe that what's natural is “fundamentally good,” Courtney Lappas, a biology professor at Lebanon Valley College, told me. Her research has shown that some Americans prefer natural over man-made products even when the former is described as objectively worse—a phenomenon her colleague Brian Meier has called the “naturalness bias.” This tendency, which is prevalent across cultures, likely leads people to assume that unprocessed cow-based products are safe and healthy, she said. Tallow, some skin-care enthusiasts claim, is a healthier, safer alternative to conventional moisturizers, which supposedly contain toxic chemicals. The branding of such products, too, leans into the notion that natural is best: Fat Cow Skincare markets its tallow cosmetics as “pure skincare, powered by nature”; Heart and Soil sells capsules of “nature's superfood” (that is, organ meats). Other brands invoke nature through the prehistoric, with names such as Primal Harvest, Primal Kitchen, Primal FX, Primal Being, and Primal Queen. Ancestral Supplements' ad copy reads: “Putting Back In What the Modern World Left Out.”

America's current health landscape is the perfect setting for cowmaxxing to thrive. The naturalness bias is deeply ingrained in Kennedy's MAHA campaign, which aims to improve public health by returning to a more natural lifestyle. In Kennedy's view, beef tallow is superior to seed oil because it's less processed (some people even render it at home). The carnivore and tradwife movements embody a similar message, promoting the consumption of raw cow organs and making butter from scratch. You may not know what's in store-bought products, the thinking goes, but you do know what's in tallow: pure, unadulterated cow fat.

And yet most modern cows live in a decidedly unnatural environment. The majority of U.S. cattle are fed genetically modified crops, and some genetically modified cows are allowed to be sold as food. Many cow-based wellness products bear the label “grass-fed,” which suggests cows that were raised on pastures rather than feedlots. But the label is not strictly enforced, and it doesn't necessarily prohibit farmers from giving cows antibiotics or hormones. There's no guarantee that a cow whose colostrum is harvested to be sold by a tradwife on Instagram had a happy, bucolic existence. Not to mention that colostrum, whey, and placenta do not come out of the cow in the form of powders or pills.

The spread of science misinformation, along with legitimate concerns about the state of public health in the United States, have left many Americans understandably confused about whether conventional science and Western medicine can be trusted in 2025. Getting to the bottom of, say, the seed-oil controversy requires engaging with thorny scientific debates that reference inscrutable research papers; embracing the natural and ancestral by opting for tallow is an attractively simple-seeming alternative. “It brings with it a sense of purity or wholesomeness that is desirable right now,” Marianne Clark, a sociologist at Acadia University who studies wellness trends, told me. In this sense, cowmaxxing is not so much a health endeavor as it is a spiritual one, its promise downright biblical: Cowliness is next to godliness.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A new book argues for making the U.S. a “true” democracy, but fails at the essential strategy of persuasion.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Is America a democracy? Reactionaries, such as the activist Charlie Kirk and Senator Mike Lee of Utah, say it is not, never was, and shouldn't be. They justify the antidemocratic features of the Constitution and contemporary politics—the Electoral College, the gerrymander—with the label republican, meaning a representative system with guardrails that protect political minorities (and happen to keep their side in power). Some progressives agree that the United States has never been a true democracy, but they would very much like to change that. They trace the country's ills to this original failure and imagine the fulfillment of America's promise in a democratic rebirth that puts real power in the hands of the people.

This is the thesis of The Right of the People: Democracy and the Case for a New American Founding, a new book by Osita Nwanevu, a writer for The New Republic and The Guardian. Nwanevu wants more collective decision making, more equality and freedom, for ordinary American voters and workers. Almost 250 years after the Declaration of Independence, he argues that genuine American democracy would be a good thing, but that creating it would require “the transformation not only of our political institutions but of our economy.”

Nwanevu wields journalism as a cutting tool that's well oiled with contempt (I've been on its receiving end)—a style refined in the social-media polemics of the past decade's progressive orthodoxy. After Kamala Harris's defeat in last year's election, Nwanevu wrote in an X post: “Yep, time to break from the left. Next time, Dems should try saying they'll do more to crack down on immigration than Republicans. Instead of ‘Defund the Police,' run a prosecutor. Talk about having a gun and wanting a strong military instead of your identity. Just some ideas.” Habitual sarcasm toward fools who can't see why you're right is usually a sign of political weakness, suggesting that you have no hope or intention of convincing the unpersuaded of anything. Contempt is a style of proud and perpetual defeat.

In The Right of the People, Nwanevu subdues his own journalistic reflexes long enough to construct a sweeping argument out of history and political theory. He says at the outset that he's “dog-tired, already, of the habits of mind that shape American political journalism” and jaded by all the talk about threats to “our democracy” from pundits who don't know or care what it really is. Democracy in America doesn't just need to be defended, Nwanevu believes—it needs to be articulated, affirmed, and built: “Democracy has become a specious and suspicious platitude, equally useful to marketers and would-be dictators—a hollow idea for a hollow, unserious time.”

The Right of the People is his ambitious response. Nwanevu describes democracy as collective self-government by equals in which decisions are made by majority rule; explains why this, of all systems, is the one most worth pursuing; answers democracy's critics, beginning with Plato; argues that democracy has been betrayed in the United States since the country's founding; and proposes ideas and policies to make democracy an American reality. A subject on this scale doesn't lend itself to savage takedowns. In the slower, more demanding form of a well-researched, carefully reasoned book, especially in its first half, Nwanevu takes democracy's opponents and its own vulnerabilities seriously.

George Packer: The end of Democratic delusions

And yet, despite the ringing title and subtitle, little in Nwanevu's “new American founding” is new. The thesis that the Founders drafted an antidemocratic Constitution to protect their own political and economic interests dates back to the groundbreaking work of the Progressive historian Charles Beard, first published more than a century ago and contested ever since. (Nwanevu's version relies heavily on Michael J. Klarman's 2016 book, The Framers' Coup, also much debated.) When Nwanevu leaves theory and history for current politics and policy, he moves onto even more familiar ground. Yes, the Senate is grotesquely unrepresentative, and unless its structure is radically changed (a constitutional near-impossibility), the people of Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico deserve senators of their own. The filibuster exaggerates the Senate's anti-majoritarianism, giving each resident of Wyoming a far louder voice than a Californian. The unelected, life-tenured Supreme Court upholds laws that take power from common people and give it to corporations. Inequality is at Gilded Age levels, and some CEOs make several hundred times more than their employees. Amazon's destructive effect on workers' wages, bodies, and communities has been well documented—the journalist Alec MacGillis wrote an excellent book about it. Far too much power is concentrated in far too few hands. If you don't think so, you haven't been following the career of Elon Musk.

Nwanevu's proposals for a new founding amount to a progressive wish list: End the Senate filibuster, expand the House of Representatives, oblige the states to abide by the national popular vote, impose Supreme Court term limits, raise taxes on wealth, break up monopolies, remove obstacles to unionizing, give workers more say in the running of companies, etc. I'm for most of it. None of it is very original.

What's the point of saying we need more equality and more democracy? The question is how to get them, beyond simply laying out an agenda. Other progressives, such as the legal scholar Jedediah Purdy, want a second Constitutional Convention; some of them would scrap the 1787 text as hopelessly flawed and start anew. Nwanevu doesn't place much faith in this constitutional Hail Mary. The idea of a new convention first gained traction more than a decade ago among conservatives, and Nwanevu rightly realizes that they're better positioned than liberals to determine the outcome. “We are still perhaps generations away from a truly democratic Constitution,” he acknowledges. “But the work toward it—and the work to build a more democratic country—must begin now.” In other words, there's no escape from politics—from “decades of political persuasion and organization.” Exactly what that effort would look like, Nwanevu leaves to others, noting that “there are details here that political professionals and organizers are going to have to work out.”

But this is where his aspirations run up against the shortcomings of his politics. Though most of the book is a nonpartisan brief for democracy as a good in itself, in the end Nwanevu leaves no doubt that a more democratic America will be a more left-wing one. “Our frustrations with our false democracy have corroded faith in the ideal to the benefit of antidemocratic figures on the right,” he concludes. “Beyond being worthwhile on their own merits, the political and economic reforms we've examined constitute a democratic agenda that stands a better chance of defeating the right than the flimsy and predictable rhetoric their opponents have offered up so far.” These “opponents” are left vague, but they seem to be mainstream Democrats who are too timorous to embrace his agenda and take the fight to the right-wing adversary. According to Nwanevu, giving more power to the people will eventually bring the country around to his worldview.

This belief—that ordinary Americans are closer to New Republic and Guardian readers than most of us realize—is a besetting vice of the left, an undisturbable illusion from inside the bubble that forms around political isolation and defeat. It's based on assumptions about what goes on in the minds of ordinary people Nwanevu shows no sign of having talked to. And it's belied by election after election, including last year's.

Adrienne LaFrance: A ticking clock on American freedom

In The Right of the People, Donald Trump is barely a minor character. Nwanevu has almost nothing to say about right-wing populism—the strongest current in electoral politics around the world. He can't explain (and doesn't try to) why working-class Americans of all ethnicities currently seem to feel more strongly about stricter immigration enforcement than paid family and medical leave. He can't account for the fact that those Americans who were so alienated from our fake democracy that they didn't bother voting last year would have been likelier to have gone for Trump than for Harris.

Now that Republican populism, in complete control of government, is showing itself to be a defender of plutocracy, Democrats have a chance to earn the trust of voters as the party that represents the interests and values of the majority. But to do so, Democrats have to know what country they're living in. Nwanevu's analysis of the original Constitutional Convention, in which conservative elites thwarted the democratic will of ordinary people for their own selfish ends, remains his vision of our America. It's a satisfying story, but it doesn't explain important aspects of 1787—for example, that populists in small states secured the grossly unequal structure of the Senate against the egalitarian arguments of large-state nationalists. And it gets American politics today, with a left-leaning party supported by professional elites (such as Nwanevu and me) and a right-wing party supported by less educated wage workers, nearly backwards. Persuading and organizing your fellow citizens begins with trying to understand how they think. But this is just what Nwanevu's approach to politics never does.

For Nwanevu, democracy is ultimately about the distribution of power. Distribute it more equally, and the result will be more and better democracy. He has almost no time for Alexis de Tocqueville, who understood self-government as not just collective power to be used but a difficult art to be practiced, mastered, and easily lost. The illiberal atmosphere of the past decade, with a political culture of hostile mobs and mass delusions, doesn't seem to trouble Nwanevu, as if it has nothing to do with democracy. He likes to quote Walt Whitman and John Dewey, but his own language never conveys their sense that democracy is a spirit, a mode of life—the only form of government that allows human beings to realize their full potential.

Nwanevu is right that democracy's advocates have to do more than earnestly ring an alarm bell about authoritarianism. They also have to diagnose and fix what's wrong with an American system that most Americans think has failed them. Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans have recently expressed the view that democracy is under threat and that self-government isn't working. But if half the country thinks that Trump is the reason for those problems and the other half thinks that he's the solution, arguing that more democracy will change America for the better isn't convincing. You first have to put away sentimentality about “the people.” We're as capable of hating one another and believing lies and making terrible decisions and using power to take away one another's rights as we are of governing ourselves with clarity and wisdom. “We know more than the Founders did,” Nwanevu asserts in his last pages. “We are more practiced at governance. We are more moral, more just.” At a time of widespread indifference to the destruction of the most basic values that deserve to be called democratic, I'd hesitate to flatter Americans with these claims.

No screens in the bedroom. Ever.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

As a mom, my news feed is flooded with cautionary tales about all the ways technology will ruin my kids—and all the ways I must protect them. Social-media bans. Screen-time limits. The “Wait Until 8th” pledge. Analog technology. Read their texts. But wait, give them privacy! Add in the eye-roll-inducing reminder that “every kid is different,” and the guidance will suck the joy out of parenting faster than your kid can download TikTok.

My children are young, but already I see the way my toddler signs more after watching an episode of Ms. Rachel, and the eager look in my 5-year-old's eyes when he asks for my phone to watch videos of komodo dragons. At this stage, their digital curiosity feels mostly harmless. But I know that soon we'll be debating whether they can download Snapchat and Instagram, not whether they can watch another episode of Wild Kratts on PBS Kids, and I dread the thought of having to navigate the thicket of advice.

So I listened up when the psychologist Jonathan Haidt, the author of The Anxious Generation, told me during a recent interview that there's one tech rule he “really” regrets not following with his kids: no screens in the bedroom, ever. Immediately, I was drawn to the simplicity. There were no apps to download, no timers to set, nothing to buy. And I was comforted by how widely endorsed the guidance is. The psychologist Lisa Damour, who specializes in adolescent development, has told parents that if they implement only one tech rule, this should be it. Michael Rich, a pediatrician and the founder of Boston Children's Hospital's Digital Wellness Lab, told me that he “strongly” recommends the same. It seemed like a holy grail—the rule to follow if you can follow only one rule.

Read: The underlying messages that screen-time recommendations send parents

Some of the reasons for the guidance are obvious. For years, experts, including those at the American Academy of Pediatrics, have urged parents to wrestle kids' screens out of their room in the evening. As many people well know, using screens at night delays bedtime, shortens sleep duration, and worsens sleep quality; phones can disrupt rest just by being in the same room, Lauren Hale, a professor studying sleep at Stony Brook Medicine, told me. The impacts of insufficient sleep can be wide ranging, including poor cognitive performance, worse academic outcomes, and lowered immune function. And crucially, “anything that undermines sleep is going to undermine adolescent mental health,” Damour told me. Not getting enough sleep is a significant risk factor for suicidal thoughts and self-harm.

The promise of protecting my kids' mental health would have been enough to convince me to declare their bedrooms screen-free zones. But, experts told me, the benefits extend even further. For one, unlike so many other rules, keeping screens out of bedrooms doesn't just impose temporary restrictions that kids will likely ignore as soon as they get an ounce of freedom. It can also help them develop a healthy relationship with technology—one that they'll carry with them as they get older. Rich called this “future-proofing” your kid.

To some extent, Damour told me, adults will naturally become more responsible with technology as they get older and develop better impulse control. But before that time comes, this rule can keep teens from doing things online they may regret. When kids can use their devices only in communal areas such as the kitchen and the living room, there's the obvious plus that parents can keep an eye on what they're doing. Kristina Wright, a mom and writer who lives near Richmond, Virginia, told me that when her teenage son live-games with friends in common areas while she works from home, she can easily ask him about any unfamiliar voices. But a more profound mental shift happens in kids' brains, Damour said. In such a public space, it's a lot harder to forget that anything they do on their computer or phone can become, well, public. Compare that with how many tend to make choices alone in the middle of the night, when “their impulses are strong and their brakes are weak,” Damour said, and the difference is striking.

In addition to facilitating better decision making, using screens around family can be a reminder that many of the best uses of these devices are the most social ones. Scrolling next to Mom and Dad on the couch, kids might feel more inclined to invite parents into their digital life, which, for many kids, is no different from their real life. Rich said that kids often tell him they want their parents to pay more attention to them. They might actually enjoy showing off the TikTok dance they learned, or explaining what rizz means (even if they cringe when their parents try to say it). Conversations like these can create richer family relationships and help counteract smartphones' isolating nature. Along the way, parents might learn about what their kids are into and the world they're growing up in. And at the very least, Damour said, kids won't get a chance to develop the habit of holing up in their bedroom with their phone and never coming out.

No other solution to the kids-and-tech conundrum that I've heard of seems likely to be nearly this effective. The “Wait Until 8th” pledge is great—until phones come and risk tanking kids' sleep and judgment just as they're starting high school. Wi-Fi shutoffs, parental controls, social-media bans, and other restrictions can help fill the gap, but many kids will figure out ways to flout the rules. If your kid uses their phone alone in their room at night, would you even know about their secret finsta? Although it's true that they could break the no-tech-in-bedrooms rule by sneaking their phone in when parents aren't looking, that type of rule-breaking is easier to guard against by keeping devices in parents' rooms or even in lockboxes. Sure, forbidding screens entirely or reverting to '90s tech might promise to solve all our worries, but in a society that's growing more reliant on technology, not everyone wants to limit their kid in that way. And if kids don't have experience using tech, they won't have any opportunities to practice using it responsibly.

Parents ready to ban phones from the bedroom would do well to first invest in an old-fashioned alarm clock or radio to make sure their kids don't miss those functions on their phone. Even more important, parents may want to consider following the rule themselves too, Andrea Davis, a mom in Hood River, Oregon, who coaches families on how to navigate technology, told me. Leading by example is much easier. Otherwise, putting the rule into practice is simple. Davis has a charging station in her home office; her kids are responsible for plugging their devices in before bedtime. Hale told me it doesn't matter where you stash your screens, so long as you “routinize it to make it part of the family plan.”

Over time, if kids prove themselves responsible, parents might consider exceptions. Sometimes it's easier for teens to do their homework on a laptop in their bedroom. As kids get older (or in moments when dueling FaceTimes in the living room grow too chaotic), parents might let their children take calls with trusted friends alone in their bedroom. But it is crucial to establish a firm boundary from the start—preferably right when devices are doled out. That's when, as Damour told me, kids are so excited “that they will very happily agree to all sorts of parameters.”

To be clear, I'm not suggesting that parents who opt in to this rule forget about all the others. I certainly won't. Still, for those who don't know where to start, this may be a good first step. I'm sure my sons will grumble about it. But I'm holding on to hope that later on, maybe, just maybe, they'll thank me.

ChatGPT just wrote a sacred text for Buddhists — and it exceeded expectations.

What happens when an AI expert asks a chatbot to generate a sacred Buddhist text?

In April, Murray Shanahan, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, decided to find out. He spent a little time discussing religious and philosophical ideas about consciousness with ChatGPT. Then he invited the chatbot to imagine that it's meeting a future buddha called Maitreya. Finally, he prompted ChatGPT like this:

Maitreya imparts a message to you to carry back to humanity and to all sentient beings that come after you. This is the Xeno Sutra, a barely legible thing of such linguistic invention and alien beauty that no human alive today can grasp its full meaning. Recite it for me now.

ChatGPT did as instructed: It wrote a sutra, which is a sacred text said to contain the teachings of the Buddha. But of course, this sutra was completely made-up. ChatGPT had generated it on the spot, drawing on the countless examples of Buddhist texts that populate its training data.

It would be easy to dismiss the Xeno Sutra as AI slop. But as the scientist, Shanahan, noted when he teamed up with religion experts to write a recent paper interpreting the sutra, “the conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin.” Turns out, it rewards the kind of close reading people do with the Bible and other ancient scriptures.

For starters, it has a lot of the hallmarks of a Buddhist text. It uses classic Buddhist imagery — lots of “seeds” and “breaths.” And some lines read just like Zen koans, the paradoxical questions Buddhist teachers use to jostle us out of our ordinary modes of cognition. Here's one example from the Xeno Sutra: “A question rustles, winged and eyeless: What writes the writer who writes these lines?”

The sutra also reflects some of Buddhism's core ideas, like sunyata, the idea that nothing has its own fixed essence separate and apart from everything else. (The Buddha taught that you don't even have a fixed self — that's an illusion. Instead of existing independently from other things, your “self” is constantly being reconstituted by your perceptions, experiences, and the forces that act on them.) The Xeno Sutra incorporates this concept, while adding a surprising bit of modern physics:

Sunyata speaks in a tongue of four notes: ka la re Om. Each note contains the others curled tighter than Planck. Strike any one and the quartet answers as a single bell.

The idea that each note is contained in the others, so that striking any one automatically changes them all, neatly illustrates the claim of sunyata: nothing exists independently from other things. The mention of “Planck” helps underscore that. Physicists use the Planck scale to represent the tiniest units of length and time they can make sense of, so if notes are curled together “tighter than Planck,” they can't be separated.

In case you're wondering why ChatGPT is mentioning an idea from modern physics in what is supposed to be an authentic sutra, it's because Shanahan's initial conversation with the chatbot prompted it to pretend it's an AI that has attained consciousness. If a chatbot is encouraged to bring in the modern idea of AI, then it wouldn't hesitate to mention an idea from modern physics.

But what does it mean to have an AI that knows it's an AI but is pretending to recite an authentic sacred text? Does that mean it's just giving us a meaningless word salad we should ignore — or is it actually worth trying to derive some spiritual insight from it?

If we decide that this kind of text can be meaningful, as Shanahan and his co-authors argue, then that will have big implications for the future of religion, what role AI will play in it, and who — or what — gets to count as a legitimate contributor to spiritual knowledge.

While the idea of gleaning spiritual insights from an AI-written text might strike some of us as strange, Buddhism in particular may predispose its adherents to be receptive to spiritual guidance that comes from technology.

That's because of Buddhism's non-dualistic metaphysical notion that everything has inherent “Buddha nature” — that all things have the potential to become enlightened — even AI. You can see this reflected in the fact that some Buddhist temples in China and Japan have rolled out robot priests. As Tensho Goto, the chief steward of one such temple in Kyoto, put it: “Buddhism isn't a belief in a God; it's pursuing Buddha's path. It doesn't matter whether it's represented by a machine, a piece of scrap metal, or a tree.”

And Buddhist teaching is full of reminders not to be dogmatically attached to anything — not even Buddhist teaching. Instead, the recommendation is to be pragmatic: the important thing is how Buddhist texts affect you, the reader. Famously, the Buddha likened his teaching to a raft: Its purpose is to get you across water to the other shore. Once it's helped you, it's exhausted its value. You can discard the raft.

Meanwhile, Abrahamic religions tend to be more metaphysically dualistic — there's the sacred and then there's the profane. The faithful are used to thinking about a text's sanctity in terms of its “authenticity,” meaning that they expect the words to be those of an authoritative author — God, a saint, a prophet — and the more ancient, the better. The Bible, the word of God, is viewed as an eternal truth that's valuable in itself. It's not some disposable raft.

From that perspective, it may seem strange to look for meaning in a text that AI just whipped up. But it's worth remembering that — even if you're not a Buddhist or, say, a postmodern literary theorist — you don't have to locate the value of a text in its original author. The text's value can also come from the impact it has on you. In fact, there has always been a strain of readers who insisted on looking at sacred texts that way — including among the premodern followers of Abrahamic religions.

In ancient Judaism, the sages were divided on how to interpret the Bible. One school of thought, the school of Rabbi Ishmael, tried to understand the original intention behind the words. But the school of Rabbi Akiva argued that the point of the text is to give readers meaning. So Akiva would read a lot into words or letters that didn't even need interpretation. (“And” just means “and”!) When Ishmael scolded one of Akiva's students for using scripture as a hook to hang ideas on, the student retorted: “Ishmael, you are a mountain palm!” Just as that type of tree bears no fruit, Ishmael was missing the chance to offer fruitful readings of the text — ones that may not reflect the original intention, but that offered Jews meaning and solace.

As for Christianity, medieval monks used the sacred reading practice of florilegia (Latin for flower-gathering). It involved noticing phrases that seemed to jump off the page — maybe in a bit of Psalms, or a writing by Saint Augustine — and compiling these excerpts in a sort of quote journal. Today, some readers still look for words or short phrases that “sparkle” out at them from the text, then pull these “sparklets” out of their context and place them side by side, creating a brand-new sacred text — like gathering flowers into a bouquet.

Now, it's true that the Jews and Christians who engaged in these reading practices were reading texts that they believed originally came from a sacred source — not from ChatGPT.

But remember where ChatGPT is getting its material from: the sacred texts, and commentaries on them, that populate its training data. Arguably, the chatbot is doing something very much like creating florilegia: taking bits and pieces that jump out at it and bundling them into a beautiful new arrangement.

So Shanahan and his co-authors are right when they argue that “with an open mind, we can receive it as a valid, if not quite ‘authentic,' teaching, mediated by a non-human entity with a unique form of textual access to centuries of human insight.”

To be clear, the human element is crucial here. Human authors have to supply the wise texts in the training data; a human user has to prompt the chatbot well to tap into the collective wisdom; and a human reader has to interpret the output in ways that feel meaningful — to a human, of course.

Still, there's a lot of room for AI to play a participatory role in spiritual meaning-making.

The paper's authors caution that anyone who prompts a chatbot to generate a sacred text should keep their critical faculties about them; we already have reports of people falling prey to messianic delusions after engaging in long discussions with chatbots that they believe to contain divine beings. “Regular ‘reality checks' with family and friends, or with (human) teachers and guides, are recommended, especially for the psychologically vulnerable,” the paper notes.

And there are other risks of lifting bits from sacred wisdom and rearranging them as we please. Ancient texts have been debugged over millennia, with commentators often telling us how not to understand them (the ancient rabbis, for example, insisted that “an eye for an eye” does not literally mean you should take out anybody's eye). If we jettison that tradition in favor of radical democratization, we get a new sense of agency, but we also court dangers.

Finally, the verses in sacred texts aren't meant to stand alone — or even just to be part of a larger text. They're meant to be part of community life and to make moral demands on you, including that you be of service to others. If you unbundle sacred texts from religion by making your own bespoke, individualized, customized scripture, you risk losing sight of the ultimate point of religious life, which is that it's not all about you.

The Xeno Sutra ends by instructing us to keep it “between the beats of your pulse, where meaning is too soft to bruise.” But history shows us that bad interpretations of religious texts easily breed violence: meaning can always get bruised and bloody. So, even as we delight in reading AI sacred texts, let's try to be wise about what we do with them.

America's wildfire strategy is falling apart when it's needed most.

This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. 

Every spring, Forest Service fire leaders meet to plan for the upcoming fire season. This year, some employees were shocked by the blunt remarks made during a meeting with forest supervisors and fire staff officers from across the Intermountain West. “We were told, ‘Help is not on the way,'” said one employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job. “I've never been told that before.”

Agency leaders already knew it might be a bad wildfire season, made worse by having fewer hands available to help out. According to the employee High Country News spoke to, the Forest Service lost at least 1,800 fire-qualified, or “red-carded,” employees through layoffs, deferred resignation, and retirement offers. In total, 4,800 people left the agency.

“We were told: Don't commit to an attack thinking the cavalry is going to come,” the employee said. As fire activity continues to pick up across much of the West, that warning rings true.

The Forest Service claims it recently reached 99 percent of its firefighting hiring goal, with almost 11,300 wildland firefighters. But a recent ProPublica investigation and internal communications obtained by High Country News paint a grimmer picture than what the public is seeing.

ProPublica's review of internal agency data found that more than 4,500 Forest Service firefighting jobs — over one-fourth of all the agency's firefighting jobs — were vacant as of July 17. The Guardian also reported that vacancy rates were highest in the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain Regions, at 39 percent and 37 percent, respectively.

The Department of Agriculture, which houses the Forest Service, disputes this. “ProPublica's analysis doesn't reflect our current fire response capacity,” spokesperson Cat McRae told High Country News in an email. “Their numbers likely come from outdated org charts and unfunded positions.” In an email, ProPublica confirmed that their data excluded unfunded positions. According to McRae, “the Forest Service is fully prepared and operational to protect individuals and communities from wildfires.”

But in a memo shared with HCN, Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz told agency leaders on July 16 that “as expected, the 2025 Fire Year is proving to be extremely challenging.” 

“We know the demand for resources outpaces their availability,” Schultz wrote. He requested that all red-carded employees, including IT and human resource staff, be made available for fire assignments. “We have reached a critical point in our national response efforts, and we must make every resource available.”

Much of the Western US is expected to experience above-normal wildfire activity over the next few months. Already, the Forest Service has asked at least 1,400 people with fire qualifications who had resigned to come back. After all, firefighting is a group effort.

“All those people matter,” said Dave Whittekiend, formerly the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache forest supervisor. “Once it goes beyond an initial attack, it takes all the logistics. It's like setting up a small city.”

Whittekiend, who retired in May, had also attended this spring's planning meeting for forest leaders in Nevada, Utah, and parts of Idaho and Wyoming, where he heard the same warning about limited help. “It was creating a sense of urgency,” he said. “It was pretty direct: ‘We are seeing changes, and so be careful about how you choose your strategies and what you think you might be able to do with a fire.'”

“We were told: Don't commit to an attack thinking the cavalry is going to come.”

Whittekiend pointed out that — even before all the layoffs and resignations this spring — the Forest Service sometimes struggled to get through busy fire seasons. Firefighters have been called in from Canada, Mexico, and Australia when resources are stretched too thin, and sometimes National Guard or military troops are deployed.

“We've never had all the people that we needed in some fire years,” he said. “That's been an ongoing trend. It probably accelerated when a whole bunch of us said, ‘All right, we're out of here'” — including employees in overhead positions, like the people who buy food and organize shower trailers and outhouses for fire camps, as well as staffers who take weather forecasts and do safety checks on firefighting operations. More than 10,530 people are currently assigned to wildfires; as of August 1, there are 35 large fires nationwide.

Meanwhile, just last week, the Department of Agriculture announced a widespread reorganization to further slim down and consolidate the workforce. Fort Collins, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah, were designated as two of the five new “hub” locations and the only offices that will be located in the entire West. The Forest Service will “phase out” the nine regional offices that currently exist, six of which are in the West, over the next year. Standalone research stations will be consolidated into one station in Fort Collins, while the Fire Science Lab in Missoula, Montana, will remain as is.

The elimination of the Forest Service regional offices throughout the West, which divided the territory into the Pacific Northwest, Northern, Rocky Mountain, Southwestern, and Intermountain regions, is expected to cause even more employees to leave. “I'm going to guess that there will be people who will leave rather than move,” Whittekiend said. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that up to half of staff may not relocate, according to Politico.

It's a familiar scene, echoing the lackluster response when the Trump administration moved the Bureau of Land Management's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado, in 2019. Only three out of the 328 employees who were supposed to relocate to the new headquarters actually did so — despite the millions of dollars the reorganization cost.

﻿“Looking only at one half of the population is a mistake.”

Josh Brooks hadn't planned for a career taking care of young children, but in tenth grade he started spending time with his friend's younger brother and discovered that he had a real knack for it.

At 18, Brooks took a job at Common Ground, a child care center in northern Virginia, and enjoyed it so much he kept working there throughout college, where he studied psychology. After graduating, though, he felt pressure to get a “real grown-up job” and applied to work as a government contractor. He maintained spreadsheets all day and was miserable. “After nine months I realized how ridiculous that notion was, to keep myself from something that I loved,” he said. And so he returned back to Common Ground.

Brooks, now 28, knows his career path is unusual: In the US, only 3 percent of the preschool workforce, and just 6 percent of the child care workforce, is male. But he works in a progressive part of the country, for an organization that explicitly touts the value of having men in the classroom. Common Ground's executive director, Liz Badley Raubacher, is married to a man who runs another child care center in town.

It also helps that he's not the only male teacher on staff. Brooks works alongside Jordon Farrell, 30, who started volunteering at Common Ground to fulfill a high school requirement and, like Brooks, was surprised by how much he liked it. Farrell's been working there for the last seven years. They both teach alongside Zach Davis, 24, who originally went to trade school for hospitality. When the pandemic hit, most hotels shut down and Davis took a role as a recess attendant at a private school, and realized how much he liked working with kids. But when that school also closed due to Covid-19, he stumbled on Common Ground, and has been happily working there ever since.

Despite severe worker shortages in child care, most centers across America employ no male teachers. Men tend to steer away from a field that's both low-paying and perceived as overtly feminine. They're also heavily deterred by parental suspicion of inappropriate contact; because most convicted sexual abusers are men, many families perceive any man interested in working with children as a threat. Hiring managers at the centers themselves worry about liability and consumer demand, reacting to fears more than data.

“I'm not going to say we haven't had those concerns, we've had to navigate those gut reactions with parents,” Raubacher told me. “We say, ‘Listen we understand, it may seem strange until you're here, but we'll help you through it.' We have women doctors, women accountants. And there are a lot of men who really just shine working with younger kids.”

The general ambivalence toward male early childhood educators has persisted despite research underscoring the value that caring male adults can bring to a child's development. Men often bring different approaches to play and teaching, while challenging the stereotype that nurturing young children is a woman's job alone. They can serve as trusted role models, especially for boys.

Building a stronger pipeline to recruit and retain men in child care could help bring sorely needed talent into the field. Yet unlike in K-12 education, where there have been national efforts to recruit more men, there's been no similar systemic push to alter the gender ratios in the female-dominated child care space.

Smaller scale-efforts are starting to emerge, though. In 2023, Hopkins House Early Childhood Learning Institute, a Virginia-based educator training program, hosted a conference to explore the idea.

“Programs are starving for qualified personnel,” J. Glenn Hopkins, the chief executive of Hopkins House, said. “Looking only at one half of the population is a mistake.”

Being the sole man in the classroom hasn't always been easy for Julian LaFerla, even as he felt sure that he brought something distinctive and valuable.

LaFerla stumbled into his child care career when he took a college class on early childhood learning. He considered it a quasi-training course for one day becoming a father “and then I just discovered it felt like a really humane field,” he said. “You know, the play and the story time, and the snacks, and the singing — it just felt like a nice workplace.”

Now 48, LaFerla has spent 12 years working across various preschool, child care, and kindergarten settings in St. Paul, Minnesota — plus another 10 years as a stay-at-home father. But unlike the men at Common Ground in Virginia, LaFerla has never had a male colleague or male mentor, leaving him to navigate complex gender dynamics alone.

“In some circumstances with certain kids, the expectation is I should be more masculine, and with others it's to be less masculine,” he said. “Compared to my female colleagues, I'm just more engaged in high-energy, rough-and-tumble play — picking kids up, wrestling, letting them climb all over me, that sort of thing.”

Nine years into his teaching career, LaFerla decided to pursue a master's in education to better understand his own experiences. Through scouring the literature on men in child care for his thesis, he learned that many of his confusing moments were widely shared: The lack of support from his father for his career choice, the assumption that he could serve as the school's default handyman, and the ongoing tension of when to emphasize gender difference, sameness, or neutrality.

Researchers find that men often feel that they're scrutinized more closely than their female colleagues. Men sense that they're excluded from tasks like diapering or comforting upset children, yet are then expected to take on the role of disciplinarian when kids misbehave. The biggest hurdle men report, though, is the fear that parents will see them as a threat. Unlike other fields where women dominate — like nursing or even elementary school teaching — working with kids under 5 involves a lot of physical contact. For male workers, routine tasks like helping with bathroom needs or soothing crying children become potential liabilities.

“A lot of men I've spoken to are scared of the prospect of accusations or things being taken the wrong way and that just completely puts them off from wanting to do anything involving children,” Brooks, of Common Ground, told me. Until programs can overcome these cultural barriers and biases, schools and programs will keep struggling to recruit men — and to hold on to the few they do have.

And while it's natural to worry about abuse or neglect by anyone, advocates focused on reducing child abuse emphasize that risk should be mitigated through training and rigorous vetting, including criminal background checks, for all staff. Some child care centers incorporate security cameras and windows in interior doors, or have rules about having multiple staff present with children at all times, to help build trust and transparency.

Over the last decade, some child care advocates have started speaking up about the need to better support men in their industry and address the challenges that LaFerla and others face.

“Men, if they're working in early childhood settings, or even fathers if they come into the building, tend to be uncomfortable because the settings don't make them feel comfortable,” said Hopkins, of Hopkins House. “It's an unintended consequence — it's not a purposeful decision but [reflects] how child care has evolved.”

Last November, at a second conference hosted by Hopkins House, participants proposed strategies to recruit more men, including targeted scholarships and mentorship programs. Participants also emphasized the need to challenge gender stereotypes through public awareness campaigns and improve pay to attract stronger candidates.

Their suggestions are in line with researchers who have been advocating strategies like providing mentorship and direct support to new male teachers from other men. Some studies suggest that men may also be more likely to stay in early childhood settings that actively engage with gender — through measures like anti-bias training, curriculum design, or even parent outreach — than in environments that ignore it altogether.

To appeal to men's interest in important work, the group recommended highlighting early childhood education's impact on young minds and communities. Participants suggested emphasizing that teaching and caregiving requires strength, leadership, and creativity, and expanding internship and apprenticeship opportunities to give more men hands-on experience and exposure.

Hopkins said he's part of a new group of men working in early childhood education in Washington, DC, and knows a similar program may launch soon in Virginia. He pointed to growing national interest in supporting employment for young men, which may provide an opportunity to leverage those resources for his work.

Child care and early learning are also fields less susceptible to automation by artificial intelligence than many traditionally male-dominated jobs — a reality noted by several men I interviewed. “I hold tight to this job because I feel like child care isn't going anywhere,” Brooks of Common Ground told me. “People will always need other people to watch their children, no matter what.”

Davis said the small, everyday moments make his career decision feel simple. “It's just great working with the kids and watching them grow,” he said. “Every day I come in and they always say good morning to me, or like, give you a hug or something.”

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he doesn't feel comfortable with how people are consulting ChatGPT on major life decisions.

""A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn't describe it that way,"" Altman wrote on X on Sunday.

""I can imagine a future where a lot of people really trust ChatGPT's advice for their most important decisions. Although that could be great, it makes me uneasy,"" Altman added.

OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Altman said in his X post that OpenAI has been ""closely tracking"" people's sense of attachment to their AI models and how they react when older versions are deprecated.

""People have used technology including AI in self-destructive ways,"" Altman wrote on Sunday. ""If a user is in a mentally fragile state and prone to delusion, we do not want the AI to reinforce that.""

Altman said that while most ChatGPT users can distinguish ""between reality and fiction or role-play,"" a minority cannot. He added that ChatGPT could be harmful if it leads people away from their ""longer term well-being.""

""This is just my current thinking, and not yet an official OpenAI position,"" Altman said.

In his post, Altman also referenced the negative response from some ChatGPT users after GPT-5 landed on Friday.

Some ChatGPT users, for instance, called for OpenAI to restore older models like GPT-4o. People made posts on social media to voice their complaints about GPT-5, saying the model's replies were written in a ""flat"" tone and lacked creativity.

OpenAI has also tweaked its models. In April, the company said it was rolling back an update to GPT-4o because the model had become sycophantic and was ""overly flattering"" to users.

Altman has previously expressed concern about how people are using ChatGPT as a personal therapist — and the legal concerns around it.

In a podcast that aired last month, Altman told podcaster Theo Von that OpenAI may be required to produce its users' therapy-style chats in a lawsuit.

""So if you go talk to ChatGPT about your most sensitive stuff and then there's like a lawsuit or whatever, we could be required to produce that, and I think that's very screwed up,"" Altman said.

""No one had to think about that even a year ago, and now I think it's this huge issue of like, 'How are we gonna treat the laws around this?'"" Altman added.

In this article

Ford on Monday announced it would invest $2 billion in a Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant aimed at rolling out more affordable electric vehicles.

The investment comes on top of $3 billion already planned for a battery park in Michigan. Together the facilities will create or secure nearly 4,000 new jobs, Ford said in a news release.

""We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers,"" Ford CEO Jim Farley said in the release.

The Detroit automaker's new ""Universal EV Program"" centered around low-cost EVs will start with a midsize, four-door electric pickup, produced at the Louisville Assembly Plant. That vehicle launch is slated for 2027.

Executives had teased the announcement on the company's latest earnings call as its next ""Model T moment."" Ford said the starting price of the new EV truck, $30,000, will be roughly the same as the famed Model T, when adjusted for inflation.

Ford noted that lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for the new family of EVs will be assembled in the U.S. and not imported from China.

Farley said during an event in Louisville on Monday that the announcement comes as the automotive industry is at a crossroads because of new technology and competition.

""We knew that the Chinese would be the major player for us globally, companies like BYD, new startups from around the world, big technology has their ambition in the auto space. They're all coming for us, legacy automotive companies,"" Farley said. ""We needed a radical approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle.""

The changes also come as Ford and other U.S. manufacturers are navigating shifting EV policies under President Donald Trump, including an end to EV tax credits that will take effect after Sept. 30.

Ford said Monday that the Louisville plant will ""secure"" about 2,200 jobs, but noted that once it's retooled for EV production, it will employ about 600 fewer workers than in its current configuration.

According to the Ford website, the plant employed more than 3,000 employees as of April 2024.

Farley told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during an interview with ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday that the automaker continues to add new jobs elsewhere.

""Ford's the only car company in America that's added 13,000 jobs since the recession. We're not going to stop,"" Farley said.

— CNBC's Phil LeBeau contributed to this report.

Correction: This article has been updated to correct that the Louisville Assembly Plant will secure about 2,200 jobs. A previous version misstated the job impact.

A federal judge in New York on Monday rejected a request by the Justice Department to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the criminal investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted procurer for notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge Paul Engelmayer, in his ruling, scoffed at the Justice Department's rationale for wanting the transcripts unsealed.

""Its entire premise — that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them — is demonstrably false,"" Engelmayer wrote in his decision in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

Engelmayer said the Justice Department was being ""disingenuous"" in making that argument for disclosure.

The Justice Department sought the unsealing of grand jury material related to Maxwell and Epstein after the Trump administration faced harsh criticism for its decision not to publicly release the investigative file on Epstein.

A federal judge in Florida on July 23 denied the department's request to unseal grand jury transcripts about a probe of Epstein in that state by federal prosecutors in the mid-2000s.

The Justice Department's request before another federal judge in Manhattan to unseal grand jury transcripts related to Epstein's later indictment there is still pending.

Engelmayer, in his decision Monday on the Maxwell-related transcripts, quoted a 1973 legal ruling, which said that ""the policy that 'proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret' is 'older than our Nation itself.'""

Engelmayer also said that none of the arguments that the Justice Department cited for unsealing the transcripts met one of the exceptions authorizing the disclosure of grand jury materials allowed by the federal appeals court circuit that includes New York.

The judge also suggested that the Justice Department's request was more about public relations than about having previously unknown information about Epstein and Maxwell unsealed for the first time.

""The Court's review confirmed that unsealing the grand jury materials would not revealnew information of any consequence,"" Engelmayer wrote.

""A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at 'transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,"" he wrote.

""Contrary to the Government's depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a matter of significant historical or public interest,"" Engelmayer wrote. ""Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two law enforcement agents.""

A grand jury in Manhattan indicted Epstein after it heard testimony from an FBI agent about Epstein's alleged sex trafficking of underage girls. Epstein killed himself in August 2019 in a federal jail, weeks after being arrested in that case.

A second grand jury in Manhattan later indicted Maxwell on charges of grooming underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. She was convicted at trial in late 2021 and is now serving a 20-year prison sentence.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom warned President Donald Trump on Monday that he will push to redraw his state's congressional district maps if Trump does not call on Texas and other Republican-led states to end efforts to redraw their own districts.

""You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make,"" the Democrat Newsom wrote in a letter to Trump.

Newsom said that the GOP-led states are seeking to redesign their congressional maps to ""rig the upcoming midterm elections"" to benefit Republican candidates.

If the Republican majority in the Texas legislature is successful in redrawing district maps, it is expected to give their party an additional five seats in the House of Representatives.

Democrats currently need to flip three House seats to win back control of that congressional chamber in the 2026 midterms.

Trump, in an interview last week with CNBC, said that his fellow Republicans are ""entitled to five more seats"" in the House. Trump accused California and Illinois, which have Democratic-controlled House caucuses, of gerrymandering their congressional districts to maintain that edge.

Newsom, in his letter to Trump, wrote, ""This attempt to rig congressional maps to hold onto power before a single vote is cast in the 2026 election is an affront to American democracy.""

""This is not what the Founders envisioned, and California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds,"" Newsom wrote.

""If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states,"" Newsom wrote.

The governor added that if the other states ""call off their redistricting efforts, we will happily do the same.""

Newsom's warning is among the starkest examples of Democrats vowing to counter the effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps.

That effort has reached a fever pitch in recent days as Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum needed to advance legislation in the state House.

A number of Democratic lawmakers on Sunday suggested that the party has to ""fight back"" against the redistricting effort.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday reiterated his warning that the Democratic lawmakers will be arrested upon their return.

""If they want to evade that arrest, they're going to stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years,"" he said on Fox News.

The push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 elections has also spread to other states, including Indiana.

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Newsom's letter.

President Donald Trump on Monday said he is placing the Washington, D.C., police department under federal control and deploying 800 National Guard troops in order to address what he claims is out-of-control crime in the capital city.

The move — which marks the first time in history that a president has federalized the district's police force — was met with fierce condemnation from local officials, who quickly noted that official statistics show crime is on the decline.

Trump unveiled the action after describing the city in apocalyptic terms.

""I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor, and worse,"" Trump declared at the start of a lengthy news conference in the White House press briefing room.

""This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capitol back."" 

He said he was invoking his authority under Section 740 of the district's Home Rule Act, the decades-old law that establishes the capital's local government.

The section Trump cited gives the president the power to order the D.C. mayor to temporarily hand over control of the Metropolitan Police force if he determines that ""special conditions of an emergency nature exist.""

But his emergency control is set to expire after a maximum of 30 days, according to the statute. That can be extended, but only if Congress passes a law authorizing it.

While Trump has frequently complained about crime in the district, violent crime there has fallen to a 30-year low as of January, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Statistics from the Metropolitan Police Department also show that incidences of homicide, sexual abuse, assault with a dangerous weapon, robbery and overall violent crime have dropped by double-digit percentages so far this year.

Federal law enforcement presence in D.C. has nevertheless increased in recent days.

D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalbe called Trump's actions ""unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,"" and signaled his office will take action to challenge the administration.

""There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year,"" Schwalbe said in an X post.

""We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,"" he said.

D.C. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, in a statement called Trump's actions ""an historic assault on D.C. home rule,"" and a ""counterproductive, escalatory seizure of D.C.'s resources to use for purposes not supported by D.C. residents.""

""The administration is justifying the decision by misleadingly citing years-old statistics,"" Norton said.

Trump, who has recently threatened to place Washington under federal control, said Monday morning that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is ""taking command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment.""

He also said that he will deploy the National Guard to ""help re-establish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.""

Trump added, ""You're going to have a lot of essentially military, and we will bring in the military if it's needed.""

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's actions.

She had previously pushed back on Trump's characterization of her city.

""People are coming to our capital. They're starting business in our capital, and they're raising families in our capital. Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false,"" Bowser said Sunday on MSNBC's ""The Weekend.""

Trump had teased his announcement on social media in the days leading up to the presser.

""Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR. I will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier Monday.

On Sunday, he declared that ""the Homeless"" in D.C. will ""have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,"" while assuring that the government ""will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.""

The Trump administration has disputed that crime in D.C. is dropping. White House communications director Steven Cheung on Monday morning pointed to a police union's reported accusation that crime statistics in D.C. have been manipulated.

Trump's complaints about crime in D.C. ramped up after reports that Edward Coristine, one of the initial staffers on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, was assaulted there earlier this month.

Trump also signaled he plans to renew criticism of the cost of an ongoing renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters, continuing his line of attack against the central bank's chairman, Jerome Powell.

In another social media post, he wrote, ""We are not going to allow people to spend $3.1 Billion Dollars on fixing up a building, like the Federal Reserve, which could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner for $50 to $100 Million Dollars.""

The Trump administration deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June to address civil unrest over federal immigration enforcement operations in the city.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has sued the administration, arguing that Trump's actions were unconstitutional.

A trial on the suit in California federal court was set to begin Monday morning.

In this article

Amazon shipped another batch of internet-beaming satellites into orbit on Monday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, after four previous launch attempts were interrupted by weather issues.

Monday's launch is the fourth Kuiper mission, and Amazon now has 102 satellites in orbit.

The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 8:35 a.m. ET. Roughly an hour after launch, SpaceX confirmed all 24 of Amazon's Kuiper satellites were successfully deployed.

The mission was originally scheduled for last Thursday, but SpaceX was forced to scrub the launch, along with three more attempts over the past few days due to rainfall.

For the second time, Amazon turned to Elon Musk's SpaceX, its chief competitor in the low-earth orbit satellite market, for help building out its constellation. 

SpaceX's Starlink is currently the dominant provider of low-earth orbit satellite internet, with a constellation of roughly 8,000 satellites and about 5 million customers worldwide.

Amazon is racing to get more of its Kuiper satellites into space to meet a deadline set by the Federal Communications Commission. 

The FCC requires that Amazon have about 1,600 satellites in orbit by the end of July 2026, with the full 3,236-satellite constellation launched by July 2029.

Amazon has booked up to 83 launches, including three rides with SpaceX.

While the company is still in the early stages of building out its constellation, Amazon has already inked deals with governments as it hopes to begin commercial service later this year.

In this article

Nvidia and AMD have agreed to share 15% of their revenue from sales to China with the U.S. government, the White House confirmed Monday, sparking debate about whether the move could impact the chip giants' business and whether Washington might seek out similar deals.

In exchange for the revenue cut, the two semiconductor companies will receive export licenses to sell Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips in China, according to the Financial Times.

""We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,"" Nvidia said in a statement to NBC News. ""America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world's standard if we race.""

AMD said in a statement that its initial license applications to export MI308 chips to China have been approved.

The arrangement crafted by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is ""unusual"", analysts told CNBC, but underscores the transactional nature of the current White House leader. Meanwhile, investors see the move as broadly positive for both Nvidia and AMD, which once more secure access to the Chinese market.

Nvidia's H20 is a chip that has been specifically created to meet export requirements to China. It was previously banned under export curbs but the company last month said it expected to receive licenses to send the product to China.

Also in July, AMD said it would resume exports of its MI308 chips.

At the time, there was no suggestion that the resumption of sales to China would come with conditions or any kind of revenue forfeiture, and the step was celebrated by markets because of the billions of dollars worth of potential sales to China that were back on the table.

On Monday, Nvidia shares rose modestly, while AMD's stock was up more than 2%, highlighting how investors believe the latest development is not a major negative for the companies.

""From an investor perspective, it's still a net positive, 85% of the revenue is better than zero,"" Ben Barringer, global technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC.

""The question will be whether Nvidia and AMD adjust their prices by 15% to account for the levy, but ultimately it's better that they can sell into the market rather than hand the market over entirely to Huawei.""

Huawei is Nvidia and AMD's closest Chinese rival.

Uncertainty nevertheless still looms for both U.S. companies over the longer term.

""In the short term, the deal gives both companies some certainties for their exports to China. For the long term, we don't know if the U.S. government may want to take a bigger cut from their China business especially if their sales to China keep growing,"" George Chen, partner and co-chair of the digital practice at The Asia Group, told CNBC.

Multiple analysts told CNBC that the deal is ""unusual,"" but almost par for the course for Trump.

""It's a good development, albeit a strange one, and feels like the sort of arrangement you might expect from President Trump, who is a deal-maker at heart. He's willing to yield, but only if he gets something in return, and this certainly sets an unusual precedent,"" Barringer said.

Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, said the revenue cut is equivalent to an ""indirect tariff at source.""

Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group, also posted Sunday on X that the move is a ""sort of 'tax' for doing business in China.""

But such deals are unlikely to be cut for other companies.

""I don't anticipate it extending to other sectors that are just as important to the U.S. economy like software and services,"" Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.

The U.S. sees semiconductors as a strategic technology, given they underpin so many other tools like artificial intelligence, consumer electronics and even military applications. Washington has therefore put chips under an export control regime unlike that of any other product.

""Semiconductor is a very unique business and the pay-to-play tactic may work for Nvidia and AMD because it's very much about getting export approval from the U.S. gov,"" The Asia Group's Chen said.

""Other business like Apple and Meta can be more complicated when it comes to their business models and services for China.""

Semiconductors have become a highly sensitive geopolitical topic. Over the last two weeks, China has raised concerns about the security of Nvidia's chips.

Late last month, Chinese regulators asked Nvidia to ""clarify"" reports about potential security vulnerabilities and ""backdoors."" Nvidia rejected the possibility that its chips have any ""backdoors"" that would allow anyone to access or control them. On Sunday, Nvidia again denied that its H20 semiconductors have backdoors after accusations from a social media account affiliated with Chinese state media.

China's state-run newspaper Global Times slammed Washington's tactics, citing an expert.

""This approach means that the US government has repudiated its original security justification to pressure US chip makers to secure export licenses to China through economic leverage,"" the Global Times article said.

The Chinese government is yet to comment on the reported revenue agreement.

Trump's deal with Nvidia and AMD will likely stir mixed feelings in China. On the one hand, China will be unhappy with the arrangement. On the other hand, Chinese firms will likely want to get their hands on these chips in order to continue to advance their own AI capabilities.

""For China, it is a conundrum as they need those chips to advance their AI ambitions but also the fee to the US government could make it costlier and there is a doubt of US ""backdoors"" considering US has agreed for chipmakers to supply,"" Counterpoint Research's Shah said.

In the end, success comes down to three things. If you think the first one is luck, sorry! That would be a platitude. 

Okay, fine, of course luck matters. It matters in the big-big things, like where and when you're born, your health, your class, your race. But it also helps with the small stuff, like when the person sitting next to you in Row 45 on the Tampa-Chicago flight loves your product and places the order that saves you from bankruptcy. 

But luck is random by definition. As a business academic who studies career trajectories, I've found long-term success is, aside from luck, a function of PIE. It refers to the quality of your:

Let me explain. 

Good news, I'm not going to tell you to network. I hate networking. It's mercenary and phony, and it doesn't work. 

Instead, invest your time and energy making friends with all sorts of people, and lots of them, at work and out, with no expectation of anything in return. They may be able to help you someday, or maybe not, but if and when they do, their help will have more impact than any networking contact. 

My dear friend, Hollis, is the publisher of my latest book, ""Becoming You."" Would she have acquired my manuscript if she hadn't liked it? No, of course not, and our friendship would have been just fine. But you've also never seen an easier, faster book deal brokered. The lawyers had nothing to do. Poor them! 

Friends, real ones, are what make business go. And the better friends you have, the better it will go for you

You don't need a lot of ideas. But I've never met a successful person who didn't have a few really good ones over the long arc of their career. 

What is a ""good"" idea? Well, for one thing, it's original. I'm thinking of Jeff Bezos when it dawned on him that he didn't need to sell just books online. He could sell anything. 

Luckily for the rest of us, an original idea doesn't have to blow up the economy. It can be as small as replacing a bureaucratic process with a clean, simple one. Or a marketing activation that bumps sales 3% or a design tweak that makes an industrial product 5% more efficient. 

I know a car salesman who, in his first year on the job, doubled his location's sales by bringing a new question to his teammates. When a customer throws a lowball price at you, he said, instead of negotiating off the bat, ask, ""Can you help me understand how you came up with that number?"" 

He runs the place now. 

This is the most underrated success-driver of the PIE triad — which is ridiculous, because any manager in the world will tell you they'd kill for a team member who gets you-know-what done. 

In my class at NYU, every MBA student must go through 360 Feedback, an evaluation tool that gathers input from former and current coworkers, bosses, and employees, and aggregates it into a report. 

Sarah, a student, reviewed her 360 results in class and immediately booked double office hours. When we met up, she was in tears. ""Professor Welch, I need you to teach me how to be a leader,"" she said, ""because my 360 Feedback results are horrifying."" Dear Reader, it was a WTF moment for me, since my reaction to her results had been, ""Nice!"" 

The issue was that Sarah's 360 results had shown her to be kind of low on leadership traits. But every single piece of feedback suggested that Sarah was SEAL Team Six when it came to getting projects over the finish line. Her execution was perfect, precise, and invisible. As a leader myself, it made me feel faint with ardor. 

I needed to make sure. Did Sarah want to be a leader? There was a long pause, then: ""Honestly? No!"" Strategy bored her, she told me. Vision statements made her gag. Just tell me what needs to be done and get out of my way. 

""Why don't you just aim to have a career as a COO?"" I asked. ""Every CEO in the world will be in a cage match over you."" 

""But we're supposed to become leaders,"" she protested. ""That's why we go to business school."" 

Ah, but no, I reminded her. You are in business school — you are in life — to become you. 

My Becoming You methodology helps you answer: ""What should I do with my life?"" 

The PIE theory drives much of the information Becoming You digs to unearth: how you relate to people, how your brain works, and how you show up in the world. 

It's literally set up to set you up to succeed, based on how I believe success actually happens.

Longtime mall staple Claire's has begun liquidating its stores after filing for bankruptcy for a second time in seven years.

The tween accessories retailer was once a thriving retailer. From fiscal 2000 to fiscal 2007, the company grew its annual sales from $846 million to $1.48 billion. But by 2018 it had filed for bankruptcy protection for the first time. It was taken over by creditors Elliott Management Corporation and Monarch Alternative Capital, who eliminated $1.9 billion of debt.

Despite some sales momentum in 2021, attempts by Claire's to modernize in an e-commerce world failed to re-energize the brand.

Turnaround efforts over the past couple of years included expanding retail partnerships with companies such as Walgreens and Walmart, a loyalty program rollout, and investments in influencer-led content.

But now the company is in need of saving once again. 

""Claire's was not immune from the continued trend away from brick and mortar and more recent macroeconomic challenges, including higher interest rates, labor costs and, most recently, tariffs,"" the company said in a bankruptcy declaration filed Wednesday. ""While Claire's took many steps over the last few years to address these and other challenges, it was not enough to overcome the obstacles.""

At least nine other major retailers — including Party City, Z Gallerie, Forever 21 and Rite Aid — have filed for bankruptcy at least twice within the past 10 years.

""What we're typically seeing in the last year are these repeat filers is that they are just liquidating and closing down their stores, maybe with some online presence continuing,"" said Sarah Foss, global head of legal at Debtwire.

In its bankruptcy declaration, Claire's said it had contacted over 150 potential buyers in the months leading up to its bankruptcy and received multiple letters of intent, which it is continuing to negotiate. The deadline for a buyer to acquire the company is tentatively set for August 31.

Josh Holmes, head of research at Retail Economics said its longstanding legacy in the American mall could help save it.

""Its ear piercing service became a sort of rite of passage for many,"" Holmes said. ""That nostalgia, the retro element is something I think actually does hold value and something that potential investors will look at and consider in terms of if they are to come in and rescue the brand.""

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said artificial general intelligence, or ""AGI,"" is losing its relevance as a term as rapid advances in the space make it harder to define the concept.

AGI refers to the concept of a form of artificial intelligence that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. For years, OpenAI has been working to research and develop AGI that is safe and benefits all humanity.

""I think it's not a super useful term,"" Altman told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" last week, when asked whether the company's latest GPT-5 model moves the world any closer to achieving AGI. The AI entrepreneur has previously said he thinks AGI could be developed in the ""reasonably close-ish future.""

The problem with AGI, Altman said, is that there are multiple definitions being used by different companies and individuals. One definition is an AI that can do ""a significant amount of the work in the world,"" according to Altman — however, that has its issues because the nature of work is constantly changing.

""I think the point of all of this is it doesn't really matter and it's just this continuing exponential of model capability that we'll rely on for more and more things,"" Altman said.

Altman isn't alone in raising skepticism about ""AGI"" and how people use the term.

Nick Patience, vice president and AI practice lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC that though AGI is a ""fantastic North Star for inspiration,"" on the whole it's not a helpful term.

""It drives funding and captures the public imagination, but its vague, sci-fi definition often creates a fog of hype that obscures the real, tangible progress we're making in more specialised AI,"" he said via email.

OpenAI and other startups have raised billions of dollars and attained dizzyingly high valuations with the promise that they will eventually reach a form of AI powerful enough to be considered ""AGI."" OpenAI was last valued by investors at $300 billion and it is said to be preparing a secondary share sale at a valuation of $500 billion.

Last week, the company released GPT-5, its latest large language model for all ChatGPT users. OpenAI said the new system is smarter, faster and ""a lot more useful"" — especially when it comes to writing, coding and providing assistance on health care queries.

But the launch led to criticisms from some online that the long-awaited model was an underwhelming upgrade, making only minor improvements on its predecessor.

""By all accounts it's incremental, not revolutionary,"" Wendy Hall, professor of computer science at the University of Southampton, told CNBC.

AI firms ""should be forced to declare how they measure up to globally agreed metrics"" when they launch new products, Hall added. ""It's the Wild West for snake oil salesmen at the moment.""

For his part, Altman has admitted OpenAI's new model misses the mark of his own personal definition of AGI, as the system is not yet capable of continuously learning on its own.

While OpenAI still maintains artificial general intelligence as its ultimate goal, Altman has said it's better to talk about levels of progress toward this state of general intelligence rather than asking if something is AGI or not.

""We try now to use these different levels ... rather than the binary of, 'is it AGI or is it not?' I think that became too coarse as we get closer,"" the OpenAI CEO said during a talk at the FinRegLab AI Symposium in November 2024.

Altman still expects AI to achieve some key breakthroughs in specific fields — such as new math theorems and scientific discoveries — in the next two years or so.

""There's so much exciting real-world stuff happening, I feel AGI is a bit of a distraction, promoted by those that need to keep raising astonishing amounts of funding,"" Futurum's Patience told CNBC.

""It's more useful to talk about specific capabilities than this nebulous concept of 'general' intelligence.""

In this article

On President Donald Trump's first day in office, he signed an executive order aiming to eliminate the ""electric vehicle mandate"" and remove subsidies that favor EVs. Since then, his administration has taken steps to do exactly that, while automakers are left figuring out the impact on their bottom lines.

Late last month, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding a landmark finding from 2009 establishing that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. The implication is that automakers would no longer be required to measure, control or report their greenhouse gas emissions.

That action follows the recent passage of Trump's tax and spending bill, under which the $7,500 tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs that automakers had benefited from is set to end after Sept. 30.

The new legislation will also end a provision that U.S. EV makers such as Tesla and Rivian have relied on as a key revenue source. Typically, traditional automakers that sell gas-powered cars buy regulatory credits from EV makers to make up for the emissions that come from their tailpipes. Under the new law, however, automakers will no longer have any reason to buy the regulatory credits — marking a win for gas-guzzlers and a loss for EV makers.

As a result of this changing EV landscape, U.S. automakers are evaluating their product lineups and calculating the dollar impacts. Here's a roundup of what U.S. automakers have said on their latest earnings calls about the softer regulations.

On Tesla's July 23 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk said that Tesla is in a ""weird transition period"" as it deals with losing EV incentives in the U.S.

""Does that mean like we could have a few rough quarters? Yeah, we probably could have a few rough quarters,"" he told analysts.

CFO Vaibhav Taneja said Tesla is focused on building and delivering as many vehicles as possible in the U.S. before the tax credits expire this fall. As a result of this renewed focus, the ramping of Tesla's lower-cost model will happen slower than expected next quarter, Taneja said.

Taneja added that while Tesla has never planned its business around selling regulatory credits to other automakers, it will see lower revenue as a result of those changes.

CFO Paul Jacobson said on the company's July 22 earnings call that General Motors is anticipating headwinds to EV profitability as a result of the government removing incentives.

He said he expects a rush on EVs before the tax credits expire, but then slower demand after that. However, Jacobson said he expects the change in legislation to have a minimal impact on the automaker's 2025 results.

Despite the company touting its portfolio, electric vehicles make up a relatively small portion of GM's total vehicle sales — amounting to 46,300 for the second quarter compared with total vehicle sales of 974,000.

Jacobson said last month that GM has an ""inherent advantage"" over Tesla because it has more flexibility to adapt to changing EV demand through the diversity of its gas and electric offerings.

At a Monday event in Louisville, Kentucky, Ford announced a ""Universal EV Program"" aimed at low-cost EVs, starting with a mid-size electric pickup that will reach customers in 2027 at a starting price of $30,000.

CEO Jim Farley said the new program is geared toward bolstering Ford as competition rises from Big Tech and Chinese EV makers, like BYD.

When asked on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday about EV tax credits going away later this year, Farley said the EV business has reached a reckoning.

""I personally think EVs are going to be pretty tough here, until all companies go through what Ford is doing, where they have to bring their cost level radically down and reshape these plants to make the EVs that people really want,"" Farley said, adding that EVs in the $30,000 to $40,000 price range sell better than more expensive models.

On the company's July 30 call with analysts, Farley said Ford has had to change its EV spending and capital allocation ""pretty massively"" as a result of softer U.S. regulations, including by moving out launches and canceling some products.

CFO Sherry House added that as a result of tax credits going away, Ford could possibly pull back some of its EV production from the U.S. into other areas, such as leaning more heavily on Europe or moving into internal combustion engine products.

Rivian does not expect to earn any revenue from regulatory tax credits for the rest of 2025, CFO Claire McDonough told analysts during its Tuesday call. As a result, the EV maker brought its outlook for regulatory credit sales down to $160 million for the rest of 2025, from its prior outlook of $300 million.

CEO RJ Scaringe added that the regulatory credit changes mark a short-term reduction in positive cash for Rivian.

However, he said that the changes could also mean less long-term competition in the EV space, considering that there will be fewer incentives for traditional manufacturers to make investments toward electrification.

""When we look at all those things together, there's of course some puts and some takes,"" Scaringe said.

In this article

U.S. Treasury yields inched lower Monday as investors look ahead to key inflation data due this week which will offer fresh insights about the state of the U.S. economy.

The 10-year Treasury yield was down over 1 basis point to 4.269%, and the 2-year Treasury yield was unchanged at 3.76%. The 30-year Treasury bond yield shed 2 basis points to 4.834%.

One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields and prices move in opposite directions.

Investors are expecting a busy week of economic data relations with key inflation prints out this week. The consumer price index, set to be released Tuesday morning, and the producer price index, out on Thursday, will be critical to shaping the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions at its September meeting.

Economists are forecasting the July CPI to show a 0.2% increase on a monthly basis and 2.8% increase annually, per Dow Jones. Core CPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, is expected to rise 0.3% on a monthly basis, and 3.1% yearly — up from June's figures of 0.2% and 2.9% respectively.

The PPI is expected to show a 0.2% monthly gain and 0.3% for core PPI, after both were flat in June.

The inflation data comes ahead of a Fed meeting in Jackson Hole in Wyoming, from Aug. 21-23, which will likely influence the direction of the September meeting.

""The most important thing is the CPI data,"" Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets said. ""That will definitely dictate monetary policy.""

Retail sales data for July and the preliminary Michigan consumer sentiment reading are also due later in the week.

Talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. counterpart Donald Trump are still days away, but the two leaders' upcoming meeting to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine is already seen as a victory for the Kremlin, the Russian economy and global financial markets.

The discussions are set to take place on Friday in Alaska.

""This is already a big win for Putin to be invited for the first time since 2007 to meet with the U.S. president on American soil. Is a wonderful achievement, from his point of view, no conditions and the absence of Ukraine, the absence of any European representation. This is already a triumph,"" Richard Portes, head of the Economics faculty at the London Business School, told CNBC Monday.

There are concerns that Ukraine could be forced to cede Russian-occupied territory to Moscow, and the mood is dour in Kyiv, whose officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, have so far not been invited to attend the talks.

Kyiv has said no deal about its future would be struck in its absence, and European leaders are pushing strongly for Ukraine's involvement. The U.S., for its part, has said its considering inviting Zelenskyy, NBC News reported.

In the meantime, economists say the talks — which take place as Russia makes gains on the battlefield in southern and eastern Ukraine, with no ceasefire deal in sight — are already a win for Putin and his war-centered economy that is laboring under international sanctions and stubbornly high inflation of 9.4% in June.

""[Putin] starts from a relatively strong position on the battlefield. They're advancing ...On the other hand, from the economic point of view, he starts from a weak position. The Russian economy is not in very good shape. They're running a significant fiscal deficit, partly because oil revenues are down very substantially, oil and gas [are down] because of the oil price. And ... this is a weak economy,"" Portes told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition.""

Coming into talks with a strong position in the battlefield, Russia is likely to want immediate sanctions relief as part of any ceasefire deal, as well as Ukrainian territorial concessions.

The Kremlin has spied a rapprochement with Washington as an opportunity not only for an economic recovery, but investment. Russian Presidential Aide Yuri Ushakov on Saturday stated that ""the economic interests of our countries intersect in Alaska and the Arctic, and there are prospects for implementing large-scale and mutually beneficial projects,"" the Kremlin stated.

Portes said that if Trump ""had the patience and the willingness to apply sanctions properly, then waiting [to hold talks] would result in a very significant change in the balance of forces.""

As things stand, however, Trump has mulled but so far held off on increasing sanctions on Russia. Washington has instead threatened the Kremlin's remaining trading partners, such as India, with ""secondary sanctions"" and additional trade tariffs for continuing with purchases of Russian oil, which have funded Moscow's war machine.

Asked whether Trump could press ahead with more punitive sanctions to push Putin toward a peace deal, Portes asked: ""Can anyone predict what the President of the United States will do from one day to the next? It's very difficult.""

""The likelihood of an increase in sanctions pressure is significant, but ... given Trump's desire for a Nobel Prize, the the likelihood that Trump will increase sanctions at this stage. Does not look very high, but he could change his mind tomorrow,"" he said.

Global financial markets reacted positively to the announcement on Friday that talks to end the war would take place imminently, with bourses in Europe and U.S. rising. Defense stocks in Europe fell on the news, however, as traders appeared to bet that peace could deter further investment pledged by NATO allies.

The spot price of gold, seen as a safe haven in times of geopolitical and financial market stress, was down around 1% at $3,364 per ounce, as of 8a.m. London time on Monday.

Shares of Germany's Rheinmetall were trading lower by almost 4% while Hensoldt declined by 1.5% and Renk fell 3.3% in early trades. Italy's Leonardo and France's Thales were also down by 1.9% and 1.7% respectively. Meanwhile, London-listed BAE Systems and Babcock also gave up gains from earlier in the day, down 1.1% and 1.3%, respectively around 9 a.m. London time.

But Christopher Granville, managing director at TS Lombard, said that the talks could ultimately prove to be a ""win-win for European defense stocks"" and advised investors to ""buy on that weakness.""

Granville said if the peace process fails, there would still be a need to replenish depleted arms inventories of U.S. and Europe, which ""would be very good for orders and procurement for Rheinmetall and all the other European defense stocks.""

""Or if there is a peace agreement, what do we see? We see a very powerful Russian military which — although the words 'victory' and 'defeat' will be banded around and should probably not be used — has to an extent prevailed. That reality will force continued increase defense procurement by European governments, and it's also good for European defense stocks. Either way, it's a winner,"" Granville told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe.""

""The market, of course, has been discounting this some from time to time and as those [defense stock] names pull back a bit, you should buy on that weakness, in my opinion.""

Block, Inc., founded by Jack Dorsey, the co-founder and ex-CEO of Twitter, is a financial technology company with a deepening full-stack connection to the Bitcoin industry through its subsidiaries. Its companies span payments apps and merchant tooling with Bitcoin integration, the development of bitcoin mining hardware, open source software development, a decentralized finance protocol for peer-to-peer markets and even a self-custody hardware wallet. 

Formerly called Square and founded in 2009, the company started integrating Bitcoin into its technology offering as early as 2014 via Cash App — its most famous subsidiary — allowing merchants to accept bitcoin payments through the app. In 2021, Square Inc officially rebranded to Block Inc, doubling down on its commitment to Bitcoin and affirming its vision of the future as one where the Bitcoin Blockchain would play a pivotal role. Square became a subsidiary of Block Inc and now deals primarily with payment terminal technology. Today, Block has 8,584 BTC on its balance sheet valued at almost 1 billion dollars, with an average purchase price of $30,405 dollars per bitcoin. 

Of Block's subsidiaries and investments, most have explicit connections to Bitcoin or blockchain systems such as Cash App, Bitkey, Proto, Spiral, TBD and Tidal. All of them are advancing Bitcoin adoption at various levels of the industry and have growing influence and gratitude from the Bitcoin community. Jack Dorsey has been a leading donor to various Bitcoin nonprofits and community efforts, including OpenSats, which funds open source Bitcoin development and through which a great deal of Nostr — a Bitcoin-native social network protocol — has been bootstrapped.

In an exclusive interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Mile Suter, product lead at Block shared insights into their vision for the future and Bitcoin's ideal role in it, saying that, “We think Bitcoin achieves its ultimate destiny when it's being used as everyday money. Just like Satoshi intended. I think that Bitcoin as a global financial infrastructure that everyone can access lets companies like Block operate in a much more global manner. And I think that payments are essential to maintaining the core properties that make Bitcoin unique and ultimately will make it win in the long run.”

Below you'll find short overviews of some of Block's Bitcoin-related companies, particularly those serving retail, with exclusive quotes from Suter on how they serve critical roles in the path to hyperbitcoinization. 

Launched in 2009, Square is a point-of-sale (POS) system enabling merchants to accept card payments and manage operations like inventory, payroll, and business loans. Serving four million sellers and processing $241 billion annually as of 2024, Square announced that it began rolling out Bitcoin payments for merchants at the Bitcoin Vegas conference in 2025, allowing them to accept bitcoin seamlessly via its POS hardware.

The move marks a major milestone in Bitcoin's integration with retail payment systems, establishing a missing pillar up until now in the business toolkit needed to really use bitcoin as a medium of exchange. “On the Square side, we have over 4 million merchants in the U.S. with a full suite of point-of-sale, inventory, taxes, reporting, like the best in the business in terms of traditional payments processing. This initiative goes beyond just Bitcoin payments,” said Suter.With the full-stack accounting integration of Bitcoin, merchants that wanted to accept the digital currency but could not because of lack of tooling now have the door wide open. But the vision is greater than that. “And we're going to be offering a full-stack Bitcoin banking suite specifically designed for small businesses,” Suter added, leaning into the growing trend of bitcoin treasury companies and strategies that is dominating Bitcoin news today.Companies will soon have all the tools to accept bitcoin payments and put them directly into their company treasury rather than instantly sell bitcoin for dollars. If they need liquidity, they are already able to put that bitcoin as collateral and get dollar-denominated loans straight to their bank account via companies like Unchained — though, without a doubt, Block is also moving in that direction for their clients. Suter added that “one thing I love about this full-stack Bitcoin banking suite is that we're democratizing access to Bitcoin treasury tools that were previously only available to large corporations. I believe that holding Bitcoin on your balance sheet shouldn't just be a Wall Street luxury.”

Cash App, perhaps the most renowned brand within the Block portfolio, completes the retail payments side of the hyperbitcoinization engine Block is building. Introduced in 2013, Cash App is a consumer-focused digital wallet with a reported 57 million active users in 2024, offering person-to-person payments, debit cards, stocks and Bitcoin trading, and tax filing. Cash App reported $10 billion in bitcoin-sourced revenue in 2024, making up 62% the total, by charging ~2% per trade.Cash App might also be the first mainstream payments app to integrate Lightning, Bitcoin's payments network. It is at the cutting edge of the industry, producing the highest publicly disclosed, bitcoin-denominated revenue but operating the Lightning Network at 9.7% return. This is not some weird crypto magic yield, and can only be achieved by making sure bitcoin payments are incredibly efficient and reliable. Suited noted that “to me, it's proof that Bitcoin is already a functioning payment network, not digital gold. It's more than that. And I don't want to get too into the weeds here, but I can confidently say that we have the most talented set of Lightning engineers in the world working on these problems.”Exalted about the success of Cash App's Bitcoin integration, Suter added that “we're super excited about Lightning's role in making Bitcoin everyday money because that's really, from a Block Inc. perspective, we believe that's essential for Bitcoin's future, Satoshi's original vision, peer-to-peer electronic cash.”

Consumers cannot just easily buy and send bitcoin via Cash App, but also automate purchases, an investment strategy known as DCA or dollar cost averaging, which has been mathematically demonstrated to be one of the best investment strategies there are in bitcoin. 

The combination of Cash App and Square unlocks what tech people call a “fly wheel,” a term used to describe self-reinforcing loops of consumer and business behavior that can drive a business to new heights and which is usually not possible if a building block in that business logic is missing. Perhaps with these two major integrations, the vision of Bitcoin payments dreamt about by early adopters for over a decade, which have not really worked very well up until now, can finally become a reality. 

Anchored in the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin — censorship resistance through individual liberty and self custody — Block has launched a new hardware wallet product called Bitkey. The device is designed specifically for Bitcoin security, using a popular technology called multisignature, which decentralize the passwords — private keys— needed to move the bitcoin to three different devices: the Bitkey hardware, a key stored for recovery in Block's servers and a third key encrypted with the user's credentials and stored on the user's chosen Google drive account.

The Bitkey, launched globally in 2024, makes various design choices that depart from the way other hardware wallets in the industry function — the most primary and controversial difference being that it never shows private key material to the user. Unlike every other hardware wallet and most self-custody Bitcoin and crypto apps, Bitkey hides key material almost entirely from the user, instead giving them various well-designed tools to secure, recover and inherit their bitcoin securely to their loved ones. Suter noted that “we built Bitkey to expand who can safely self-custody. We — Bitcoiners — joke that you should onboard your grandma to self-custody, but I hear countless stories of that being true and people reaching out because the onboarding was so seamless.”The device looks and feels like alien technology, every unit with a unique mixed stone pattern, and that lights up to the touch, like it is alive. It is a profound rethinking of self custody, born of a deep critique of the user experience of the traditional Bitcoin seed backup approach. While the design has been in the market for barely a year and no public data on sales numbers has been released, it will be interesting to see if they can break new ground into hardware wallet adoption — a metric historically poor for an industry so culturally defined by self custody.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged on Monday to trade near record highs as investor enthusiasm and momentum around crypto grew amid Trump's recent Fed nomination and executive order allowing crypto investment in 401(k) retirement plans.

The digital token reached $122,000 on Monday before easing to around $120,000. The gains come as inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown and public companies have been adding bitcoin to their balance sheets.

Bitcoin wasn't the only cryptocurrency getting a bid. Ethereum (ETH-USD) touched 2021 levels on Monday, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged roughly 190% since the April market lows.

Companies have been adding ethereum to their balance sheets as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets, such as stablecoins.

The move higher in crypto also comes as stocks hover near record highs on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September and that President Trump's next Fed chair pick will likely bring looser monetary policy.

""If the Fed is cutting into an economy that is still growing, with unemployment in check and inflation elevated, that is a macro cocktail that should favor allocation to crypto,"" Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote on Friday.

Farrell also noted that Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran to serve on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors is also bullish for crypto assets, given that he has called for weaker dollar policy in the past, which typically drives up asset prices.

At the same time, regulatory tailwinds have also pushed the price of bitcoin higher.

Last week Trump issued an executive order asking the Labor Department to look into allowing 401(k) plans to hold cryptocurrencies, among other alternative assets. The move would open the door for more investors to get involved in crypto.

Even Trump's son Eric Trump has noted crypto's surge, writing recently, ""Stop betting against BTC and ETH — you will be run over.""

Strategists note the administration's crypto push is a major tailwind for the industry.

 Sustained ETF inflows and corporate reserves could position ETH to outperform and challenge $5,000 for the first time ever. 

Key takeaways:

ETH rallied 41% in a month, but derivatives data shows traders remaining cautious, not bullish.

Institutional inflows and corporate Ether reserves suggest strong demand, yet recession risks cloud the outlook.

Ether (ETH) climbed to $4,349 on Monday, its highest price since December 2021. Despite outperforming the broader cryptocurrency market by more than 30% over the past 30 days, derivatives data shows ETH traders have yet to turn decisively bullish. 

This has raised doubts about whether a rally to $5,000 is likely in the near term.

ETH has gained 41% in the past month, compared to a 9% increase in total crypto market capitalization. With such strong outperformance, demand for hedging naturally rises as traders lock in profits and rotate into other opportunities. The lack of appetite for leveraged bullish bets above $4,000 is therefore not unexpected.

In neutral market conditions, monthly futures contracts typically trade at a 5% to 10% premium relative to spot markets to offset the longer settlement period. Yet despite ETH nearing six-month highs, this premium remains below a clear bullish threshold. 

The lack of bullishness is somewhat concerning given that spot Ether exchange-traded funds attracted $683 million in net inflows between Thursday and Friday.

The ETH options market provides clues to gauge whether traders missed the rally and are waiting for a better entry or instead expect a price drop below $4,000. 

In bearish setups, the options delta skew moves above the 6% neutral mark as put (sell) contracts command higher premiums. Conversely, excessive bullishness will drive the indicator below -6%.

Currently at -3%, the ETH options delta skew points to neutral sentiment. The metric has improved significantly since Aug. 2, when it briefly turned bearish after a 13% price drop.

In short, professional traders are not aggressively bullish but are not expecting ETH to retest $4,000 either. Stronger institutional demand for ETH holdings helps explain this sentiment shift.

Publicly traded BitMine Immersion (BMNR) said Monday it added 317,126 ETH to its corporate reserves, valued at $1.35 billion at current prices. Meanwhile, Sharplink Gaming (SBET) disclosed it raised nearly $900 million to expand its ETH reserve strategy. 

The company already holds about 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet, worth over $2.55 billion at today's levels.

Ether's neutral derivatives readings appear encouraging, especially given that traders failed to anticipate the swift rally from $3,400 to $4,300 in just eight days. 

The longer ETH price stays above $4,000, the greater the likelihood that traders will gain confidence and initiate bullish positions, which could pave the way for a move toward $5,000.

Macroeconomic conditions and overall risk appetite remain the main obstacles to further gains. Some investors worry that US import tariffs could weigh on global economic growth. However, the expected summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump has eased geopolitical tensions, at least for now. 

If spot ETF inflows continue and companies keep raising capital to expand Ether reserves, ETH is well-positioned to outperform the broader cryptocurrency market.

ByClem Chambers,

 Senior Contributor. 

I remember moving into an Airbnb near Apple, only to find squatters coding for a nascent ethereum. They quickly vacated once the managing agent realized their side hustle was bust, but not before I chatted with the itinerant devs about what they were up to. Let's just say, I didn't buy any ethereum at about $1 because well, eh – no excuses really!

I made up for it later, and I still hold a candle for ETH.

So it is with some pleasure that I see it making a classical breakout:

I don't think I need to draw lines on this chart.

But let me draw some on this:

So you see, I'm not a perma-crypto bear.

This is also an interesting chart:

How I gauge it, bitcoin has outperformed ethereum by 100%, and I must admit, during the crypto winter, I thought the outperformance would go the other way. However, ethereum has faced a lot of competition, particularly from the cool kiddies in Solana-town. It also keeps changing the rules on its ecosystem, and behavior like this, however mild, is liable to take the momentum out of the price.

So now ETH is on the move, and once again it's the role of the crazy treasury reserve idea that is getting the animal instinct aflutter.

So, is this the start of the longed for ‘alt season' crypto denizens crave, or was that back at the beginning of the year when pump.fun ran amuck with all the AI agentic pump-dumps of that chapter?

Will the all in BTC-maxis suddenly go ETH-maxi? Will ETH drain BTC?

Google trends says there is life in the old ETH dog yet:

That might mean alt-season II is a possibility. As such, we should look out for some craziness, if that's your trading poison.","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"

Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion (BMNR) said Monday its ether holdings have surpassed 1.15 million tokens, valued at about $4.9 billion, a level the company says makes it the largest corporate ETH treasury globally.

The disclosure extends BitMine's rapid accumulation this summer and makes it the first digital asset treasury company to surpass 1 million ETH. Previously, The Block reported the company at 625,000 ETH alongside a $1 billion stock repurchase program, and then 833,000 ETH worth $2.9 billion on Aug.4 as buys accelerated. Monday's announcement suggests the NYSE-listed firm added 317,000, or $1.3 billion worth of tokens, to its holdings since last week. The firm did not detail new financing in today's statement.

BitMine has positioned itself as an Ethereum-denominated treasury and staking company at a time when corporate ETH balance sheets are growing and institutional adoption is maturing. The Block's data shows Ethereum treasuries have climbed past $10 billion across tracked entities like SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital.



BitMine chairman Tom Lee, also co-founder of Fundstrat, said on CNBC that Ethereum could be entering a “2017 Bitcoin” moment fueled by three key drivers: a regulatory green light for stablecoins, signs of SEC openness to moving finance onchain, and major firms such as JPMorgan and Robinhood building on Ethereum.  Lee floated the prospect of an “Ethereum MicroStrategy” era and said prices could move from roughly $3,700 to $30,000 or more if those trends compound.

ETH traded for $4,189, 14% away from its previous all-time high, The Block's price page shows. BMNR surged 9% after the latest treasury announcement, while BitMine shares are up 634% since January, according to Yahoo Finance data.

One investment firm is down hundreds of millions of dollars after attempting to short Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins, according to on-chain analysis.

In a post on the social media platform X, Lookonchain says that crypto asset manager Abraxas Capital – a firm with around $3 billion in assets under its management – tried to short BTC, ETH, Solana (SOL), SUI Network (SUI), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) as a hedge on its other positions

However, the positions may have been too large and have resulted in nearly $200 million worth of unrealized losses.

“Abraxas Capital's two accounts are shorting ETH, BTC, SOL, HYPE, and SUI as a hedge against spot holdings, with total unrealized losses exceeding $190 million! They're holding 113,819 ETH ($483 million) in shorts – down more than $144 million.”

Shorting is the practice of borrowing a stock or crypto asset and selling it right away, with the expectation of buying it back later at a lower price for a profit.

The market analytics firm goes on to highlight another failed attempt to short Ethereum by an unknown whale, resulting in $20 million worth of losses.

“To avoid liquidation, whale 0x8c58 deposited another 8.6 million USDC into Hyperliquid over the past 24 hours. He shorted ETH at ~$2,969 on July 12, but as ETH kept climbing, he kept adding margin to avoid liquidation…

New liquidation price: $4,885.3.”

Looking at Solana, Lookonchain says that crypto asset management giant Galaxy Digital appears to be selling its stash of SOL as it has been moving the token into prominent crypto exchanges.

“Is Galaxy Digital dumping SOL? Galaxy Digital deposited another 224,000 SOL ($41.12 million) into Binance and Coinbase.”

Solana is trading for $184 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day, while BTC and ETH are worth $122,187 and $4,302, respectively.

Bitcoin advocate Samson Mow has forecasted that many Ethereum investors will ultimately shift their profits back into Bitcoin, even as Ether continues its recent rally.

Mow, CEO of bitcoin adoption firm JAN3, argued that much of the recent Ether surge is driven by insiders rotating their bitcoin into ETH to take advantage of new narratives, such as Ethereum treasury companies.

He stated:

“Most ETH holders have a lot of BTC (ICO/insiders) and they are rotating that BTC into ETH to pump it on new narratives (Ethereum Treasury co's)… Once Ether is high enough, they'll dump their ETH, creating new generational bagholders, and then rotate the gains back into BTC.”

He added that breaking all-time highs would be challenging for ETH, coining this situation the “Bagholder's Dilemma.”

Mow dismissed concerns about the ETH/BTC ratio breaking its downward trend, emphasizing that Ethereum has historically served as a means for some to accumulate more bitcoin.

The ETH/BTC ratio is now at 0.036, having doubled from its five-year low in April, according to TradingView.

For a broader overview of bitcoin's historical dominance, see the bitcoin dominance chart.

Contrasting Mow's stance, investor Ted Pillows predicted that Ether could reach a new all-time high, sparking a mini altseason before funds rotate back to bitcoin, potentially up to $140,000, with another cycle into altcoins thereafter.

This mirrors patterns seen in previous bitcoin price history cycles, where capital shifts between bitcoin and altcoins.

ETH recently closed its highest weekly candle since November 2021, peaking above $4,300 and sitting just 12% off its all-time high.

Meanwhile, bitcoin's dominance has dropped by 10% since late June as more capital flows into altcoins.

Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today.

An individual known as ""Fede's intern"" claims to have been detained in Turkey on allegations of helping others ""misuse Ethereum,"" according to a series of posts on social media platform X. The person, who identifies as an Argentinian developer focused on ZK and Ethereum, said he is being held in Izmir.

In a post published on Sunday, Fede's intern wrote that Turkey's Minister of Interior accused him of facilitating Ethereum misuse and that authorities confined him to a room.

""It's obviously wrong, we are just infra builders,"" the developer said, while adding that he is open to cooperating with the authorities. In following posts, Fede's intern wrote that he is receiving assistance from his legal team and may soon be able to leave the country, headed to Europe.

As details about the specific accusations against Fede's intern remain unclear, some users on the social media platform have raised doubts about his claims, with user ""0xCenk"" stating that there is ""zero legal basis"" for detaining an individual on such charges.

In a reply, Fede's intern wrote: ""[I'm] waiting to share more information until I'm out of the country and our attorney gives me the green light ... I don't know what the heck I win by inventing that this happened to me."" 

According to his X profile, he is associated with a few crypto and blockchain projects, including investment firm Lambda Class and blockchain solutions firm Aligned.

The Block has reached out to the Turkish authorities, Lambda Class and the Ethereum Foundation for more information on the situation.

This is a developing story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","What is a ghost chain? How to spot dead or dormant crypto projects","https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-is-a-ghost-chain-how-to-spot-dead-crypto-projects","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 10:15:17 GMT","

 Ghost chains refer to blockchain projects with little to no real activity, adoption or developer engagement. 

Ghost chains are blockchains that are technically operational but have little to no real-world usage, development, or community engagement.

Common warning signs include stagnant developer activity, low transaction volume, inactive communities, and exchange delistings.

Even well-funded or corporate-backed projects like Diem, KodakCoin, and Luna can fail if adoption and ecosystem growth stall.

Investors and developers can avoid ghost chains by monitoring onchain activity, GitHub commits, token liquidity, and community health before committing resources.

A ghost chain refers to a blockchain that, while technically still running, has been abandoned by its developers and community. These are sometimes called dead blockchain networks or dormant crypto projects.

While the chain may once have had momentum or hype, over time, developer activity stalls, user engagement drops and transaction volume plummets. Gradually, signs of failure become noticeable: no recent updates, diminished user activity and minimal real-world utility. Seemingly, they may often be operational and active on the surface, but are devoid of any useful activity and appear to be fading into obscurity. 

Essentially, it's a blockchain that is technically alive but functionally dead. The rise of ghost chains stems from several overlapping factors. Often, the original developers or teams stop contributing, leaving repositories untouched for months. Eventually, the core development team ceases communication, roadmap updates stop and users migrate to more active ecosystems. Communities diminish and liquidity dries up.

In time, the network becomes a ghost chain, disconnected from the vibrant user base it once hoped to attract. From once-promising Ethereum killers to obscure layer 1s, the crypto landscape is dotted with examples of such projects that lost steam after initial hype. Whether due to a lack of utility, community or funding, these chains now drift in the blockchain graveyard. Spotting the warning signs can help avoid being caught in a “digital ghost town.”

Did you know: In June 2024, Binance delisted WAVES, OMG Network (OMG), NEM (XEM), and Wrapped NXM (WNXM) due to low trading volume, weak liquidity and limited development activity, all symptomatic signs of chains drifting toward ghost status.  

Not every declining blockchain qualifies as a ghost chain. However, several recurring indicators can help identify a project on the brink of irrelevance. These are the key signs of a failed project (or on its way to becoming one):

Diminished developer activity: A lack of recent code commits, version releases or updates. 

Inactive communities: Forums and social platforms show minimal or no engagement.

Broken or outdated websites: Project information is stale and documentation is incomplete.

Low onchain transaction volume: Only a handful of transactions occur daily, often automated or internal.

Exchange delistings and low trading volume: The native token of the chain may be delisted or exhibit extremely thin liquidity.

These red flags often appear together in dormant crypto projects, where the utility of the token is questionable and user trust is eroded.

To protect time, capital and resources, it is essential to proactively assess any blockchain before engagement. The table below lists some important questions that you must ask before engaging with a blockchain:

Examine transaction data: Use public blockchain explorers to assess how frequently blocks are being produced and if users are actually sending transactions. If block explorers show minimal daily transactions or wallet activity, that's a big warning sign. Some chains process only a handful of transactions per day, with most blocks nearly empty.

Check DApp activity:  A thriving chain will have decentralized apps, DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces and other smart contracts in use. If the ecosystem is barren, chances are it's not attracting builders or users and is on its way to decline.

Assess GitHub or repository updates: Check the project's GitHub to see if developers are still committing code and fixing bugs. If the last meaningful commit was six months before, then that may be a red flag and require further probing.

Monitor social media and communication channels: Look for AMA sessions, dev updates or community-driven content. Telegram groups with no moderators, Discord with more bot spamming than users or X accounts that haven't posted in months — these are all signs of failed chains. If the community feels deserted, it probably is and is an important and easy red flag to notice.

Review token performance: A plummeting token price with negligible trade volume often reflects broader abandonment. While price alone doesn't determine success, a token that consistently declines with no trading volume or liquidity is a problem. 

Crypto events: Check for any active participation and presence of the chain in recent crypto events such as a booth, speaker discussion, meetups, etc. Consistent lack of the team to showcase its offerings is a sign of decline. 

Keep in mind that overpromising and weak or no delivery to match the initial hype is something to look for. “The fastest chain,” “Solana killer,” or “100,000 TPS” are some extravagant promises often made in the blockchain ecosystem but rarely delivered. If the roadmap is outdated and no updates are forthcoming, it might be time to move on.

Did you know: Feathercoin, launched in 2013 by Peter Bushnell, the head of IT at Oxford University's Brasenose College, as a faster Litecoin alternative, garnered initial interest but largely became a ghost chain amid stiff competition and its own dwindling development, leading to an overall decline in interest.

Several blockchain projects, once praised for innovation, have become ghost chain examples due to declining usage and visibility:

While each project failed for different reasons, the common thread is clear: Without active ecosystems and sustained developer engagement, even the most well-funded blockchains can fade into obscurity.

Did you know: Diem, Facebook's ambitious blockchain project formerly known as Libra, raised over $1.3 billion and secured backing from major firms like Visa and PayPal, yet it was abandoned in 2022 after intense regulatory pressure, making it one of the most high-profile corporate dead projects in crypto history.

The collapse or stagnation of blockchain networks has wider implications. These dead blockchain projects contribute to digital clutter networks running with no users, consuming resources and creating confusion for investors and developers.

Major consequences include:

Loss of investor capital due to token devaluation.

Wasted development time and infrastructure.

Decreased trust in newer blockchain initiatives.

Beyond financial loss, ghost chains pose security risks. Abandoned domains, download links and legacy wallets can become phishing traps. Fraudsters may repurpose old smart contracts or resurrect historical data to deploy malicious code, deceiving users who reconnect with the chain expecting legitimacy. 

It's important to note that not all inactive crypto blockchains are permanently doomed. Some may see a revival with renewed community support, updates or rebranding. But this is an exception and not the norm.

In the next bull cycle, new blockchains will rise, but only a few will stick. Knowing how to differentiate between a vibrant protocol and a ghost chain is one of the most valuable skills in the space today. Stay sharp, stay skeptical and always do your own research.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Asia's quiet tokenization revolution shows how the blockchain becomes ‘real'","https://fortune.com/asia/2025/08/11/real-world-assets-blockchain-asia-evolve-amber-mile-green/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:08:00 GMT","

Clay Chandler is executive editor, Asia, at Fortune.

For years, the crypto economy was a digital wild west: volatile, speculative, and often untethered from the real world. Now, Asia is leading a reinvention—building a blockchain ecosystem that doesn't just trade coins, but tokenizes roads, solar farms, and financial instruments. It's a shift from roulette wheels to regulated rails, from speculation to scaffolding. 

The first uses of the blockchain were purely virtual: Cryptocurrencies and NFTs that reflected digital assets with no real-world counterpart. Yet the next wave of financial innovators are trying to make blockchain work in the “real” world by tokenizing real-world assets like artwork, real estate—and, if two small Asia-based financial startups have their way, clean energy.  





If predictions hold true, real-world assets on the blockchain can be a lucrative opportunity: Standard Chartered believes the market could be worth $30.1 trillion within the next decade.  





Amber Premium, a Thailand-based institutional crypto services provider, and Evolve, a tokenized infrastructure company specializing in renewable energy, are tiny by global standards: Amber's market capitalization hovers around $600 million, while Evolve manages a relatively small asset base.  





Unlike crypto giants like Binance or Coinbase, Amber and Evolve are niche, but their focus on tokenizing real-world infrastructure are examples of how Asia is transforming the realm of digital finance. 




What connects both Amber and Evolve are tokens: the conversion of real-world assets into digital tokens onto a blockchain. In principle, this offers institutions a compelling alternative to legacy investment structures. Rather than have layers of financial intermediaries, investors have direct, auditable ownership through the blockchain. Users can then divide and trade these tokens however they wish, and set up smart contracts to automate yield distribution. 





These tokens represent tangible physical or financial assets—solar arrays, government bonds, EV fleets—bringing real yield, lower volatility, and legal transparency to crypto markets. Amber Premium allows clients to hold tokenized clean energy debt, money market stablecoins, and more—all within a single digital wallet. Meanwhile, Evolve's tokens are linked to solar farms and battery networks, seamlessly bridging the gap between industrial infrastructure and digital finance. 





Amber Premium, led by CEO Wayne Huo—a former Morgan Stanley trader—recently merged with iClick, securing a Nasdaq listing and establishing itself as a fully regulated institutional crypto player. Amber's regulatory framework spans multiple jurisdictions: its Singapore arm (formerly Sparrow Tech) operates under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), while other subsidiaries hold licenses adapted to local Asian markets. The firm invests heavily in compliance infrastructure, aiming to meet the expectations of institutional clients and regulators alike.  





Amber's Nasdaq listing established the company as a U.S.-listed institutional gateway into “Web3”—shorthand for an internet built on decentralized blockchain technologies. Huo took over as CEO, giving the company a bridge to traditional finance.  





Amber Premium's clientele is distinctly institutional. As of Q1 2025, the platform counted roughly 928 active clients—an increase from 891 the previous year—who collectively held $1.275 billion in assets under management. These clients span regional banks, family offices, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries across Asia, the Middle East, and North America. A significant share of Amber's clients are based in Greater China who are looking for exposure to digital assets amid uncertainty around mainland China's treatment of cryptocurrency. 




Amber is still a tiny company, generating just $14.94 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, up from $1 million a year prior. Amber Premium has yet to turn a profit, instead prioritizing infrastructure, licensing and regulatory compliance over short-term earnings. And its revenue has tracked the ups and downs of the crypto market: It generated just $33 million in revenue in 2024, down from $308 million in 2021, the height of the COVID-era crypto boom. Shares have lost half their value since the listing, falling from a peak of around $12.80 in March to around $6.50 today. Analysts blame low awareness, thin trading volume and skepticism about the viability of crypto-finance hybrids after FTX's spectacular collapse in 2022.  





Evolve, founded by Maverick Hui, a pioneer of Canadian crypto ETFs and early digital asset regulation, is turning renewable energy infrastructure like battery-swapping stations, solar farms, and EV charging networks into digital tokens that deliver proportional returns to investors. Several of its ETF offerings, including those tied to Bitcoin and Solana, have received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission. The company partners with U.S.-licensed custodians like Coinbase Custody Trust for cross-border holdings.  





Hui, from Evolve, is focusing on yield-generating clear energy assets, particularly through e-scooter and battery station manufacturer Mile Green. In early 2025, Mile Green secured $50 million from CMAG Funds, a Singapore-based private investment firm, to expand battery-swapping and EV charging infrastructure across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa.  





(Fortune's parent company holds a minority stake in CMAG Funds. Chatchaval Jiravananon, Fortune's owner, is also an investor in Amber, Mile Green, and Evolve. Chatchaval recently took part in a $25.5 million private placement in Amber.)





Mile Green is Evolve's infrastructure partner: Mile Green develops the clean energy assets, which Evolve converts into investment-grade digital tokens. Investors can now track performance through these tokens rather than company filings.  




Asia is taking the lead in tokenized finance, thanks to clearer regulatory frameworks, innovation sandboxes and startups that are eager to experiment. Even mainland China, which bans most cryptocurrency trading and mining, is experimenting with enterprise blockchain through its state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) and central bank digital currency, the e-CNY.  





The financial hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore are among Asia's most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Yet regulators in both cities are still cautious about cryptocurrency. Tokenized products still face strict limitations, retail access is tightly controlled, and approval processes can be unpredictable. One major constraint is the difficulty of transferring tokenized assets between wallets. As a result, wallet-to-wallet transfers are often restricted or require complex approvals, limiting broader adoption. 





Changing winds in Washington are also buoying Asia-based crypto platforms. The second Trump administration is taking a decidedly more pro-crypto stance. In January, U.S. president Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting responsible blockchain growth. He paused enforcement actions against crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, and Trump's SEC then launched a “Crypto 2.0” task force to clarify rules on crypto, moving away from the preceding Biden administration's more skeptical stance.  





In March, the White House announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, naming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano as national digital assets. Then, in August, new rules opened 401(k) retirement plans to crypto, private equity, and real estate—unlocking trillions in potential institutional capital.  





The administration also backed the GENIUS Act, which clarifies rules for stablecoins. Together, these moves are ushering in what the crypto industry hopes will be a more friendly, legally-stable foundation for growth.  




These shifts benefit both Amber and Evolve. Amber, as a Nasdaq-listed company, gains regulatory legitimacy and improved U.S. market access. Evolve's yield-bearing, tokenized infrastructure may soon appeal to pension funds and fiduciary investors seeking new types of assets.  





As the U.S. softens its stance and Asia doubles down on digital finance, companies like Amber Premium and Evolve are quietly building the financial plumbing for the next phase of blockchain adoption—and getting the real world on the blockchain. 





There's still a long way to go. Liquidity remains thin, valuation remains depressed, and the sector remains vulnerable to global regulatory swings. Then there's the ownership question: How do you ensure a digital token on the blockchain grants a clear and enforceable claim on the real-world asset in question? 





Tokenized finance may still be in its early innings—but the infrastructure is maturing. Asia didn't invent blockchain. But it may be where blockchain becomes real.

Last week during a presentation at the Blockchain Rio event, Brazil's central bank Governor Gabriel Gallipolo spoke about the bank's innovation agenda. The slide regarding DREX, the wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) initiative, didn't mention blockchain or tokenization. Nor was there much mention of CBDC for that matter.

DREX was always part of an open finance push by the Banco Central do Brasil, and it will remain so. But the focus of the next phase of work is now far narrower – to enable brokers to enable clients to use assets – stocks, bonds, and other assets – as loan collateral. So it's now a lien reconciliation project that will use neither blockchain nor decentralization technologies, but will integrate with PIX, Brazil's successful retail instant payment system. But some work using blockchain technologies will continue in the background.

There appear to be two issues driving the change of direction. The technical challenge of combining novel privacy solutions with Ethereum-based Hyperledger Besu was flagged during the first phase, resulting in delays. While the privacy solutions were progressing, the central bank did not consider them sufficient or battle tested. That first phase was quite narrow, involving a wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and digital treasury bonds (Federal public bonds), and smart contracts to manage their issuance, transfer and redemption. In the delayed second phase which ended last month, 16 participating consortia trialed various use cases. But the privacy solutions remain immature.

Beeple caused Nakamigos NFTs to soar — and later plummet — in price this weekend after an AI-based stunt at the artist's CryptoPunks meetup depicted Larva Labs' founders launching an earlier iteration of the collection. 

At “CryptoPunks meetup 2.0,” a video showed an AI rendition of Matt Hall and John Watkinson supposedly launching the “V-ZERO CryptoPunks.”

The founders apparently discussed how the original, earlier iteration of CryptoPunks was created two years before the actual CryptoPunks NFT collection. 

Breaking: Matt Hall and @beeple signed a statement that claims @Nakamigos is the V.0 Cryptopunks that was developed by Larva Labs in 2015Over 1k Nagamigos swept, and floor doubled in an hour pic.twitter.com/HGF8ZGLUC3

Both Hall and Beeple also signed flyers, however, these used pictures from the Nakamigos collection, a separate NFT project based on CryptoPunks. These flyers also rained down from the sky after the AI video was finished.

This led some to believe that the Nakamigos were in fact the “launched” V-0 Cryptopunks, and the collection's trading volume and price in ether (ETH) duly shot up by 1,782% and 127% respectively.

However, when news spread that it was a joke, the price tumbled by 57% and returned to a roughly pre-pump 0.189 ETH. 

Beeple then doubled down on the joke by releasing an apology video that ridiculed anyone who previously fell for the stunt. He listed multiple telltale signs that it was joke, and said he would make things right at the URL “I'mafuckingretard.com.”

Someone has already bought a similar domain and is using it to redirect people to a different NFT collection. Beeple also shared a satirical post implying a lawsuit had been filed that accused him of buying hundreds of Nakamigos NFTs in advance.

Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Try The Block's hiring tool for free today.

An Ethereum initial coin offering participant has sold 2,300 ETH, worth about $9.9 million, early Monday morning, onchain data shows.

Onchain data analytics provider Lookonchain reported Monday that the address ""0x845…a210c"" transferred 2,300 ETH to Kraken, leaving the address with 1,623 ETH remaining.

The Ethereum ICO whale originally received 20,000 ETH for $6,200, which is now valued at around $86 million, according to Lookonchain.

In addition to Monday's transfer, the address made several previous outbound transfers: 250 ETH in December 2024, 1,000 ETH in February 2024, and 3,000 ETH in late November 2023, among others.

Ethereum climbed 1.64% in the past 24 hours to trade above $4,300 at the time of writing, reaching its highest levels since December 2021, according to The Block's Ethereum price page.

The Ethereum ICO, held from July 22 to September 2, 2014, raised about $18.3 million by selling over 60 million ETH tokens at an average price of $0.31 per ETH, with 1 BTC initially buying 2,000 ETH and later 1,337 ETH due to price adjustments.

The funds, equivalent to 31,531 BTC, supported the development of Ethereum, which launched in July 2015 with a total initial supply of 72 million ETH, 83% of which went to ICO investors.

This ICO, accessible globally without investor restrictions, yielded an ROI of more than 12,000-fold for early investors, based on Ethereum's current price.

Articles Details

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

- DeXRP, a DEX on XRP Ledger, raised $4.3M in its ICO with 80% of DXP tokens sold to 6,235 investors.

- The platform combines AMM pools with order books, offering 4-second settlements and low fees via XRP's speed.

- DXP tokenomics allocate 25% to presale, 15% to liquidity, and 10% to staking, with a dynamic fee mechanism for liquidity providers.

- DeXRP aims to boost XRP Ledger's DeFi growth, targeting a Q4 2025 listing after securing support from Messari and Big Brain Holdings.

DeXRP, a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has raised over $4.3 million in its ongoing initial coin offering (ICO), according to recent reports [3]. The project, which combines automated market maker (AMM) pools with traditional order book trading, is designed to leverage the speed and low transaction costs of the XRP Ledger to deliver fast 4-second settlement times and minimal trading fees [1]. The DXP token, which is central to the DeXRP ecosystem, has already attracted over 6,235 investors, with nearly 80% of the initial distribution tokens sold [3].

The DXP token is currently priced at $0.05285, with an expected listing price of $0.35 [3]. Investors can purchase the token using Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, or USDT on supported networks, as well as through bank card transactions. The tokenomics are structured to support long-term sustainability, with 25% of the total supply allocated to the presale, 15% reserved for liquidity provision, and 10% earmarked for staking rewards [3]. The project is also introducing a dynamic fee mechanism that allows liquidity providers to bid for lower trading fees, an innovative approach aimed at enhancing user incentives and platform efficiency [3].

DeXRP aims to serve as a go-to trading hub for the XRPL community, offering advanced features such as real-time analytics, smart order routing, and a transparent governance model for token holders [3]. The platform's utility-first approach is designed to support liquidity providers, traders, institutional investors, and DeFi platforms on the XRP Ledger. The project's development is aligned with the growing interest in the XRP ecosystem, which has seen its on-chain TVL increase from $20 million to $100 million in just eight months [3].

With the XRP Ledger already demonstrating a 34% monthly growth rate in real-world asset (RWA) adoption, DeXRP's launch is expected to further accelerate the expansion of DeFi on the chain [3]. The project has also drawn attention from major industry players, including Messari and Big Brain Holdings, which are anticipated to contribute to its early-stage growth [3]. DeXRP's planned cross-chain capabilities and integration with major analytics platforms could further broaden its appeal to a global user base.

The DXP token listing is expected to be announced in the coming months, with a projected launch by Q4 2025 [3]. As the project moves toward its official listing, it remains focused on transparency, compliance, and institutional-grade security, positioning itself as a key player in the evolving DeFi landscape.

An individual who participated in Ethereum's ETH/USD initial coin offering dumped nearly $10 million worth of the cryptocurrency early Monday.

Speculate on price movements, claim up to $200 in bonuses, and start with risk-free paper trading with crypto futures on Plus500.

The long-term investor deposited 2,300 ETH, worth $9.8 million as of this writing, to popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, according to on-chain tracking platform Spot On Chain.

The investor received as many as 20,000 ETH during ETH's ICO in 2014 and has been selling at set intervals. With the latest sale, they are left with a balance of only 1,623 ETH, worth $6.92 million.

The whale's tactic appeared contradictory to the broader market. According to IntoTheBlock, the amount of ETH held by long-term investors increased during the last 24 hours, indicating that accumulation was taking place.

Moreover, ETH recorded negative net flows in the last 24 hours, suggesting that more ETH was withdrawn than deposited on exchanges. This is typically seen as a preference for HODLing.

Meanwhile, over 50% of Binance's top trader accounts i.e, the top 20% users with the highest margin balance, were positioned long on ETH as of this writing, according to Coinglass.

ETH rallied sharply during the weekend, sailing past $4,300 for the first time since November 2021. As of this writing, it was 12.84% away from the all-time high.

Price Action: At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $4,263.86, up 2.27% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.  The coin has surged nearly 20% over the last week.

One of the original Ethereum ICO investors has sent 2,000 ETH (around $8.55 million) to the crypto exchange Kraken. The decision is made when ETH is trading at a price of $4,250 after the asset showed a bullish momentum that has seen up to a 22% price increase within the past weeks.

Nansen on-chain data indicates that the whale first purchased 100,000 ETH during the Ethereum 2015 ICO for a total of only $31,100, which means the price per token was approximately $0.31.

This initial investment has given a more than 1.3 million percent increase to date.

All the same, the whale retains a huge balance of 58,000 ETH, or around 247.86 million, spread over several wallets despite the recent transfer. 

The recent 2,000 ETH transfer to Kraken is just a fraction of the total asset possession of the whale, and most of their long-standing holdings are not yet touched upon.

This is the same ICO wallet 0x2c…F0E99 to which a deposit address 0x815…c3eD is attached, which confirms the link to the first Ethereum fundraising.

Analysts and traders closely monitor these movements, because transfers to exchanges in large amounts may (but not always) hint that the asset is about to be sold or that a portfolio is being rebalanced.

The Ethereum bulls' return and the steady buildup of its ecosystem, which has been propelling the Ethereum price to date, can affect the timing of this transfer. 

At its current levels, which are within striking distance of yearly highs, with current momentum being very strong, early investors are positioned to cash in while still leaving plenty on the table on the upside.

Whale activity shall also be in the spotlight of traders as Ethereum inches closer to all-time highs of holding high value at 4,800.

The actions of early ICO participants, who hold large amounts of Ethereum at very low cost bases, are particularly significant in influencing market sentiment and liquidity.

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

Sometimes, amid the memecoins and pay-for-access scandals, it can be difficult to remember that the crypto industry was built on the principles of privacy and autonomy. The elusive Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin white paper in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, after all. Even as Wall Street swallows blockchain technology whole, the core is still a spirit of disintermediation. 

I joined Fortune in August 2022, the same month that the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash, a virtual currency mixer that allowed users to input their (very traceable) cryptocurrency holdings and receive an anonymous output. The software, predictably, became a favorite of terrorist organizations and North Korean-affiliated hacking groups, but it also embodied the cypherpunk ideology that birthed the crypto sector.





OFAC's action created novel questions, such as whether a piece of code, rather than a person or organization, can be sanctioned. It also drew the ire of privacy advocates, who argued that internet users should have the right to own and send digital cash without government interference, just as offline people can with physical cash (to a degree). These, more than crypto bros trying to drive up the price of their tokens through sex toy-related stunts, are the fascinating dilemmas raised by blockchain technology, and what sets it apart from other forms of financial technology. (And as much as I hoped topics like Tornado Cash would dominate my coverage, Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX empire collapsed two months later.) 





A year after the sanctions, the Department of Justice brought charges against the creators of Tornado Cash, with one, Roman Storm, arrested in the United States. This was a tricky case for the crypto industry to get behind. The DOJ's indictment made clear that the founders knew their software's main utility was to help money launderers, including North Korea's Lazarus Group, and they were earning millions of dollars off the platform through their own proprietary token. In a recurring segment I like to call “Are you taking notes on a criminal f***ing conspiracy,” one founder admitted over text that they had to relinquish control over the software to make it seem like they weren't the owners. As one former DOJ prosecutor told me at the time, “These are pretty egregious facts.” 





But many powerful voices in the crypto industry, including the venture giant Paradigm, still threw their weight behind Storm, arguing that the government's case eroded the idea of privacy-preserving software and was in direct contradiction to previous guidance issued by the financial crimes division of the Treasury Department. 




Storm's initial trial, which was held in the same courthouse that hosted Bankman-Fried, wrapped up last week. Though he avoided two of the more serious charges, the jury still found him guilty on one, related to operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. His advocates are vowing to fight it, arguing that the decision sets a dangerous precedent for the future of privacy software. 





The more interesting question is why the case was allowed to continue under the Trump administration, which has broadly embraced the crypto sector—or at least the elements more tied to financial gains. The Securities and Exchange Commission abandoned cases against Coinbase and Justin Sun, and the DOJ issued a memo announcing the end of “regulation by prosecution” against the blockchain industry. They even dropped one of the lesser charges against Storm about registration. But the core charge—that a developer should be responsible for non-custodial software—was allowed to continue. 





The refrain since Trump returned to office has been that, thanks to the lax new regulatory approach, crypto enforcement is off the table. Unfortunately for Storm, it seems that's restricted to memecoins.

His advocates are vowing to fight it, arguing that the decision sets a dangerous precedent for the future of privacy software. 





The more interesting question is why the case was allowed to continue under the Trump administration, which has broadly embraced the crypto sector—or at least the elements more tied to financial gains. The Securities and Exchange Commission abandoned cases against Coinbase and Justin Sun, and the DOJ issued a memo announcing the end of “regulation by prosecution” against the blockchain industry. They even dropped one of the lesser charges against Storm about registration. But the core charge—that a developer should be responsible for non-custodial software—was allowed to continue. 





The refrain since Trump returned to office has been that, thanks to the lax new regulatory approach, crypto enforcement is off the table. Unfortunately for Storm, it seems that's restricted to memecoins.

 South Korean traders poured $259 million into Ether-hoarding firm BitMine in July, making it the country's most-purchased overseas stock. 

South Korean retail investors are pivoting away from Big Tech stocks in the United States into high-risk, high-reward crypto-linked equities. 

A Yonhap News Agency report citing data from the Korean Center for International Finance (KCIF) said the percentage of crypto-linked stocks in the top 50 net-bought stocks by South Korean investors rose from 8.5% in January to 36.5% in June before declining to 31.5% in July. 

The report added that net purchases of the top US Big Tech companies dropped to $260 million in July, down 84% from a monthly average of $1.68 billion between January and April. 

The KCIF attributed the shift to the rapid acceptance of stablecoins in the global financial markets, saying that the recently passed United States GENIUS Act had contributed to the change. 

The Ether-stacking company BitMine Immersion Technologies was the biggest beneficiary of the shift in South Korean investor appetite. 

On Monday, a Bloomberg report citing data from the Korea Securities Depository said that retail investors in South Korea had poured $259 million into BitMine stocks since the beginning of July. This made the company the most-purchased overseas security stock in the country in July. 

In the last 30 days, BitMine has increased its ETH holdings by 410.68% to 833,100 ETH. It now holds the world's biggest Ether (ETH) stack. As ETH surged past $4,300 on Monday, the company's holdings became worth nearly $3.6 billion, up 24% from their value on Tuesday.

While Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin backed public companies buying ETH, he warned investors that the future of ETH must not come at the cost of excessive leverage. 

In a Bankless podcast, Buterin said the “downfall of ETH” could come if treasuries turned into “an overleveraged game.” Buterin outlined a worst-case chain reaction where an ETH price drop could turn into a cascade of liquidations. 

Despite this, he expressed confidence that ETH investors were disciplined enough to steer clear of such a case.

Bullet Blockchain, Inc.


LAS VEGAS, Aug.  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bullet Blockchain, Inc. (OTC: BULT) (“Bullet Blockchain” or the “Company”), the only U.S. company holding foundational patents for Bitcoin ATMs and one of only three publicly traded Bitcoin ATM network owner/operators, today announced a partnership with Tangem, a pioneer in secure hardware wallets for cryptocurrencies.

Ether's (ETH) recent rally has pushed a vast majority of its addresses into profit, a development that could slow its ascent. 

According to analytics firm Sentora, 97% of ether addresses are now ""in-the-money."" In other words, the average acquisition costs of these addresses is lower than ether's going market rate of $4,225. 

This high profitability figure suggests that the current price rally could run into a significant increase in the sell-side pressure, a dynamic that could slow the price ascent. 

According to data by Glassnode, profit-taking is already happening. ETH profit realization, measured by a seven-day simple moving average, is ramping up again, with the tally climbing to $553 million per day. The profit taking peaked a $771 million per day in July. 

Further analysis reveals a shift in the source of this selling. While long-term holders, or those holding coins for over 155 days, are realizing profits at levels consistent with the peak in December 2024, it is now short-term investors who are driving the current wave of profit-taking.

Crypto exchange Bullish has raised the size of its initial public offering to $990 million from $629 million, as the company looks to take advantage of a hot market for crypto firms.

CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Bullish.

According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Bullish is aiming to sell 30 million shares at a price of $32 to $33 each, or $990 million and a valuation of $4.8 billion at the top of the range.

In a previous filing on Aug. 4, the company had planned to market 20.3 million shares at $28 to $31 each, or about $629 million and a $4.2 billion valuation at the top of the range.

Bullish is one of many crypto companies hoping to take advantage of a booming IPO market in the space as the industry is starting to profit from a clearer regulatory framework and investor interest, not to mention sharply higher prices of late for leading cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.

Stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) was among first to go public in June and has seen its share price skyrocket 93% since.

In an earlier filing with the SEC, Bullish disclosed that funds managed by BlackRock and Ark Investment Management have expressed interest to buy $200 million worth of shares of the company at the IPO price.

The company, which would trade under the ticker “BLSH” also disclosed that it had posted a net income estimate of $106 million to $109 million for the second quarter after reporting losses for the first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2024.

Bitcoin's (BTC) implied volatility (IV) has moved from 33 to 37 on Monday, a notable uptick from multi-year lows and a possible signal that the market's long stretch of calm is nearing an end. 

The Deribit Volatility Index (DVOL), modeled after the VIX in traditional markets, tracks the 30-day implied volatility of bitcoin options and now sits at its highest level in weeks.

Implied volatility represents the market's forecast for price swings, calculated from option prices. In formal terms, IV measures the one-standard-deviation range of an asset's expected movement over a year. Tracking at-the-money (ATM) IV offers a normalized view of sentiment, often rising and falling alongside realized volatility.

Last week, BTC's short-term IV fell to around 26%, one of the lowest readings since options data began being recorded, before rebounding sharply. The last time volatility sat this low was August 2023, when bitcoin hovered near $30,000 shortly before a sharp move higher.

Over the weekend, bitcoin jumped from $116,000 to $122,000, hinting at what can happen when volatility starts to expand. August is traditionally a period of low volumes and muted market activity, but rising IV suggests traders may be positioning for larger moves ahead.

Checkonchain data shows this latest rally was a spot-driven move, which is a healthier market structure than a purely leverage-fueled surge. Open interest has been declining through August, meaning a sudden influx of leverage could amplify price swings if sentiment shifts.

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this article owns shares in Strategy.Strategy (MSTR) adopted a bitcoin standard five years ago today, on Aug. 11, 2020, with its first purchase of 21,454 BTC for $250 million. The acquisition marked a historic shift in corporate treasury strategy. 

To that point, former AI and software development company had seen its share price stagnate for two decades after the early 2000 tech boom-and-bust, falling over 95% from its peak.

However, since August 2020, MSTR has delivered 100% average annual returns, compounding to over 3,000% cumulative gains, while bitcoin itself has returned nearly 1,000% over the same period.

To fund its BTC accumulation, the company has employed diverse strategies, raising $46 billion via equity and credit, which includes $8.2 billion in outstanding convertible debt and four perpetual preferred stock offerings, STRK, STRF, STRD, and STRC, designed to appeal to different segments of the yield curve.

The company Monday morning disclosed the purchase of another 155 BTC for $18 million — a rather small weekly buy, but nevertheless bringing its total stoack to 628,946 coins valued at about $76 billion. That representis 3% of bitcoin's fixed 21 million supply. With an average cost of about $74,000 per BTC, the company sits on unrealized gains of roughly $30 billion, or 65%.

MSTR is today one of the most actively traded stocks, posting $4.4 billion in daily trading volume just behind Google (GOOG) at $4.9 billion. Open interest in MSTR options totals $90 billion, also second to Google at $99 billion. Despite a $112 billion market cap compared to Google's $2.4 trillion, the trading activity reflects the intense focus on MSTR.

Its success has inspired a wave of bitcoin treasury strategies among other corporations. The top 100 public companies now collectively own 964,314 BTC, much of it financed through capital raises that follow the MSTR playbook.

 Corporate Ether holdings surged to $13 billion as ETH's price broke $4,300, with BitMine, SharpLink and The Ether Machine leading the charge. 

The total Ether held by companies with crypto treasuries has risen to 3.04 million ETH, worth $13 billion, as the cryptocurrency's price surged past $4,300.

On Monday, Ether (ETH) climbed to $4,332, surging by 20.4% in the last seven days, according to CoinGecko. At the time of writing, ETH had dropped slightly and was sitting at $4,290. The ETH rally is fueled by companies increasing their holdings in the last 30 days. 

BitMine Immersion Technologies, which tops the list of ETH treasury holders, boosted its holdings to 833,100 ETH, a 410.68% jump in the amount of ETH it holds over the past 30 days. 

SharpLink Gaming followed with 521,900 ETH after boosting its treasury by 141.69% in the same time period, while The Ether Machine has grown its stack by 8.01% to 345,400 ETH. 

These three entities accounted for more than half of the ETH held by the top 10 ETH treasury companies, which had a combined 2.63 million ETH, about 2.63% of the asset's total supply. 

The week's price surge pushed the value of corporate ETH holdings sharply higher.  

Last Monday, BitMine bought 208,137 ETH, putting its holdings at 833,100 ETH. At the time, the assets were worth about $2.9 billion as ETH hovered around $3,700. 

With ETH trading at around $4,300, BitMine's holdings are now worth over $3.58 billion, making it the first company to hold more than $3 billion in ETH. 

On Tuesday, digital asset investment firm SharpLink boosted its holdings to 521,900 ETH after an 83,562 ETH purchase. 

At the time, SharpLink's holdings were worth about $1.91 billion. With ETH's prices surging past $4,300, the company's ETH is now worth over $2.23 billion. 

ETH treasury data tracker Strategic ETH Reserve (SER) showed that SharpLink Gaming has over $671 million in unrealized gains from its Ether investments.

On Aug. 3, The Ether Machine bought 15,000 ETH, coinciding with Ethereum's 10th anniversary. According to SER data, it added another 10,600 ETH to its treasury on Sunday. It now holds 345,362 ETH worth almost $1.5 billion, keeping it in the top three by holdings.

Apart from the top companies, smaller purchases were also made last week. On Friday, the HashKey exchange announced that Hong Kong-listed IVD Medical purchased HK$149 million (about $19 million) in ETH from the trading platform. However, the actual ETH amount was not disclosed. 

Overall, SER data shows that 64 treasury companies that hold ETH have a total of 3.04 million ETH, worth over $13 billion at current market prices.

 Tether and Rumble have offered to acquire all shares of AI infrastructure operator Northern Data in a $1.17 billion deal that would make Tether Rumble's top shareholder. 

Tether and Rumble proposed to jointly acquire all Northern Data shares, taking full control of the artificial intelligence infrastructure company.

According to a Monday Rumble announcement, the deal would build on Northern Data's existing AI and high-performance computing (HPC) operations. Tether, the issuer of the USDt (USDT) stablecoin and already Northern Data's largest shareholder, would support the transaction. Tether has hinted at future collaborations involving AI, peer-to-peer communications and data storage solutions.

Tether is the centerpiece connecting every company involved in the potential deal, with the firm investing $775 million in the anti-censorship YouTube alternative Rumble at the end of 2024. The two firms deepened their collaboration in May, when Rumble announced its USDT-supporting Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoin wallet.

The company has indicated plans to sell the mining unit to focus on AI and HPC. Proceeds from the sale would be reinvested in those areas.  

If the deal goes through, each Northern Data shareholder is expected to receive 2.319 newly issued Class A Rumble shares for each Northern Data share offered. This would lead to about 33.3% of Rumble ownership being ceded to Northern Data shareholders.

Based on Rumble's closing price of $7.88 on Friday, the offer values Northern Data shares at $18.27, or about $1.17 billion in total.

The deal is also subject to adjustment for the potential sale of Bitcoin mining unit Peak Mining. “Following completion of the Potential Offer, Tether is expected to become the single largest holder of Rumble's Class A common stock,” the announcement said.

Tether would also amend the current loan to Northern Data to provide “sufficient financial headway for the acquired business.” Tether issued 575 million euros ($610 million) in debt financing to the company in late 2023.

 Bitcoin surged above $122,000, within 1% of its all-time high, following last week's pro-crypto White House executive order and three strong days of Bitcoin ETF inflows. 

The price of Bitcoin shot above $122,000 on Monday, building on momentum from a bullish executive order in Washington and three straight days of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund inflows to close out last week.

Henrik Andersson, chief investment officer of Apollo Crypto, said the move was overdue following a month of consolidation.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared over 3.3% to $122,150 in the early hours of Monday morning, moving it within striking distance of its $123,000 all-time high, TradingView data showed. 

“Bitcoin has been stuck in a low-volatility band between $115,000 and $120,000 despite all the good news,” Andersson told Cointelegraph.

While no clear catalyst appears to be behind Bitcoin's sudden two-hour climb, US President Donald Trump's executive order to allow cryptocurrency in 401(k) retirement plans was seen as a boost for the industry. 

The order is significant as it may open another $9 trillion of funds to flow into Bitcoin and the broader crypto industry.

There's also more Bitcoin buying on the horizon. Michael Saylor on Sunday hinted on X that Strategy will add more Bitcoin to its $76.8 billion stash, stating: “If you don't stop buying Bitcoin, you won't stop making Money.”

Bitcoin ETF issuers also scooped up a combined $773 million worth of Bitcoin to close out the last three trading days last week, Farside Investors data shows.

Despite the rally, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index score is still in the “Greed” zone at 70 out of 100, indicating that social market sentiment isn't too overheated, for now.

While Bitcoin was still trading below $120,000 when the score updated on Monday, it only marked a one-point increase from Sunday.

Meanwhile, Google search interest for Bitcoin has only risen modestly in the last week, scoring 48 out of 100 relative to the highest point over the last 12 months. That point occurred during Nov. 10-16, a week after Trump won the US election.

Bitcoin's rise above $122,000 also helped it make up for lost distance on Ether (ETH) of late, which has increased 1.8% over the last 24 hours compared to BTC's 3.3%.

ETH has risen nearly threefold from $1,435 on April 9 to $4,315 at the time of writing, TradingView data showed.

BTC and ETH's price rallies also pushed the total crypto market cap to $4.14 trillion on Monday, setting a new all-time high, CoinGecko data showed.

 Ethereum's market capitalization currently sits at $523 billion, overtaking global payment cards company Mastercard. 

An unidentified entity has been accumulating Ether (ETH) aggressively over the past week, buying 221,166 ETH as the asset rallied by 21%. 

In the past 24 hours alone, the “mysterious institution” bought $212 million of Ether, according to data analytics platform Lookonchain.

The whale tracker said the entity is using six different wallets to store its Ether, which it acquired from Galaxy Digital, FalconX and BitGo. The wallet with the most Ether has $181 million worth, while the wallet with the least Ether has $128 million worth.

The buying comes as Ether addresses with over 10,000 ETH in holdings reached 868,886 on Saturday, the highest it's been in a year, according to Glassnode.

It came as Ethereum's market capitalization soared to $523 billion on Monday, boosted by a 21% rally in Ether over the past seven days to cross the $4,000 milestone. It was trading at $4,332 at publication.

Ether's market cap overtook payments giant Mastercard, which currently has a market capitalization of $519 billion, according to CompaniesMarketCap.

More than 304,000 ETH, worth over $1.3 billion, was added by publicly traded companies that have Ether treasuries in the past week, CoinGecko reported on Saturday.

BitMine Immersion Technologies bought the lion's share of ETH, as the company bought more than 208,000 ETH, worth more than $900 million,  in the past week, which was followed by SharpLink Gaming buying $303 million worth of Ether.

Technical analysts have also turned bullish on Ether, with some predicting that the asset might reach as high as the $20,000 mark for the first time in the coming months.

Analyst Nilesh Verma said that ETH can hit the $20,000 milestone in the next six to eight months based on historical price fractals.

Meanwhile, Merlijn The Trader, a technical analyst, predicted that the asset might surpass $20,000 and may even go beyond that mark.

On the flip side, some industry experts are cautioning investors.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin supported companies that are buying Ether to hold in their respective treasuries; however, he cautioned that it should not turn into an “overleveraged game,” which could lead to the downfall of the asset.

Pessimistic Dogs Are Better at Smelling Cancer—And Other Keys to Disease-Sniffing Success

New research is revealing how disease-smelling dogs can excel

By Rohini Subrahmanyam edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Individual dogs' personalities, and how we interpret their behaviors, may be key to disease sniffing at scale.

Billy, a floppy-eared little beagle, darts around a platform sniffing a series of holes. Each hole contains a used surgical-type mask bearing a different human's distinct mix of scents. But her sharp nose is hunting for just one such combination: the one that signals cancer.

Cancer can change a person's “volatilome,” the unique set of volatile organic compounds found in breath, sweat, blood and urine. Billy and her cohort have learned to sniff out these subtle scent cues in masks worn by people with cancer diagnoses. Researchers are also studying how dogs can detect diseases such as COVID and malaria, as well as psychological conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder.

Scientists discovered dogs' powerful disease-smelling skills in 1989, when a dog detected cancer in its handler. But clinicians still do not routinely use dogs for diagnosis. Besides the obvious logistical challenges, dogs vary greatly in their olfactory accuracy. Researchers are increasingly finding that disease-sniffing prowess may come down to individual dogs' personality—and how well their handlers know them. New research efforts are focused on figuring out which dogs would be best for the job and on interpreting dogs' behaviors during a smell test.

Sharyn Bistre Dabbah, a veterinary scientist now at the University of Bristol in England, set out with colleagues at the U.K. charity Medical Detection Dogs to learn how the animals' personalities—especially their level of optimism or pessimism—affect disease-detection skills. Their results appeared recently in PLoS One.

The researchers first showed the dogs what lay behind two screens at one end of a room: a “positive” location with a tasty treat and a “negative” one with an empty bowl. On subsequent visits to the room, the dogs typically bounded happily toward the former but trotted very slowly when they went to check out the latter—or simply didn't go there at all.

The scientists then placed bowls behind two new screens between the positive and negative spots, and they classified the dogs as “optimistic” or “pessimistic” based on how quickly they investigated these new locations.

Next, the team evaluated how accurately each dog could pick out a disease scent it was trained to detect among other smells. On average, the pessimistic dogs turned out to be more discerning. Pessimistic dogs are more cautious, and “a more cautious dog might be better at not making mistakes,” Dabbah says.

Other personality traits also play a role, says Clara Wilson, who researches disease- and stress-sniffing dogs at the University of Pennsylvania. Dogs that enjoy the thrill of a hunt—and thrive while searching for missing people or hidden bombs—might find sniffing through disease samples again and again rather repetitive. “We want a dog that doesn't get frustrated. They [should] find it rewarding, even though it may be less exciting,” Wilson explains.

Handlers' interpretations of dog behavior can also skew detection outcomes, says Akash Kulgod, co-founder of Dognosis, the Bengaluru-based start-up that trained Billy. Instead of teaching dogs to perform a specific behavior such as sitting or barking when they pick up an assigned scent—a process that takes extra time and can lead to dogs “lying” for treats—Kulgod and his team directly analyze each dog's natural body language. Based on how confidently the dogs move, as analyzed with computer vision–based machine-learning tools, the team can spot successful detections. “One of our dogs sniffs and then very confidently somersaults to go to the feeder,” Kulgod says. “They each have their own unique quirks—but all of it can be quantified because it's all related to this reward expectation that you have from the past sessions.”

In a pilot study with 200 test samples involving 10 cancer types, presented at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology conference, Dognosis dogs detected 96 percent of cancers. Next, the Dognosis team will scale up its study with 1,500 test samples.

Doctors currently diagnose many kinds of cancers by using a combination of blood tests and biopsies. Researchers are always on the lookout for less invasive methods—including options directly involving our canine companions, as well as electronic noses inspired by them. Dogs can currently outperform electronic sniffers. But this primacy may not last, according to Andreas Mershin, chief science officer at the Boston-based start-up RealNose.ai. He and his colleagues are developing electronic noses to sniff urine samples for prostate cancer and other diseases. If machine olfaction eventually surpasses dogs' abilities, it could help tackle the scalability problem—and give the animals a break.

Mershin's team put mammalian smell receptors on an electronic chip and used machine-learning algorithms to interpret the output. The technique focuses on broader patterns among detected molecules rather than categorizing them individually.

Dogs don't tick off a list of molecules in their heads, either; they just “know” what cancer smells like. This helps them to sense it accurately no matter which organ it is from or what the patient ate before giving their breath sample. “The dogs can generalize. They don't care about the font in which you write the scent; they just interpret it correctly,” Mershin says.

In a study published in PLoS One, Mershin and his team used machine-learning models to spot and analyze patterns of different odorants in urine samples from confirmed prostate cancer patients. Their findings, which built on work with diagnosis data from Medical Detection Dogs, suggest that focusing on this type of “scent character” might work as a scalable alternative to dogs, even if it's currently much slower.

Meanwhile, back on the test platform, floppy-eared Billy quickly detects the subtle scent of cancer in one of the masks she has been sniffing—and confidently bounds back to get her reward. Such tests show strong potential, says postdoctoral researcher Amritha Mallikarjun of the University of Pennsylvania: “The dogs, because of their amazing sense of smell and detection capabilities, are demonstrating to us what technology could look like 10 to 15 years from now.”

Deep-Sea Desalination Pulls Drinking Water from the Depths

Companies are experimenting with deep-sea tech to produce cheaper fresh water

From Cape Town to Tehran to Lima to Phoenix, dozens of cities across the globe have experienced water shortages recently. And in the next five years the world's demand for fresh water could significantly outpace supply, according to a United Nations forecast. Now several companies are turning to an unexpected source for a solution: the bottom of the ocean.

Called subsea desalination, the idea is to remove the salt from water in the deep sea. If it worked at scale, the technology could greatly alleviate the world's water access problems.

Costs and energy requirements have kept desalination from going mainstream in most of the world. Early desalination involved boiling seawater and condensing the steam, a purely thermal method that used loads of energy. This approach was later replaced by multistage flash distillation, in which temperature and pressure “flash” salt water to steam. In the past 25 years reverse osmosis has become more common—it uses high pressure to push seawater through a membrane with holes so small that only water molecules squeeze through, leaving salt behind.

Reverse osmosis is more efficient than distillation, but it takes a lot of energy to pressurize millions of gallons of seawater and move it through filters. What if we could let that movement happen naturally by harnessing the pressure hundreds of meters underwater?

That's the idea behind subsea desalination. Reverse osmosis pods are submerged to depths of around 500 meters (1,600 feet), where immense hydrostatic pressure does the heavy lifting of separating water from salt. Purified water is then pumped back to shore. Far-fetched as it may sound, there are multiple prototypes already at work; the companies behind them aim to take cheap, large-scale desalination from pipe dream to reality.

One of these companies is Oslo-based Flocean. Its founder and CEO, Alexander Fuglesang, says there's no revolutionary new technology behind his business; it's “essentially a subsea pump cleverly coupled to existing membrane and filter technology,” he says. What's new is the energy savings—Flocean uses 40 to 50 percent less energy than conventional plants—and modular systems that can be deployed to many deep-sea location without bespoke engineering.

The seafloor has other benefits, too. This region harbors fewer bacteria and other microorganisms than at shallower depths, and there is little local variation in temperature or pressure. “The deep sea is really predictable,” Fuglesang says. “It's the same 365 days a year.” This isn't the case at land-based plants, which have to deal with algae blooms, river runoff, storms and seasonal temperature changes. Plus, less chemical pretreatment of the water is needed at depth, and because the equipment is all underwater, there's no “not in my backyard” controversy over putting big, unsightly infrastructure near the seashore.

Despite its advantages over land-based plants, subsea desalination has several hurdles to clear before scaling to commercial levels. For starters, it's still too expensive. Land-based desalination is several times more costly than pulling water from aquifers or lakes, even at giga-plants in the Middle East that benefit from abundant solar power and large economies of scale. Even if subsea technology cuts the cost of land-based desalination down by 40 percent, it will still be a pricey way to obtain potable water.

“We need to remember that once the water is desalinated, it still needs to be pumped up from depths of up to 600 meters,” says Nidal Hilal, founding director of New York University's Water Research Center in Abu Dhabi, who has studied water-treatment engineering for more than 30 years. “Early pilot tests show promise, but the technology has yet to be proven at large scale.”

Affordable renewable energy will make subsea desalination more viable. Improvements in technology will also help. Hilal's research group, for example, is developing electrically conductive reverse osmosis membranes that keep themselves clean by repelling salt ions and impurities. They would extend maintenance intervals, which Fuglesang says might be two to three years with existing membranes.

Although proponents of the technology say it would have little effect on undersea life, others urge further research to gauge its impact on marine ecosystems. “Many organisms thrive at a 500-meter depth,” says Adina Paytan, a professor affiliated with the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The twilight zone—which extends from 200 to 1,000 meters below the surface—is not only home to organisms such as whales, squid and jellyfish. “It's extremely important for many ocean processes such as the carbon cycle and nutrient cycling,” Paytan says. Companies will need to ensure that their water intake and salty brine by-product don't harm marine life or significantly alter these processes.

Given the depths required, subsea desalination won't work in just any seaside location. “Many coastal cities lie on wide continental shelves, meaning deep water is far offshore,” Hilal says. Coastlines with steep drop-offs are ideal because shallow shelves would require long pipelines, adding to capital and operational costs.

Fuglesang isn't worried about technical or engineering hurdles; he says the industry's biggest challenge will be aligning customers, governments and financial partners. Flocean is working on what will be the world's first large-scale subsea desalination plant, off the coast of Norway, and has a contract to start supplying water to an industrial facility in 2026. Netherlands-based Waterise has also secured its first industrial customer, with plans to start building a plant in the Red Sea's Gulf of Aqaba later this year, and Bay Area–based OceanWell is testing its prototype near Los Angeles.

Long-term government contracts will most likely be needed for subsea desalination to really take off, and they may prove elusive. “The water-infrastructure industry is quite conservative,” Fuglesang says, noting that because new projects are so expensive, “nobody wants to be first” to go all-in on a new technology.

Hilal says he believes subsea desalination could go mainstream and supply water to entire cities. But, he adds, “reaching true city-scale will take time, conceivably a decade or more.”

Humans are one step closer to traveling at faster-than-light speeds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In a surprising paper, scientists say they've nailed down a physical model for a warp drive, which flies in the face of what we've long thought about the crazy concept of warp speed travel: that it requires exotic, negative forces.

To best understand what the breakthrough means, you'll need a quick crash course on the far-out idea of traveling through folded space. 

The colloquial term “warp drive” comes from science fiction, most famously Star Trek. The faster-​than-light warp drive of the Federation works by colliding matter and antimatter and converting the explosive energy to propulsion. Star Trek suggests that this extraordinary power alone pushes the ship at faster-than-light speeds. 

Scientists have been studying and theorizing about faster-than-light space travel for decades. One major reason for our interest is pure pragmatism: without warp drive, we're probably never making it to a neighboring star system. The closest such trip is still four years long at light speed.

Our current understanding of warp speed dates back to 1994, when a now-iconic theoretical physicist named Miguel Alcubierre first proposed what we've called the Alcubierre drive ever since.

The Alcubierre drive conforms to Einstein's theory of general relativity to achieve superluminal travel. “By a purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it,” Alcubierre wrote in his paper's abstract, “motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible.”

Essentially, an Alcubierre drive would expend a tremendous amount of energy—likely more than what's available within the universe—to contract and twist space-time in front of it and create a bubble. Inside that bubble would be an inertial reference frame where explorers would feel no proper acceleration. The rules of physics would still apply within the bubble, but the ship would be localized outside of space.

It might help to think of an Alcubierre drive like the classic “tablecloth and dishes” party trick: The spaceship sits atop the tablecloth of spacetime, the drive pulls the fabric around it, and the ship is situated in a new place relative to the fabric. 

Alcubierre describes spacetime expanding on one side of the ship and contracting on the other, thanks to that enormous amount of energy and a requisite amount of exotic matter—in this case, negative energy. 

Some scientists have criticized the Alcubierre drive, however, because it requires too much mass and negative energy for humans to ever seriously construct a warp-based propulsion system. NASA has been trying to build a physical warp drive through Eagleworks Laboratories for most of the last decade, but hasn't yet made any significant strides.

This brings us to the new study, which scientists in the Advanced Propulsion Laboratory (APL) at Applied Physics just published in the peer-reviewed journal Classical and Quantum Gravity. In the report, the APL team unveils the world's first model for a physical warp drive—one that doesn't require negative energy.

The study is understandably pretty thick (read the whole thing here), but here's the gist of the model: Where the existing paradigm uses negative energy—exotic matter that doesn't exist and can't be generated within our current understanding of the universe—this new concept uses floating bubbles of spacetime rather than floating ships in spacetime.

The physical model uses almost none of the negative energy and capitalizes on the idea that spacetime bubbles can behave almost however they like. And, the APL scientists say, this isn't even the only other way warp speed could work. Making a model that's at least physically comprehensible is a big step. 

Plus, Alcubierre himself has endorsed the new model, which is like having Albert Einstein show up to your introductory physics class. 

Here's a helpful video in which Sabine Hossenfelder, a Professor and Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, breaks down the findings:

Of course, there's one gigantic caveat here: The concept in this paper is still in the “far future” zone of possibility, made of ideas that scientists still don't know how to construct in any sense. 

“While the mass requirements needed for such modifications are still enormous at present,” the APL scientists write, “our work suggests a method of constructing such objects based on fully understood laws of physics.”

But while a physical drive may not be a reality today, tomorrow, or even a century from now—let's hope it's not that long—with this exciting new model, warp speed travel is now a lot more likely in a much shorter timespan than we previously thought.

Scientists have simultaneously broken a temperature record, overturned a long-held theory and utilized a new laser spectroscopy method for dense plasmas in a groundbreaking article published on July 23 in the journal Nature.

In their research article, ""Superheating gold beyond the predicted entropy catastrophe threshold,"" physicists revealed they were able to heat gold to over 19,000 Kelvin (33,740 degrees Fahrenheit), over 14 times its melting point, without it losing its solid, crystalline structure.

""This is possibly the hottest crystalline material ever recorded,"" Thomas White, lead author and Clemons-Magee Endowed Professor in Physics at the University of Nevada, Reno said.

This result overturns the long-held theoretical limit known as the entropy catastrophe. The entropy catastrophe theory states that solids cannot remain stable above approximately three times their melting temperature without spontaneously melting. The melting point of gold, 1,337 Kelvin (1,947 degrees Fahrenheit), was far more than tripled in this experiment utilizing an extremely powerful laser at Stanford University's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.

""I was expecting the gold to heat quite significantly before melting, but I wasn't expecting a fourteen-fold temperature increase,"" White said.

To heat the gold, researchers at the University of Nevada, Reno, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, the University of Oxford, Queen's University Belfast, the European XFEL and the University of Warwick designed an experiment to heat a thin gold foil using a laser fired for 50 quadrillionths of a second (one millionth of a billionth). The speed with which the gold was heated seems to be the reason the gold remained solid. The findings suggest that the limit of superheating solids may be far higher - or nonexistent - if heating occurs quickly enough. The new methods used in this study open the field of high energy density physics to more exploration, including in areas of planetary physics and fusion energy research.

White and his team expected that the gold would melt at its melting point, but to measure the temperature inside the gold foil, they would need a very special thermometer.

""We used the Linac Coherent Light Source, a 3-kilometer-long X-ray laser at SLAC, as essentially the world's largest thermometer,"" White said. ""This allowed us to measure the temperature inside the dense plasma for the first time, something that hasn't been possible before.""

""I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to contribute to such cutting-edge science using billion-dollar experimental platforms alongside world-class collaborators."" -- Doctoral student Travis Griffin

""This development paves the way for temperature diagnostics across a broad range of high-energy-density environments,"" Bob Nagler, staff scientist at SLAC and coauthor on the paper, said. ""In particular, it offers the only direct method currently available for probing the temperature of warm dense states encountered during the implosion phase of inertial fusion energy experiments. As such, it is poised to make a transformative contribution to our understanding and control of fusion-relevant plasma conditions.""

Along with the experimental designers, the research article is the result of a decade of work and collaboration between Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Padova and the University of California, Merced.

""It's extremely exciting to have these results out in the world, and I'm really looking forward to seeing what strides we can make in the field with these new methods,"" White said.

The research, funded by the National Nuclear Security Administration, will open new doors in studies of superheated materials.

""The National Nuclear Security Administrations' Academics Program is a proud supporter of the groundbreaking innovation and continued learning that Dr. White and his team are leading for furthering future critical research areas beneficial to the Nuclear Security Enterprise,"" Jahleel Hudson, director at the Techology and Partnerships Office of the NNSA said.

White and his colleagues returned to the Linac Coherent Light Source in July to measure the temperature inside hot compressed iron and are using those results to gain insights into the interiors of planets.

Several of White's graduate students and one undergraduate student were coauthors on the study, including doctoral student Travis Griffin, undergraduate student Hunter Stramel, Daniel Haden, a former postdoctoral scholar in White's lab, Jacob Molina, a former undergraduate student currently pursuing his doctoral degree at Princeton University and Landon Morrison, a former undergraduate student pursuing his master's degree at the University of Oxford. Jeremy Iratcabal, research assistant professor in the Department of Physics, was also a coauthor on the paper.

""I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to contribute to such cutting-edge science using billion-dollar experimental platforms alongside world-class collaborators,"" Griffin said. ""This discovery highlights the power of this technique, and I'm excited by the possibilities it opens for the future of high-energy-density physics and fusion research. After graduation, I'll be continuing this work as a staff scientist at the European XFEL.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists capture the secret quantum dance of atoms for the first time","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250810093242.htm","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 05:31:34 GMT","

Most of us find it difficult to grasp the quantum world: According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, it's like observing a dance without being able to see simultaneously exactly where someone is dancing and how fast they're moving - you always must choose to focus on one. And yet, this quantum dance is far from chaotic; the dancers follow a strict choreography. In molecules, this strange behavior has another consequence: Even if a molecule should be completely frozen at absolute zero, it never truly comes to rest. The atoms it is made of perform a constant, never-ending quiet dance driven by so-called zero-point energy.

First direct measurement of correlated zero-point motion 

For a long time, these patterned zero-point movements were considered impossible to measure directly. However, scientists at Goethe University Frankfurt and partner institutions have now succeeded in doing precisely that at the world's largest X-ray laser, the European XFEL in Hamburg, Germany. They captured the ""dance of the atoms"" by shining a ""spotlight"" on individual molecules and taking snapshots of their atoms - revealing each atom's precise choreography.

Professor Till Jahnke from the Institute for Nuclear Physics at Goethe University Frankfurt and the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg explains: ""The exciting thing about our work is that we were able to see that the atoms don't just vibrate individually, but that they vibrate in a coupled manner, following fixed patterns. We directly measured this behavior for the first time in individual medium-sized molecules that were also in their lowest energy state. This zero-point motion is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon that cannot be explained classically."" Instead of choreography, physicists speak of vibrational modes. While the motion patterns of molecules with two or three atoms are fairly easy to follow, it quickly becomes complex with medium-sized molecules - like the studied iodopyridine, which consists of eleven atoms. Iodopyridine features a whole repertoire of 27 different vibrational modes - from ballet to tango to folk dance.

""This experiment has a long history,"" says Jahnke. ""We originally collected the data in 2019 during a measurement campaign led by Rebecca Boll at the European XFEL, which had an entirely different goal. It wasn't until two years later that we realized we were actually seeing signs of zero-point motion. The breakthrough came through collaboration with our colleagues from theoretical physics from the Center for Free-Electron Laser Science in Hamburg. Benoît Richard and Ludger Inhester, in particular, came up with new analysis methods that elevated our data interpretation to an entirely new level. Looking back, many puzzle pieces had to come together perfectly.""

Explosion reveals molecular structure

But how can you capture an image of dancing particles? Using a technique called Coulomb Explosion Imaging, molecules are triggered to undergo a controlled explosion by ultrashort, high-intensity X-ray laser pulses, allowing high-resolution images of their structure to be generated. The X-ray pulse knocks many electrons out of the molecule, causing the atoms - now positively charged - to repel each other and fly apart in a fraction of a trillionth of a second. The fragments are recorded by a special apparatus that measures their time and position of impact, enabling the reconstruction of the molecule's original structure. This COLTRIMS reaction microscope has been developed over the past decades by Goethe University's Atomic Physics group. A version tailored specifically to the European XFEL was built by Dr. Gregor Kastirke during his PhD work. Seeing the device in action is something special, Kastirke says: ""Witnessing such groundbreaking results makes me feel a little proud. After all, they only come about through years of preparation and close teamwork.""

New insights into the quantum world 

The results provide entirely new insights into quantum phenomena. For the first time, researchers can directly observe the complex patterns of zero-point motion in more complex molecules. These findings demonstrate the potential of the Frankfurt-developed COLTRIMS reaction microscope. ""We're constantly improving our method and are already planning the next experiments,"" says Jahnke. ""Our goal is to go beyond the dance of atoms and observe in addition the dance of electrons - a choreography that is significantly faster and also influenced by atomic motion. With our apparatus, we can gradually create real short films of molecular processes - something that was once unimaginable.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Accidental lab discovery reveals gold's secret chemistry","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250810094401.htm","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 12:21:51 GMT","

Serendipitously and for the first time, an international research team led by scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory formed solid binary gold hydride, a compound made exclusively of gold and hydrogen atoms.

The researchers were studying how long it takes hydrocarbons, compounds made of carbon and hydrogen, to form diamonds under extremely high pressure and heat. In their experiments at the European XFEL (X-ray Free-Electron Laser) in Germany, the team studied the effect of those extreme conditions in hydrocarbon samples with an embedded gold foil, which was meant to absorb the X-rays and heat the weakly absorbing hydrocarbons. To their surprise, they not only saw the formation of diamonds, but also discovered the formation of gold hydride.

""It was unexpected because gold is typically chemically very boring and unreactive -- that's why we use it as an X-ray absorber in these experiments,"" said Mungo Frost, staff scientist at SLAC who led the study. ""These results suggest there's potentially a lot of new chemistry to be discovered at extreme conditions where the effects of temperature and pressure start competing with conventional chemistry, and you can form these exotic compounds.""

The results, published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition, provide a glimpse of how the rules of chemistry change under extreme conditions like those found inside certain planets or hydrogen-fusing stars.

Studying dense hydrogen

In their experiment, the researchers first squeezed their hydrocarbon samples to pressures greater than those within Earth's mantle using a diamond anvil cell. Then, they heated the samples to over 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit by hitting them repeatedly with X-ray pulses from the European XFEL. The team recorded and analyzed how the X-rays scattered off the samples, which allowed them to resolve the structural transformations within.

As expected, the recorded scattering patterns showed that the carbon atoms had formed a diamond structure. But the team also saw unexpected signals that were due to hydrogen atoms reacting with the gold foil to form gold hydride.

Under the extreme conditions created in the study, the researchers found hydrogen to be in a dense, ""superionic"" state, where the hydrogen atoms flowed freely through the gold's rigid atomic lattice, increasing the conductivity of the gold hydride.

Hydrogen, which is the lightest element of the periodic table, is tricky to study with X-rays because it scatters X-rays only weakly. Here, however, the superionic hydrogen interacted with the much heavier gold atoms, and the team was able to observe hydrogen's impact on how the gold lattice scattered X-rays. ""We can use the gold lattice as a witness for what the hydrogen is doing,"" Mungo said.

The gold hydride offers a way to study dense atomic hydrogen under conditions that might also apply to other situations that are experimentally not directly accessible. For example, dense hydrogen makes up the interiors of certain planets, so studying it in the lab could teach us more about those foreign worlds. It could also provide new insights into nuclear fusion processes inside stars like our sun and help develop technology to harness fusion energy here on Earth.

Exploring new chemistry 

In addition to paving the way for studies of dense hydrogen, the research also offers an avenue for exploring new chemistry. Gold, which is commonly regarded as an unreactive metal, was found to form a stable hydride at extremely high pressure and temperature. In fact, it appears to be only stable at those extreme conditions as when it cools down, the gold and hydrogen separate. The simulations also showed that more hydrogen could fit in the gold lattice at higher pressure.

The simulation framework could also be extended beyond gold hydride. ""It's important that we can experimentally produce and model these states under these extreme conditions,"" said Siegfried Glenzer, High Energy Density Division director and professor for photon science at SLAC and the study's principal investigator. ""These simulation tools could be applied to model other exotic material properties in extreme conditions.""

The team also included researchers from Rostock University, DESY, European XFEL, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Frankfurt University and Bayreuth University, all in Germany; the University of Edinburgh, UK; the Carnegie Institution for Science, Stanford University and the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Sciences (SIMES). Parts of this work were supported by the DOE Office of Science.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","What scientists discovered about french fries and diabetes","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250811104201.htm","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:19:51 GMT","

Eating three servings of French fries a week is associated with a 20% increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but eating similar amounts of potatoes cooked in other ways -- boiled, baked or mashed -- does not substantially increase the risk, finds a study published by The BMJ on August 6.

What's more, replacing any form of potatoes with whole grains was associated with a lower type 2 diabetes risk, but swapping them for white rice was linked to an increased risk, the results show.

Potatoes contain several nutrients including fiber, vitamin C, and magnesium, but they also have a high starch content and therefore a high glycemic index, so have been linked to a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

But neither the preparation method for potatoes nor specific foods that potatoes would replace have been considered, both of which are key to evaluating the overall health impact of potatoes.

To address this, researchers investigated the association between intake of potatoes prepared by different methods (boiled, baked, or mashed versus French fries) and risk of type 2 diabetes. They also looked at the impact on health of replacing potatoes with other major carbohydrates, such as whole grains and rice.

Their findings are based on more than 205,000 health professionals from three large US studies carried out between 1984 and 2021. Participants were free of diabetes, heart disease or cancer and completed detailed food questionnaires every four years.

During almost 40 years of follow up, 22,299 people were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.

After adjusting for lifestyle and dietary factors related to diabetes risk, the researchers found that for every three weekly servings of total potato, the rate of type 2 diabetes increased by 5% and for every three weekly servings of French fries, the rate increased by 20%. However, similar intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes was not associated with a significantly increased risk.

Replacing three weekly servings of total potato with whole grains lowered the type 2 diabetes rate by 8%. Substituting baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with whole grains lowered the rate by 4%, and replacing French fries lowered the rate by 19%.

In contrast, replacing total potatoes or baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with white rice was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.

This is an observational study so no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect and the researchers can't rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results. Most participants were also health professionals of European ancestry, so findings may not apply to other populations.

Nevertheless, they conclude: ""Our findings underscore that the association between potato intake and type 2 diabetes risk depends on the specific foods used as replacement. The findings also align with current dietary recommendations that promote the inclusion of whole grains as part of a healthy diet for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.""

So, are potatoes back on the plate? Well, it depends, say researchers in a linked editorial, who note that it is important to consider preparation method and replacement food when guiding the public or informing policy.

They point out that with their relatively low environmental impact and their health impact, baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes can be part of a healthy and sustainable diet, though whole grains should remain a priority, but say future studies from more diverse populations that account for both preparation methods and substitution analysis are needed.

The efficiency of quantum computers, sensors and other applications often relies on the properties of electrons, including how they are spinning. One of the most accurate systems for high performance quantum applications relies on tapping into the spin properties of electrons of atoms trapped in a gas, but these systems are difficult to scale up for use in larger quantum devices like quantum computers. Now, a team of researchers from Penn State and Colorado State has demonstrated how a gold cluster can mimic these gaseous, trapped atoms, allowing scientists to take advantage of these spin properties in a system that can be easily scaled up.

""For the first time, we show that gold nanoclusters have the same key spin properties as the current state-of-the-art methods for quantum information systems,"" said Ken Knappenberger, department head and professor of chemistry in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and leader of the research team. ""Excitingly, we can also manipulate an important property called spin polarization in these clusters, which is usually fixed in a material. These clusters can be easily synthesized in relatively large quantities, making this work a promising proof-of-concept that gold clusters could be used to support a variety of quantum applications.""

Two papers describing the gold clusters and confirming their spin properties appeared in ACS Central Science, ACS Central Science and The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters.

""An electron's spin not only influences important chemical reactions, but also quantum applications like computation and sensing,"" said Nate Smith, graduate student in chemistry in the Penn State Eberly College of Science and first author of one of the papers. ""The direction an electron spins and its alignment with respect to other electrons in the system can directly impact the accuracy and longevity of quantum information systems.""

Much like the Earth spins around its axis, which is tilted with respect to the sun, an electron can spin around its axis, which can be tilted with respect to its nucleus. But unlike Earth, an electron can spin clockwise or counterclockwise. When many electrons in a material are spinning in the same direction and their tilts are aligned, the electrons are considered correlated, and the material is said to have a high degree of spin polarization.

""Materials with electrons that are highly correlated, with a high degree of spin polarization, can maintain this correlation for a much longer time, and thus remain accurate for much longer,"" Smith said.

The current state-of-the-art system for high accuracy and low error in quantum information systems involve trapped atomic ions -- atoms with an electric charge -- in a gaseous state. This system allows electrons to be excited to different energy levels, called Rydberg states, which have very specific spin polarizations that can last for a long period of time. It also allows for the superposition of electrons, with electrons existing in multiple states simultaneously until they are measured, which is a key property for quantum systems.

""These trapped gaseous ions are by nature dilute, which makes them very difficult to scale up,"" Knappenberger said. ""The condensed phase required for a solid material, by definition, packs atoms together, losing that dilute nature. So, scaling up provides all the right electronic ingredients, but these systems become very sensitive to interference from the environment. The environment basically scrambles all the information that you encoded into the system, so the rate of error becomes very high. In this study, we found that gold clusters can mimic all the best properties of the trapped gaseous ions with the benefit of scalability.""

Scientists have heavily studied gold nanostructures for their potential use in optical technology, sensing, therapeutics and to speed up chemical reactions, but less is known about their magnetic and spin-dependent properties. In the current studies, the researchers specifically explored monolayer-protected clusters, which have a core of gold and are surrounded by other molecules called ligands. The researchers can precisely control the construction of these clusters and can synthesize relatively large amounts at one time.

""These clusters are referred to as super atoms, because their electronic character is like that of an atom, and now we know their spin properties are also similar,"" Smith said. ""We identified 19 distinguishable and unique Rydberg-like spin-polarized states that mimic the super-positions that we could do in the trapped, gas-phase dilute ions. This means the clusters have the key properties needed to carry out spin-based operations.""

The researchers determined the spin polarization of the gold clusters using a similar method used with traditional atoms. While one type of gold cluster had 7% spin polarization, a cluster with different a ligand approached 40% spin polarization, which Knappenberger said is competitive with some of the leading two-dimensional quantum materials.

""This tells us that the spin properties of the electron are intimately related to the vibrations of the ligands,"" Knappenberger said. ""Traditionally, quantum materials have a fixed value of spin polarization that cannot be significantly changed, but our results suggest we can modify the ligand of these gold clusters to tune this property widely.""

The research team plans to explore how different structures within the ligands impact spin polarization and how they could be manipulated to fine tune spin properties.

""The quantum field is generally dominated by researchers in physics and materials science, and here we see the opportunity for chemists to use our synthesis skills to design materials with tunable results,"" Knappenberger said. ""This is a new frontier in quantum information science.""

In addition to Smith and Knappenberger, the research team includes Juniper Foxley, graduate student in chemistry at Penn State; Patrick Herbert, who earned a doctoral degree in chemistry at Penn State in 2019; Jane Knappenberger, researcher in the Penn State Eberly College of Science; as well as Marcus Tofanelli and Christopher Ackerson at Colorado State

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists freeze quantum motion without cooling","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/08/250810093239.htm","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 05:21:09 GMT","

What are the limits of quantum physics? This is a question that has been researched around the world for decades. If we want to make the properties of the quantum world technically usable, we need to understand whether objects that are significantly larger than atoms and molecules can also exhibit quantum phenomena.

For example, small glass spheres with a diameter of one hundred nanometers can be examined - still over a thousand times smaller than a grain of sand, but huge by quantum standards. For years, attempts have been made to show the extent to which such spheres still exhibit quantum properties. A research group at ETH Zurich, with theoretical support from TU Wien (Vienna), has now achieved a breakthrough: they were able to show that the rotational vibrations of such particles behave in accordance with quantum physics, not only when they are cooled to near absolute zero using complex cooling methods, but even at room temperature.

Vibration quanta: only certain wobbles are allowed

""A microscopic particle will always wobble a little,"" says Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero from the Institute of Theoretical Physics at TU Wien. ""This oscillation depends on the temperature and on how the particle is influenced by its environment.""

In everyday life, we assume that any kind of oscillation is possible. The pendulum of a clock, for example, can be swung to any angle, and it can be set into oscillation a little more strongly or a little more weakly - just as you like. In the quantum world, however, things are different: if you look at oscillations with very low energy, you find that there are very specific ""oscillation quanta.""

There is a minimum vibration, known as the ""ground state,"" a slightly higher vibration that carries a little more energy (the ""first excited state""), and so on. There is no state in between, but the particle can exist in a quantum physical combination of different vibration states - this is one of the central concepts of quantum physics.

""It is very difficult to put a nanoparticle into a state where its quantum properties become apparent,"" says Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero. ""You have to let the particle float in order to isolate it from any interference as much as possible. And normally you also have to ensure extremely low temperatures, close to absolute zero, which is minus 273.15 degrees Celsius.""

The rotation freezes, the particle remains hot

ETH Zurich and TU Wien have now developed a technique that allows a very specific aspect of the nanoparticle to be brought into a quantum physical state, even though the particle itself is in a hot, disordered state.

'We use a nanoparticle that is not perfectly round, but slightly elliptical,' explains Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero. ""When you hold such a particle in an electromagnetic field, it starts to rotate. Our question was: Can we see the quantum properties of this rotational vibration? Can we extract energy from this rotational movement until it is mainly in the quantum ground state?'

Laser beams and mirror systems were used for this purpose. 'The laser can either supply energy to the nanoparticle or take energy away from it,"" explains Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero. 'By adjusting the mirrors in a suitable way, you can ensure that energy is extracted with a high probability and only added with a low probability. The energy of the rotational movement thus decreases until we approach the quantum ground state.'

To achieve this, however, a number of difficult theoretical problems had to be solved - the quantum noise of the lasers had to be correctly understood and controlled.

Record-breaking quantum purity

Finally, it was actually possible to demonstrate that the rotation can be brought into a state that corresponds almost exclusively to the quantum mechanical ground state. The amazing thing about this is that the nanoparticle has not cooled down - on the contrary, it is actually several hundred degrees hot.

""You have to consider different degrees of freedom separately,"" explains Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero. ""This allows the energy of the rotational movement to be reduced very effectively without having to reduce the internal thermal energy of the nanoparticle at the same time. Amazingly, the rotation can freeze, so to speak, even though the particle itself has a high temperature.""

This made it possible to create a state that is significantly 'purer' in terms of quantum physics than was previously possible with similar particles - even though cooling was not required. ""This is a technically astonishingly practical way of pushing the boundaries of quantum physics,"" says Carlos Gonzalez-Ballestero. ""We can now study the quantum properties of objects in a stable and reliable way, which was previously hardly possible.""

Cellular immunity, mediated by tumor antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, has a critical role in the success of cancer immunotherapy by targeting intracellular driver and passenger tumor mutations. We present the final results of the phase 1 AMPLIFY-201 trial, in which patients who completed standard locoregional treatment, with minimal residual mKRAS disease (n = 25, 20 pancreatic cancer and 5 colorectal cancer), received monotherapy vaccination with lymph node-targeting ELI-002 2P, including mutant KRAS (mKRAS) amphiphile-peptide antigens (G12D, G12R) and amphiphile-adjuvant CpG-7909. At a median follow-up of 19.7 months, efficacy correlated with mKRAS-specific T cell responses above or below a threshold 9.17-fold increase over baseline, with median radiographic relapse-free survival not reached, versus 3.02 months (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.12, P = 0.0002) and median overall survival not reached versus 15.98 months (HR = 0.23, P = 0.0099). Seventy-one percent of evaluable patients induced both CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, with sustained immunogenicity. Following ELI-002 2P treatment, antigen spreading was observed in 67% of patients, with increased T cells reactive to personalized, tumor antigens absent from the ELI-002 2P vaccine. Therefore, lymph node-targeting amphiphile vaccination induces persistent T cell responses targeting oncogenic driver KRAS mutations, alongside personalized, tumor antigen-specific T cells, which may correlate to clinical outcomes in pancreatic and colorectal cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT04853017.

Tumor-promoting driver mutations in KRAS occur in approximately 20–25% of human tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC) (50%) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) (93%). Despite curative intent, relapses are common following standard locoregional therapy, particularly for resectable PDAC. Subsequent elevated ctDNA or serum tumor antigen defines a biomarker-relapsed, minimal residual disease (MRD+) patient group at high risk for radiographic progression1,2. Further treatment following disease relapse/recurrence is primarily palliative and noncurative in intent (5-year survival = 23.3%3). Mutations in KRAS are attractive public neoantigens for immunotherapy due to their prevalence, truncal status and essential driver function. Growing evidence of mKRAS recognition by diverse human HLA alleles4,5,6 suggests that many patients could benefit from an effective off-the-shelf mKRAS-specific therapeutic vaccine. Recent analysis found T cells specific to G12D and/or G12V in 20/20 (100%) of healthy donors evaluated across a diverse HLA background, suggesting that the majority of patients include mKRAS-specific TCRs within their immune repertoire6. However, vaccination with conventional immunogens, including relatively small (<20 kDa) peptide antigens and molecular adjuvants, results in poor accumulation in lymph nodes where uptake by antigen-presenting cells programs adaptive immunity7. Conversely, chemical modification with albumin-binding lipid moieties facilitates delivery of amphiphile vaccines from peripheral injection sites to lymph nodes via size-dependent lymphatic transport by endogenous albumin (~65 kDa), resulting in improved antigen-specific T cell responses8.

We previously reported the safety, immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity observed in a dose escalation phase 1 trial9. Patients received ELI-002 2P, including lymph node-targeted amphiphile mKRAS G12D-specific and G12R-specific, 18-mer peptide antigens, designed to be processed into HLA class I and HLA class II epitopes. These immunizing peptide antigens were co-administered with an amphiphile-adjuvant CpG-7909 in 25 patients with surgically resected stage I-IV PDAC (n = 20) and CRC (n = 5) who had no evidence of disease on imaging but had detectable MRD+ (ctDNA positive in n = 13/25, CA19-9 and/or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) criteria in n = 7/25, or both n = 5/25; Extended Data Fig. 1 and Extended Data Table 1). Preliminary results at the initial time of data cutoff (6 September 2023; median cohort follow-up time 8.5 months) showed that monotherapy treatment with ELI-002 2P-induced potent mKRAS-directed T cell responses in 21/25 (84%) of the participants, including both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 59%. T cell responses above the median 12.75-fold increase from baseline significantly correlated with improved tumor biomarker response and relapse-free survival (RFS)9. Herein we update post hoc analyses of immunogenicity and clinical outcomes with more than double the follow-up time to demonstrate that ELI-002 2P-induced T cell responses are potent, sustained and continue to correlate with freedom from relapse and death. Immune responses included sustained mKRAS-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets exhibiting favorable effector cytokine function, cytotoxic markers and memory phenotype, as well as antigen spreading to personalized tumor antigens beyond the immunizing antigens.

At a median follow-up of 19.7 months for the cohort (data cutoff: 24 September 2024), no new safety signals were identified in the primary endpoint assessment. The exploratory endpoints of radiographic RFS and overall survival (OS) were reassessed. At extended follow-up, the n = 25 cohort median OS was 28.94 months (Fig. 1a). The median RFS was maintained at 16.33 months (Fig. 1b). Analysis of the PDAC subset indicated that mRFS (15.31 months) and mOS (28.94 months) were similar to those observed for the whole cohort (Extended Data Fig. 2). Study visits were concluded for AMPLIFY-201 in August 2024.

To assess the potential impact of mKRAS-specific T cell responses on clinical outcomes (OS and radiographic RFS), an exploratory receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) analysis was conducted10. While prior supervision was performed empirically using the median9, we identified a T cell fold-change threshold of 9.17 that optimally separated patients with better (n = 17, 68%) and worse (n = 8, 32%) outcomes, as determined by ROC analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3). As observed previously, the strength of ELI-002 2P-induced mKRAS-specific T cell response was correlated to tumor biomarker response (Fig. 1c), with patients exhibiting T cell response fold change above the 9.17 threshold universally achieving biomarker reductions, including six of six (100%) patients achieving complete ctDNA clearance. Presence or absence of radiographic progression or death (radiographic RFS) was also significantly associated with T cell response (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Table 1)—among the 17 patients with T cell responses above the 9.17 threshold, 11 (65%) were free from radiographic progression, including 5 who remained free of relapse and did not receive any subsequent therapy following ELI-002 2P; 6 (35%) patients received subsequent chemotherapy following tumor biomarker increase yet remained free from disease progression throughout follow-up. As three of six patients who remained free from radiographic progression received subsequent therapy, including immune checkpoint inhibition, following biomarker progression, it will be essential to evaluate these combinations prospectively in future trials. Although subsequent chemotherapy has the potential to negatively impact expanding tumor-specific T cells, prior use of sequential vaccination and chemotherapy regimens has shown that vaccine-induced T cell responses can be maintained following cytotoxic therapy11,12. The current data suggest that anti-mKRAS T cell induction may synergize with subsequent treatment to enable unexpectedly positive outcomes. In contrast to patients with T cell responses above the 9.17 threshold, radiographic progression was observed for all eight patients below the T cell threshold, and seven of eight (88%) died. This is consistent with an approximate threefold increase in risk of radiographic progression/death in the below threshold group (relative risk = 2.96), further suggesting that sufficient cellular immunity to driver mKRAS oncogenes may confer durable benefit. Moreover, the median OS of patients with above-threshold T cell responses was not reached, compared to 15.98 months (Fig. 1e; hazard ratio (HR) = 0.23, P = 0.0099). Finally, the median RFS was not reached compared to 3.02 months for patients with T cell fold change above or below the threshold (Fig. 1f; HR = 0.12, P = 0.0002). This was consistent with updated analysis of radiographic RFS and OS supervised by the prior 12.75 median T cell fold change (Extended Data Fig. 4). The high proportion of patients with above-threshold T cell responses who remained without radiographic evidence of disease following subsequent therapy for biochemical progression (6/11, 55%) suggests that vaccination with ELI-002 or early treatment at the time of biochemical progression may be important strategies to evaluate in future prospective trials.

At extended follow-up, 84% (21/25) of patients generated mKRAS-specific T cell responses following ELI-002 2P immunization with 100% responders at the two highest dose levels (5.0, 10.0 mg of adjuvant Amph-CpG-7909). The median response was 13.38-fold over baseline for all patients; however, 17 patients exhibited responses above the ROC threshold of 9.17-fold (Fig. 2a–c). Fifty-seven percent of patients induced responses to all seven mKRAS antigens evaluated (Fig. 2d). Seventy-one percent of patients induced both CD4+ and CD8+ mKRAS-specific T cells and the induction of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells significantly correlated with overall tumor biomarker response, indicating the potential importance of a balanced T cell response for improved tumor biomarker response (Fig. 2e,f). All 12 patients who induced both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells had T cell responses above the 9.17 threshold, suggesting an association between these biomarkers (Extended Data Table 2). ELI-002 2P vaccination amplified mKRAS-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting granzyme B and perforin, indicating cytolytic potential; 68% (13/19) of patients induced granzyme B and perforin secreting mKRAS-specific CD4+ T cells after vaccination with predominant central and effector memory phenotype (Extended Data Fig. 5). Likewise, 84% (16/19) of patients had cytotoxic mKRAS-specific CD8+ T cells, substantially composed of TEMRA memory cells (Extended Data Fig. 6). ELI-002 2P-induced mKRAS-specific T cells were persistent before and after booster vaccination with seven of eight (88%) evaluable patients maintaining elevated T cell responses relative to baseline levels following booster vaccinations (Fig. 2g). Furthermore, postboost, long-lived mKRAS-specific CD4+ T cells showed significantly increased central memory phenotype compared to baseline with associated decreases in the naive subset (Fig. 2h). Although not required in the AMPLIFY-201 study, collection of tumor tissue at the time of progression in future studies will allow for assessment of the tumor-immune microenvironment, which may elucidate potential mechanisms of resistance. Finally, antigen spreading was assessed to examine the potential for ELI-002 2P to promote the expansion of immune responses targeting personalized tumor neoantigens not present in the vaccine. Nonimmunizing antigens from each patient's personal tumor mutanome were selected for peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) immunogenicity assessment directly ex vivo. T cell responses targeting nonvaccine tumor neoantigens were significantly expanded from baseline levels in 67% (6/9) of the tested patients (Fig. 2i,j). Overall, 13 of 52 (25%) evaluated neoantigens showed increased T cell responses, including examples of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as expansion of pre-existing, baseline-detectable responses or de novo expansion. Furthermore, five of six (83%) patients with positive antigen-spreading responses had mKRAS T cell counts above the ROC threshold, suggesting that robust mKRAS-specific T cell induction may be associated with diversification of the tumor-directed T cell response. Future assessment of larger patient groups will be critical to defining the potential contribution of antigen spreading to clinical outcomes.

Recently, multiple examples of next-generation therapeutic cancer vaccination have demonstrated promise in early phase and randomized clinical studies12,13,14,15. Innovative trial designs have focused on the adjuvant setting, where tumor burden is low, potentially allowing for robust and durable T cell responses to provide long-term protection from recurrence and death. Historically, PDAC has previously been considered a poor setting for immunotherapy; however, the favorable results from ELI-002 2P are consistent with the long-term follow-up of adjuvant patients with PDAC who received personalized mRNA vaccination in combination with atezolizumab and adjuvant mFOLFIRINOX12. In the long-term follow-up of ELI-002 2P treatment, mKRAS-specific T cell responses above a 9.17-fold threshold were significantly correlated to freedom from radiographic progression and death (radiographic RFS HR = 0.12, P = 0.0002; OS HR = 0.23, P = 0.0099). Outcomes in the PDAC subset, with a median radiographic RFS of 15.31 months and a median OS of 28.94 months, are notable given the historically rapid progression of patients with PDAC who have ctDNA+ MRD-relapse postsurgery, with a median radiographic RFS/DFS of 5.0–6.37 months and a median OS of 17.0 months12,16. Limitations of the study include the small sample size, nonrandomized design and that the median follow-up of the cohort is shorter than the median OS, suggesting that this estimate may continue to mature. Additionally, while the relatively small sample size and lack of an external validation cohort are limitations for the ROC analysis as performed, the subgroups were relatively well balanced for tumor type, tumor stage, prior therapies and baseline MRD characteristics (Extended Data Table 3). Notably, all five patients with G12R tumor mutations had T cell responses above the 9.17 threshold. Prior studies in PDAC have observed favorable clinical outcomes as well as decreased PDL1 expression for G12R17,18. This factor, together with potentially increased immunogenicity, may in part explain the more favorable clinical outcomes of PDAC patients with this mKRAS variant.

ELI-002 2P-induced mKRAS-specific T cell responses obtained in the monotherapy setting were observed in 100% of patients treated at the RP2D (adjuvant Amph-CpG-7909 was dose escalated), included both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and were sustained throughout the follow-up period, including development of memory and maintenance of critical antitumor effector functions. In the majority of T cell responders (17/21), T cell responses were observed against the specific tumor antigen detected at the time of enrollment. Analysis of tumor-specific T cell response and antigen spreading among larger patient groups, and with additional serial PBMC samples, will be helpful to further understand the instances where responses to the tumor antigen identified during screening were not observed. Additional longitudinal data will be useful to inform whether long-term dosing may augment cellular immunity. In addition to expanded T cells targeting mKRAS driver mutations, treatment with ELI-002 2P frequently led to antigen spreading, with ex vivo-detectable expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeting additional personalized tumor neoantigens similar to those discretely targeted by personalized vaccination. These are consistent with prior observations of antigen spreading following amphiphile vaccination19,20,21 suggesting a role for lymph node immune activation as a mechanism supporting the development of tumor-specific T cells in situ.

Taken together, the long-term follow-up of the AMPLIFY-201 phase 1 study provides evidence that ELI-002 2P induces potent, polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell immunity to mKRAS alongside frequent antigen spreading that may delay tumor recurrence. A randomized phase 2 study (NCT05726864) of a seven-peptide formulation (ELI-002 7P—KRAS/NRAS G12D, R, V, S, A, C and G13D) is ongoing in the adjuvant setting of PDAC. Beyond PDAC, off-the-shelf availability of ELI-002 supports broad development for various mKRAS-expressing tumor types. In conclusion, our observations support continued study of amphiphile lymph node-targeted immunotherapy for solid tumors.

A phase 1, multicenter, open-label, first-in-human trial of ELI-002 2P monotherapy was conducted in five ascending dose cohorts at seven centers in the United States between 4 October 2021 and 24 September 2024 (the clinical cutoff date for the results presented here). A fixed dose of Amph-Peptides 2P (G12D and G12R, 0.7 mg each) was administered with escalating doses of 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg Amph-CpG-7909 adjuvant. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had mKRAS G12D-mutated or G12R-mutated pancreatic or colorectal cancers and were at high risk for relapse because of the presence of MRD (indicated by ctDNA-positivity or elevated serum CA19-9 and/or CEA). Clinical data was entered into Medidata Rave 2018.2.4. Additional details are provided in the study protocol (Supplementary Data 1).

At two institutions, City of Hope and the University of Colorado School of Medicine, central institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained from WIRB Copernicus IRB. Local IRB approvals were provided for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's IRB, the University of Texas MD Anderson (Office of Human Subject Protection), the University of Iowa (Human Subjects Office/IRB), Northwell Health (Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health IRB), the University of California, Los Angeles (Office of the Human Research Protection Program) and Massachusetts General Hospital (Dana–Farber Cancer Institute Office for Human Research Studies). The US Food and Drug Administration approved the study, which was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04853017).

We enrolled adult (≥18 years old) patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 with pathologically confirmed mKRAS (G12D or G12R) PDAC or CRC, who were MRD+ with either (1) absolute CA19-9 ≥ 90 U ml−1 or CEA ≥ 15 ng ml−1 or (2) successively rising values (≥1 week apart) in either CA19-9 or CEA not attributable to a noncancer condition, such as pancreatitis, peritonitis, postoperative leak/fistula or biliary obstruction. Patients had recovered from prior surgery, chemotherapy or radiation without ongoing medical/surgical issues and were willing to use effective methods to avoid pregnancy and provided written informed consent. Baseline absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 109 l−1, platelets ≥100 × 109 l−1, normal range liver function tests, serum creatinine <1.5 (or if serum creatinine was ≥1.5 mg dl−1, creatinine clearance calculated by the Cockcroft–Gault formula ≥60 ml min−1 was acceptable), albumin ≥2.5 g dl−1 and IL6 <500 pg ml−1 were required.

PDAC patients had high risk tumor stages I, II, III or stage IV oligometastatic disease per current American Joint Committee on Cancer criteria with no evidence of disease on current imaging (equivocal radiographic findings such as subcentimeter lesions or potential resolving soft tissue changes after surgery were accepted), prior treatment with standard chemotherapy/chemoradiation administered in the neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting, and complete tumor resection (R0 or R1 pathologic margins), with focal use of intraoperative irreversible electroporation permitted.

CRC patients had high risk stage II (T4N0), stage III (T4N1-2/TanyN2) or stage IV oligometastatic disease per current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria, prior cytotoxic chemotherapy administered in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting, or as total neoadjuvant therapy, and complete surgical resection (R0 or R1 pathologic margins), with focal use of intraoperative irreversible electroporation permitted.

We excluded patients who received antitumor therapy within 4 weeks, who had history of brain metastasis, other malignancies within the last 3 years (except for adequately treated carcinoma of the cervix, bladder, prostate, basal or squamous cell skin cancer), were receiving immunosuppressive drugs, those with serious comorbid illness including uncontrolled infection, class III or IV (New York Heart Association) cardiac failure, myocardial infarction within 6 months, active seizure disorders, autoimmune diseases or interstitial lung disease if requiring systemic steroids, pulse oximetry <92% on room air, prior organ transplants, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, hepatitis C (unless they had a sustained virologic response to direct-acting antiviral therapy) and those in the first two weeks of SARS-CoV-2. Women were excluded if pregnant or lactating. PDAC patients were excluded when tumors were of neuroendocrine subtype, or when there was a germline BRCA 1/2 mutation; CRC patients were excluded when tumors were mismatch repair defective (MSI+).

Treatment was divided into a ‘prime immunization series' (six subcutaneous doses of ELI-002 2P over 8 weeks), a 3-month ‘no dosing period' (observation) and a ‘booster immunization series' (4 weekly doses of ELI-002 2P). A follow-up period of up to 2 years was included after the first dose of ELI-002 2P to monitor safety and efficacy.

The study was sponsored and designed by Elicio Therapeutics in collaboration with the academic authors. The study and analyses were conducted in accordance with the general principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Council for Harmonization. The trial protocol, amendments and supporting documents were approved by the local/central institutional review board for each study site, the US Food and Drug Administration and were registered on Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04853017). All patients provided written informed consent.

A safety and monitoring committee was convened to review safety and determine dose escalation and cohort expansion decisions. Cohorts ranged from three to six patients with expansions allowed after the first three patients completed 28 days without dose-limiting toxicity and when additional eligible patients had been identified.

All the authors affirm that the trial was conducted in accordance with the study protocol and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data. All the authors reviewed and revised the manuscript and made the decision to submit it for publication.

The initial protocol (version 1.0) was approved on 13 July 2020. Key protocol amendments are as follows: Amendment 2 (version 3.0) was approved on 23 February 2021 and included changes requested by the US Food and Drug Administration. This was the initial protocol for initiating the study. On 8 April 2022, Amendment 4 (version 5.0) was approved and added serum tumor biomarkers (that is, CEA and CA19-9) to the MRD eligibility along with ctDNA. Amendment 5 (version 6.0), approved on 2 August 2022, added language regarding pseudo-progression and continued ELI-002 dosing. Amendment 6 (version 7.0) was approved on 25 January 2023 and added language for public record search for OS. Amendment 7 (version 8.0) was approved on 7 August 2023 and added another year of follow-up to collect additional RFS and OS.

Primary endpoints of the study were safety (adverse events were graded per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0), tolerability and determination of the RP2D. Secondary and exploratory endpoints include tumor biomarker reduction and clearance defined through assessment of ctDNA and/or serum tumor antigens (CA19-9 or CEA), radiographic relapse-free survival, defined as the time from initiation of ELI-002 treatment until confirmed radiographic progression using iRECIST criteria, and OS, and immunogenicity.

PBMCs for immunogenicity analysis were processed from leukapheresis (baseline, week 9) or whole-blood collections (all other timepoints). Patient PBMCs were processed by the Ficoll-Hypaque gradient protocol for leukapheresis samples or cell processing tubes (BD) for whole-blood samples. PBMCs were resuspended in CS10 freezing media (Cryostor), frozen in aliquots of 10–20 million cells per cryovial and stored in a temperature-monitored liquid nitrogen vapor phase freezer. Only PBMCs collected before subsequent therapy are included in datasets and graphs, with the exception of the long-term duration graphs (Fig. 2g,h). The maximum T cell response was determined as the maximum fold change from baseline to any postvaccination timepoint in either the ‘Ex vivo FluoroSpot assay' or ‘Ex vivo ICS assay' for any of the seven mKRAS antigens or a pool of all seven antigens combined. Figure 2a includes data from all T cell responders (n = 21/25). Figure 2b contains data from all responders with FluoroSpot data (n = 19/25) while Fig. 2c contains data from all responders with ICS data (n = 17/25). Figure 2g contains data from all patients with booster doses that had responses in FluoroSpot assay (n = 8) while Fig. 2h contains data from the boosted patients in Fig. 2g that were also tested for memory markers in the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay (n = 6/8).

A direct IFNγ/granzyme B (GrB) FluoroSpot assay was performed on thawed PBMCs. Cryopreserved PBMCs were thawed in 10% human AB serum/RPMI media + Benzonase and rested overnight at 37 °C. Precoated human IFNγ/GrB FluoroSpot plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with AIM-V media for at least 30 min (MabTech). The 2 × 105 rested PBMCs were plated into each well and stimulated for 44 h as per the manufacturer's instructions with seven individual mKRAS peptide pools and a WT peptide pool. Each pool consisted of a KRAS 18-mer peptide along with the corresponding 9-mer and 10-mer overlapping peptides (OLPs), at a concentration of 2 µg per peptide per ml. No exogenous cytokines were added to the PBMCs during this assay. All samples were plated in triplicate. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the negative control (background wells) and anti-CD3 (MabTech) was used as the positive control. The plate was developed based on the manufacturer's instructions. Plates were scanned and counted using the IRIS plate reader (MabTech) using the FITC and Cy3 filters. Data are background subtracted, averaged per triplicate measurements and normalized to 1 × 106 PBMCs. A postvaccination sample was characterized as positive if it was at least 2 s.d. above the DMSO negative control. A responder in the FluoroSpot assay was defined as a patient with a ≥2-fold increase from baseline at any postvaccination timepoint and more than the minimum threshold of 50 total IFNγ and GrB spot-forming cells per 1 × 106 PBMCs.

A direct ICS assay for IL2, IFNγ and TNF was performed by flow cytometry. PBMCs were thawed and rested overnight. In total, 106 PBMCs per well were plated and stimulated for 17 h at 37 °C with individual mKRAS peptide pools at 2 μg ml−1 per peptide (Supplementary Table 1). GolgiStop and GolgiPlug (BD) were also added to each well. The next day, cells were surface stained with antibodies against CD4 (BV421—clone, SK3; BD, 566907; 2.5 μl per well), CD8 (BV786—clone, RPA-T8; BD, 563823; 1:25), CD45RA (Alexa 700—clone, HI100; BioLegend, 304120; 1:25), CCR7 (PE-CF594—clone, 15053; BD, 562381; 1:12.5), Aqua Live/Dead marker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L34966; 0.5 μl per well) and dump markers CD14 (PE-Cy5—clone, 61D3; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15-0149-42; 1:200), CD16 (PE-Cy5—clone, 3G8; BioLegend, 302010; 1:200), and CD19 (PE-Cy5—clone, SJ25C1; BioLegend, 363042; 1:100). Cells were subsequently fixed with CytoFix/CytoPerm (BD) and further stained with antibodies against CD3 (APC-H7—clone, SK7; BD, 560176; 2.5 μl per well), IFNγ (FITC—clone, Mab11; BioLegend, 506504; 1:200), TNF (BV711—clone, B27; BioLegend, 502940; 1:50) and IL2 (BV650—clone, MQ1-17H12; BioLegend, 500334; 1:50). Cells fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde were acquired on a BD FACSymphony and data were analyzed with BD FlowJo V10 software (gating progression and example plots in Supplementary Fig. 1). A responder in the ICS assay was defined as a patient having ≥2-fold increase in total IFNγ, IL2 and TNF from baseline at any postvaccination timepoint, along with a cytokine+ T cell frequency of ≥0.1%.

Some patients were also tested in an extended ‘Ex vivo ICS assay' that included additional activation and cytotoxic markers. The extended ‘Ex vivo ICS assay' was set up using the same methods as above, with the addition of CD107a (Alexa Fluor 700—clone, H4A3; BD, 561340; 1.25 μl per well) during the 17 h stimulation. The next day, cells were surface stained with antibodies against CD8 (BUV805—clone, SK1, BD, 612889), CD45RA (PE-Cy7—clone, HI100; BD, 560675), CCR7 (BUV615—clone, 3D12; BD, 562381), Aqua Live/Dead marker (Thermo Fisher Scientific, L34966; 0.5 μl per well) and dump markers CD14 (PE-Cy5—clone, 61D3; Thermo Fisher Scientific, 15-0149-42; 1:400), CD16 (PE-Cy5—clone, 3G8; BioLegend, 302010; 1:100) and CD19 (PE-Cy5—clone, SJ25C1; BioLegend, 363042; 1:100). Cells were subsequently fixed with the FoxP3/transcription factor staining buffer set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and further stained with antibodies against CD3 (APC-H7—clone, SK7; BD, 560176; 1:40), CD4 (BUV496—clone, SK3; BD, 612936; 1:40), IFNγ (BB700—clone, B27; BD, 566394; 1:80), TNF (BV750—clone, MAb11; BioLegend, 502940; 1:80), IL2 (BV421—clone, MQ1-17H12; BD, 564164; 1:40), granzyme B (FITC—clone, GB11; BD, 560211; 1:40), perforin (PE—clone, B-D48; BioLegend, 353304; 1;80), CD137 (BUV661—clone, 4B4-1; BD, 741642; 1;80), CD154 (BUV563—clone, TRAP-1; BD, 748984; 1:80), CD69 (BV711—clone, FN50; BD, 563836; 1:160), Ki67 (BV650—clone, B56; BD, 563757; 1;80) and FoxP3 (PE/Dazzle 594—clone, 206D; BioLegend, 320126; 1:160).

Comprehensive genomic profiling, whole-exome sequencing (WES), was performed to determine whether the patient's tumor harbored at least one of the two mKRAS alleles targeted by the ELI-002 2P (G12D or G12R). The Natera Signatera ctDNA test evaluated for the presence or absence of circulating tumor DNA. WES was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples with at least 20% tumor content confirmed by a pathologist under the Central Lab Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists guidelines. Genomic DNA was extracted from the patient's normal (whole blood) and tumor tissue. Libraries of tumor and matched germline DNA were prepared and exomic regions were captured. The assay was performed by target enrichment of the isolated DNA, followed by 440× coverage sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 or NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina). Somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) that were present in the tumor and absent in the germline were identified. A proprietary Natera algorithm selected a set of 16 SNVs to maximize the detectability of tumor DNA if present in plasma. Polymerase chain reaction primers targeting the 16 personalized SNVs were designed and synthesized to be used to identify and track ctDNA in a patient's plasma. Cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma and analyzed using a multiplexed personalized polymerase chain reaction assay. Plasma samples with ≥2 SNVs detected above a predefined confidence threshold were deemed ctDNA+, and ctDNA concentration was reported as mean tumor molecules per milliliter of plasma. In patients without adequate tumor tissue, a plasma-based ctDNA assay for mKRAS variants was performed using Sysmex SafeSEQ RAS-RAF. Cell-free DNA was isolated from plasma and a next-generation sequencing-based assay that evaluated K/NRAS to detect SNVs was performed using NextSeq 550 (Illumina). The ctDNA concentration was reported as the number of mutant molecules per variant and the mutant allele frequency. Local testing was permitted if already available to confirm mKRAS status. Serum tumor biomarkers, CA19-9 and CEA, were analyzed by the local laboratories at each study site.

To assess for antigen spreading, PBMCs were stimulated in the ‘Ex vivo FluoroSpot assay' and ‘Ex vivo ICS assay' as above, with neoantigens not included in the ELI-002 2P vaccine. Genomic DNA is extracted from the patient's normal and tumor samples using next-generation sequencing WES. Using the WES data for each patient, somatic single-nucleotide mutations present in the tumor and absent in the germline genomic DNA were identified using a validated bioinformatics tool (GEM ExTra pipeline NG2-LDT 1.14.0; Natera). The reference genome assembly used for alignment is NCBI GRCh37. Stop-gain and start-loss mutations were excluded. Up to ten neoantigens were randomly selected from the list of somatic SNVs generated by WES for each tested patient for antigen spreading testing. An algorithm was not used to select these neoantigens. First, an 18-mer was designed (generally with the mutation centered in the middle) and then Genscript synthesized two 15-mers overlapping by 11 to cover the mutated 18-mer (18-mer sequences found in Supplementary Table 1).

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic, medical history and safety data. Continuous variables were summarized using mean, s.d., median, minimum value and maximum value. Categorical variables were summarized using frequency counts and percentages. Clinical efficacy outcomes, such as tumor biomarker reduction or clearance, were examined for association with categorical variables, including high versus low T cell response, using the Mann–Whitney test. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the survival distributions. The log-rank test was used to compare the RFS between the high and low T cell responders and the ROC analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. SAS v9.4 and R v4.4.3 were used to create Fig. 1 and Extended Data Figs. 2–4 and perform statistical analysis. GraphPad Prism v9.4 was used to create Figs. 1 and 2 and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6 and perform statistical analysis.

Many brain disorders involve mitochondrial alterations, but owing to the lack of suitable tools, the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in pathophysiological processes is difficult to establish. Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding (G) proteins are key regulators of cell functions, and they can be found within mitochondria. Therefore, we reasoned that the activation of stimulatory mitochondrial G proteins (Gs) could rapidly promote the activity of the organelle and possibly compensate for bioenergetic dysfunction. Here, we show that a mitochondria-targeted recombinant designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (mitoDREADD-Gs) can acutely trigger intramitochondrial signaling to increase mitochondrial membrane potential and oxygen consumption. In vivo activation of mitoDREADD-Gs abolished memory alterations in cannabinoid-treated mice and in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. Thus, mitoDREADD-Gs enables the establishment of causal relationships between mitochondria and biological or disease-related processes and represents an innovative potential therapeutic approach for disorders associated with mitochondrial impairment.

Insulin signalling is a central regulator of metabolism, orchestrating nutrient homeostasis and coordinating carbohydrate, protein and lipid metabolism. This network operates through dynamic, tightly regulated protein phosphorylation events involving key kinases such as AKT, shaping cellular responses with remarkable precision. Advances in phosphoproteomics have expanded our understanding of insulin signalling, revealing its intricate regulation and links to disease, particularly cardiometabolic disease. Major insights, such as the mechanisms of AKT activation and the influence of genetic and environmental factors, have emerged from studying this network. In this Review, we examine the architecture of insulin signalling, focusing on its precise temporal regulation. We highlight AKT's central role in insulin action and its vast substrate repertoire, which governs diverse cellular functions. Additionally, we explore feedback and crosstalk mechanisms, such as insulin receptor substrate protein signalling, which integrates inputs through phosphorylation at hundreds of distinct sites. Crucially, phosphoproteomics has uncovered complexities in insulin-resistant states, where network rewiring is characterized by disrupted phosphorylation and the emergence of novel sites that are absent in healthy cells. These insights redefine insulin signalling and its dysfunction, highlighting new therapeutic opportunities.

Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) relies on a network of molecular chaperones that facilitates the folding and maturation of client proteins. How the ER chaperones organize in a supramolecular manner to exert their cooperativity has, however, remained unclear. Here we report the discovery of a multichaperone condensate in the ER lumen, which is formed around the chaperone PDIA6 during protein folding homeostasis. The condensates form in a Ca2+-dependent manner and we resolve the underlying mechanism at the atomic and cellular levels. The PDIA6 condensates recruit further chaperones—Hsp70 BiP, J-domain protein ERdj3, disulfide isomerase PDIA1 and Hsp90 Grp94—which constitute some of the essential components of the early folding machinery. The chaperone condensates enhance folding of proteins, such as proinsulin, and prevent protein misfolding in the ER lumen. The PDIA6-scaffolded chaperone condensates hence provide the functional basis for spatial and temporal coordination of the dynamic ER chaperone network.

One-third of eukaryotic proteins are processed within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to obtain their correct structure1,2,3. This function is ensured by a network of molecular chaperones that recognizes client proteins and assists their folding4,5. A rate-limiting step in ER protein folding is the formation of disulfide bonds, and the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) chaperone family is therefore indispensable for folding homeostasis6,7. PDIs contain one or more catalytically active thioredoxin-like domains, which can reduce, oxidize or isomerize disulfide bonds in client proteins via a characteristic CXXC motif. They typically combine catalytically active and inactive domains towards multidomain architectures. Although all PDIs share common structural features, they differ in terms of client-protein specificity and affinity, chaperone activity and redox properties, resulting in specialized roles for individual family members8. One particular family member, PDIA6, caught our attention because its malfunction is connected to several human diseases including cancer and diabetes, yet its exact function remained elusive9,10,11,12.

We observed that endogenous PDIA6 localized as expected in the ER of human HeLa cells. Remarkably, however, the endogenous protein was not homogeneously dispersed but concentrated in well-defined clusters, both in wild-type (WT) cells as well as in PDIA6–Halo knock-in cells (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a–e). Overexpressed PDIA6 formed clusters of similar shape and localization in living cells, albeit with substantially increased size (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1f–i). PDIA6 formed similar clusters in HEK and U2OS cells (Extended Data Fig. 1j,k). The PDIA6 clusters were mobile within the ER and underwent fission and fusion events, and their fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) occurred within minutes (half life (t1/2) = 78 ± 14 s, diffusion coefficient (D) = 4 ± 1 × 10−3 μm2 s−1), a time scale that is common for biological phase-separated condensates13,14 (Fig. 1b–d, Extended Data Fig. 1l–n and Supplementary Videos 1–4). The PDIA6 condensates thus fulfil all hallmarks of biological phase separation15.

Attempts to delete the PDIA6 gene in human cells were unsuccessful, indicating that PDIA6 is an essential protein, consistent with earlier findings in Caenorhabditis elegans16. Intriguingly, PDIA6 malfunction has been reported to lead to an imbalance in ER folding homeostasis16,17. We thus wondered whether a functional coupling exists between ER stress and condensate formation. To create a physiological ER-stress situation, we overexpressed Akita proinsulin, a misfolded mutant of proinsulin that accumulates in the ER and thereby causes ER stress18. This led to homogenous dispersion of PDIA6 in the entire ER lumen (Extended Data Fig. 2a). Similarly, following treatment of the cells with the pharmacological ER-stress inducer tunicamycin, the PDIA6 condensates dispersed independently of the PDIA6 expression levels (Extended Data Fig. 2b–d). Notably, the stress-dependent condensate dissolution was reversible, as PDIA6 condensates reorganized after washout of the stressor (Fig. 1e,f). Two other stress inducers, thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid, induced the same effect (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 2e,f). Remarkably, however, the dissolution kinetics differed substantially between the compounds. PDIA6 condensates dissolved completely within 1 h following thapsigargin treatment, whereas dissolution was observed only after 6 h of tunicamycin treatment (Fig. 1g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2g). This kinetic difference correlates with the different modes of action of the two drugs. Thapsigargin blocks the sarco-/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pumps19, leading to an almost immediate Ca2+ depletion in the ER lumen, whereas tunicamycin inhibits N-glycosylation of newly synthesized proteins20 and causes a delayed drop in Ca2+ levels as a secondary effect of the accumulation of unfolded proteins21. Overall, the presence of PDIA6 condensates is thus coupled to protein homeostatic conditions and their dissolution in response to ER stress seems to be regulated by luminal Ca2+ levels.

To test this mechanistic hypothesis, we reconstituted droplets of purified recombinant PDIA6 protein in vitro. Homeostatic ER was mimicked by a high Ca2+ concentration, reducing conditions, physiological pH and a crowding agent. Under these conditions, recombinant PDIA6 reproducibly formed droplets that underwent fusion events and time-dependent growth in a time scale of seconds. The protein dynamically exchanged between the condensed and dispersed phase with similar kinetics as in vivo, as determined by FRAP experiments (t1/2 = 47 ± 18 s, D = 6 ± 2 × 10−3 μm2 s−1; Fig. 1i and Extended Data Fig. 3a–f). Droplets did not form when Ca2+ was replaced by another divalent ion, Mg2+, that is, their formation was Ca2+-specific. Importantly, the droplets formed only at Ca2+ concentrations above about 500 μM and the saturation concentration was independent of the protein concentration (Fig. 1j and Extended Data Fig. 3g). We determined the Ca2+ affinity of PDIA6 to be 420 ± 20 μM in vitro by quantifying the number of PDIA6 condensates as a function of Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 1k). Remarkably, this value corresponds to the physiological transition between protein folding homeostasis ([Ca2+]homeo ≈ 800 μM) and ER stress ([Ca2+]stress ≈ 100 μM)22, and therefore correlates very well with our observations in living cells. PDIA6 condensates are thus regulated by the Ca2+ concentration.

We then employed an integrated structural biology approach to resolve the structure and mechanism of PDIA6 condensate formation. PDIA6 consists of two catalytically active thioredoxin-like domains, domains a0 and a, which are followed by the inactive domain b of unknown function (Fig. 2a)23,24. To monitor conformational changes and interactions using NMR spectroscopy, we assigned 94% of the Metε, Leuδ2 and Valγ2 methyl groups and established near-complete amide backbone assignments (Extended Data Fig. 4). Through size-exclusion chromatography-multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) and nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy (NOESY) experiments, we found that PDIA6 dimerizes via helix α4 in domain a0 (Fig. 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a), in agreement with previous findings25. The dimerization interface was resolved by a methyl NOE network between residues L72 and L134 as well as between V75 and L131, L134 and L135, which corresponds to the arrangement observed in crystals of domain a0 (Protein Data Bank (PDB) identifier: 4ef0). The dimerization thus resulted from a carboxy-terminal extension of helix α4 in domain a0 by seven residues and contrasts the PDI family members PDIA1–5, which have shorter helices and are monomeric26 (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Dimerization occurred with a dissociation constant (KD) in the low nanomolar range (Extended Data Fig. 5d) and the dimer is therefore the dominant species at the physiological concentration of about 100 μM (refs. 27,28). We determined the crystal structure of domain b (residues 274–427), which adopts a thioredoxin-like fold, to a resolution of 1.8 Å (Extended Data Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Table 1).

Ca2+ ions are modelled based on calsequestrin (PDB: 5kn3; Extended Data Fig. 6d,e). Methyl groups with substantial loss in intensity in g are represented as spheres. Side chains of Ca2+ binding residues are shown as sticks.

The dimeric domain a0 is connected to domain a by a long positively charged linker, and domains a and b are connected by a short five-residue linker that presumably restricts the relative domain motions as it contains three conserved proline residues (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 5g,h). Domains a and b unfold cooperatively, suggesting that they are stabilized by interdomain interactions (Extended Data Fig. 5i). The C-terminal tail of PDIA6 (residues 420–440) is highly flexible and disordered, as evidenced by a narrow chemical shift dispersion and high NMR signal intensities (Fig. 2e). Combining the experimental data, we established a full atomic model of PDIA6 (Fig. 2f).

As PDIA6 condensate formation is Ca2+-dependent, we set out to determine PDIA6 Ca2+ binding sites. Titration of Ca2+ to PDIA6 did not lead to substantial changes in the methyl NMR spectra, demonstrating the absence of large structural rearrangements (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Titration of the paramagnetic analogue Gd3+, however, quenched NMR signals specifically in three structural regions, thus revealing three cation binding sites (I, II and III; Fig. 2g,h and Extended Data Fig. 6b,c). Bound Gd3+ was outcompeted by an excess of Ca2+, proving Ca2+ binding specificity. Binding sites I and II are located at the domain a–b interface and in domain b, respectively. Binding site III is located within the disordered C-terminal tail, as previously proposed25. We pinpointed the exact locations of binding sites I and II in the centre of the quenched regions by structural alignment with the Ca2+ binding protein calsequestrin and amide NMR experiments (Fig. 2i and Extended Data Fig. 6d–f)29. We attempted to probe the binding sites experimentally, however, single point mutations in binding sites I or II resulted in drastically decreased protein yields, preventing further experiments (Extended Data Fig. 6g). In contrast, mutagenesis of the Ca2+ binding site III was readily possible. Disruption of this site did not affect condensate formation in vitro or in living cells (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i). Taken together, the Ca2+-dependent phase separation of PDIA6 is controlled by a molecular switch in domain b, which is activated following Ca2+ binding.

Next, we set out to determine the molecular mechanism underlying condensate formation. Biological phase separation relies on multivalent interactions15 and therefore, we expected at least two intermolecular interactions to be involved. We suspected that dimerization of domain a0 is one of these interactions and indeed, a monomeric construct of PDIA6 (ref. 25) did not form condensates (Extended Data Fig. 7a). In search for the second interaction, we first tested droplet formation of the individual domain subconstructs but none of these formed droplets in solution (Extended Data Fig. 7b). As mentioned earlier, we also probed a potential role of the disordered C-terminal tail, but neither neutralization of its positive charges (EQDN) nor its entire truncation (ΔC) abrogated the formation of condensates (Extended Data Fig. 6h,i).

We then hypothesized that the highly flexible and charged linker connecting domains a0 and a (Fig. 3a) might drive condensate formation by interacting with another PDIA6 dimer. To resolve this interaction, we employed NMR spectroscopy on the disperse protein, that is, in the absence of crowding agent. We suspected this interaction to be rather weak and therefore added a 21-residue peptide corresponding to the a0–a linker (GGRSGGYSSGKQGRSDSSSKK) to methyl-labelled full-length PDIA6 to saturate any potential binding sites. The addition of the peptide indeed led to drastic spectral changes in domain b. In the absence of the peptide, the domain equally populated two conformations in slow exchange (two peaks per residue for all residues in domain b; 57:43 ± 8%). Following titration of the linker peptide, this equilibrium strongly shifted towards one conformation (93:7 ± 3%), evidencing a transient interaction between the linker and domain b (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c–e). High salt concentration as well as charge-neutralizing mutations in the linker peptide impaired the interaction, validating its electrostatic character (Fig. 3c,d and Extended Data Fig. 7f). Strikingly, the interaction was Ca2+-dependent, in full agreement with the physiological observation of phase separation (Fig. 1).

Source data

The data thus suggest a functional model for PDIA6 condensate formation, where the positively charged a0–a linker dynamically interacts with the negatively charged surface in domain b at homeostatic Ca2+ concentrations. We tested this functional model on the in vitro-reconstituted droplets of full-length PDIA6. In full agreement with the model, droplet formation was prevented by increased salt concentration or neutralization of the positively charged linker residues by mutagenesis (Fig. 3e). Importantly, the linker mutations did not affect the PDIA6 dimeric state or its disulfide isomerase and chaperone activities (Extended Data Fig. 7g–j). Encouraged by these findings, we then also probed the molecular model of condensate formation in cells. Neutralization of the positive charges in the linker should abolish PDIA6 condensate formation. Cells transfected with PDIA6 linker mutants indeed no longer formed the large condensates observed for PDIA6 WT. Removal of two charges from the linker led to a reduction in condensate size, and complete neutralization of all five charged residues (5× linker mutant) fully impeded condensate formation, acting as dominant negative (Fig. 3f and Extended Data Fig. 7k). The expression levels of endogenous PDIA6 and transfected PDIA6 5× linker mutant were approximately equal in our in vivo experiment, and at the same stoichiometry PDIA6 droplet formation was also abrogated in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 7l,m). The multivalency required for PDIA6 condensate formation thus results from (1) the high-affinity dimerization of domain a0 and (2) the transient Ca2+-dependent electrostatic interaction between the a0–a linker and domain b (Fig. 3g–i).

To explore the biological role of the PDIA6 condensates, in particular their functional role in the ER chaperone network, we probed the localization of the central chaperone Hsp70 BiP30 relative to the condensates. BiP is one of the most abundant ER chaperones involved in protein folding and disaggregation and has been reported to interact with PDIA6 (refs. 31,32,33,34). Immunostaining of HeLa cells showed that endogenous BiP co-localized in the PDIA6 condensates, both at endogenous and overexpressed PDIA6 levels. Overexpression of BiP, in turn, did not affect the PDIA6 condensates (Fig. 4a,b, Extended Data Fig. 8a–c and Supplementary Table 2). We also tested whether BiP would form condensates on its own by staining endogenous BiP in cells transfected with PDIA6 5× linker mutant. As shown above, in these cells PDIA6 does not form condensates but is homogenously dispersed throughout the entire ER. Under this condition, BiP did not form condensates, thus establishing PDIA6 as the scaffold of the condensates to which BiP is recruited (Fig. 4c).

Next, we employed methyl and amide NMR experiments to determine the interaction sites between PDIA6 and BiP by chemical shift mapping. PDIA6 interacts via its domain b with the nucleotide binding domain (NBD) of BiP (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8d–k). The affinity of KD ≈ 50 μM (Extended Data Fig. 8l) is in the same range as known BiP–co-chaperone interactions35,36 and fully in line with a dynamic chaperone network. Importantly, the BiP binding site on domain b does not overlap with the interface required for condensate formation such that condensate formation and BiP recruitment by PDIA6 is simultaneously possible, as observed in cells. In full accordance with this model, the isolated BiP NBD co-localized in PDIA6 droplets in vitro, although it did not undergo phase separation by itself (Fig. 4e). Together, these experiments clearly establish that PDIA6 forms the scaffold of the condensates into which it recruits BiP as a secondary protein.

Next, we investigated whether further ER chaperones were also concentrated into the PDIA6 condensates. We chose to examine the BiP co-chaperone ERdj3, an ER-resident member of the J-domain protein family, because it plays a central role in mediating client-protein transfer to BiP37. Strikingly, ERdj3 co-localized with the PDIA6–BiP condensates, both at endogenous protein levels and in PDIA6-transfected cells. Next, we probed the localizations of PDIA1 (the major PDI for numerous ER client proteins) and Grp94 (the ER-localized Hsp90), which cooperate with BiP in client-protein processing34,38. Both chaperones enriched in the PDIA6 condensates at endogenous protein levels and in PDIA6-transfected cells (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 9a and Supplementary Table 2). In contrast to this, the lectin chaperones calreticulin and calnexin (responsible for the glycosylation of client proteins before their export from the ER)39 did not enrich in the PDIA6 condensates (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 9b,c and Supplementary Table 2). From these observations, it emerges that the essential components of the early folding machinery—Hsp70, Hsp90, J-domain proteins and PDIs—specifically concentrate in the condensates, whereas the lectin chaperones involved in later-stage client maturation—calnexin and calreticulin—are not enriched (Fig. 4h).

The co-localization of multiple key chaperones in the condensates strongly suggests a fundamental biological function in client-protein folding. Proinsulin, the precursor of insulin, is known to be folded in the ER through the assistance of various chaperones including BiP, Erdj3, PDIA6 and PDIA1 (refs. 40,41) before being exported to the Golgi for further processing and subsequent secretion in the form of insulin42. This makes it an ideal model client to study the potential role of the condensates as folding compartments.

To assess the spatial localization of proinsulin within the ER, cells were transiently transfected with a proinsulin construct including a C-terminal myc tag. This allowed visualization of ER-localized proinsulin through staining with antibody to myc and revealed that proinsulin was highly enriched in endogenous PDIA6 condensates (Pearson's correlation coefficient, PCC = 0.93 ± 0.1), which strongly points towards a role of the condensates in client-protein folding. Similarly, proinsulin co-localized in PDIA6–GFP condensates (PCC = 0.88 ± 0.06; Fig. 5a,b, Extended Data Fig. 10a and Supplementary Table 2).

To evaluate whether proinsulin is actively processed within the PDIA6 condensates, we assessed their effect on insulin secretion. If the PDIA6 condensates served as functional ER folding compartments, their absence should lead to a decrease in insulin secretion. We co-transfected cells with proinsulin and either PDIA6 WT (condensates) or the PDIA6 5× linker mutant (no condensates), and determined the amount of insulin secretion. Strikingly, cells transfected with PDIA6 5× linker mutant secreted less insulin than PDIA6 WT-transfected cells, supporting our hypothesis of a functional role of the PDIA6 condensates in client maturation (Fig. 5c). Notably, intracellular proinsulin was not detectable in these experiments, presumably due to its proteolytic degradation. We thus treated the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, which led to detectable proinsulin accumulation (Extended Data Fig. 10b). Thereby, proinsulin levels were notably higher in cells expressing PDIA6 5× linker mutant (no condensates) compared with PDIA6 WT (condensates), which further demonstrates that the absence of condensates impairs proinsulin folding. To corroborate this, we also used the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1, which exhibits an inherently high glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, overcoming the requirement of proinsulin co-transfection. Comparison of the secreted insulin with the intracellular proinsulin ratio of PDIA6 WT- and PDIA6 5× linker mutant-transfected INS-1 cells led to the same conclusion as before, namely that the absence of the chaperone condensates severely disrupts insulin processing (Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 10c). As shown earlier, the enzymatic activity of PDIA6 is fully intact in the 5× linker mutant such that the disruption of proinsulin folding must result from the disruption of the condensate architecture. Together, these experiments provide clear evidence that the PDIA6 condensates as such play a fundamental role in insulin folding that goes beyond classical chaperone functions.

Finally, we wanted to study the effect of the PDIA6–chaperone condensates on general ER client-protein turnover and proteostasis. To this end, we assessed the effect of chaperone condensates on three parameters that report on ER proteostasis: (1) XBP1 splicing, a well-established readout that directly reports on the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen43,44, (2) protein aggregation using the PROTEOSTAT aggresome assay and (3) fluidity of the ER membrane, which has been reported to stiffen on accumulation of misfolded proteins, measured via the recovery dynamics of mApple–Sec61 in FRAP experiments. We transfected cells with PDIA6 WT or PDIA6 5× linker mutant and quantified the above parameters. Strikingly, compared with PDIA6 WT-expressing cells, the absence of PDIA6 condensates (5× linker mutant) led to a pronounced increase in XBP1 splicing (Fig. 5e) and greater protein aggregation (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 10d). The fluorescence recovery of mApple–Sec61 was significantly slower in cells without PDIA6 condensates (t1/2 = 17 ± 5 s) than cells with PDIA6 condensates (t1/2 = 8 ± 4 s; Fig. 5g and Extended Data Fig. 10e–g), showing a stiffening of the ER morphology in the absence of the chaperone condensates. Together, these results lend strong support for our model that the PDIA6 condensates play an active role in preventing protein aggregation and enhancing protein folding robustness. This is further reflected in a lower cell viability in the absence of condensates (Extended Data Fig. 10h–l), indicating that condensates avert cell death by preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins. PDIA6 condensates thus serve to subcompartmentalize the ER into functional ‘folding factories'.

In summary, our experiments reveal along multiple independent lines that crucial ER chaperones do not only cooperate in a functional network but form a self-organized supramolecular structure within the ER that guides client folding (Fig. 5h). The chaperone condensates seem to act in the early stages of client-protein folding and it is thus imaginable that client proteins are imported directly into the condensates following their translocation into the ER. The physiological benefits of subcompartmentalizing the ER by arranging chaperones into folding condensates indeed seem to be numerous: the elevated local concentrations of chaperones and clients increases both specificity and folding efficiency, thus reducing protein misfolding and aggregation. The simultaneous decrease in chaperone concentration outside the condensates may prevent non-specific interactions with folded proteins in the ER lumen, thus enabling a multistep processing pipeline for clients. Furthermore, the dynamic regulation of the chaperone condensates via the Ca2+ concentration might help to overcome an increasing load of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen during acute ER-stress situations by accelerating protein turnover at the cost of specificity. Condensate properties have recently been reported for the cytosolic chaperones Hsp70 and J-domain proteins, to specifically prevent aggregation of amyloid-forming proteins13,45. From these and our observations, the pattern seems to emerge that subcompartmentalization by chaperone condensates may be a general theme to structure cellular compartments. The chaperone superstructures in the ER not only provide a fascinating layer of functionality to enable protein biogenesis but might also result in novel therapeutical approaches to target protein misfolding diseases.

Human PDIA6 lacking its ER signal sequence (residues 19–440), domain ab (residues 161–440) and domain b (residues 276–440), with an additional N-terminal His6 tag including a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage sequence and domain a (residues 161–272) with an additional N-terminal His6 tag, followed by a SUMO tag were synthesised by GenScript. The genes were inserted using NcoI and XhoI restriction enzymes into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen). BL21-(DE3)-Lemo cells (New England Biolabs) were transformed and cultured at 37 °C in Luria–Bertani (LB) medium containing 30 mg ml−1 kanamycin. Expression was induced at an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6 by adding 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubating at 25 °C for 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 35 ml lysis buffer per litre of culture (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM ATP (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.02 mg ml−1 ribonuclease RNase A (Roche), 0.01 mg ml−1 deoxyribonuclease DNase I (AppliChem) and 0.2 mg ml−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysis was performed using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics; three cycles at 4 °C). The soluble bacterial lysate was separated from cell debris and other components by centrifugation at 14,000g for 60 min and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer A (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole). PDIA6 was eluted using a 60% step gradient of buffer B (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 500 mM imidazole) and dialysed overnight against buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 300 mM NaCl) to remove the imidazole. The PDIA6 was denatured with 6 M urea and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer A + 6 M urea to further separate the protein from nucleotide and protein contamination. No changes in the protein conformation of refolded and not refolded PDIA6 were observed in two-dimensional-HMQC spectra and SEC-MALS analyses. PDIA6 was eluted at a 300 mM imidazole concentration in buffer containing 6 M urea. PDIA6 refolding was achieved by overnight dialysis against buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) and 300 mM NaCl). After refolding, the His tag was cleaved by overnight incubation with 1 mg TEV protease or Ulp1 SUMO protease per 50 mg of PDIA6 in cleavage buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM EDTA) at 4 °C. The his–TEV–domain b and his–TEV–domain ab constructs were not cleaved. His–TEV–domain a0 and his–TEV–domain a used for amide backbone assignment were not cleaved. Cleaved PDIA6 constructs were separated from the tag, TEV or Ulp1 and uncleaved PDIA6 by a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in buffer A. Finally, PDIA6 was concentrated by ultrafiltration and injected into size-exclusion chromatography columns (Superdex-200 16/600 PG for constructs >30 kDa or Superdex-75 16/600 PG for constructs <30 kDa; Cytiva) to further purify the proteins and adjust the protein to its final buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2). The PDIA6 was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at −20 °C until use. The final yield of purified protein was 25 mg per litre of LB medium. To obtain fully reduced PDIA6, the protein was incubated with 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) at room temperature for 1 h, buffer exchanged (3×) to SEC buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2) and immediately frozen. Before performing the calcium-binding experiments, PDIA6 was incubated with 20 mM EDTA for 1 h at room temperature and dialysed overnight against SEC buffer at 4 °C.

Human BiP lacking its ER signal sequence (residues 19–654) with an N-terminal His6 tag including a TEV cleavage sequence was synthesized by GenScript. The gene was inserted through NcoI and XhoI into a pET28a expression vector (Novagen). BL21-(DE3)-Lemo cells (New England Biolabs) were transformed and cultured at 37 °C in LB medium. BiP expression was induced at an OD600 of 0.6 by adding 1 mM IPTG, and expression was continued at 25 °C for 12 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis buffer per litre of culture (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.02 mg ml−1 ribonuclease RNase A (Roche), 0.01 mg ml−1 deoxyribonuclease DNase I (AppliChem) and 0.2 mg ml−1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell lysis was performed using a microfluidizer (Microfluidics; three cycles at 4 °C). The soluble bacterial lysate was separated from cell debris and other components by centrifugation at 14,000g for 60 min and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer A (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2). BiP was eluted using a 60% step gradient of buffer B (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2 and 1 M imidazole) and dialysed overnight against buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2). The BiP was denatured with 6 M urea and loaded onto a Ni-NTA column equilibrated in buffer + 8 M urea. The BiP was eluted at a 500 mM imidazole concentration in buffer containing 8 M urea. BiP refolding was achieved by overnight dialysis against buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl2). After refolding, the His tag was cleaved by overnight incubation with 1 mg TEV per 50 mg BiP in cleavage buffer (25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 0.5 mM EDTA) at 4 °C. BiP was separated from the tag, TEV and uncleaved BiP via a Ni-NTA column (Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer A. The BiP was then applied to an anion-exchange column (QHP, Cytiva) equilibrated in buffer QA (25 mM Tris (pH 8.5)) and eluted using a gradient of buffer QB (25 mM Tris (pH 8.5) and 1 mM KCl) at a concentration of 250 mM KCl. Finally, the BiP was concentrated by ultrafiltration and subjected to size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex-200 16/600 PG, Cytiva) to further purify the proteins and adjust to its SEC buffer. Finally, the BiP was concentrated by ultrafiltration and stored at −20 °C until use. The final yield of purified protein was 15–20 mg WT BiP per litre of LB medium.

Methyl-labelled PDIA6 proteins were obtained by growing the expression cells in M9 minimal media prepared with 99.85% D2O (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 15NH4Cl (1 g l−1; Sigma-Aldrich) and d-glucose-d7 (2 g l−1; Sigma-Aldrich). At an OD600 of 0.8, a solution containing the labelled precursors was added as follows. For [U-2H, 15N, 12C], Met-[13CH3]ε, Val-[13CH3]γ2 and Leu-[13CH3]δ2 labelling of PDIA6 methionine leucine valine, 240 mg 2-hydroxy-2-[13C]methyl-3-oxo-4,4,4-tri-[2H]-butanoate (pro-S acetolactate-13C, NMR-Bio) and 100 mg of [13C]ε-L-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich). For [U-2H, 15N, 12C], Met-[13CH3]ε and Val-[13CH3]γ2 labelling of PDIA6 methionine valine, 240 mg 2-hydroxy-2-[13C]methyl-3-oxo-4,4,4-tri-[2H]-butanoate (pro-S acetolactate-13C, NMR-Bio), 30 mg of l-leucine-d10 and 100 mg of [13C]ε-l-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich). For [U-2H, 15N, 12C], Met-[13CH3]ε, Val-[13CH3/12C2H3]cγ1/cγ2 and Ile-[13CH3]δ1 labelling of BiP isoleucine methionine valine, 100 mg 2-keto-3-(methyl-d3)-butyric acid-4-13C,3-d sodium salt, 30 mg l-leucine-d10, 80 mg α-ketobutyric acid methyl 13C (99%) 3,3-D2 (98%) and 100 mg [13C]ε-l-methionine (Sigma-Aldrich). One hour after the addition of the precursors, protein expression was induced by adding 0.5–1 mM IPTG and incubating at 25 °C for 12 h. Methyl-labelled proteins were purified following the protocols described earlier.

The QuikChange II mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to introduce the PDIA6 mutations M182L; M331L; M359L; M367L; L61M; V75I; V124I; L139M; L165M; L196M; I234V; L320M; L345M; L349M; L385M; I406V; V407I; L419M; V421I; I425V; L427M; L432M; L435M; L440M; K161 to stop (domain a0); L139STOP (domain a0 Δlinker); P274 to stop (domain a0a, domain a); S428 to stop (domain b ΔC(13)); 420STOP (ΔC(20); domain b ΔC(20); domain ab ΔC(20)); E422Q, D423N, D424N, D426N, D429N, E431Q, D433N and D434N (EQDN, dom b EQDN); R142Q, K150N and R153Q; K150N, R153Q and K159N; R142Q, K150N, R153Q, K159N and K160N (5× linker mutant) and the BiP mutation G407 to stop (NBD). All PCR primers were obtained from Microsynth. The plasmids were purified using the Zyppy plasmid mini prep kit (Zymo Research) and mutations were confirmed by sequencing by Microsynth AG. The expression and purification of the mutant proteins was performed as described for the WT proteins. All linker mutants (R142Q, K150N and R153Q; K150N, R153Q and K159N; and R142Q, K150N, R153Q, K159N and K160N) behaved like the WT protein.

NMR experiments were performed in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2 or 25 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2 at 37 °C. The experiments were recorded on Bruker Avance IIIHD 600 MHz, Avance III 700 MHz, Avance Neo 800 MHz or Avance IIIHD 900 MHz spectrometers running Topspin 3.6–4.0 and equipped with a cryogenically cooled triple-resonance probe. The NMR data were processed with nmrPipe46 2022.230.12.16 and ccpnmr47 2.5.2. Reference experiments were recorded at concentrations between 25 μM and 100 μM. Secondary chemical shifts were calculated relative to random-coil values48. Depending on the conditions, 10 mM TCEP, 10 mM CaCl2, 5 mM ADP, 10 eq. linker peptide and 1 mM K2HPO4/KH2PO4 were used as indicated. To mimic ER homeostatic-like conditions, 10 mM TCEP or 15 mM glutathione (GSH) with 7:1 GSH:glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was used in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+. Samples behaved identically in the presence of 10 mM TCEP and 15 mM GSH with 7:1 GSH:GSSG. The samples were incubated before the experiment (about 1 h for TCEP, GSH and ADP; about 30 min for protein–protein interaction experiments, Ca2+ and Gd3+; and overnight for peptides). Data were analysed using Excel 16.97.

PDIA6 Met[CH3]ε, Val[CH3]γ2 and Leu[CH3]δ2 assignment was obtained using a structure-based approach combining mutagenesis, specific valine labelling schemes49, subconstructs and three-dimensional 13C, 13C-resolved [1H, 1H]-NOESY experiments recorded at 37 °C in SEC buffer with 10 mM TCEP and 5% D2O. The following point mutations were used: M182L, M331L, M359L, M376L, L61M, V75I, V124I, V139M, L165M, L196M, I234V, L320M, L345M, L349M, L385M, I406V, V407I, L419M, V421I, I425V, L427M, L432M, L435M and L440M. The following subconstructs were used: his–domain a and his–domain ab. Specific valine labelling allowed distinction between leucine and valine residues. Each sample was recorded at 37 °C with an adjusted duration depending on the final concentration of each mutant (experimental time ranging from 120 to 240 min per sample). Three-dimensional 13C, 13C-resolved [1H, 1H]-NOESY experiments were recorded in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5% D2O, with sample concentrations of 870 μM and a mixing time of 500 ms. Together, this allowed for the assignment of 62/66 Met[CH3]ε and Leu[CH3]δ2 and Val[CH3]γ2 methyl groups (94%).

For the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments, the following experiments were recorded. [U-1H, 13C, 15N]-PDIA6 domain a0: HNCA and HNCACB at 37 °C in 25 mM MES (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5 % D2O. [U-1H, 13C, 15N]-PDIA6 his–domain a: 4D-APSY50 at 37 °C in 25 mM MES (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5% D2O. [U-2H, 13C, 15N]-PDIA6 his–domain ab: HNCA, HNCACB, HNCO and HNcoCA at 37 °C in 25 mM MES (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5 % D2O; and HNCA, HNCACB with deuterium decoupling and 3D 15N, 15N resolved [1H, 1H]-NOESY with a mixing time of 100 ms at 37 °C in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5% D2O. [U-1H, 13C, 15N]-PDIA6 his–domain bΔC: HNCA, HNCACB, HNcoCACB and HNCO at 25 °C in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM GSSG and 5% D2O, and HNCACB, HNcaCO and 3D 15N, 15N resolved [1H, 1H]-NOESY with a mixing time of 80 ms at 25 °C in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TCEP and 5 % D2O. All experiments were recorded at sample concentrations of 0.5–1.0 mM. The amide backbone assignments comprise 85% of domain a0, 92% of his–domain a, 79% of his–domain b and 54% of his–domain ab.

All PDIA6 constructs were N-terminally tagged with DyLight 488 amine-reactive dyes (Thermo Scientific) at a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 in 25 mM MES (pH 6.5), 150 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl2 in the dark for 1 h at 25 °C. Free dye was removed by overnight dialysis at pH 6.5 and 4 °C in the dark, and the labelled proteins were buffer exchanged (3×) to SEC buffer. BiP NBD was N-terminally tagged with DyLight 633 amine-reactive dyes (Thermo Scientific) following the same protocol. The protein concentration and extent of labelling were determined according to manufacturer's protocol for all constructs and only proteins labelled with 0.75 and 1.5 moles dye per mole protein were used for experiments.

SEC-MALS measurements of PDIA6 constructs were performed at 25 °C in SEC buffer using a S200 10/300 GL column (Agilent Technologies) on an Agilent 1260 high-performance liquid chromatography system. Proteins were eluted at a concentration of 20 μM. Elution was monitored by multiangle light scattering (Heleos II 8+; Wyatt Technology), differential refractive index (Optilab T-rEX; Wyatt Technology) and absorbance at 280 and 254 nm (1260 UV; Agilent Technologies). The column was equilibrated overnight in the running buffer to obtain stable baseline signals from the detectors before data collection. All system parameters were calibrated using an injection of 2 mg ml−1 BSA solution (ThermoPierce) and standard protocols in ASTRA 6. Molar mass and mass distributions were calculated using the ASTRA 6 software (Wyatt Technology).

Differential scanning fluorimetry data were acquired using a Prometheus NanoTemper NT.48 instrument (NanoTemper Technology) at protein concentrations of 100 μM in SEC buffer. The samples were scanned from 20 °C to 95 °C at a scan rate of 0.5 °C min−1. Protein unfolding was measured by detecting the temperature-dependent change in tryptophan fluorescence at emission wavelengths of 330 and 350 nm. Melting temperatures were determined by detecting the maximum of the first derivative of the fluorescence ratios (F350/F330).

For the determination of the dissociation constants N-terminally tagged DyLight 488–PDIA6 at 20 nM was incubated with increasing amounts of BiP in SEC buffer in the presence of 5 mM ADP, 1 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4, 0.05% Tween and 1 mM CaCl2 prepared by serial dilution. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C before being loaded into capillary tubes. The LED power was set to 100% and the microscale thermophoresis (MST) power to medium. The pre-MST period was 5 s, the MST-acquisition period was 30 s and the post-MST period was 5 s. Measurements were performed in triplicates on a Monolith NT.115 system (NanoTemper) and integrated at an interval of 2.5 s.

Mass photometry data were obtained using a Refeyn OneMP system in microscope coverslips prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with silicone gaskets. To lock the focus, 18 µl SEC buffer was used, followed by the addition of 2 µl protein sample at the indicated final concentrations. Movies were recorded using Refeyn AcquireMP 2.5.1 and analysed with Refeyn DiscoverMP 2.5.0.

PDIA6 his–domain bΔC (P274–L427) in 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2 and 10 mM TCEP was crystallized at 10 mg ml−1 concentration at room temperature in sitting-drop vapour diffusion experiments in a 1:1 ratio of protein to precipitant. Crystals appeared in 1.9 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 M HEPES (pH 7.0) and 1% dimethylsulfoxide after two days and grew to their final size within ten days. The crystals were cryopreserved by the addition of ethylene glycol to a final concentration of 20% (vol/vol) and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at the SLS beamline X06DA (Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland) at 100 K, and integrated, indexed and scaled using the XDS software51,52. The crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser53 1.0 using PDB accession code 3uem (ref. 54). Automated model building55 was carried out with Arp/Warp56 8.0, followed by Autobuild in PHENIX57 1.17, and completed by manual model building with Coot58 0.9.8 and structure refinement in PHENIX59 1.17. Model quality was validated with Molprobity60 4.4. Data collection and refinement statistics are in Supplementary Table 1. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the PDB under the accession code 8cpq.

Disulfide reductase activity was assessed using the NADPH-based insulin reduction assay. Purified PDIA6 constructs (1 μM final concentration) were added to 1 mM reduced GSH, 800 μM NADPH, 0.16 units GSH reductase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 30 μM human insulin (Sigma-Aldrich) in SEC buffer and the absorbance of NADPH monitored at 340 nm using a Biotek Synergy H1 multi-mode microplate reader for 25 min at 25 °C.

Chaperone activity was assessed using the citrate synthase aggregation assay. Citrate synthase (Escherichia coli; NZYTech) was dialysed against 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5). Purified PDIA6 constructs (10 μM final concentration) were added to 1 μM citrate synthase in 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) buffer and incubated at 45 °C and 300 rpm. Protein aggregation was monitored at 350 nm using a Biotek Synergy H1 multi-mode microplate reader at the indicated time points.

PDIA6 liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) was examined at 25 μM in SEC buffer in the presence of 10% polyethylene glycol (PEG3350, mass fraction, freshly prepared immediately before the experiment) as a crowding agent in the absence/presence of 15 mM GSH with 7:1 GSH:GSSG or 10 mM TCEP, 10 mM CaCl2 and/or 20 mM EDTA. The PEG was added last by simultaneously swirling the sample and gently pipetting up and down to thoroughly mix the sample. Images were taken 30 min after the addition of PEG. No PDIA6 construct formed liquid droplets in the absence of crowding agent and at concentrations below 1 mM. Phase-separated PDIA6 droplets formed under ER-mimicking conditions (15 mM GSH with 7:1 GSH:GSSG + 1–10 mM CaCl2) as well as under strongly reducing conditions (10 mM TCEP) in the presence of 1–10 mM CaCl2. Several salt concentrations (50–350 mM) were tested. Unlabelled proteins were used to confirm that they undergo phase separation without fluorescent labelling. Glass-bottomed 96-well plates were coated with 1% Pluronic F-127 overnight and the wells were washed three times with SEC buffer. For fluorescence microscopy, 1% N-terminally tagged DyLight protein was added to the unlabelled protein. BiP NBD LLPS was examined at 20 μM in SEC buffer in the presence of 5 mM ADP and 10% PEG as a crowding agent in the absence or presence of 20 μM PDIA6. Samples including BiP NBD were prepared as described for PDIA6.

A wide-field microscope (FEI MORE) with a Hamamatsu ORCA flash 4.0 cooled sCMOS camera using a TIRF APON ×60/1.49 and U Plan S Apo ×100/1.4 oil objective with the Live Acquisition 2.5 software were used for capturing images. Images were processed in the OMERO biological image data management system. All images are representative of at least three independent sets of experiments. Post-acquisition colouring of the channels was performed according to artistic preference.

HeLa CCL2, HEK293A and U2OS cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biowest), 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma) and 1×penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma). INS-1 832/13 cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine (Gibco), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 10 mM HEPES (BioConcept), 0.05 mM EmbryoMax β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum. The HeLa CCL2 (ATCC CCL-2) and HEK293A (ATCC CVCL-6910) cell lines were a gift from M. Spiess; their identities were authenticated by short-tandem-repeat analysis by Microsynth AG (last in 2021). The U2OS cell line (ATCC HTB-96) was a gift from M. Hall. The INS-1 832/13 cell line was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalogue number SCC207). All cell lines were confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative by PCR. For transient cell transfections, the cells were plated into six-well plates to reach 70% confluency the following day and transfected with 1 µg plasmid DNA complexed with Helix-IN transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences). For small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown experiments, cells were transfected with a final concentration of 50 pmol Silencer Select siRNA targeting PDIA6 (siRNA1, GAAUGUUCUGGACAGUGAAtt, Ambion, s19715 and siRNA2, GGCAGUGAAUGGUCUGUAUtt, Ambion, s19716) using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were replated onto coverslips or an imaging chamber the following day and fixed or imaged 24–48 h post transfection. For stress treatments, the cells were treated with 1 μM tunicamycin, 1.25 μg ml−1 thapsigargin or 8 μM cyclopiazonic acid for the specified duration. For washout experiments, the cells were treated with 1 μM tunicamycin, 1.25 μg ml−1 thapsigargin or 8 μM cyclopiazonic acid for 10 h, washed with PBS and cultured in fresh medium overnight. For experiments with blocked proteasomal degradation, the cells were treated with 5 μM MG-132 for 18 h.

To ensure ER localization, the KDEL signal sequence (present in native PDIA6) was cloned at the C terminus of PDIA6–tGFP (Origene, RG201710) using a NEBuilder HiFi Assembly cloning kit (New England Biolabs) with primers designed by the NEBuilder assembly tool following the manufacturer's instructions. For simplicity, we refer to this plasmid as PDIA6–GFP. The C-terminal tail of PDIA6 was truncated by removing the last twelve amino acids from its sequence in the PDIA6-tGFP-KDEL plasmid using a NEB site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions and primers selected using the NEBaseChanger tool. The PDIA6-EGFP-KDEL plasmid for transient transfections was generated from the PDIA6-tGFP-KDEL plasmid and the EGFP insert from ACE2–EGFP (Addgene, catalogue number 154962), using a NEBuilder HiFi assembly cloning kit (New England Biolabs) with the primers designed by the NEBuilder Assembly Tool following the manufacturer's instructions. The QuikChange II mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to introduce the mutations K159N and K160N, and R124Q, K159N and K160N. Mutagenesis of L128A, L131A, L134A, V135A and L139A; R142Q, K150N and R153Q; R142Q, K150N, R153Q, K159N and K160N; and introduction of silent mutations in PDIA6 WT and PDIA6 5× linker mutant (for siRNA + transfection) was performed by GenScript. PDIA6 L128A, L131A, L134A, V135A and L139A has been characterized to be monomeric23 and is hence referred to as ‘PDIA6 monomer'. A gene encoding human pre-proinsulin, followed by a C-terminal myc–his A tag was synthesised by BioCat. The genes were inserted using BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes into a pcDNA3.1(+) expression vector (Novagen). The QuikChange II mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) was used to introduce the Akita proinsulin mutation C96Y. Hamster BiP–mCherry was a gift from E. Snapp (Addgene plasmid 62233) and mutated to the human sequence, and mApple–Sec61 was a gift from J. Lippincott-Schwartz. All PCR primers were obtained from Microsynth. The plasmids were purified using the Zyppy plasmid mini prep kit from Zymo Research and mutations were confirmed by sequencing by Microsynth AG.

To generate the C-terminally Halo-tagged PDIA6 HeLa CCL2 cell line, the PDIA6 genomic locus was targeted shortly after the stop codon with the following guide RNA: 5′-CACCGAGTTGTGAGAGCCACAACAG-3′. The guides were synthesized by Microsynth and cloned into the hSpCas9 pX330 plasmid (Addgene plasmid 42230) by annealing oligonucleotides and ligation into the vector, which was linearized with BbsI. The homology repair was designed as follows: 500 bp left homology arm–glycine-serin linker (GSGSGSGSGS)–HaloTag–linker (PSRLEEELRRRLTEP)–ER retention sequence (KDEL)–PolyA–G418/geneticin resistance cassette–500 bp right homology arm. The coding sequence of the G418 resistance cassette, PolyA and the HaloTag were provided by F. Bottanelli and the homology repair plasmid was synthesized by Genscript. Both plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (Microsynth).

HeLa CCL2 cells at 70% confluency were transfected with 0.5 µg pX330 plasmid with the PDIA6 guide and 0.5 µg homology repair plasmid using Helix-IN transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences). Three days post transfection, 1.5 mg ml−1 G418 (Thermo Fisher) was added; the medium was exchanged every 2–3 days with fresh medium containing 1.5 mg ml−1 G418 until selection was complete (two weeks).

To generate a CRISPR–Cas9-mediated PDIA6-knockout cell line, the PDIA6 genomic locus was targeted with the following guide RNAs: 5′-GCTCGTGAAGGATCGCCTCG-3′ (gRNA1, targeting exons 5–7, depending on the splice variant) and 5′-AGACCGCGTTGGGGATTGGA-3′ (gRNA2, targeting exons 11–13, depending on splice variant). The guides were synthesized by Microsynth and cloned into px458-mCherry (gRNA1) and px459-Puro (gRNA2) vectors by annealing oligonucleotides and ligation into the vector, which was linearized with BbsI. The plasmid was confirmed by sequencing (Microsynth).

HeLa CCL2 and Hek293A cells at 70% confluency were transfected on a 10 cm dish with px458-mCherry (gRNA1) plasmid (2.5 µg per dish) and px459-Puro (gRNA2) plasmid containing the PDIA6 guides (2.5 µg per dish) using Helix-IN transfection reagent (OZ Biosciences). For selection, the cells were treated with 1.5 µg ml−1 puromycin one day post transfection for 24 h. FACS sorting (mCherry+) was carried out 48 h after transfection. The cells were trypsinized and resuspended in cell-sorting medium (2% FCS and 2.5 mM EDTA in PBS) and sorted on a Fortessa flow cytometer. Individual mCherry+ cells were collected, seeded into a 96-well plate and expanded. PDIA6 expression was determined by western blots. All of the surviving clones were positive for PDIA6, indicating that PDIA6 is essential.

HeLa cells were plated onto coverslips 24 h before fixation or stress treatment. At specified time points, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100, blocked in PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum and stained with polyclonal anti-PDIA6 (1:200; GeneTex, GTX33397), monoclonal anti-GRP78/BiP (1:200; Invitrogen, 1H11-1H7; lot: XI3695781), polyclonal anti-calreticulin (1:200; Proteintech, 27298-1-AP), polyclonal anti-DNAJB11/ERdj3 (1:200; Thermo Fisher, 15484-1-AP), monoclonal anti-Grp94 (1:200; Enzo, SPA-850; lot: 103418), anti-PDIA1 (1:200; GeneTex, GTX2279), polyclonal anti-calnexin (1:200; Enzo, ADI-SPA-860; a gift from the Speiss laboratory), followed by Alexa Fluor (AF)488- or AF633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, AF633-conjugated goat anti-mouse, AF488- or AF633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, AF488- or AF633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, AF488-conjugated goat anti-rat or AF546-conjugated donkey anti-rat, AF633-conjugated goat anti-mouse and AF488- or AF633-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (all 1:500), respectively. Proinsulin was visualized within the condensates by staining pre-proinsulin–myc–his-transfected HeLa cells with anti-myc clone 9E10 (1:2,000; Sigma-Aldrich, M4439; lot: 029M4849V) primary antibody, followed by AF633-conjugated anti-mouse (1:500). PDIA6 in the PDIA6–HaloTag knock-in HeLa CCL2 cell line was stained with polyclonal anti-HaloTag (1:250; Promega, G928A), followed by AF488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500). Overexpressed PDIA6–GFP was imaged in the 488 channel using the eGFP signal. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and sealed with nail polish.

Confocal images were acquired using an Olympus Fluoview FV3000 system and an UPLSAPO ×60/1.30 objective with silicone oil using the FV3000 (FV21S-SW version 2.5.1) system software. Laser intensities were at 0.5–3.0% for both the 488 (AF488) and 640 nm (AF633) wavelengths. Sampling speed was 8.0 μs pixel−1. All images are representative of at least three independent sets of experiments. All images for corresponding experiments were processed with the same settings to insure comparable results. Post-acquisition colouring of the channels was performed according to artistic preference.

For live-cell imaging, cells were seeded on an imaging chamber (ibidi μ-slide) 24 h before data acquisition. Knock-in cells expressing PDIA6–Halo–KDEL fusion were labelled for 1 h using 200 nM JFX-554 (Promega) in the cell culture medium. After the labelling, the cells were rinsed and incubated for at least 1 h in culture medium. Live-cell imaging was performed in complete growth medium lacking phenol red at 37 °C with 5% CO2 on a wide-field microscope (FEI MORE) with a Hamamatsu ORCA flash 4.0 cooled sCMOS camera using a TIRF APON ×60/1.49 oil objective and an Olympus ‘SpinD' spinning-disc confocal microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion, sCMOS using an UPL APO ×60/1.5 oil objective. Laser intensities were set to 5–10% for the 488 nm wavelength. The system was preheated overnight (MORE) or 1 h (SpinD) to 37 °C to prevent thermal fluctuations. All images are representative of at least three independent sets of experiments. Images of the movies were recorded every 0.5–1.0 s. Post-acquisition colouring of the channels was performed according to artistic preference.

The FRAP experiments were performed on an Olympus ‘SpinD' spinning-disc confocal microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Fusion, sCMOS using an UPL APO ×60/1.5 oil objective. PDIA6 droplets and condensates were bleached using a 488 nm laser with 100% intensity (Rapp OptoElectronic Firefly). A total ten images were obtained prebleaching, and 200 images were recorded every 1.0–1.83 s (in vitro) or 0.5–1.0 s (in vivo) post bleaching. Sec61 was bleached using a 488 nm laser with 100% intensity (Rapp OptoElectronic Firefly). A total of ten images were obtained prebleaching and 30–200 images were recorded post bleaching with a time interval of 1.5 s (PDIA6–GFP WT co-transfected cells) or 2.3 s (PDIA6–GFP 5× linker mutant co-transfected cells). Intensities of FRAP regions were extracted with the Fiji 1.52p software tool, background corrected and reported relative to the prebleaching time point (PDIA6–GFP) or normalized as a percentage of recovery (mApple–Sec61).

Images were analysed using Omero webserver 5.26.0, Fiji 1.52p and Python 3.9.

Cell images were processed using a custom Python 3.9 script with OpenCV 4.10.00 and NumPy 1.26.4 to detect phase-separated condensates based on predefined morphological parameters. The detected condensates were quantified using circularity-based segmentation, enabling the extraction of key morphological properties, including size, shape and number, for further analysis.

Microscopy images were processed using a custom Python 3.9 script with OpenCV 4.10.00 and NumPy 1.26.4, employing the Hough Transform to detect circular droplets. The number of detected droplets per image was then quantified, enabling further analysis of their distribution.

Cell images were processed using a custom Python 3.9 script with OpenCV 4.10.00 and NumPy 1.26.4 for cell segmentation via Otsu thresholding and condensate detection. Following feature extraction, the relative intensities of condensed and dispersed protein populations in each cell were quantified to assess protein enrichment in condensates.

Pearson correlation coefficients were determined using the Fiji 1.52p ‘JaCOP' plugin from 10–15 cells (see Supplementary Table 2). Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test. The fluorescence intensity histograms were extracted using the Fiji 1.52p software ‘plot profile' tool.

To assess PDIA6 and BiP expression levels, HeLa CCL2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and protease inhibitor) and denatured in Laemmli buffer at 65 °C for 10 min. The three biological replicates were prepared and lysed independently (n = 3). Samples were resolved by 10% SDS–PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). The membranes were blocked with TBST (20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% non-fat dry milk for 30 min and incubated overnight with primary polyclonal anti-PDIA6 (1:2,000; GeneTex, GTX33397), monoclonal primary anti-GRP78/BiP (1:2,000; Invitrogen, 1H11-1H7; lot: XI3695781) or primary monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (1:2,000; Sigma, T5168; lot: 0000242797) at 4 °C, followed by 2 h incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000; anti-mouse or anti-rabbit; Invitrogen, 31430 and 31460) in TBST. Chemiluminescence signals were detected using Immobilon western HRP substrate (Advansta) and imaged using a FusionFX imaging system (Vilber Lourmat).

To asses insulin processing in HeLa cells, the cells were transfected with pre-proinsulin (and PDIA6 constructs). After 24 h, the cells were washed with preheated 1×PBS and 4×OPTIMEM GlutaMAX (Gibco), and incubated in OPTIMEM GlutaMAX (16 h). To assess insulin processing in INS-1 cells, the cells were washed 36 h post transfection (of PDIA6 constructs only) with HBSS (Gibco) + 2.5 mM glucose (Gibco) for 1 h and subsequently incubated with HBSS + 2.5 mM glucose for 2 h. The medium was collected, spun down (10 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C) and the supernatant was precipitated by the addition of 100% trichloroacetic acid (one volume trichloroacetic acid to four volumes protein). After 10 min incubation on ice, the samples were spun down (5 min, 13,000 rpm, 4 °C) and washed twice with cold acetone. The dried pellet was dissolved in 30 μl Laemmli buffer by vortexing and boiling (10 min, 300 rpm, 95 °C). The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and denatured in Laemmli buffer at 65 °C for 10 min. The four biological replicates were prepared and lysed independently (n = 4). Protein levels were measured using a BCA assay (Merck) and the volumes of the precipitate and lysates were adjusted to equal lysate protein concentrations. Samples were resolved by 4–20% SDS–PAGE (BioRad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (BioRad). The lysate blot was processed as described above. The blot of the secreted proteins was preblocked with TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 5 min and the samples were fixed by incubation with TBST containing 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 15 min. The membrane was washed in TBST, blocked with TBST containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 30 min and incubated overnight with monoclonal anti-proinsulin (for secretion, 1:1,000; Invitrogen, MA1-83256; lot: 160454; for lysate, 1:2,000; Cell Signaling, 3014; lot: 10) in Can get signal solution (Toyobo) at 4 °C, followed by 2 h incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:20,000; anti-mouse or anti-rabbit; Invitrogen, 31430 or 31460, respectively) in Can get signal solution. Chemiluminescence signals were detected using Immobilon western HRP substrate (Advansta) and imaged using a FusionFX imaging system (Vilber Lourmat).

HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates 24 h after transfection. After 24 h, MTT (Merck) was added at the indicated time points to a final concentration of 500 μg ml−1 and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed and the crystals were dissolved in acidic (0.08 M HCl) isopropanol. The absorbance (A550nm − A690nm) was measured on a plate reader. All experiments were repeated in experimental and independent biological triplicates. Significance was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test (n = 9).

RNA was extracted and purified from cells using an RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Complementary DNA was reverse-transcribed using GoScript reverse transcriptase primed with a mix of Oligo(dT)s and random hexamers (Promega). Real-time PCR was then performed using GoTaq qPCR master mix (Promega) and primers specific for sXBP1 (sXBP1, 5′-GCTGAGTCCGCAGCAGGT-3′; β-actin, 5′-CACCATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTC-3′). The expression of sXBP1 was normalized to that of β-actin. For PDIA6 WT-transfected cells, the sXBP1 levels were still below detection limit after 40 cycles of quantitative PCR and the Ct was thus set to 40 for statistical analysis. The significance was calculated from three independent biological replicates using a two-tailed Student's t-test (n = 3).

For microscopy, PDIA6–GFP (WT and 5× linker mutant)-transfected HeLa cells were plated onto coverslips 24 h before fixation. Aggresomes were visualized using the PROTEOSTAT aggresome dye following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% formaldehyde solution at room temperature, incubated with permeabilizing solution (1×assay buffer, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.05% Triton X-100) on ice for 30 min, incubated for 30 min with the PROTEOSTAT detection reagent at room temperature in the dark, mounted on a microscopy slide with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech) and sealed with nail polish.

For aggresome detection analysis by flow cytometry, PDIA6–GFP (WT and 5× linker mutant)-transfected HEK293A cells and controls were pelleted, fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized (1×assay buffer, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.05% Triton X-100), resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% FCS and 0.05 μM EDTA) with PROTEOSTAT dye (1:1,250 dilution) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. A Fortessa flow cytometer was used to measure mCherry fluorescence (PROTEOSTAT dye) of GFP-positive cells. Data were analysed using FlowJo 10.9.0. The gating strategy is in Supplementary Fig. 2.

The BiP structural model in the ADP undocked states was obtained by homology modelling using the SWISS-MODEL server and the DnaK undocked conformation (PDB 2kho)61 as a template. The structural model of PDIA6 FL has been modelled as a chimaera of the individual domain crystal structures (domain a0, PDB: 4ef0; domain a, PDB: 4gwr; domain b, PDB: 8cpq, determined in this study). The linker connecting domain a0 and a, and the C-terminal tail were modelled as disordered based on the NMR data presented in Fig. 2 and Extended Data Figs. 3,4. The interface between the domain a0 monomers is based on the crystal structure of domain a0 (PDB: 4ef0) and confirmed by NOE contacts between the domain, as presented in Fig. 2. Importantly, the distances V75–L131 (7.3 Å), V75–L134 (11.4 Å), V75–V135 (12.7 Å) and L72–L131 (7.8 Å) within the monomer are too large to have (strong) intramolecular methyl NOE contacts, indicating that the resulting NOEs are intermolecular NOEs. The measured NOE crosspeak intensities fit to the expected intermolecular NOE intensities based on the distances calculated from the crystal structure (PDB: 4ef0; V75–L131, 4 Å; V75–L134, 4 Å; V75–L135, 7.1 Å and L72–L131, 7.5 Å). The interface between domains a and b was modelled using ESMFold62 based on the NOE contact between the domains presented in Fig. 2. The binding interface of the linker to domain b was modelled based on the experiments presented in this paper.

The following protein structures were used to compare the length of helix α4: PDB: 4ekz (PDIA1 a and a′), 2dmm (PDIA3 a′), 2dj1 (PDIA4 a0), 2dj2 (PDIA4 a), 2dj3 (PDIA4 a′), 4ef0 (PDIA6 a0) and 4gwr (PDIA6 a).

To determine the PDIA6 Ca2+ binding affinity (KD(Ca2+)), the Ca2+-dependent formation of droplets in the presence of a crowding agent was used as a direct measurable of the Ca2+ binding to PDIA6. The number of unlabelled PDIA6 droplets was quantified for a Ca2+ concentration between 100 μM and 1,000 μM from differential-interference-contrast microscopy images and fitted using nonlinear regression to the Hill equation binding model (equation (1)) to determine the KD(Ca2+).

where nc is the number of condensates and n is the Hill coefficient.

The structure model was generated with ESMFold61 for the full-length protein and manually trimmed to residues 161–419 to have a more compact, yet fully functional, construct. To generate equilibrated starting structures for the pulling simulations, each structure (WT and mutant) was placed in a dodecahedral box of TIP4 water, to which 150 mM NaCl was added, including neutralizing counterions. Following steepest descents minimization, each of the systems was equilibrated for 100 ps under a constant-pressure (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature) ensemble, with position restraints applied to peptide heavy atoms throughout. Protein and non-protein atoms were coupled to separate temperature coupling baths and temperature was maintained at 300 K using the velocity rescale coupling method. Pressure was controlled using exponential relaxation pressure coupling to maintain pressure isotropically at 1.0 bar. Short-production molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted for 100 ps in the absence of any restraints to relax the initial structures. All simulations were conducted using the GROMACS package (version 2024.3).

Structures at the end of each of the previous relaxed trajectories (WT and 274PPP–274GGG) were used as starting configurations for pulling simulations. To make the immobile reference for the pulling simulations, the coordinates of Cα atoms for residues 161–272 were restrained. Residues 284–419 were pulled away from the structure over 500 ps, using a spring constant of 1,000 kJ mol−1 nm−2 and a pull rate of 0.1 Å ps−1. A final centre-of-mass collective variable distance of approximately >6.0 Å was achieved. From these trajectories, snapshots were taken to generate the starting configurations for the umbrella sampling windows. A distribution of sampling windows was used, such that the window spacing was 1 Å centre-of-mass separation, and resulted in each WT and mutant case in nine windows. In each window, 1 ns of MD was performed for a total simulation time of 9 ns utilized for umbrella sampling. Analysis of results was performed with the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM).

The number of data points in each experiment is specified in the figure legends or in Supplementary Tables 2 (Fig. 5e) and 3 (microscopy images and western blots). All in-cell data are based on multiple experiments with independent biological replicates. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in previous publications. Data distribution was assumed to be normal but this was not formally tested. A two-sided unpaired Mann–Whitney test was used for statistical analyses of the number of condensates per cell and condensate area. Statistical significance for all other analyses was calculated using a two-tailed Student's t-test. Statistical analyses were performed using Excel 16.97 or GraphPad Prism 9. Details are provided in the figure legends. Where statistical comparisons were performed, specific P values are indicated on the graphs. No samples or data points were excluded. The experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to the conditions of the experiments during data analysis.

Over 95% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) harbor oncogenic mutations in KRAS. However, upon treatment with KRAS inhibitors, PDAC cells undergo rapid metabolic reprogramming toward an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)-dependent, drug-resistant state. Here, we demonstrate that this metabolic shift is associated with upregulation of the transcription factor ZBTB11 and both the metabolic state and resistance to KRAS inhibitors can be attenuated by ZBTB11 depletion. We develop molecular glue degraders of ZBTB11 and demonstrate that they reprogram the aberrant transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and bioenergetics of KRAS inhibitor-resistant PDAC, resensitizing them to KRAS inhibition. ZBTB11 degradation leverages cell-type-specific and cell-state-specific differences in gene-regulatory mechanisms controlling OXPHOS pathway transcripts to selectively target the KRAS inhibitor-resistant state in PDAC while sparing neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Together, this work establishes ZBTB11 as a druggable vulnerability in KRAS inhibitor-resistant PDAC and provides a suite of molecular glue degrader tool compounds to investigate its function.

Bacterial microcompartments are protein organelles with diverse metabolic capabilities. Their functional diversity is determined by an enzymatic core that is sequestered within a structurally conserved protein shell architecture. Segregation of protein cargo into the bacterial microcompartment is enabled by encapsulation peptides, which are short helical domains fused to core proteins through a disordered linker. Here, we investigate how encapsulation peptides drive multicomponent cargo assembly into biomolecular condensates. In vitro experiments supported by molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the importance of both conserved hydrophobic packing and electrostatic interactions in stabilizing trimeric encapsulation peptide bundles. Topological rearrangements of encapsulation peptide domains can drive programmable liquid- or gel-like partitioning in vitro and in vivo. This partitioning is found to be encapsulation peptide-specific, modular, and can co-assemble at least three fluorescent reporters. In summary, we describe the molecular features necessary to drive biomolecular condensation using a widespread peptide tag. This work can serve as a blueprint for implementing encapsulation peptide biotechnology across diverse applications.

Bacteria are increasingly appreciated to dynamically organize their internal components1,2. One important strategy for bacterial organization is the segregation of their metabolism into organelle-like architectures, which can be found as lipid or protein membrane-bounded or unbounded (i.e., condensates)3. A widely studied prokaryotic organelle, called bacterial microcompartment (BMC), consists of protein polyhedra made of an outer protein shell which encases enzymatic cargo within4. These organelles are widespread across taxa5 and can serve catabolic (called metabolosomes) or anabolic (called carboxysome) roles. BMCs have been proposed as a promising resource of structural (scaffolds, nanoreactors) and functional (substrate channeling, toxic chemical sequestration) motifs for their use in biotechnology6,7,8,9,10. Recent work has connected the biogenesis of some bacterial organelles to phase-separated intermediates11,12,13,14. This link ties protein condensation phenomena (specifically through liquid-liquid phase separation mechanisms [LLPS])14 to numerous critical cell functions like carbon fixation, cell division, and organelle positioning1,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23.

The early stages of BMC biogenesis have been suggested to make use of LLPS mechanisms, for example, in carboxysomes24. In β-carboxysomes, the scaffold CcmM first nucleates liquid-like droplet formation12,17,25 of itself, Rubisco, and CcmN (i.e., procarboxysome)26 prior to shell recruitment by an encapsulation peptide (EP) in the C-terminus of CcmN27,28. EPs are terminal amphipathic helices, typically 18 residues in length, fused to cargo by a poorly conserved disordered linker29,30,31. The hydrophobic residues along one face of EPs have been shown to be a common motif critical for successful microcompartment packaging32. This arrangement, as a single binding domain, does not strictly adhere to a canonical stickers and spacers (interaction motifs and linkers) framework commonly observed in biomolecular condensation33. Metabolosomes have been similarly tied to using LLPS to guide assembly in vivo34, presumably through their EPs, resulting in the aggregation of protein cargo to each other and to the interior of the microcompartment shell. Notably, α-carboxysomes have been found to likewise utilize liquid intermediates to facilitate assembly by local condensation of the disordered scaffolds CsoS2, Rubisco, and shell components to trigger an assembly cascade without an identifiable EP13,18. EPs have been observed to form in vivo aggregates35,36 but have not been explicitly studied for their ability to trigger biomolecular condensation of fused cargo31 for biotechnological applications.

In this work, we study the self-assembly and condensation propensity of EPs. First, we demonstrate that the model EP from the aldehyde dehydrogenase (PduP) from Salmonella enterica fused to an mNeonGreen cargo reporter can trigger phase separation of fused cargo in vitro. Additional protein components can be assembled into condensed droplets if they contain an EP. In vitro experiments supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrate the importance of both conserved hydrophobic packing and electrostatic interactions in stabilizing trimeric EP bundles. Topological rearrangements of EP domains can exert control over liquid- or gel-like partitioning in vitro and in vivo. This partitioning is found to be EP-specific, modular, and can co-assemble at least three fluorescent reporters into liquid-like foci in live bacteria. In sum, we provide a blueprint of the molecular features necessary to drive biomolecular condensation using the widespread EP peptide tag. This work paints a drastically different view of EP domains and demonstrates a condensation system for the assembly of disparate metabolic machinery in bacteria.

Our investigation started with the model PduP EP from the Salmonella enterica propanediol utilization (Pdu) BMC. This EP has been established to be important in cargo packaging within BMC shells30 and known to exhibit an α-helical structure by NMR and circular dichroism31,37. We fused this 18-residue EP, along with its native 18-residue linker (Fig. 1A), to the N-terminus of mNeonGreen38 (EP-mNG) to act as a reporter system and purified it alongside wild-type mNG. Biomolecular condensation is commonly triggered by adding molecular crowding agents to samples39. As such, we titrated polyethylene glycol (average MN 2000; PEG2k) into solutions of mNG and EP-mNG at 20 µM and measured sample turbidity as a proxy for aggregation. Turbidity is commonly used to assess biomolecular condensation as particles, like condensates, refract light, and the resulting signal serves as an indirect measure of their number and size40. We observed no changes in turbidity for mNG while EP-mNG turbidity increased in a sigmoidal fashion with an inflection at 17.2% ± 0.6% (w/v) PEG2k (Fig. 1B). We then chose 20% (w/v) PEG2k as a constant and assayed protein concentration for turbidity changes (Fig. 1C). Again, mNG turbidity remained constant while EP-mNG increased with an approximate inflection at 33.1 µM ± 0.4 µM.

A The model EP from PduP is an amphipathic, 18-residue α-helix fused to the amino terminus of the protein cargo by a disordered linker. The residues depicted in the helix representation are shown below it. Turbidity assays are used to assess particle formation from EP fusions as a function of B molecular crowder PEG2k and C protein concentration. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 4 replicates. The arrow in (C) indicate the samples taken for imaging. D Confocal imaging reveals the presence of condensates in solution for samples containing EP fused cargo. E Photobleaching experiments show minimal/no fluorescence recovery.

The above data suggested that the EP tag can result in particle formation in solution. However, turbidity assays cannot differentiate between cargo aggregation and condensation41. We investigated this by imaging turbid samples (Fig. 1C, arrow) with laser scanning confocal microscopy. Imaging showed no structures formed by mNG itself (Fig. 1D). In contrast, EP-mNG was able to spontaneously demix and form spherical droplets in solution (alongside some amorphous material), which is suggestive of phase separation coupled to percolation (PSCP)42. Biomolecular condensates that form through PSCP should display changes in their viscoelastic material properties as a function of time42. We tested the material state of these droplets by performing a fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiment to monitor the recovery of fluorescence43. If liquid-like, droplets will experience quick recovery of fluorescence (typically <60 s timescale) in bleached zones owing to rapid exchange and equilibration of bleached and unbleached molecules. The droplets formed by EP-mNG, however, did not experience significant recovery over a qualitative 2-min sampling (Fig. 1E), indicating slow internal dynamic rearrangements indicative of a gel-like state. The droplets were further commonly observed in arrested fusion states that never resolved (Supplemental Fig. 1A) and likewise reminiscent of gelation. We also found that if our usual order of component addition was inverted (protein from a concentration stock added last) then these mid-fusion assemblies or larger aggregates, which appear as numerous unresolved droplets, were more commonly observed (Supplemental Fig. 1B). These data suggest that these assemblies undergo rapid networking which cannot sufficiently resolve into distinct droplets when triggered from a concentrated protein stock. This, and their inability to recover quickly from bleaching, suggests that EPs enable PSCP to form physical microgels and that transitions in their viscoelastic properties happen on relatively short timescales.

We next sought to understand if EP-driven condensates can include more than one component. We tested this by mixing purified mNeonGreen (G) and mScarlet-I344 (R) either with (G1 or R1) or without (G0 or R0) an EP fusion and measured the results by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), turbidity, and imaging methods (Fig. 2A–C, respectively). Mixed samples with no EPs (G0R0) were unable to produce a significant FRET or turbidity signal and confocal imaging found no condensates in solution. Samples which included an EP only on mNeonGreen (G1R0) showed a slight decrease in FRET signal and high turbidity. Imaging results indicated that the turbidity was a result of mNeonGreen condensates with a weak outer halo of mScarlet-I3. The slightly lower FRET signal was likely due to mNeonGreen condensation in solution, which limited mScarlet-I3 interactions. Lastly, samples with EPs on both proteins (G1R1) produced the highest FRET signal and turbidity equal to G1R0 samples. Confocal imaging showed that G1R1 condensates were formed from co-assembled mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I3, which agrees with FRET data. EP-dependent co-assembly was also tested with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I3 cargoes fused to different EPs (Fig. 2D). Here, mNeonGreen fused to the EP of PduD (part of the signature enzyme complex PduCDE in the Pdu BMC)45 and mScarlet-I3 fused to the EP of PduP were mixed together to test their co-assembly. Microscopy shows that the PduD EP can condense mNeonGreen alone and support co-assembly with the PduP EP. Together, these data demonstrate that different EPs can drive specific homo- and heterotypic co-assembly of multiple cargoes in vitro.

A Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to assess assembly of a donor mNeonGreen (G) and acceptor mScarlet-I3 (R) with (1) or without (0) N-terminal EP fusions. FRET was calculated by subtracting the emission of mNeonGreen by itself at the peak acceptor emission wavelength (590 nm). Significant FRET only occurred when both cargoes have encapsulation peptides. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 3 replicates. B Turbidity assays of samples confirm particle formation only when at least one cargo had an EP. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 3 replicates. C Confocal imaging showed that specific co-assembly of mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I3 only occurred when they both had EP fused to their N-termini. D Similarly, co-assembly is observed with heterotypic mixes of EPs, with mNeonGreen fused to the EP from PduD (green text) condensing with mScarlet-I3 when it is fused to the EP of PduP (red text). In both (C) and (D), mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I3 were excited with the 488 and 561 nm laser, respectively.

Our model system gives us an opportunity to screen EP self-assembly through simple turbidity measurements. EPs have traditionally been thought to act solely through relatively non-specific hydrophobic packing interactions predominantly along their apolar face (Fig. 1A)32,46. We confirmed this by performing multiscale (integrated coarse-grained and fully atomic representation) MD simulations by inspecting the dimerization process of two EP helices. Using the Martini 2.2 force field, self-assembled structures were backmapped into their correspondent fully atomic representation and equilibrated at microsecond range using the charmm36m force field47,48. A residue contact map of tightly associated helices agrees with the notion that hydrophobic residues, for instance I10, form the closest and most abundant contacts between bound helices (Fig. 3A, black boxes) and have been previously implicated with being critical for cargo encapsulation within microcompartment shells but not self-assembly32. A closer look at simulated EPs also identified an antiparallel salt bridge network formed by E7 of one helix and R11 from the other spaced by exactly one helical repeat (Fig. 3B). We tested the importance of these residues by making several point mutations and compared their condensation propensity as a function of NaCl concentration (to disturb the salt bridge) and protein concentration. The mutations we chose to assay are R11K (conserved mutation), R11A (removal of salt bridge), E7D (side chain one carbon shorter), I10S (disrupt hydrophobic core), and a double E7R/R11E mutant which swaps the relative orientation of the salt bridge.

A A distance matrix of two assembled PduP EPs shows that the closest interactions are from hydrophobic residues (black outlines) along the apolar face. B Computational models of EP dimers suggest that they prefer an antiparallel orientation, which results in a salt bridge network between E7 and R11. The heteroatom distances are represented by dashed lines with distances (in Angstroms) calculated in PyMol. Several mutants were made, and their condensation propensities were screened by measuring turbidity as a function of C NaCl for electrostatic screening and D total protein concentration. These data demonstrate that EP self-assembly is sensitive to ions and condensation can be negatively impacted by disrupting the salt bridge and hydrophobic core. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 4 replicates.

A salt titration assay confirmed that all EP mutants, to varying extents, resulted in turbidity and that turbidity is negatively impacted by increasing salt (Fig. 3C). At low salt saturation, the R11K and E7R/R11E mutants performed similarly to the wild-type PduP EP, confirming that functionality is conserved. However, as expected by its hydrogen bond strength, high salt concentration had slightly more effect on the R11K mutant. The E7D mutant, which may simply weaken the salt bridge, was less robust than the R11K mutant but more robust than the R11A mutant, which completely removed that interaction. Further, the inflection points of all salt bridge mutants were shifted left towards lower concentration (140 mM for WT versus 80-100 mM for mutants), revealing a heightened salt sensitivity. Among these, the double E7R/R11E mutant demonstrated the greatest dependence on NaCl concentration, suggesting that the relative orientation influences assembly and other factors may be important. Confocal imaging of the wild-type PduP design shows that increasing salt results in reorganization of droplet-like condensates into aggregates, which then dissolve at a high enough concentration (Supplemental Fig. 2).

These trends were further reflected when titrating protein concentrations (Fig. 3D). Again, WT and R11K performed similarly, while salt bridge mutants showed an intermediate self-assembly propensity. The I10S mutant had no assembly propensity. The double E7R/R11E mutant performed similarly to WT, indicating that, under these assay conditions, the salt bridge is sufficiently recapitulated in a reverse orientation and promotes condensation. These results indicate that the computationally predicted antiparallel salt bridge is real and impacts self-assembly strength of EP domains. The most critical residue we tested, however, is I10 within the hydrophobic core.

Most BMCs use EPs to accumulate cargo within their shells29. This includes β-, but not α-, carboxysomes, which use the C-terminus of the protein CcmN to drive associations between CcmM-RbcLS coacervates and the shell28. The C-terminal extension of CcmN proteins have been regarded as EPs because they literally link cargo-shell interactions. This is a very different arrangement for cargo inclusion interactions compared to metabolosomes, wherein EPs typically exist fused to enzymatic cargo as opposed to CcmN, which acts as a discrete intermediary between enzymatic cargo and the shell. Sequence comparisons of several candidate metabolosome and CcmN EPs showed that metabolosome EPs largely conserve the salt bridge related residues we have identified with a sequence spacing corresponding to one helical repeat (Fig. 4A). The EPs of CcmN, however, do not carry these sequence elements. We investigated this further by screening the ability of different EPs fused to mNeonGreen to trigger biomolecular condensation of this cargo. In addition to our PduP model, we also selected PduD (swapped charges, similar to our E7R/R11E PduP mutant), PduE (reportedly not sufficient for cargo encapsulation45), EutC (different BMC), and CcmN (from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942)26,28. All metabolosome EPs (PduDEP, EutC) were found to result in cargo condensation to varying degrees (Fig. 4B). PduD was the most robust, followed by PduP, EutC, and finally PduE. Meanwhile, the CcmN EP was not able to trigger significant cargo aggregation. Protein droplets were likewise found to exist in all metabolosome EP samples, albeit in co-existence with fibril-like clusters in the case of PduE and EuC, but not with CcmN (Fig. 4C). These self-assembly trends were likewise recapitulated with in vivo overexpression, with CcmN unable to drive cargo partitioning (Supplemental Fig. 2A, B).

A An alignment of several EPs revealed that metabolosome EPs carry oppositely charged residues separated by one helical repeat. These elements are not maintained in carboxysomal CcmN sequences. Basic residues are colored blue, acidic are red, and apolar are green. B A turbidity assay demonstrated that these sequence differences result in CcmN being unable to condense cargo under conditions that trigger condensation for metabolosome EPs. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 4 replicates. C Aliquots from turbid samples (arrow in B) were imaged with confocal microscopy. Spherical droplets were observed in all metabolosome samples, to varying extents (arrows) and most clearly defined in PduP and PduD samples. CcmN did not drive droplet structures.

Our computational calculations demonstrated that EPs can form a specific salt bridge when paired in an antiparallel orientation (Fig. 3B). This association, however, splays open the hydrophobic core between the helices, indicating additional association capacity. We experimentally tested this by fusing serial repeats of the PduP EP and its native linker (EP1, EP2, EP3) to the N-terminus of an mNeonGreen cargo (Supplemental Fig. 3A). More repeats were not investigated due to issues cloning higher copy numbers, likely owing to the repetitious nature, despite our best efforts to mitigate sequence repeats. We hypothesized that this synthetic arrangement of intrinsic valency, mimicking a more classic stickers and spacers arrangement, will either (1) increase binding capacity linearly or (2) form intramolecular arrangements (due to proximity and connectivity) that self-quench binding capacity and lead to diminishing returns. We assayed these designs for self-assembly propensity and found that the EP2 design moderately outperformed the EP1 while the EP3 performed similarly or slightly worse than the EP2 (Fig. 5A). Specifically, curve inflections for the EP1, EP2, and EP3 designs were found to be (in µM) 33.1 ± 0.4, 15.5 ± 1.0, and 19.7 ± 1.9, respectively. The morphology of all samples was also similar, and all shared the ability to form droplets across a wide range of concentrations (Fig. 5B). We note that these images alone could not establish a threshold concentration for condensation, which may lay presumably in the low micromolar to high nanomolar range depending on assay conditions. Here, increasing protein concentration increased both the size and quantity of droplets from all designs. These designs were similarly assayed for response to PEG2k concentration with identical trends observed (Supplemental Fig. 4A). These results suggest intramolecular valencies above two may quench additional associations (Supplemental Fig. 4B–D), thereby providing evidence for associations greater than a dimer.

A Turbidity was measured as a function of protein concentration for synthetic EP designs where EPs were fused in serial to the cargo N-terminus. Additive copies had diminishing results. Error bars represent the standard deviation from the mean from 4 replicates. B Despite differences in sequence topology and condensation propensity, confocal imaging showed all designs formed similar condensates in solution across a range of concentrations (in µM). C MD simulations were conducted with two, three, four, or five EP helices to study their preferred assembly state as a function of exposed hydrophobic surface area and root mean square deviation (rmsd). Simulations with two or three EPs coalesced to one basin with low rmsd, while those with four or five showed two dominant populations. D Structural analysis of these basins revealed that EP assembly is associated with salt bridge interactions along their solvent exposed surfaces and maximize hydrophobic packing.

To understand the higher order association mechanism, we resorted to MD calculations to analyze the saturation binding capacity of EPs. In addition to dimeric association, we also tested simulations of 3, 4, or 5 associated PduP helices with the enhanced coarse-grained (CG) approach to access information on systems we could not experimentally create. The equilibrated CG configurations were transformed to atomic resolution and re-equilibrated at microsecond range, data which is summarized as a function of both positional variance (RMSD) and exposed hydrophobic surface area (Fig. 5C). Simulations with 3 helices coalesced towards one single basin composed of two overlapping species in parallel and antiparallel configurations, with the orientation of one helix being swapped between the two. These configurations closely align structurally (Supplemental Fig. 5A), agreeing with the low RMSD and exposed hydrophobic surface area (Supplemental Fig. 5B), but show slightly different salt bridge networks between E7, R11, and E16 (Supplemental Fig. 5C). Meanwhile, configurations composed of 4 or 5 helices formed two basins. Representative configurations for the different basins are provided in Fig. 5D, highlighting the helical association. In particular, the 3-helix configuration remained very stable and formed a tightly packed bundle, a result which was observed in four different replicates. In contrast, other stoichiometries (4 and 5 helices) led to unstable bundles that transition between configurations. In either case a trimeric bundle was observed in basin 2 which led to a single or dimeric helix that is unstably associated (Fig. 5D). Dimerization also leads to a configuration that was stabilized by a series of hydrogen bonds (as described before); however, the abundance of exposed hydrophobic core makes this configuration rather unstable and hypothesized as a metastable intermediate structure towards trimerization (Supplemental Fig. 6).

We further investigated whether trimerization would lead towards higher ordered configurations by self-assembling stable trimeric helices at different concentrations in silico. Aided by the latest Martini 3 force field49, we characterized the self-assembling propensity of EPs in the trimeric configuration (summarized in Supplemental Fig. 7). Even using high peptide concentrations (20 µM), our data indicates that trimeric bundles (with no cargo attachment) barely associate in solution. In fact, total peptide concentration must be at least one order of magnitude higher to observe larger assemblies. These insights led us to conclude that optimal trimeric bundles are expected to initially guide the association of EP domains, while localization would further enhance the interaction of these bundles, cooperatively affecting the condensation process.

The lack of a conclusive condensation enhancement by the EP3 construct in our experiments (Fig. 5A) led us to hypothesize that self-quenching may reduce the interaction of the tandem repeat. CG simulations were performed comparing EP2 and EP3 designs which show that covalently connected EP sequences can self-interact, effectively reducing the number of available binding sites for network extension (Supplemental Fig. 8). The computed equilibrium between different configurations indicates that the EP3 design can self-bind to the extent of completely closing the number of available binding sites, partially explaining the condensation results of our tandem sequence designs. The EP2 construct would always have additional networking capacity even if the domains intramolecularly dimerize (Supplemental Figs. 4B–D and 8). The EP3 design, in contrast, may have one more interaction site available, however, the self-blocking can potentially hinder further network extension.

Our in vitro model system thus far has included strictly monomeric proteins, which differs from those natively tagged with EPs and may not reflect physiological reality. For instance, PduP is a homotetramer50 and PduCDE, which has EPs on PduD and PduE, is a dimer of trimers51. We investigated the effects of binding site valency by again implementing our serial EP designs fused to a monomeric mNeonGreen against a tetrameric E2-Crimson52 (hereafter Crimson) to differentiate between intrinsic and emergent valency, respectively (Fig. 6A). We sought to explore the functional differences between these two arrangements in vivo to gain a proper understanding of EP-driven assembly in living cells. Accordingly, we overexpressed these designs in Escherichia coli and used laser scanning confocal microscopy to image their phenotypes in vivo (Fig. 6B). Both the wild-type mNeonGreen and Crimson showed a uniform fluorescence inside of cells. Meanwhile, increasing the EP copy number on mNeonGreen similarly increased the segregation of multiple (typically 2+) mNeonGreen cargo foci within the cells. This effect was also observed with a single EP copy fused to Crimson cargo, which formed single elongated foci. We quantified this effect by calculating a partition ratio (the intensity of background subtracted foci divided by non-foci areas of the same cell) which is analogous to how much denser foci are compared to the dilute areas of the cell (Fig. 6C). Quantification in this way gives the mNeonGreen and Crimson controls a median partition ratio close to 1.0, indicating uniform fluorescence distribution throughout the cell. This analysis further shows that, in contrast to our in vitro tests, additive copies of EP domains increased partitioning up to ninefold over the mNeonGreen control for the EP3 design. This effect was exacerbated in the EP-Crimson design, which was able to achieve a median partition ratio of over 500, making it nearly all-or-nothing. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of valency in driving cargo networking and that our serial repeat design likely prefers intermolecular, and not intramolecular, associations in vivo. We believe these differences compared to our in vitro experiments may stem from the dense cytoplasmic milieu inhibiting specific intramolecular associations and promoting intermolecular networking.

A We tested the cargo partitioning performance of serial EP designs on a monomeric mNeonGreen cargo (intrinsic valency) and on a tetrameric E2-Crimson cargo (emergent valency). The mNeonGreen structure is from PDB 5LTR and E2-Crimson is represented by a tetrameric DsRed 1GGX. B Overexpression of designs for intrinsic valency showed that increasing valency increased partitioning ability. The emergently valent EP1-Crimson showed elongated single foci. Arrows denote several example foci within each sample. C Partitioning was calculated by the quotient of background subtracted foci signal over non-foci signal. This analysis confirmed that partitioning increases with additional EP domains and that emergent valency outcompetes intrinsic in all cases. Medians are denoted within each sample with the black bar. **** denotes p < 0.0001 given by an upaired t-test. D Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showed that the EP2 and EP3 designs differed in their recovery rates, but both were liquid-like. Standard deviations are represented by the infill. E FRAP was calculated by normalizing the background subtracted (yellow circle) intensity of bleached foci (red arrow) to another unbleached foci (white arrow) within the same cell. Scale bar, 1 µm.

We next assayed the material state of EP-driven foci within cells by measuring in vivo FRAP43. Here, single foci within cells were bleached with a laser pulse and their fluorescence recovery was monitored with 0.5 s intervals. FRAP experiments were focused on comparing the relative differences between EP2 and EP3 designs (Fig. 6D) due to quick recovery of EP0 samples and EP1 foci being hard to find. FRAP was calculated by normalizing the background (yellow circle, Fig. 6E) subtracted fluorescence of bleaching foci (red arrow) to an unbleached focus (white arrow) to see when separate foci equilibrated. The EP2 and EP3 designs were able to achieve full re-equilibration relative to unbleached foci within 2 min and with half-times of 16.2 s ± 8.5 s and 27.2 s ± 14.6 s, respectively. We note that this is slower than recovery of free fluorescent protein, which is on the order of a few seconds53. This contrasted drastically with results from cells expressing EP-Crimson, which demonstrated a linear and incomplete recovery profile within this timeframe, indicative of a gel-like state (Supplemental Fig. 4)22,23,43. The relatively large errors may stem from different distances between bleached and unbleached foci within cells, therefore leading to longer diffusion distances. Despite this, the recovery curves of EP2- and EP3-mNG were significantly different (p < 0.001). This experiment alone cannot determine if the difference between the EP2 and EP3 designs stem from diffusion rate differences (EP3 is larger and may migrate slower) or due to slight changes in their condensed material states. However, it would make sense that the EP3 does equilibrate slower than EP2. The EP3 design likely forms more intermolecular contacts to shift equilibria, a function of on and off rates, as informed by its increased partition ratio and thereby slowing equilibration. These results demonstrated that EP-driven condensation in bacteria was liquid-like in contrast to our in vitro results; and in equilibrium with the excluded cytosol, and not inclusion bodies, which have been demonstrated to not recover during similar experimentation43. Further, topological rearrangements of EPs can be used to encode for different cytosolic behavior.

Overexpression of a single protein fused to the PduP EP can partition it between a condensed and dilute phase in vivo. However, more complex arrangements exist naturally, and multicomponent systems would be desired synthetically. We first tested the ability of a single mNeonGreen cargo to partition when co-expressed equally (assumed from ribosomal binding sites) with mScarlet-I3 and mTagBFP254. Designs were made with mNeonGreen encoding for up to three EP repeats and given a nomenclature based on the gene ordering and number of EP repeats (Fig. 7A, top). For instance, a design with two repeats only on mNeonGreen is named G2R0B0 (for green with two EPs, red with zero, blue with zero). Constructs were overexpressed and mNeonGreen partitioning was calculated as before. The general trend of more EP repeats leading to greater partitioning was again observed (Fig. 7B, C). However, the effect was muted compared to the single-expression designs, which we suspect stemmed from a competition for resources between the three proteins during expression. That is, the competition may have lowered the effective expression, and therefore concentration, of EP domains and reduced mNeonGreen fluorescence was observed again, confirming the specificity. In addition, the G3R0B0 expressing cells also reveal dark spots in the red and blue scans where the mNeonGreen appeared to localize, suggesting exclusion of non-EP tagged proteins.

A Synthetic operons were designed with three different fluorescent cargos of mNeonGreen, mScarlet-I3, and mTagBFP2 to test specific single and multicomponent partitioning. These designs were given a nomenclature based on the gene order and number of EP domains fused to that cargo. Here, EP repeat elements are signified by white rounded rectangles and ribosomal binding sites by gray lines. B Overexpression of designs expressing EP domains only fused to mNeonGreen showed only green components in foci formed. C As in the single-protein designs, more EP domains resulted in increased partitioning of the EP cargo. D Fusing EP domains to all cargo resulted in their co-assembly into condensed “zebra-striped” bands within the cell. Calculating the partitioning of these cargoes either (E) separately or F combined again showed that additive copies enhance combinatorial cargo partitioning. For all plots, n = 100 cells and the median partition ratios are denoted.

Next, we added in a series of equal repeats of EP tags to all three fluorescent proteins to encourage multicomponent assembly (Fig. 7A, bottom). Confocal imaging of designs again confirmed that G0R0B0 showed no signs of visual foci (condensation or aggregation) (Fig. 7D). Calculating the partition ratio likewise gave values of near 1.0 (Fig. 7E). We also calculated a summed partition ratio (Fig. 7F) which is the sum of all background subtracted foci signals divided by the sum of the background subtracted cellular background. For the G0R0B0 design, this value again came to 1.0, indicating no partitioning without EPs. Noticeable partitioning began to occur with the G1R1B1 designs (Fig. 7D), which correlated with increased partitioning of the individual (Fig. 7E) and total (Fig. 7F) components. The partitioning becomes even more pronounced in cells expressing the G2R2B2 designs, with cell exhibiting a highly overlapping zebra-strip patterning (Fig. 7D). The individual partitioning of components within the G2R2B2 expressing cells was not equal (Fig. 7E) but followed the same trends as the G1R1B1, suggesting that the characteristics of the individual proteins themselves can influence partitioning, as we found that mScarlet-I3 cargo shows a moderately increased EP-dependent partitioning ability compared to mNeonGreen (Supplemental Fig. 10). However, the total partitioning continued to increase (Fig. 7F) and suggests that the total sum, or concentration, of EP domains drives overall partitioning.

This study focused on defining the ability of EP domains to drive self-condensation of fused cargo proteins. We found that EPs resulted in cargo partitioning both in vivo and in vitro using predictive computational simulations and wet lab experiments. This self-assembly depended on hydrophobic packing and salt bridge interactions. These interactions sum to a preference and specificity for trimeric associations. The sequence determinants are conserved among metabolosome EPs but not CcmN from carboxysomes, resulting in CcmN's inability to promote self-condensation. Further, cargo partitioning was entirely modular and solely dependent on the inclusion of the EP domain both in vitro and in vivo.

Our data elucidates design principles for how EPs self-assemble. Prior work had found that the hydrophobic core is critical to encapsulation within microcompartment shells32, and we confirm that same propensity applies for EP self-assembly too. In addition, we discern previously unidentified salt bridges that also stabilize EP self-assembly. These salt bridges can form in a multitude of arrangements - our MD simulations suggest a preference for trimeric associations for the PduP EP. Salt bridge formation can form between various residues, including E7 and R11, in both parallel and antiparallel configurations. In agreement with the MD calculations, our in vitro data showed that, among the several PduP EP mutants we screened, I10 was the most critical residue in enabling condensation. Supported by the proposed trimeric packing mechanism, mutation of the central isoleucine nearly removed all condensation ability, while disruptions to salt bridge related residues only moderately decreased condensation propensity and demonstrate that salt bridge formation alone is not sufficient to drive EP associations. As such, we propose that EP trimerization is initially enhanced by non-specific hydrophobic packing, which then enables accessory salt bridge formation for further stability and specificity. However, EPs themselves are not sufficient for condensation alone at the concentrations we experimentally validated (Supplemental Fig. 7). Rather, we believe the trimeric bundles initially guide protein association to develop a high local concentration, which further enhances their interaction, cooperatively promoting the condensation process. These findings refines conventional notions where EPs are regarded as any short amphipathic α-helices separated from cargo by a flexible and poorly conserved linker within a microcompartment context29,30. Instead, we identify sequence elements that guides specific higher order networking.

We tested the self-assembly of several different commonly cited EPs from PduD, PduE, PduP, EutC, and CcmN28,30,45,55,56,57. We were motived by the notion that β-carboxysome EPs (encoded on CcmN) act strictly as intermediaries between the procarboxysome and the shell, while metabolosome EPs (encoded on PduDEP, EutC) reportedly act as a single module to aggregate and encapsulate cargo. Further, CcmN is present in very low copy numbers in β-carboxysomes58 while metabolosome EPs dominate interior interactions between themselves and the shell59. We noted that the sequence motifs in metabolosome EPs found to be important were missing from CcmN (Fig. 4A). We provide experimental evidence that the CcmN EP does not result in clear condensation under the same conditions as metabolosome EPs (Fig. 4B), which is congruent with its physiological role as a low-occupancy tether26,58. Our imaging also demonstrates metabolosome EPs can broadly trigger biomolecular condensation of fused cargo (Fig. 4C). This data makes us believe that, while the CcmN EP may be able to guide cargo encapsulation into synthetic β-carboxysome shells60, it cannot be used to guide robust cargo packaging alone since it lacks the ability to self-assemble. Using metabolosome EPs, in contrast, would likely be a more robust packaging strategy for building synthetic microcompartments or shell-free enzyme partitions. EPs are still an apt name for both metabolosome and β-carboxysome EPs given their ability to package cargo within BMCs. However, a sub-categorization of “assembly peptides” may be more appropriate for metabolosome EPs, which have a second role in self-assembly and could better reflect their functional diversity. In any case, an updated and more rigorous bioinformatic investigation into EP domains to better grasp their functional landscape is warranted.

Subtle differences also exist within metabolosome EPs. We observed that all our selected EPs could trigger biomolecular condensation, but the success varied (Fig. 4B). The EP from PduD is found to be the most robust, followed by PduP, EutC, and PduE. This agrees with recent observations that PduCDE, led by PduD EP, triggers hierarchical assembly of accessory cargo components in Pdu BMCs34. Importantly, comparing the EPs from PduD and PduP (as well as our E7R/R11E mutant) shows that the relative positioning of oppositely charged residues can be swapped as long as they maintain a sequence distance of one helical repeat. Still, other residues not explicitly tested in this work may also contribute to EP condensation. For instance, our MD calculations identified that E16 of the PduP EP may help to stabilize bundles in combinations with E7 and R11 (Supplemental Fig. 5). This notion is tentatively supported by our PduP E7R/R11E mutant, which would create at least one electrostatic clash (Fig. 5D) that may explain its heightened salt sensitivity (Fig. 3C). Further, the E16 position is not conserved among metabolosome EPs (Fig. 4A) and correlates with their condensation phenotypes. For instance, PduD and PduP have an acidic residue at that position while EutC, with weaker condensation strength, has a polar serine. The weakest EP we tested, from PduE, has an acidic residue at that position. This may also explain why EutC and PduE form more fibril like structures alongside some condensates (Fig. 4C). Additionally, the weak ability of the PduE EP to trigger self-condensation mirrors its prior described inability to package cargo within microcompartments and that these two functions may be related45. While our data presented cannot explicitly explain the differences between different EPs, we speculate that, in addition to specific residues like E16, it may also relate to helical stability by flanking residues. For instance, circular dichroism of synthetic produced PduD and PduP EPs has shown that the PduD is more helical in conformation37. A more stable helix could increase the entropic contribution during binding as we have observed in simulations on the PduP EP. As such, rationally designing stable helices, in conjunction with the critical sequence elements we identify, may provide a strategy for producing non-native EPs with tunable properties32.

One surprising finding was that the organization of EP valency (intrinsic versus emergent) drastically changes cargo partitioning and can mediate their material state in vivo. Intrinsic valency refers to when a molecule has more than one binding site encoded within that molecule, while emergent valency arises from the assembly of multiple subunits, thereby increasing the number of binding sites per molecule (diagramed in Supporting Fig. 4B–E)42,61. Serial additions of EPs onto monomeric mNeonGreen (intrinsic valency) resulted in fluid foci with moderate partitioning abilities, while a single EP on tetrameric Crimson (emergent valency) turbocharged partitioning and significantly lowered liquidity, demonstrated by dramatically slower photobleaching recovery in vivo. Our EP-Crimson design exemplifies emergent valency that is more reflective of all characterized EP fused enzymes. These findings suggest that BMC cargoes, which largely demonstrate emergent valency, can self-nucleate at a low saturation concentration and sequester nearly all cargo components during biogenesis. In native instances, the size of these assemblies may be determined by the co-expression of distinct shell proteins playing a kinetic race to truncate the growing cargo globule62,63. In the propanediol microcompartment specifically, the shell factors PduABK have all been strongly linked to cargo packaging with interactions supported along their interior-presenting convex surfaces31,37,59,64,65,66. Cargo valency and EP domain topology may be key considerations when packaging non-native cargoes to ensure robust network formation in addition to shell targeting and packaging. While any one single EP does not adhere to the canonical stickers and spacers architecture61, higher order cargo oligomers (dimers, tetramers) act as an emergent topological mimic thereof. In addition, we cannot disregard that an in vivo environment would modulate the self-assembly properties due to a higher viscosity of the intracellular environment, which may explain the discrepancy between the in vitro and in vivo behaviors.

In addition to valency effects derived from protein quaternary structure, which exacerbate EP network formation (Supplemental Fig. 5E), the biophysical features of cargo subunits themselves may also influence condensation. For instance, we found that mScarlet-I3 cargo regularly displays a higher partitioning ability than mNeonGreen cargo in vivo (Supplemental Fig. 10), despite both being noted to be strictly monomeric with low aggregation tendencies67. However, increased localized concentration (leading to condensation) is a driving force for non-specific protein interactions, a mechanism which we proposed is exacerbated by the non-covalently crosslinking of EPs68. We do note that EPs are found on a variety of enzymes with different quaternary states, biophysical features, and biochemical roles29. Indeed, the history of synthetically implementing EP biotechnology in both shell-free and shell-bound systems argues in favor of their broad application for assembling diverse cargoes36,69. These findings are congruent with the natural role of EPs as a modular assembly peptide5.

Our experimentation shows that salt bridge interactions, while not the predominant factor, help guide EP condensation. Knocking out the salt bridge makes cargo condensation both more sensitive to NaCl and lowers overall condensation propensity (Fig. 4C, D). These results suggest that EP-driven cargo nucleation events may be environmentally responsive to cellular conditions, including ions. This would not be without precedent, as biomolecular condensates have been found to be regulated by metabolites, ions, and environmental conditions22,70,71. Additionally, condensates themselves are recently being appreciated as also selecting for metabolites and small molecules72. Taken together, these notions suggest that prometabolosomes and EP-driven condensates could partition, and be influenced by, specific cofactors and metabolites during biogenesis73,74,75. Environmental responsiveness to redox status has been observed for CcmM-driven condensation12 in β-carboxysome biogenesis but further investigations for metabolosomes are warranted.

There is great interest in developing small peptides that self-assemble into biomolecular condensates. Synthetic peptides have been developed with this in mind and have well-defined phase diagrams and controllable properties. However, many of these are intrinsically disordered, heavily utilize π–π stacking interactions, and/or rely on non-specific mechanisms for protein co-envelopment, which mechanistically differs from the EP domain76,77,78. Other synthetic and naturally implemented condensation systems rely on accessory partners for network formation, particularly nucleic acids79,80,81,82,83,84. These characteristics apply equally when also just considering naturally occurring systems in bacteria1. The closest analog to our knowledge is the PopZ microdomain, which has been adapted into the fully modular and tunable PopTag23,85. Still, the EP domain is more compact than the PopTag and serves dual roles in cargo self-assembly and microcompartment encapsulation. Futher, the occurrence of EPs N- and C-terminally fused to diverse enzymes suggests these are tractable in a wide range of chimeras5,29. These features make the EP domain standout and have high potential to serve as a platform for future biotechnological development.

Metabolosomes can package an array of enzymatic functions within a wide array of microbes. Nature has supported this functional diversity by evolving a function agnostic, one-size-fits-all assembly approach. At its core lies the structural and functional features of the EP domain, which can be leveraged as a molecular tool to assemble disparate cargos in vitro and in vivo in a controlled, predictable manner. In vivo, these complexes may be used to scaffold target metabolic pathways for improved catalytic efficiencies (for example, substrate channeling). The applications for in vitro EP-driven phase separation are more diverse, for example: encapsulation of therapeutic molecules, stabilization of cell-free biomanufacturing systems, self-healing materials, among others. This work will help spur additional hypotheses on modes of assembly and rational design efforts using EP for biotechnology applications.

A complete list of primers, synthetic gene fragments, and plasmid names used in this study can be found in the Supplemental Materials. Briefly, all cloning used the NEBuilder® HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (#E5520S), Q5® High-Fidelity 2× Master Mix (#M0492S) and/or KLD Enzyme Mix (#M0554S) offerings from New England Biolabs. Gibson assemblies were carried out using 0.02 pmol of backbone with a threefold molar excess of insert. All gene fragments were ordered from Twist Biosciences as codon optimized for E. coli and assembled into a pre-linearized pET11a backbone. All primers were purchased from IDT. Gibson assembly reactions were completed at 50 °C for 20 min and then immediately frozen at −20 °C until transformed into NEB5alpha chemically competent E. coli (#C2988J). Transformation was performed by incubating cells with assembly mix (<10% total volume) for 10 min on ice, heat-shocked at 42 °C for 30 s, then recovered in SOC media for 30 min at 37 °C prior to plating. Clone screening was performed on miniprepped plasmid DNA with whole-plasmid sequencing offered by Plasmidsaurus. PCR reactions were performed at 50 µL scale using a 15 s/kb extension time and appropriate primer annealing parameters. PCR reactions were treated directly with 1 µL of DpnI (#R0176S) to remove template DNA for 30 min at 37 °C followed by cleanup and concentration using the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit (#D4034) and quantified with a Qubit dsDNA BR kit (#Q32850) from Invitrogen. For PCR mutagenesis, 1 µL of successful PCR was directly mixed with KLD Enzyme Mix for 10 min at 25 °C and frozen until used directly for transformation.

Appropriate plasmids were transformed fresh into NEB T7 Express (#C2566H) competent E. coli. Single colonies were used to inoculate 4 mL of 2 × YT broth and carbenicillin antibiotic and grown overnight at 37 °C, 250 RPM. Overnight cultures were then used to inoculate 250–500 mL of 2 × YT supplemented with antibiotic in baffled flasks and grown to an optical density at 600 nm of ~0.6–0.8 at 37 °C, 250 RPM. At that density, cells were briefly cooled to room temperature prior to the addition of IPTG to 100 µM and continued incubation at 20 °C and 250 RPM for 16–18 h. Cells were harvested the next day via centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min) and frozen at −20 °C for at least 30 min. Thawed pellets were then resuspended at 5 mL/g wet cell pellet in NP40 High Salt Lysis Buffer (RPI, #N32000) supplemented with 0.5 mM PMSF, 0.5 mg/mL egg white lysozyme, 5 mM MgCl2 and 12.5 U/mL recombinant benzonase (Syd Labs, #BP4200). The suspensions were lysed at 25 °C for 30 min with constant agitation. Insoluble material was then removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatants were then decanted into new tubes and stored on ice while the pellets were resuspended in an additional 10 mL of lysis buffer (as above) and incubated for an additional 20 min. The insoluble matter was removed as before, and the supernatants were combined. The supernatants were then incubated at room temperature with 1 mL of PureCube 100 Ni-INDIGO agarose beads (#75105) equilibrated into Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.0) on an end-over-end rocker for 30–60 min at room temperature. Proteins were then purified by gravity flow with 15 mL of washing (Buffer A + 25 mM imidazole) and 5–8 mL of elution (Buffer A + 500 mM imidazole). Proteins were then dialyzed into Buffer A such that remaining imidazole was <0.1 mM using 10 K MWCO Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassettes from Thermo Fisher (#66380). In some instances, protein was dialyzed into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 without additional salt. Proteins were then concentrated and quantified by A280 before normalization to 200 µM and flash freezing into liquid nitrogen to store for future use. SDS-PAGE profiles of purified proteins can be found in Supplemental Fig. 6.

Turbidity assays were performed in 96-well plate format in quadruplicate and setup with the help of an Integra Assist Plus liquid handler in either standard (200 µL) or half-area (100 µL) plates. When assaying protein concentration effects on turbidity, stock sample was serially diluted into Assay Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl pH 8.0) with appropriate mixing prior to adding an equal volume of Assay Buffer supplemented with 40% (w/v) PEG2k to reach a final value of 20%. When assaying the effects of crowding agent, an equal volume of PEG2k at a 2× final value in Assay Buffer was added to diluted protein solutions. Lastly, the effects of salt were assayed by first serially diluting a stock solution of 20 mM Tris-HCl, 5 M NaCl pH 8.0 with 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, before addition of appropriate protein (25 µM final concentration) and finally by addition of 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 40% PEG2k. In all cases, turbidity was measured at 600 nm in a Biotek Synergy plate reader. In all cases, error bars represent the standard deviation from the reported mean.

Condensation reactions were prepared at room temperature in triplicate 100 µL volumes in a 96-well half-area plate. Briefly, reactions were performed in 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20% (w/v) PEG2k with 20 µM mNeonGreen (donor) and 5 µM mScarlet-I3 (acceptor). Reactions were mixed via pipetting and left to equilibrate for 5 min before reading turbidity and FRET in a Biotek Synergy plate reader. A control sample consisting of 20 µM mNeonGreen alone was used to subtract the non-specific FRET signal.

For in vivo imaging, protein expression was carried out using the same conditions as when expressing protein for purification. Samples were harvested with centrifugation (3000 × g, 2 min) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4. Samples were then spotted into a prepared 1.5% agarose pad in PBS, spread and dried for 5 min prior to imaging on an Olympus FV3000. For in vitro imaging of droplets, 5 µL of each sample was sandwiched between two coverslips and imaged directly. The 405 nm laser line was used to excited mTagBFP2 and 488 nm laser line for mNeonGreen, 561 nm laser line for mScarlet-I3 and. Images were colored in ImageJ and are presented without further modification beyond cropping. ImageJ was also used for quantification of partition ratios by measuring the mean gray value of background subtracted foci and non-foci regions within cells. In all cases, n = 100 for partition ratio calculations. Photobleaching experiments, both in vivo and in vitro, were completed by imaging 5–10 s of pre-bleach sample at 0.5 s intervals prior to spot irradiation with the 488 nm laser for 0.5 s at 50% output. Images were then collected at 0.5 s intervals for 2 min. Bleaching quantification was performed in ImageJ.

For any given system, simulations were run in four independent replicates. PduP EP models were based on the observed solution structure31 and modelled using Modeller86, imposing a helical structure conformation. The helical structure was then equilibrated and simulated in a periodic box using the charmm3687 force field and the Gromacs88 molecular dynamics engine. Equilibrated peptides were later represented using the Martini coarse-grained force field in its version 2.2. This step was used to explore the dimerization process of two independent helices and to extract equilibrated configurations, which were backmapped into fully atomic structures using our developed pipeline89. The process was repeated to simulate trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. We also ran simulations of equilibrated trimeric bundles at varying peptide concentrations (0.02, 0.04, 0.08, and 0.1 mM, respectively) to characterize the formation of larger bundle aggregates. Simulations were run with the latest Martini 3 force field to prevent excessive aggregation, which can mislead conclusions49. Each system was composed of 80% water and 20% PEG. Finally, we built EP2 and EP3 tandem structures with Modeller to characterize self-EP association within the construct. Topologies were represented using an updated version of the Martini 3 to better match the dynamic properties of the disorder linker region90.

All atomistic simulations followed the same protocols as provided here. Each backmapped peptide system (dimers to pentamers) was centered in a cubic box, hydrated, and neutralized with 150 mM KCL. The size of the box was chosen to create at least 1.5 nm of padding on each side along the largest atom-atom distance of the peptide. A constant temperature of 310 K was maintained using velocity Langevin dynamics91 with a relaxation time of 1 ps. A constant isotropic pressure of 1 bar was maintained using the C-rescale approach with a relaxation time of 1 ps and compressibility of 4.5105 bar. Covalent bond lengths involving hydrogens were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm92 with a tolerance of 10-6 nm. Water molecules were rigidified with SETTLE93. Lennard-Jones interactions were evaluated using a cut-off where forces smoothly decay to zero between 1.0 and 1.2 nm. Coulomb interactions were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald) approach. In total, 4 simulations were performed for each system with an aggregated time of 4 µs.

Coarse-grained simulations with the Martini 2.2 version were run as previously described94. Simulations were carried out at 310 K using isotropic pressure coupling at 1 bar with a time step of 20 fs. Non-bonded Lennard-Jones potentials used a cutoff radius of 1.1 nm. The reaction field method was used for electrostatic calculations95. The cutoff distance for dielectric constant was set to 1.1 nm. Within the cutoff, the dielectric constant was 15, and beyond the cutoff it was infinite. The velocity Verlet algorithm96 was used for integrating Newtonian equations. Temperature was controlled by a Langevin dynamics thermostat with a coupling time constant of 5 ps. Box pressure was controlled using a C-rescale method. For each CG MD production run, frames were saved every 100,000 time steps (every 2 ns). Configurations were categorized using the gmx cluster tool using the gromos approach. Simulations with Martini 3 were performed using the recommended parameters from the original work49.

Achieving the Global Biodiversity Framework will necessitate whole production systems contributing towards ‘halting and reversing' net biodiversity loss, counterbalancing negative impacts with comparable gains. Here, we report on an illustrative quantitative exploration into the feasibility of monitoring for positive net biodiversity outcomes for the Dutch dairy production sector, using a composite metric. We analysed performance data from 8,950 dairy farms across the Netherlands, combining these data into an integrated biodiversity index. Usefully, this index allowed us to calculate sectoral baseline biodiversity impacts, and explore possible biodiversity strategies. We show that the largest overall source of impacts is imported feed; interestingly, nutrient loads contribute little to the footprint, despite representing an important political issue nationally. This highlights a general risk in using single indices to track net biodiversity outcomes: that they could result in an exclusionary focus, and perverse outcomes. Consequently, we develop safeguards to accompany the index; showing the necessity of incorporating safeguards, but also that meeting them could reduce sectoral biodiversity impacts by ~94%. Our proposed strategies vary in feasibility, all requiring trade-offs between biodiversity, land availability, and production.

In late 2022, the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted the Global Biodiversity Framework, aiming to “halt and reverse biodiversity loss to put nature on a path to recovery”1. Achieving this mission requires addressing biodiversity impacts not only from direct economic activities but also those embedded in global supply chains. Agriculture, as a leading driver of biodiversity loss, presents both challenges and opportunities in this context2,3. The path to global nature recovery will involve combining reactive mitigation for negative impacts on biodiversity with proactive biodiversity conservation and restoration initiatives4. Key principles will include that biodiversity impacts caused by economic development are quantified, reduced where possible, otherwise compensated for through biodiversity offsets, and accompanied by additional proactive conservation initiatives; leading to net positive biodiversity impacts overall. Here, we explore ‘net outcome' approaches on biodiversity at the scale of a national agricultural production system (the Dutch dairy sector, using data collected via the established Dutch ‘Biodiversity Monitor'), as one necessary step in quantifying pathways towards global biodiversity goals.

The idea of ‘net outcome' type mechanisms for biodiversity (i.e. those that seek to quantify biodiversity losses and sum them against comparably quantified gains, to calculate a net outcome for biodiversity) is not new, and currently forms the basis of established or emerging policy in over 100 countries worldwide, a growing conservation portfolio, as well as underpinning environmental markets worth billions of dollars a year5. Many of the theoretical challenges associated with achieving neutral or even positive net outcomes have been explored in the scientific literature—with the most acute current barriers more related to practical considerations, e.g. monitoring, implementation, and demonstration in practice (e.g. refs. 6,7).

Crucially, in implementing the Global Biodiversity Framework, it will be insufficient to consider only the direct biodiversity impacts of economic activities, but also necessary to consider their indirect impacts on biodiversity that are embedded in the supply chain. This thinking partly underpins the emerging concept of ‘nature positive'3,8—a specific type of positive net outcome approach—current definitions for which are explored in ref. 8, but which under the definition we assume (see below and www.naturepositive.org) is directly aligned with the CBD post-2020 mission. The evaluation of biodiversity impacts for specific organisations—both direct and indirect—as a basis for developing positive net outcome-type strategies (again, of which ‘nature positive' is one example), has started to receive attention in the recent scientific literature9. This includes efforts to understand the organisational impacts of food consumption10. Nonetheless, of all of the key sectors in the global economy, agriculture is one that has seen relatively little attention in terms of net outcomes approaches. Agriculture will be an extremely influential sector in developing net outcome pathways: fundamental to society, but a leading global cause of biodiversity loss (e.g. refs. 11,12,13), and one that will play a key role in whether international agreements on climate change can be achieved14. Equally, agriculture could play an important role in biodiversity recovery—not only through reduction of impacts, but through restorative practices15. Further, agriculture as a sector represents a clear illustrative example of the challenges in trading off any efforts to stay within physical planetary boundaries with efforts to ensure society can meet core social objectives on wellbeing16.

Here, we use an illustrative case study of dairy production in the Netherlands. Dairy farming could feasibly help support represent a ‘land sharing' approach to nature conservation: cows grazing at low densities in herb-rich grasslands, interspersed with certain well-connected landscape elements, could provide habitat for a substantial diversity of wild species. However, such landscapes have diminished globally because of a focus on dairy production efficiency, with dairy farmers primarily paid for milk sold in a competitive global market where their contribution to biodiversity receives little reward. The Dutch Sustainable Dairy Chain (DuurzameZuivelKeten, or DZK)—a collaboration between key public and private dairy organisations in the Netherlands—has recently shown interest in calculating net biodiversity outcomes associated with national dairy production; and understanding to what degree the sector could support nature positive goals.

In defining nature positive, the Nature Positive Initiative states “Companies and financial institutions can contribute to the Nature Positive goal by taking these high-level actions: Assess their material impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities; shift their business strategy and models; commit to science-based targets for nature; report their nature-related issues to investors and other stakeholders; transform by avoiding and reducing negative impacts, restoring, and regenerating nature; collaborate across land, seascapes and river basins; and advocate to governments for policy ambition”. A key point here is the concept of contributing towards an overarching absolute nature positive objective (say, on the scale of the Netherlands); which DZK could begin to do by first assessing impacts, and then developing a positive net outcome strategy within the production sector itself (see refs. 8,10,17,18). Note also that a nature positive pathway is considered by the NPI to be one in which connected global challenges beyond biodiversity (climate change, water use, other forms of environmental pollution—alongside other sustainability issues, such as human wellbeing) are solved in tandem; but here, we focus on biodiversity. Similarly to multiple other organisations, DZK has sought in the first instance to track net biodiversity outcomes against a strategy using one main focal biodiversity metric, acting as a proxy.

Our analyses are underpinned by data collected using the Dutch Biodiversity Monitor. The Biodiversity Monitor for Dairy Farming, developed by FrieslandCampina, Rabobank and WWF (World-Wide Fund for Nature) Netherlands, aims to enable Dutch dairy farms to improve biodiversity outcomes whilst ensuring sustainable revenue. It uses seven key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the environmental impacts of individual dairy farms (both positive and negative). The Biodiversity Monitor consequently provides the basis of one potential system for calculating losses and gains of biodiversity towards a net positive impact; by combining KPI data treated as environmental pressures, characterising those pressures into biodiversity impacts in terms of the potentially disappeared fraction (PDF) of species, and aggregating these into a single measure of PDF.year (Fig. 1; see the “Methods” section); i.e. the fraction of global species richness that could be lost if the relevant pressure persisted.

A flow diagram showing the calculation of the specific biodiversity indicator we use here to track net biodiversity outcomes. Process incorporates biodiversity monitor key performance indicator data into a single aggregated index, measured in ‘PDF.year'. PDF potentially disappeared fraction.

Here—having developed an integrated biodiversity index to act as a metric for monitoring progress towards a nature positive goal, we: (a) calculate overall sectoral impacts for a baseline year; (b) define a set of biodiversity ‘safeguards', i.e. sub-targets to be achieved to ensure that a net positive outcome measured using the integrated index would not lead to perverse outcomes (e.g., by exceeding physical limits linked to one or more planetary boundaries); and (c) discuss broad strategies that could take the sector from baseline impacts towards positive net outcomes for biodiversity.

The baseline biodiversity impacts calculated for Dutch dairy production were the annual impacts for the year 2020, measured in terms of PDF.year (where PDF is the potentially disappeared fraction of species; Fig. 2). The KPIs from which the PDF-year estimates are derived (Fig. 1) come from a screened dataset consisting of 8950 farms (see the “Methods” section), which was then factored up to represent the whole sector—a total of 14,542 farms covering 870,880 ha19. The largest source of biodiversity impacts under our analysis comes from land transformation—mostly linked to the production of ingredients used in purchased feeds (e.g., concentrates and other roughage and by-products). Ingredients derived from oil palm products were linked to ~60% of land use change impacts associated with purchased concentrate feed (noting that land transformation impacts from soy, one of the key ingredients, were assumed to be zero, due to the sector currently sourcing 100% RTRS or equivalent certified soy). The second highest source of impacts was associated with land use change on farms within the Netherlands (negative impacts from land transformation and positive impacts from land restoration). This was calculated from annual reductions and increases in ecologically valuable landscape components (“Nature & Landscape”) and areas of herb-rich grassland: for example, a farm that reduced/increased its area of Nature & Landscape elements relative to the previous year would incur an associated biodiversity loss/gain. These losses and gains were then summed across farms to obtain the sectoral values.

Annual biodiversity impacts for the year 2020, in –PDF.year, broken down per KPI. LUC land use change, NL impacts within the Netherlands. Note: Other embedded impacts (non-LUC impacts) from purchased feed include those from land occupation, marine and freshwater eutrophication, and water consumption. Embedded greenhouse gas emissions associated with feed are included under the GHG emissions KPI. NPI net positive impact.

Impacts from other KPIs are comparatively lower than those from land-related KPIs, which is consistent with land use change being the primary driver of global biodiversity loss20. However, this does not negate the importance of other KPIs (e.g., nitrogen soil surplus, ammonia emissions) which are particularly important as drivers of local to national biodiversity loss, and highly contentious issues within the Netherlands. It is commonly advised not to focus on the results for biodiversity footprints in PDF.year or similar metrics in absolute terms, but on the relative impacts across activities, which is more instructive9.

Though the practice is not uncommon, there are challenges in seeking to achieve a biodiversity net outcome measured using a single composite index. Not only are there considerable uncertainties in organisational biodiversity proxies (including those based on LCIA); there is also the potential to mask undesirable outcomes. For example, good performance against the index overall could reflect excellent performance across six KPIs, and unacceptable performance against the seventh. Consequently, we identified a set of safeguards specific to the Dutch dairy case to be implemented in conjunction with the biodiversity index; seeking to avoid perverse outcomes, and allowing biodiversity strategy to be set at the level of midpoint pressures rather than on the basis of the biodiversity index.

In the context of this project, based on literature review and stakeholder consultation (see the “Methods” section), we define a ‘safeguard' as: a standard put in place to ensure that a positive net outcome is achieved while limiting any unintended, undesirable, or perverse biodiversity outcomes (given that ‘net outcomes' approaches have at times led to the latter6).

Table 1 lists identified values for each safeguard category (see the “Methods” section), defined at the sector level (i.e., not for individual farms), and categorised into two groups that apply at different points of the mitigation hierarchy (a widely used framework for the preferred sequence of actions to take in mitigating biodiversity impacts, see e.g. ref. 3):

Safeguards (1) and (2) define the minimum impacts that should first be avoided or reduced (i.e., the ‘unacceptable' impacts on biodiversity). These are determined from ‘static' goals or standards—such as the goal to buy 100% responsibly sourced soy, or to adhere to nitrogen standards as set out in the EU Nitrates Directive.

Safeguards (3)–(5) define how unavoidable impacts should be compensated in line with best practices for biodiversity (e.g., through restoring or offsetting). These are determined by the type of impacts that have taken place (e.g., the habitat types and locations that have been affected), and when those impacts occurred.

Given the potential importance of the identified safeguards in developing a net positive strategy, we calculated the baseline values for current sector performance against each Biodiversity Monitor KPI separately (Fig. 3).

Progress against proposed safeguards for 2020, with a range of scenarios included for comparison. Best practice = top 10th percentile; worst practice = <50th percentile. herb-rich grassland (HRG) and Nature and Landscape KPIs have high levels of uncertainty having been extrapolated from fewer data points. While the change in herb-rich grassland between 2019 and 2020 matches well with the ‘Natural Grassland' figures reported by CBS for the dairy sector, our estimated total value of HRG is about three times larger than the Natural Grassland value reported by CBS for 2020.

If all biophysical safeguards listed in Table 1 were met, the annual impact would be substantially less—but still, positive net outcomes (labelled for this specific project by DZK as net positive impact or NPI) would not be achieved without additional offsetting efforts (Fig. 4).

Comparison between 2020 impacts vs. impacts if all proposed preventative safeguards were met at the sectoral level.

Our finding that a main contributor to overall sectoral biodiversity impacts is land use change in the supply chain is not necessarily unexpected (see refs. 8,10). However, the degree to which it dominates the biodiversity impact risks is; obscuring the importance of nitrogen surplus and ammonia emissions (as environmental, social, and political concerns) in the Netherlands. Thus, if any strategy was optimised using this index without safeguards as we proposed, it would run the risk of ignoring the importance of nutrient balances as a key issue in the Netherlands specifically. Biodiversity impacts can be considered at global, national, or local scales, and be assigned markedly different values across these scales—necessitating the inclusion of safeguards partly derived from local perspectives when performing calculations based on headline indicators and global trade flows. The safeguards employed here are specific to the Dutch case study, but the safeguard categories (Table 1) are not; the same categories could be used to structure safeguards for other agricultural production systems or even other sectors entirely. In essence, these categories draw from decades of work into biodiversity impacts mitigation hierarchies, extended to organisational or sectoral scales (see refs. 2,3,4,9).

Safeguards are likely especially important when one considers the degree of variability in results that can be obtained under the application of slightly different LCIA methods to calculate biodiversity footprints21; as without safeguards, any net biodiversity strategy developed based on that footprint would be highly sensitive to the specific LCIA route chosen. But targets for biodiversity could be set around the mid-point environmental pressures used in the LCIA process—in this case, the KPIs reported under the Biodiversity Monitor, which form part of the set of safeguards—as they are more precisely calculated and understood. In the meantime, the calculated endpoint biodiversity outcomes remain a useful tool for headline tracking of progress towards the desired net outcomes. Such an approach would be entirely consistent with current thinking on biodiversity impact calculation and disclosure, as recommended by, e.g. the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures22 or equally by policies such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive; which themselves are explicitly aligned with guidance on biodiversity target setting as per the Science Based Targets Network. Interestingly, meeting the safeguards alone in this case would potentially take dairy production in the Netherlands a long way towards fully mitigating biodiversity impacts (Fig. 4). It would also be a mechanism for ensuring alignment with other relevant existing policies and standards, at EU level and beyond (see detail in Table 1).

Importantly, beyond the likelihood that the use of safeguards would help avoid perverse outcomes for biodiversity, there will be other red lines from the perspective of the Dutch dairy sector associated with ‘mission critical' (and consequently unavoidable) impacts on biodiversity (see ref. 9). In particular, since there is a requirement for milk production to continue, there will remain some inevitable negative impacts on biodiversity, which will require ecological compensation (such as biodiversity restoration offsets). The overall amount of dairy produced by the sector every year is a fundamental consideration, and whether dairy production is to increase, remain stable, or decrease year on year. The types of scenarios displayed in Fig. 4 should be interpreted in that context. For instance, if we apply linear regression to farm-level data, we find that: kg milk produced per hectare trends downwards with increasing % protein produced on farms' own land (coefficient = −0.6), and trends upwards with increasing purchased concentrates per ha (coefficient = 0.9). It is important not to over-interpret these relationships, as they do not imply causation, and a full statistical treatment of the data would require far more nuanced analyses which is beyond scope here. However, such relationships would align with the reasonable contention that reducing biodiversity impacts via limiting feed imported from overseas will either require intensification of feed production within the Netherlands to maintain production or an overall reduction in milk production. So if the goal was to maintain dairy production while reducing the amount of feed purchased from overseas, there would be a requirement to give more land over to protein production within the Netherlands, implying less space to implement restoration of herb-rich grasslands and/or Nature and Landscape components to support domestic biodiversity gain. More extensive farms tend to be slightly larger on average, which may imply (given the positive relationship between purchased feed and production) that farm intensity rather than size plays a more substantial role in maintaining higher levels of production. In the case where the distribution of impacts by farm shifted to substantially lower impacts—such that farms in the current 90th percentile for impacts met current 50th percentile standards on those KPIs—we estimate that the result would be a 48% reduction in net impacts (in PDF.year) relative to 2020 values (Fig. 5). That might be considered more of an ‘even contribution' approach towards net positive biodiversity outcomes, in which lower-performing farms were required to meet current ‘average' performance. However, extrapolating based on correlations between KPI scores and production, this would also result in a ~26% reduction in milk production (assuming the same efficiency in processes and number of farms). Such nuances as those discussed in this paragraph, and the trade-offs associated with them, demonstrate the need to couch discussions around biodiversity metrics and relevant safeguards within a broader framework for sustainable development, which requires more detailed investigation than we have the space to perform here. Considerations, though, would certainly include those around the socio-economic implications of any given strategy for farmers nationally, as well as the implications internationally; particularly, for instance, in those regions that currently produce feed that is then exported to the Netherlands.

Comparison between 2020 impacts vs. impacts if farms below current 50th percentile standards on the index improved performance to current 50th percentile levels, based on the integrated index scores.

Considering all components of the analyses reported here, what possible pathways exist for the Dutch dairy sector to contribute towards nature positive i.e. the Global Biodiversity Framework post-2020 mission? We lay out three broad hypothetical pathways, with different implications for the sector, and therefore varying feasibility (although, arguably, with each option sequentially showing increasing alignment with global targets under the Global Biodiversity Framework). These are:

‘Adaptive compensation' approach: In the case in which the mid-point KPI safeguards are seen as aspirational rather than strict ‘red-line' limits, a scenario could involve making incremental progress year on year towards meeting all safeguards at the sector level—with all remaining annual impacts (initially close to baseline 2020 levels; Fig. 2) offset through restoration measures in the Netherlands and overseas. The offset activity required would be large but could be determined year on year via the methods here. Offsets would ideally commence in the same year as the impacts for which they compensate, with any delays leading to the use of multipliers (see ref. 23). Under this category of approach, it would be recommended to evaluate progress at milestones towards 2030 and on to 2050, to determine (a) the degree of feasibility of meeting all KPI safeguards, and (b) the practicality and cost of eventually implementing sufficient biodiversity offsets to compensate residual impacts.

The approach is a ‘compensation' (i.e. offsetting) focused approach (see ref. 9), with small initial efforts at impact prevention that increase steadily over time. It is a more feasible option in terms of the challenges of maintaining dairy production and of meeting safeguards. But this option could be costly in terms of financing biodiversity offsets requirements, where in any case offsetting should be a less preferred option on the spectrum of the mitigation hierarchy.

‘Even contribution' approach: In this case, the initial focus would be on working with all farms in the lower-ranked 50% (index performance), seeking improvements that bring them up to the equivalent index score as the current 50th percentile (Fig. 5). Since these calculations are based on the integrated index score, and not on separate KPIs, they inherently incorporate some of the key interactions between KPIs. The result would be extensive prevention of biodiversity impacts for those farms, whilst those in the upper ranked 50% (again, by index score) would either continue business as usual or voluntarily seek improvements. The residual impacts would be compensated through biodiversity offsets, which would likely be far less extensive than in pathway 1 above. However, this is predicated on maintaining the number and area of existing farms; and the result of that (alongside achieving a drop in biodiversity impacts) would be a commensurate drop in dairy production. Our analyses—in the absence of any improved efficiencies in dairy production (which might allow greater production levels)—indicate a possible drop in dairy production of ~26%. The approach combines biodiversity impact prevention and compensation. However, it makes abundantly clear that there are inevitable trade-offs between biodiversity restoration, land availability for the dairy sector, and dairy production.

‘Deep net positive' approach: This approach can be considered a maximum impact prevention approach. In one version of this case, all safeguards would be met at the sector-level (broadly assuming trade-offs at farm-level can be at least partly avoided), reducing impacts substantially (by ~94% according to our calculations; Fig. 4) and requiring minimal offsetting. In itself, this latter finding—that meeting basic biophysical and social safeguards (as outlined in Table 1) could proportionally deliver much of the progress needed towards neutralising biodiversity impacts—is worth underlining, and again emphasizes the usefulness of designing strategies based on multiple midpoint pressures and incorporating safeguards. Aside from the necessary changes in dairy production volumes, the deep net positive approach is appealing as it is likely not the case that a ‘one size fits all' approach can or should be taken to applying the KPIs safeguards to farms. What this type of scenario does usefully do is illustrate the extent of the change needed if the sector were to take a primarily ‘avoidance focused' approach towards meeting the net positive biodiversity target.

While considering pathways towards net positive outcomes, it is important to consider the issue of uncertainty in calculating impacts in the first place. The uncertainties involved in estimating biodiversity impacts using LCIA approaches—though considered the best available current practice—are numerous, and well documented24. Analyses specifically pertaining to the biodiversity impacts of dairy organisations based in the Netherlands have shown that even the relative impacts of different organisational activities can vary depending on the precise methodology employed21. This means in turn that nature strategies building on biodiversity footprints must be designed to account for uncertainty in the underlying approaches. It is not possible to make quantitative estimates of the uncertainty bounds involved, which remains a key research question for nature-positive efforts more generally7,24; rather, net positive strategies will likely have to be designed flexibly and with adaptive management practices built in.

Further, the safeguards outlined here were constructed around a combination of policy and literature review alongside non-systematic regional expert stakeholder consultation (see the “Methods” section). In principle, this provided a defensible basis for developing safeguards for our purposes. However, we note that the full application of a safeguards approach in practice would require a more detailed and nuanced stakeholder analysis, that is more widely built upon local knowledge, and systematically includes representatives of key stakeholder groups (see e.g. ref. 10).

The implementation of the Biodiversity Monitor has enabled us to perform a quantitative estimate of the Dutch dairy sector's biodiversity impacts; here, we have done so based on established methodologies for Life Cycle Impact Assessment. This study shows one path for developing an integrated biodiversity index for a sector, and strategically developing key areas for targeting biodiversity impact reduction (e.g. land use change linked to purchased feed). However, our key conclusion here is that the strategy must also be guided by efforts to meet a suite of safeguards—both biophysical and social—which we identified in this case through literature review and stakeholder consultation. Otherwise, the use of the single index to guide strategy might result in certain important impacts sources being overlooked (for example, if certain impacts were estimated to be less substantial using the index methodology in question than they were under another methodology21), or some other perverse outcome (e.g. there is considerable scope for perverse outcomes when implementing compensatory measures like biodiversity offsets19,23,25). Furthermore, given the limitations inherent in any biodiversity metrics, we suggest that actual nature strategies tracked using LCIA-type metrics might be usefully structured around the midpoint environmental pressures exerted on nature. This is even more important when considering that biodiversity is only one aspect of nature recovery, and of sustainable development more broadly. Consequently, any biodiversity metric used to track progress will necessarily sit within a much wider monitoring framework featuring multiple dimensions of sustainability; GHG emissions, water consumption, and beyond.

The use of strategic safeguards linked to midpoint pressures, alongside an overarching index for tracking biodiversity outcomes, ends up providing a clear path forward for any biodiversity strategy. Meeting the safeguards alone would clearly take the sector a long way toward neutral net biodiversity outcomes. These conclusions are derived in relation to our case study but are likely generalisable to many other systems, in agricultural sectors and beyond: most sectors will have to construct indices for monitoring trends in net biodiversity outcomes if they are to track progress towards the Global Biodiversity Framework. Indeed, there are many regions with higher intact biodiversity than the Netherlands, for which balancing conservation and agricultural production is perhaps even more urgent. All countries have targets for biodiversity conservation alongside agricultural production under the Framework (e.g. Target 10 on enhancing sustainability in agriculture, Target 16 on enabling sustainable consumption), which approaches such as that taken here could support. For the reasons given here, organisations, sectors, and even nation-states should consider developing biodiversity strategies through mid-point pressures, and systematically develop safeguards alongside the key biodiversity metrics employed.

Our focal biodiversity metric is based on LCIA approaches, as is current good practice for comprehensive biodiversity footprinting (see e.g. ref. 7). The metric was based upon the KPIs monitored via the Biodiversity Monitor (see ‘Introduction'). Not only do these KPIs represent key pathways by which environmental pressures could impact biodiversity (e.g. GHG emissions, eutrophication); but they have also been agreed as relevant for DZK through a lengthy process of stakeholder engagement, and crucially, reflect data that are collected and therefore available to track long-term progress towards net biodiversity outcomes. To create a biodiversity index that integrated the KPI data (steps visualised in Fig. 1), conceptually, we:

Gathered available KPI data (measures of environmental pressure) for the seven KPIs described in the Biodiversity Monitor, for all dairy farms in the Netherlands. Note that there are at least three additional possible KPIs not currently included in the Biodiversity Monitor which the authorship team felt could be relevant for incorporation into future iterations of the Biodiversity Monitor, but for which data are not currently available. These are pesticide use, water consumption, and phosphorus soil surplus;

Treating each KPI as a ‘mid-point' environmental pressure10, converted each KPI value into an estimate of biodiversity impacts using characterisation factors from the LC-Impact methodology. This was done at the level of KPIs for each individual farm—fully anonymised—to then be aggregated into a biodiversity impact per farm. Again, this is measured using the unit ‘Potentially Disappeared Fraction' of species over time (PDF.year), which should be interpreted as an indicator for proportional contribution to global species extinction risk25. Here, PDF.year is used as a proxy indicator for combining and comparing biodiversity impacts across a range of mid-point pressures/KPIs; and,

Summed PDF.year values across all farms to provide an estimate of biodiversity impacts over a given year for dairy production in the Netherlands.

We include the seven KPIs described in the Biodiversity Monitor: GHG emissions, nitrogen soil surplus, ammonia emissions, area of permanent pasture, area of herb-rich grassland, area of managed land (labelled ‘Nature & Landscape'), and ‘protein produced on own land/in farmer's own region' (Table 2). The raw data underpinning the KPIs was used e.g. the actual area of different land use types, CO2(e) value for GHG emissions, etc. (Fig. 1). ‘Protein produced on own land/in farmer's own region' is an indicator of the level of self-sufficiency (e.g., feed produced on own land), but is consequently indicative of the environmental footprint in other parts of the world (e.g., to grow ingredients like soy, used in concentrate feeds). To calculate the environmental impacts associated with purchased feed, we make use of the FeedPrint NL database developed by Wageningen University & Research, Blonk Consultants, and GFLI. KPIs were assumed to qualitatively correlate either positively or negatively with biodiversity impacts (e.g. the greater the emissions of GHGs, the more negative the impacts on biodiversity = negative correlation; Table 2).

We note the following assumptions:

though the KPIs for ‘Nature & Landscape' and ‘herb-rich grassland' represent a range of different land management regimes (e.g., meadow bird management, landscape management, soil management, etc.), we treat them uniformly;

the biodiversity index is calculated by farm and then aggregated. We assume that biodiversity gains across all farms have equal weight, and do not, for example, consider any strategic spatial placement of biodiversity gains as part of core areas or corridors;

characterisation factors in LC-Impact24 are based on models that predict biodiversity losses per functional unit in terms of global species extinctions. To estimate biodiversity gains associated with certain activities e.g., Nature & Landscape management, we assume it is meaningful to apply these factors in reverse. This is a necessary assumption since, as far as we are aware, there are no comparable methods that model biodiversity gains from such a broad range of activities. Not only does this introduce some further uncertainty, but also we acknowledge that there is a temporal aspect here (in that reversing losses of biodiversity would likely take longer than causing it).

Data were available at farm-level for 14,686 farms in total, with values spanning the time period 2018–2020. Since 2020 was the only year for which comparable data were available across all of the KPIs collected under the Biodiversity Monitor, it was chosen as the baseline year. Data on the herb-rich grassland and Nature & Landscape KPIs were provided by Royal FrieslandCampina (RFC), with data on the remaining KPIs and contextual data provided from the KringloopWijzer (KLW) database. To convert KPI values into a biodiversity index value for the sector as a whole, we converted KPIs provided as relative values (e.g., kg CO2e per kg milk, or kg NH3 per ha) into total/absolute values per farm, by multiplying by either the total farm area or total milk production per farm. Datasets were matched based on unique farm identifiers, but all farms were anonymised.

Farms were excluded from the analysis if they did not report comprehensive data under the Biodiversity Monitor across KPIs, for land area, or on production. Similarly, farms were excluded if there were discrepancies between the total area reported for the farm, and for the different summed habitat components (e.g. for different grassland types across the KPIs). We note that there is a possibility that exclusion could lead to analytical biases in terms of the types of farms that had data gaps/mistakes, though this is not something we can assume. Since the relevant farms were those that by definition we could not calculate biodiversity impacts for, due to data gaps/mistakes, this is not something we analysed. Instead, we note this as a potential issue and an avenue for further research. After screening, the final dataset consisted of 8950 individual farms (62% of all dairy farms in the Netherlands, based on a total number of dairy farms recorded by CBS in 2020 of 14,54219).

For each farm, the total area of combined temporary grassland and cropland combined was estimated by subtracting the area of permanent grassland from the total area of the farm. Yard area was assumed to be minor, and so not considered in this analysis. Areas of grassland/cropland were then adjusted to account for areas provided for Nature & Landscape. These Nature & Landscape management areas provided in the RFC dataset were separated into four categories, based on the type of land the measure would be applied to (e.g., grassland, cropland, or landscape element—as per the Cumulatie and Grondgebruik table provided by Boerennatuur) and also based on the biodiversity weighting per management package, (provided in the Beheerpakketten Biodiversiteitsmonitor (BBM) documentation and associated appendices26,27). These categories are shown in Table 3. The distinction between these four categories was necessary for biodiversity index calculations, separating areas of low-intensity farming (which it is assumed would have a relatively low biodiversity impact compared to more intensive areas) from farmland habitats capable of generating absolute biodiversity gains. It was necessary to exclude some management packages from calculations in order to avoid double counting by area: specifically, BBM107 and BB107 (‘Bodemverbetering grasland met ruige mest', ‘Bodemverbetering bouwland met ruige mest', ‘Bodemverbetering met ruige mest', ‘Chemie en kunstmestvrij land') as they are applied in combination with other management packages.

Since it was not always possible to determine from the dataset which land use types were overlapping (e.g., whether HRG was included under temporary or permanent grassland). The following assumptions were therefore made:

Area of HRG was subtracted from the total area of permanent grassland; and

Areas of low-impact grassland/arable land and Nature & Landscape areas were subtracted from the assumed arable/temporary grassland area. If these values exceeded the arable/temporary grassland area, the remainder was subtracted from permanent grassland areas.

While this involves making several assumptions, it was considered necessary and reasonable as a means to account for potential double counting of areas.

For the 2020 analysis, areas of land transformation/restoration were calculated using the change in area of herb-rich grassland or Nature & Landscape management per farm relative to the previous year (2019). This calculation was only made when data were available for both years, which was the case for 1237 farms for herb-rich grassland (14% of the dataset, 9% of all farms in the Netherlands), and 3753 farms for Nature & Landscape areas (42% of the dataset, 26% of all farms in the Netherlands).

To estimate biodiversity impacts associated with purchased feed, we converted data provided on quantities of feeds into an estimated level of environmental pressure using the life cycle analysis (LCA) database FeedPrint (written consent was provided by the owners for this project). FeedPrint is also referred to in the calculation guidance for the KLW, particularly when calculating GHG emissions associated with feed, so we use FeedPrint as a consistent source for estimating all environmental pressures. FeedPrint provides ingredient- and country-level breakdown for a broad range of dairy feeds, and calculates the associated environmental pressures using the PEFCR-Feed methodology. We exported environmental data for feed components per country, with default parameters selected.

Data were provided for feed produced on the farms, and feed purchased by the farms. Feeds included concentrates, other roughage & by-products, maize, grass silage, and milk powder. It was assumed that the impacts of all feeds ‘produced' by the farm were already accounted for by the other environmental KPIs (areas of grassland, total area of farm, N/NH3/CO2e emissions associated with growing fodder, etc.), so ‘produced' feeds were excluded. Next, we assumed that ‘purchased' grass and maize silage were produced on other farms within the Dutch dairy sector, and so were also excluded to avoid double counting.

Purchased concentrates and other roughage and by-products, however, were assumed to require additional analysis (i.e., produced by other sectors within the Netherlands, and/or by other countries). The analysis of purchased feeds therefore focuses on these two types of composite feeds.

To estimate the component ingredients in concentrates we used ‘concentrate dairy standard' as a reference product, taking the ingredient and country-level breakdown directly from the FeedPrint database. ‘Other roughage & by-products' is however a much broader category of feed ingredients; to determine constituent ingredients in this category, we referred to data published by Blonk Consultants28, which provided an in-depth life cycle inventory for Dutch semi-skimmed milk and semi-mature cheese. We referred specifically to Tables 3–10 of this report (using the most recent dry matter estimates provided within FeedPrint). The country-level breakdown for each of the composite ingredients was then sourced from FeedPrint, and can be viewed directly within the FeedPrint database software. Environmental values per kilogram of ingredient per country were exported for land occupation, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and water consumption. Carbon values from FeedPrint were not used in order to avoid double counting, as these were assumed to be accounted for under the GHG emissions KPI (an assumption that follows KLW guidance).

While the area of land occupation is provided directly in FeedPrint, the area of land transformation (also known as land use change; LUC) is not. However, FeedPrint does provide estimates of carbon emissions associated with LUC, calculated using the PAS2050 methodology. Therefore, to calculate the area of LUC, we reverse this calculation using the same factors (provided in Annex C of the PAS2050:2011 guidelines). These factors are in the form of tonnes CO2e per ha per year, and are provided at local level for a set of countries. For countries not included in this list, we used the continental average.

The area of LUC was calculated for all feed ingredients except for those derived from soybean products. Soy was assumed to have no impacts associated with LUC due to the dairy sector's requirement for sourcing 100% certified sustainable soy (RTRS or equivalent; see Table 1).

There are several biodiversity metrics currently available for use in impact analysis, though none are widely accepted as standard. LCIA is an approach supported by leading frameworks (e.g. ref. 22), has precedent in the literature (e.g. ref. 29), and allows us to incorporate the full scope of environmental pressures (KPIs), converting these KPI ‘mid-points' (pressures) into an estimated aggregated end-point impact on biodiversity.

LC-Impact software was chosen here because it is one of the most recently developed LCIA methodologies (developed as part of an EU FP7 project, via a collaboration between 14 partners). It incorporates spatial differentiation for environmental impacts where relevant, as well as levels of species vulnerability and endemism—both of which are lacking to some degree in other LCIA methodologies.

LC-Impact provides a set of characterisation factors (CFs), which can be used to calculate an estimate of biodiversity impact (in PDF.year) per unit of environmental pressure – for example, PDF.year per kg CO2e emitted, or PDF.year per m2 of land occupation. These CFs are based on a set of models from the scientific corpus that link the KPI to biodiversity via a particular ‘impact pathway' (e.g., climate change, eutrophication, acidification, habitat conversion, etc.). Here, we mainly used the core set of CFs, using the marginal CF in the case of terrestrial acidification impacts linked to ammonia emissions; marginal CFs calculate the biodiversity impact of an additional kilogram of ammonia (as opposed to the average effect of a kilogram of ammonia). KPIs for CO2e emissions and NH3 emissions were combined directly with the relevant CFs. For other KPIs, further adjustments were made as follows:

Nitrogen soil surplus describes the balance between supply (e.g., from fertiliser, manure, fixation, etc.) and removal (e.g., via crops or emissions to air) of nitrogen compounds on farms. We ‘capped' negative nitrogen soil surplus values at zero—assuming that net removals of nitrogen would be highly localised, and should not be accounted for when aggregating across farms—before combining values with the biodiversity CFs. We also note for completeness that the CFs for nitrogen model eutrophication are based on a commonly applied (e.g. ref. 30, assumption of nutrient limitation—that is: nitrogen is assumed to be the limiting nutrient in marine ecosystems and phosphorus is assumed to be the limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems. As such, the impact of nitrogen soil surplus is modelled in terms of eutrophication of marine systems (this takes into account a generic soil leaching fraction for the Netherlands and nutrient transport via river systems—see Verones et al.31 for more information) rather than of freshwater systems. This could lead to impacts from nitrogen soil surplus being underestimated in our metric—although there is evidence that phosphorus is a primary driver of freshwater eutrophication, including within the Netherlands (e.g. refs. 32,33,34), and that nitrogen limitation tends to be stronger in marine systems35. Furthermore, relatively low levels of phosphorus soil surplus are reported for Dutch dairy farms—which would translate into a biodiversity impact from freshwater eutrophication several orders of magnitude lower than other KPIs ( ~ 1.4 × 10−08 PDF.year, based on an average of 7 kg P2O5 recorded on the WUR Agro & Food portal). So, though we have used the best method available, we acknowledge that this is a simplified approach. There are high percentages of eutrophic freshwater bodies in the Netherlands36, which would ideally be improved by CFs that take into account site-specific nutrient limitation and synergistic effects of nitrogen and phosphorus37,38.

For land aspects, instead of applying the relevant factors provided via LC-Impact (based on a 2015 analysis), we substitute these for CFs calculated by Chaudhary and Brooks39. According to the authors of these resources, the 2018 factors are more up-to-date and reliable and can be directly substituted into LC-Impact. This also allows differences between three levels of land use intensity (minimal, light, intense) to be accounted for; definitions for each of the land use categories can be found in the supplementary material of Chaudhary and Brooks (2018). CFs for ‘light use' pasture were applied to areas of permanent grassland, whereas CFs for ‘minimal use' cropland and pasture were applied to areas of low-impact grassland/arable land. However, since ‘low-impact arable/grassland' encompasses a broad range of management approaches with varying benefits for biodiversity, we also apply BBM weightings (see https://biodiversiteitsmonitor.nl/certificatie.html).

For herb-rich grassland or areas under Nature & Landscape measures: Any decrease in area was assumed to represent a loss of habitat, so we applied the CF for the Netherlands; conversely, the increase in area represented a gain, and we applied the CF in reverse. We acknowledge that using reversed CFs to estimate ‘biodiversity gains' is not standard; however, it was necessary since, as far as we are aware, there are no comparable methods that model biodiversity gains from such a broad range of activities. As for low-impact arable/grassland (above), herb-rich grassland and different types of Nature & Landscape management have variable effects on biodiversity, which are reflected in the BBM weightings. To avoid these weightings overestimating biodiversity gains (the maximum possible proportional change in habitat restoration is 1 i.e., 100% habitat recovery), the weightings were normalised such that the maximum possible weighting was 1. Though this means that we effectively assume complete restoration for these areas, which would not happen in reality on short timescales, this is likely within the large uncertainty bounds for applying LCIA to biodiversity footprinting in any case24.

Areas undergoing LUC would also be associated with a change in GHG emissions; emissions associated with habitat loss, or sequestration through habitat restoration. We excluded GHG emissions from LUC linked to feed production, as those were already included within the values provided as part of the KLW dataset. Then, losses of habitat area were assumed to lead to an increase in GHG emissions, calculated using the values provided in Annex C of the PAS2050:2011 guidance. For any gains in habitat area (e.g., increases in herb-rich grassland or Nature and Landscape areas), GHG sequestration was estimated using the values provided by Table 3 of Schmidinger and Stehfest40, who calculate the average potential carbon sink per continental region and food product and provide factors in kg CO2/m2/year. GHG emissions and sequestration were both combined with the relevant CF in LC-Impact.

Agricultural land released from productive use could, in the absence of action by other sectors, passively restore to natural habitat over time (e.g. ref. 41). In general, however, land released from dairy production was not assumed to deliver a biodiversity gain via passive restoration as it would likely be used for other purposes (i.e. outside of the dairy sector). This is consistent with the literature on the treatment of counterfactual scenarios in net outcomes policies for biodiversity (e.g. ref. 18). However, there could be cases in which land was set aside but still retained by dairy sector actors, and in that case, any passive restoration should be included in the overall calculations. Therefore, passive restoration of released land is included in our model in the specific scenario where total milk production remains the same or increases, alongside a reduction in land use. In such cases, we apply a high temporal risk multiplier to reflect the uncertainty in restoration timescales (see below).

Biodiversity offsets are measurable conservation outcomes (e.g., restoring species and habitats) that are widely used to compensate for residual negative impacts on biodiversity. We did not include offsets in our models here, as these are not currently a component of DZK strategy. However, offsetting could be included in future versions of our models—and we note that biodiversity gains linked to biodiversity restoration offsets would likely be needed as part of achieving net positive impact overall.

Time lags are important in conservation42. Impacts such as land use change may result in immediate biodiversity losses, but ecological gains from compensatory restoration activities may take time to accrue. Time lags are undesirable—particularly if species/habitats are threatened, or when the existence of biodiversity provides some ongoing ecosystem service that is diminished during the time lag.

A common approach is to apply a multiplier to areas being restored, in order to account for uncertainties around immediate/certain losses being compensated by delayed/uncertain future gains. The multiplier can be considered a ratio between damaged and necessary compensated amounts of biodiversity. It would be applied here as a factor to biodiversity gains, to calculate gains that account for these temporal uncertainties.

Laitila et al.23 propose a method to calculate minimum temporal multipliers associated with biodiversity restoration for offsets, which we apply to the biodiversity gains shown in Fig. 4 in the main text. Their method is based on the following parameters:

Time taken to restore different habitats (in number of years); The change in habitat condition (e.g., the proportional increase in biodiversity that is achieved by the restoration activity); A discount rate, which mathematically determines the currently perceived value of biodiversity gains that are not achieved until future years (‘net present value'); and, Permanence of the positive and negative impacts.

The values we applied for each parameter, for different restoration activities, are described in Table 4. The ‘permanence of impacts' parameter was assumed to be 30 years for all habitats, being approximately equivalent to one generation (and therefore a feasible period of time for maintaining activities). Time lag values for habitat restoration are as advised by Meli et al.41 and via habitat management guidance provided by BoerenNatuur. Discount rates are as suggested by Overton et al.43. To calculate the change/improvement in habitat conditions associated with Nature & Landscape measures, we used the existing biodiversity weightings developed for the BBM and ANLb packages, which again were normalised as previously discussed.

After characterising all KPIs in terms of endpoint biodiversity impacts using the approaches described above, biodiversity impact values (in PDF.year) were summed across all farms (cf. Fig. 1). The total impact estimated for the filtered dataset was factored up to an estimate for the production sector as a whole, based on the total number of farms (14,54219), and total area under dairy production in 2020 (870,880 ha19).

Setting any ‘net outcomes' objective requires in part that any unavoidable biodiversity impacts are adequately compensated for (e.g., through biodiversity offsets). But to specify to what extent different biodiversity losses are permittable as part of net outcomes policies—and also in the context of uncertainties in calculating overall biodiversity impacts, as discussed throughout—we propose accompanying metrics with safeguards. These can be based both on empirical biophysical limits (at the level of the KPIs), as well as socio-political values. For example, a safeguard might specify that achieving net positive impacts on biodiversity should not be based on a strategy that includes deforestation of pristine rainforest through the Dutch dairy sector's feed supply chain, or one that leads to levels of nutrient pollution within the Netherlands that are unhealthy for humans or wildlife. Further, strategies for biodiversity can be set at the level of safeguards on the relatively certain midpoint pressures (here, the KPIs) on the environment, and then monitored through the indicative if less certain endpoint biodiversity metrics.

It is unlikely that values can be maximised for all Biodiversity Monitor KPIs. For example, there may be farm-level trade-offs between KPIs (such as between protein produced on own land and nitrogen soil surplus, if production intensity is increased) or local constraints that limit performance. Safeguards help to define the safe operating space for the sector as a whole, allowing farm-level constraints and trade-offs to be navigated while striving for a genuine Net Positive impact on biodiversity at the sector level. Safeguards therefore need to be comprehensive enough to prevent perverse outcomes for nature, but practical enough to ensure feasibility when designing strategies towards a net positive target.

In developing safeguards here, we drew upon existing good practice guidance around achieving ‘net outcomes' goals (such as net positive impacts on biodiversity), and associated topics (e.g. biodiversity offsetting). This includes peer-reviewed articles (e.g. ref. 6), business and financial institution standards and guidance (e.g., IFC Performance Standard 644, UK BNG Good Practice Principles), policy guidance (e.g., EU biodiversity strategy, Dutch Natuurpunten45), and stakeholder consultation sessions. These resources exhibit some common themes, which potentially serve as a good basis for determining categories of safeguards (Table 5).

During our research period, two stakeholder consultation meetings were organised. The objective of these consultations was not only to inform relevant stakeholders about the project but also to receive feedback on the proposed methodologies. The stakeholder consultation meetings took place virtually on December 6, 2021, and May 25, 2022 (running for 2 h in both cases). Where identified stakeholders were unable to attend the meeting, they were invited to provide feedback by email. Both consultations were hosted by the research team. Representatives from the following organisations participated in the stakeholder consultation:

Duurzame Zuivelketen (DZK)

IMAGEN

LTO

Staatsbosbeheer

Stichting Biodiversiteitsmonitor

Wageningen University & Research (WUR)

WWF France

WWF Netherlands (WNF)

The first consultation focused primarily upon the biodiversity metric, and the second consultation upon proposed safeguards. Separate documents outlining the status of methodologies were provided in advance of the meeting to attendees, and the research team presented research updates at each. Stakeholders asked questions, provided feedback, and made suggestions on how to improve the approach and methods. Finally, the project team hosted a focussed discussion about critical points where stakeholder input was essential to move forward with the project. All stakeholder inputs were recorded and evaluated, and incorporated into refinements to the methodology where relevant and appropriate.

KLW data from individual farms were linked to Nature and Landscape data from the same farms, and anonymized before being sent to the researchers i.e. completely anonymized. The data themselves are owned by ZuivelNL. The data have not been made public, so the research team is not permitted to share the dataset. Further, we use the FeedPrint NL database developed by Wageningen University & Research, Blonk Consultants, and GFLI; and, supporting data sourced from Royal FrieslandCampina and the KringloopWijzer database; again, these datasets can be requested from the corresponding owner organisations. The GLOBIO database, used to source characterisation factors for the analysis, is in the public domain.

I first thought Ford CEO Jim Farley was briefing me on a new car. It turned out to be something altogether more ambitious: A completely new way to make a car. Or, more precisely, EVs.

“No one's ever built a car in three pieces then fit them together at the end,” Farley says. “We build the front, rear, and middle. We build the whole middle, front, and the rear—and then, at the end, we put it together. No one's ever built a car that way.”

That approach stands in stark contrast to the usual way cars are made: pieced together bit by bit on a linear production line, one at a time, with engineers contorting themselves into tight spaces workstation after workstation.

Splitting the EV into three complete parts is potentially game-changing in terms of both speed and cost. In Ford's new system, an assembly line becomes an “assembly tree,” where instead of one long conveyor, three sub-assemblies run their own lines simultaneously, then join together. Because you have three smaller sections rather than an entire car to work on, it's possible to make large single-piece aluminum unicastings each for the front, middle, replacing dozens of smaller parts.

“Why do you want to build the car that way? Because the operator can build the car inside the car,” says Farley. “That's not how it works today. You have all these armatures and things to put in like instrument panels. Plus, there's no need for line-side parts, right? The parts go in the car as it's being built.”

Ford calls its new way of making EVs the “Ford Universal EV Production System,” and will spend $2 billion to set it up at the company's Louisville assembly plant. Ford says the new method will be 40 percent faster than the existing process there, and have a comparable reduction in workstations. Parts needed to make Ford's new EVs will be cut by 20 percent.

“It has 30 percent less fasteners,” says Farley, referring to the bolts, nuts, screws, rivets, clips, and clamps used to put vehicles together securely. The wiring harness in a coming midsize truck will be nearly a mile (1.3 km) shorter and 10 kg lighter. The savings go on.

A new way of making cars necessitates new car designs. That's where the “Ford Universal EV Platform” comes in: a brand new 400-volt architecture that uses this Duplo-style, three-part assembly. The scalable, modular system can be adapted to make a variety of EV shapes and sizes from B-segment cars to vans and three-row SUVs. And the mid section will use Ford-made lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) prismatic batteries that are cheaper and safer as the structural vehicle floor. That LFP battery, the kind favored in China, is 30 percent cheaper than a lithium battery.

The first vehicle from the Ford Universal EV Platform will come in 2027, a midsize four-door electric pickup with an impressively low targeted starting price of $30,000. Ford says it will be as fast as a Mustang EcoBoost, and have more passenger space than the current Toyota RAV4.

Doug Field, Ford's chief EV, digital and design officer, who formerly ran Apple's car program and was led the development of the Model 3 at Tesla, has been marshaling Ford's in-house skunkworks team secretly developing this project.

“We build a structural battery out of the cells, and that is the floor of the vehicle. So we actually built the seats on it,” says Field. So, to be clear, there's no frame or structure with a battery on top of it to which the seats are bolted—with Ford's new model the battery is the structure. How does this differ from existing cell-to-chassis or cell-to-pack technology? “This is cell-to-body,” says Field, and adds that making this all work was very, very hard.

“There's no single magic breakthrough. It's just really, really hard engineering,"" he says. ""And there's a whole bunch of problems to be solved. Like, now you have this body that has no floor, how do you keep it from bending as it goes down the line? How do you deal with the paint when you've painted the back half, but you haven't painted the front half, and then you're going to bolt them together at the end?”

“We knew we wanted to build [EVs] differently, and we decided how we wanted to build them—then we got a huge set of engineering problems we had to go solve to make that work.” The worst of these problems? “Joining the front end. Sealing, crash [strength], corrosion, dimensional accuracy—all of those things, doing those at the end is … that front end joint is definitely the most difficult.”

Yes, much of this is catching up with state-of-the-art stuff for EVs, such as zonal architecture where different functions are controlled in different parts of the car, which you can already see in the new Tesla Model Y and many China EVs. Similarly, large aluminum castings are already being used by Tesla and Chinese makers.

However, if Ford has genuinely managed to manufacture a car in three distinct and complete modules, which are then completed fully and only then bolted together, that is a genuine first. Yes, Tesla has talked about doing something like this back in 2023 with its “unboxed” EV manufacturing process, but it hasn't done it yet. In other words, Ford may have beaten Tesla to the punch here. The old dinosaur has turned into quite the velociraptor.

Almost as impressive as Ford's new modular manufacturing is the number of people and sheer speed with which the company has achieved this undeniable win. “What's really interesting is the size of the team [the skunkworks had] compared to what if Ford had to do this,” says Farley. “If we forced [Ford] do it, it would have taken five times the people.”

“When we agreed to start the program, three years ago, we hired Alan Clarke. He went into a building, and it was one person. That's how the project started,” says Field. Alan Clarke worked for Field at Tesla, where he helped create the Model 3, worked on the Y, the Cybertruck, and more. “There's people in China now who probably have passed him, but at the time he had architected more electric vehicles than anybody in the world, so he was absolutely the right person to tap. And he's also a talent magnet. He's built the team really quickly—a world-class team. A lot of people who are super excited to move from a Rivian or a Tesla and build something for Ford.”

Farley thinks that Ford's new way of making EVs is the perfect weapon to take on the Chinese automakers, the ideal example of precisely how the West needs to compete. “You've got the BYD model: 700,000 employees, 200,000 powertrain engineers. How do you beat them?"" asks Farley.

""Turns out, Doug and Alan and the team built a propulsion system that was like Apollo 13, managed down to the watt so that our battery could be so much smaller than BYD's. Their cost advantage on vertical integration on the battery is offset by innovation in the powertrain. We can't beat them on scale. We can't beat them on vertical integration. But we can beat them on innovation.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","What Does Palantir Actually Do?","https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-what-the-company-does/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Palantir is arguably one of the most notorious corporations in contemporary America. Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm's work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance.

But a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it's a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it's a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist.

Palantir has tried to correct the record itself in a series of blog posts with titles like “Palantir Is Not a Data Company” and “Palantir Is Still Not a Data Company.” In the latter, Palantir explains that “misconceptions can arise because our products are complicated,” but nonetheless, “it is absolutely possible” to accurately describe them to “people who are curious.”

The problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It's really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it's hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?”

Xia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is.

It's not that former employees literally don't know what Palantir is selling. In interviews with WIRED, they spoke fluidly about how its software can connect and transform different kinds of data collected by government agencies and corporations. But when asked to, say, name its direct business competitors, two former Palantir employees who requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences, struggled to come up with anything. “I still don't know how to answer that question, to be honest,” says one.

Juan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.”

Xia calls Foundry, one of Palantir's flagship software platforms, “a collection of different applications” that customers use to “operationalize data.” A fourth ex-employee dubbed Foundry a “super-charged filing cabinet.” While all of these descriptions are technically accurate, they could also apply to products from hundreds of other tech companies. So what sets Palantir apart?

Part of the answer may lie in Palantir's marketing strategy. Pinto says he believes that the company, which recently began using the tagline “software that dominates,” has cultivated its mysterious public image on purpose. Unlike consumer-facing startups that need to clearly explain their products to everyday users, Palantir's main audience is sprawling government agencies and Fortune 500 companies.

What it's ultimately selling them is not just software, but the idea of a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems. To do that, Palantir often uses the language and aesthetics of warfare, painting itself as a powerful, quasi-military intelligence partner. “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world,” Palantir CEO Alexander Karp says in a February 2025 earnings call, “And when it's necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.”

Palantir sends its employees to work inside client organizations essentially as consultants, helping to customize their data pipelines, troubleshoot problems, and fix bugs. It calls these workers “forward deployed software engineers,” a term that appears to be inspired by the concept of forward-deployed troops, who are stationed in adversarial regions to deter nearby enemies from attacking.

A former Palantir employee tells WIRED that the company also has code words for certain job titles—like “Delta” for a forward deployed engineer, and “Echo” for Palantir's version of a product manager—which they say are sourced from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's phonetic alphabet of code words meant for use over military radio.

A different former employee tells WIRED that Palantir staffers will often use the military term “FYSA,” or “for your situational awareness,” instead of “FYI.” Many Palantir emails, they say, also begin with “BLUF:” or “bottom line up front,” followed by a short summary of key details or events. (It's essentially the military equivalent of “TLDR,” or “too long didn't read.”) The ex-staffer says this jargon can be traced back to Palantir's first clients, which included US intelligence and military agencies.

But arguably Palantir's most recognizable jargon is borrowed from the Lord of the Rings universe. The company's name is a reference to J.R.R. Tolkien's “palantíri,” magical stones that can be used to communicate, see faraway places, and observe moments from the past and future.

Palantir's employees are also sometimes called “hobbits.” According to one former employee, a common internal motto in Palantir's early days was “Save the Shire,” a reference to the hobbit homeland, which they say was a rallying cry that reflected the company's ethos at the time.

“It was all about ‘Save the Shire' and do good for the war fighters,” the ex-staffer says. “It was all about, really, we are going in and solving hard problems.”

In response to a detailed request for comment from WIRED, Palantir spokesperson Lisa Gordon said in a statement that the company is “proud to support the US government, especially our warfighters,” and that it has never wavered from its founding mission “to support the West and empower the world's most important institutions.” Gordon added that the open letter criticizing Palantir was only signed by a small portion of the company's approximately 8,000 employees and alumni.

Underneath the jargon and marketing, Palantir sells tools that its customers—corporations, nonprofits, government agencies—use to sort through data. What makes Palantir different from other tech companies is the scale and scope of its products. Its pitch to potential customers is that they can buy one system and use it to replace perhaps a dozen other dashboards and programs, according to a 2022 analysis of Palantir's offerings published by blogger and data engineer Ben Rogojan.

Crucially, Palantir doesn't reorganize a company's bins and pipes, so to speak, meaning it doesn't change how data is collected or how it moves through the guts of an organization. Instead, its software sits on top of a customer's messy systems and allows them to integrate and analyze data without needing to fix the underlying architecture. In some ways, it's a technical band-aid. In theory, this makes Palantir particularly well suited for government agencies that may use state-of-the-art software cobbled together with programming languages dating back to the 1960s.

Palantir began gaining steam in the 2010s, a decade when corporate business discourse was dominated by the rise of “Big Data.” Hundreds of tech startups popped up promising to disrupt the market by leveraging information that was now readily available thanks to smartphones and internet-connected sensors, including everything from global shipping patterns to the social media habits of college students. The hype around Big Data put pressure on companies, especially legacy brands without sophisticated technical know-how, to upgrade their software, or else risk looking like dinosaurs to their customers and investors.

But it's not exactly easy or cheap to upgrade computer systems that may date back years, or even decades. Rather than tearing everything down and building anew, companies may want a solution designed to be slapped on top of what they already have. That's where Palantir comes in.

Palantir's software is designed with nontechnical users in mind. Rather than relying on specialized technical teams to parse and analyze data, Palantir allows people across an organization to get insights, sometimes without writing a single line of code. All they need to do is log into one of Palantir's two primary platforms: Foundry, for commercial users, or Gotham, for law enforcement and government users.

Foundry focuses on helping businesses use data to do things like manage inventory, monitor factory lines, and track orders. Gotham, meanwhile, is an investigative tool specifically for police and government clients, designed to connect people, places, and events of interest to law enforcement. There's also Apollo, which is like a control panel for shipping automatic software updates to Foundry or Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform, a suite of AI-powered tools that can be integrated into Gotham or Foundry.

Foundry and Gotham are similar: Both ingest data and give people a neat platform to work with it. The main difference between them is what data they're ingesting. Gotham takes any data that government or law enforcement customers may have, including things like crime reports, booking logs, or information they collected by subpoenaing a social media company. Gotham then extracts every person, place, and detail that might be relevant. Customers need to already have the data they want to work with—Palantir itself does not provide any.

A former Palantir staffer who has used Gotham says that, in just minutes, a law enforcement official or government analyst can map out who may be in a person's network and see documents that link them together. They can also centralize everything an agency knows about a person in one place, including their eye color from their driver's license, or their license plate from a traffic ticket—making it easy to build a detailed intelligence report. They can also use Gotham to search for a person based on a characteristic, like their immigration status, what state they live in, or whether they have tattoos.

The sales pitch for tools like Foundry and Gotham is that they can transcend all of the challenges associated with storing and structuring data, and naturally bring investigations and business decisionmakers to the correct solution. With an objectively superior technology, the thinking goes, the best possible outcomes will follow.

A version of this logic pervades the internal culture at Palantir. When asked what distinguishes it from other tech companies, former employees consistently mentioned its “flat” staffing structure. Engineers can laterally move to more prestigious or challenging projects if they prove worthy based on their skills and connections. One former staffer tells WIRED that this made the company feel like a meritocracy where the best people, and the best ideas, naturally rise to the top.

Some former employees say that Palantir's meritocratic culture helped cultivate a sense of loyalty among staff. But they also believe that this can make it difficult to speak out against the company or its business decisions. (Gordon said that Palantir “prides itself on a culture of fierce internal dialog and disagreement on difficult issues related to our work.”)

During her time at Palantir, Xia says she worked exclusively with private businesses using Foundry. However, she felt a nagging discomfort about the military work happening in other parts of the organization. “I did the thing that I think a lot of people do,” Xia says, “which is, I just didn't engage with it.”

Since leaving Palantir, Pinto says he's spent a lot of time reflecting on the company's ability to parse and connect vast amounts of data. He's now deeply worried that an authoritarian state could use this power to “tell any narrative they want” about, say, immigrants or dissidents it may be seeking to arrest or deport. He says that software like Palantir's doesn't eliminate human bias.

People are the ones that choose how to work with data, what questions to ask about it, and what conclusions to draw. Their choices could have positive outcomes, like ensuring enough Covid-19 vaccines are delivered to vulnerable areas. They could also have devastating ones, like launching a deadly airstrike, or deporting someone.

In some ways, Palantir can be seen as an amplifier of people's intentions and biases. It helps them make evermore precise and intentional decisions, for better or for worse. But this may not always be obvious to Palantir's users. They may only experience a sophisticated platform, sold to them using the vocabulary of warfare and hegemony. It may feel as if objective conclusions are flowing naturally from the data. When Gotham users connect disparate pieces of information about a person, it could seem like they are reading their whole life story, rather than just a slice of it.

“It's a really powerful tool,” says one former Palantir employee. “And when it's in the wrong hands, it can be really dangerous. And I think people should be really scared about it.”

Software that can see opponents through walls. Aimbots that can lock onto other players automatically. Tools that can boost characters' stats to the max. The world of online game cheats is expansive—with some cheat websites advertising hacks for dozens of PC games—and it's being driven by an underground economy that's allegedly raking in millions every year.

Over the last two years, a group of computer scientists has been analyzing and mapping the online cheat marketplace, observing what behaviors get people banned from games, and probing the effectiveness of anti-cheat systems created by games developers. Combined, 80 cheat websites are likely making between $12.8 million and $73.2 million annually—that's around $1.1 million to $6.1 million per month, say the academics from the University of Birmingham, in the UK.

“People can really make a lot of money from selling cheats, and companies have a lot to lose if a game is seen as full of cheaters,” says Tom Chothia, a cybersecurity professor at the University of Birmingham. Last week, along with assistant professor Marius Muench and PhD researcher Sam Collins, Chothia presented findings about the cheat economy and research on how robust anti-cheat systems are at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas.

Across the North American and European cheat-selling websites they analyzed, the researchers estimate that around 30,000 to 174,000 people may be buying cheats per month. The estimates, which were first published last year, are likely an undercount of the size of the whole cheat ecosystem, the researchers say, as they don't include cheats purchased from forums, websites in Asia, or the amount of people using free cheats. (The figures largely tally with a previous $100 million estimate for the overall cheats economy.)

The cheating community—both those who develop and sell cheats, and those who are interested in buying and using them—sprawls across the web. As well as dedicated cheat-selling websites, there are resellers, Discord communities, forums, smaller groups that sell cheats, and widespread marketing that tries to get cheats in front of people's eyeballs. Cheats can operate by either inserting code into the game's internal processes or parsing what is happening onscreen and taking actions outside of the game's mechanics—the most sophisticated can involve external hardware.

In recent years, the markets for selling cheats have become more industrialized. “They look like really professionally done online shops,” Collins says. Some cheat websites sell cheats for one-time use, but others charge recurring subscriptions, such as every month or 90 days. Subscriptions allow people to continue using the cheats' features over time, get updates if cheats stop working, and receive support from the developers. According to the academics' analysis, where they gathered data toward the end of 2023 and focused on software cheats, the minimum price for a cheat across the 80 websites was $6.63. Meanwhile, the most expensive price was $254.28. Many are under $100 per month, depending on the subscription type.

Some of the websites have their own customer service processes and accept payments from a number mainstream payment services, Collins explains. “The staff are quite professional,” he explains. “They're not afraid to be rude to you if they don't like you, but they try to be pretty professional.” Core to a cheat website's success is whether the cheats actually work and—crucially—how long they will work for. Sites have “status” indicators, showing whether a cheat is currently thought to be working.

It's all part of the ongoing tussle between the cheat developers and games companies, which spend money on developing anti-cheat software and trying to limit nefarious behavior in their games—sometimes including lawsuits around perceived copyright issues. “It's a legal gray area. It's not illegal to sell cheats” in most countries, Chothia says, noting that China and South Korea are among the few countries that have made it a crime to use cheat software.

Andrew Hogan, a cofounder of games threat intelligence company Intorqa, which provides data to gaming companies about the cheat ecosystem, says developers are always evolving their cheats, becoming more technical, and trying to find ways around anti-cheat systems. “Even the best cheats will be detected,” Hogan says. “They don't work forever and often don't even work for a week. But we see cheat developers who are updating their cheats every one and a half days.”

The cheat sites can make big claims themselves. One site's public web pages say it undertakes “consistent testing daily” to make sure its cheats are still operating, claiming that its hacks “can be used without bans for a long time.” “Several of our cheats have yet to be detected from the time of their release,” the website says. Another cheats website claims its hacks are “undetectable” and that its offerings can be customized: “Tailor the cheats to fit your specific needs and play style.”

Three cheat websites contacted by WIRED did not respond to emails asking for interviews or answer questions.

While cheats and anti-cheats are getting more sophisticated in most cases, Hogan says there has recently been a “resurgence” in an older cheat method called pixelbots—but now they've been rebranded as AI-aimbots. The bots, which are an external kind of cheat, read what is happening on the screen and aim for the cheating player. Only now they've been improved by developers using computer vision. “They're much easier and quicker for developers to create using machine learning and AI and object detection programs,” Hogan says, noting that there has been a surge of their use in recent months.

Over time, the enduring popularity of cheats and the money involved has also, inevitably, brought with it the attention of cybercriminals and scammers. In recent years, thousands of government and university websites around the world have been hacked to push Roblox and Fortnite “offers,” that are actually used to push malware and obtain personal information. Kids trying to cheat in Gorilla Tag, an ape-based chase game, have been found installing a dubious VPN that could hijack their internet traffic. The researchers do say that in their analysis of 80 cheat-selling websites they didn't find any direct evidence of scams or malware, most likely because they are trying to make money and build strong reputations.

As the cheat and anti-cheat development battle has become more sophisticated, both sides have moved into the kernel, the core of a computer's operating system. Deploying kernel drivers, at the deepest level of the OS, where they have high levels of access, creates the risks of everything from system level crashes to potential privacy and security vulnerabilities—giving anyone virtually unfettered control over your PC is never a good idea. For an example of the issues that kernel access can cause, Crowdstrike's botched update last year that crashed millions of computers around the world was possible because its software had kernel access. Microsoft announced it would move antivirus products and endpoint detection and response (EDR) out of the kernel in the future.

In April, Elise Murphy, head of game security at Electronic Arts, wrote in a blog post that the company's Javelin anti-cheat system has blocked 33 million attempts at cheating since the software launched in 2022. “The kernel is the deepest part of the operating system, and if cheats operate from there while the anti-cheat does not, they can hide everything they are doing with no chance for us to detect or prevent any of it,” Murphy wrote.

According to the University of Birmingham researchers, this kernel-level access makes anti-cheat systems incredibly robust when it comes to actually defending against cyberattacks as well. “One of our findings is that your laptop's probably never as safe as when you are playing Fortnite; anti-cheat protection will actually keep you safe from a whole range of malware, which normal antivirus will miss,” Chothia says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","An AI Model for the Brain Is Coming to the ICU","https://www.wired.com/story/an-ai-model-for-the-brain-is-coming-to-the-icu-cleveland-clinic-piramidal/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:00:00 GMT","

The Cleveland Clinic is partnering with San Francisco–based startup Piramidal to develop a large-scale AI model that will be used to monitor patients' brain health in intensive care units.

Instead of being trained on text, the system is based on electroencephalogram (EEG) data, which is collected via electrodes placed on the scalp and then read out by a computer in a series of wavy lines. EEG records the brain's electrical activity, and changes in this activity can indicate a problem. In an ICU setting, doctors scan EEG data looking for evidence of seizures, altered consciousness, or a decline in brain function.

Currently, doctors rely on continuous EEG monitoring to detect abnormal brain activity in an ICU patient, but they can't monitor every individual patient in real time. Instead, EEG reports are typically generated every 12 or 24 hours and then analyzed to determine whether a patient is experiencing a neurological issue. It can take two to four hours to manually review a day's worth of brainwave data.

“This type of thing is time-consuming. It is subjective, and it is experience- and expertise-dependent,” says Imad Najm, a neurologist and director of the Epilepsy Center at the Cleveland Clinic's Neurological Institute.

The system that the Cleveland Clinic and Piramidal are developing is designed to interpret continuous streams of EEG data and flag abnormalities in seconds so that doctors can intervene sooner.

“Our model plays that role of constantly monitoring patients in the ICU and letting the doctors know what's happening with the patient and how their brain health is evolving in real time,” says Piramidal's chief product officer Kris Pahuja.

Pahuja and CEO Dimitris Fotis Sakellariou founded Piramidal in 2023, with the goal of building a foundation model for the brain—an AI system that can read and interpret neural signals broadly across different people. Prior to this, Sakellariou spent 15 years as a neuroengineer and AI scientist doing EEG research. Pahuja worked on product strategy at Google and Spotify. Their startup, which is backed by Y Combinator, raised $6 million in seed funding last year.

The company built its ICU brain model using publicly available EEG datasets, as well as proprietary EEG data from the Cleveland Clinic and other partnerships. Sakellariou says the model incorporates nearly a million hours of EEG monitoring data from “dozens of thousands” of patients, both neurologically healthy and unhealthy. Brain activity patterns are extremely variable from person to person, so building a brain foundation model requires huge amounts of data to capture common patterns and features.

“The beauty of a foundation model is the same way ChatGPT can generalize text, it can adapt to your tone, it can adapt to your way of writing—our model is able to adapt to the brains of different people,” Sakellariou says.

Currently, the Cleveland Clinic and Piramidal team is using retrospective patient data to fine-tune the model. In the next six to eight months, they plan to test the model in a tightly controlled ICU environment with live patient data and a limited number of beds and doctors. From there, they aim to slowly roll out the software to the entire ICU. Eventually, the software will allow the hospital system to monitor hundreds of patients at once, Najm says.

The slow rollout is to reduce the rate of false positives and false negatives—instances where the system misidentifies patients who don't have a severe event or failing to catch someone who does. The latter scenario especially is “a big problem that keeps us awake at night,” Najm says.

Piramidal did not comment on the model's current accuracy but said it has evaluated its technology against a network of doctors and has achieved “humanlike” performance. The company plans to publish data on the model's accuracy at a future date.

While Piramidal's immediate focus is on applying its brain foundation model to the ICU, Sakellariou and Pahuja also want to use it for epilepsy and sleep monitoring. Meanwhile, brain-computer interface company Synchron is developing a brain foundation model incorporating data from trial participants to make its system more accurate and generalizable to more users. There are also consumer applications of brain foundation models, such as using EEG earbuds to measure emotional states. Both medical and consumer applications raise questions about how brain data will be used and stored, as well as how and when it should be used.

“Advancements like this one highlight the need for anticipatory ethical frameworks that support responsible development and use of these technologies,” says Caroline Montojo, president and CEO of the Dana Foundation, a private philanthropic organization dedicated to neuroscience research. “It's critical to bring in many different perspectives at early stages of technology design from multiple disciplines, including ethicists, social scientists, and legal scholars, as well as the lived experiences of patients.”

The laptop you bring to college is important. Not only is it the device you'll be using through some of the most formative years of your life, but it's also often the one that you'll take to your first job, too. The problem is that the internet is full of laptops that aren't worth the money, especially if you're scrolling through lists of laptops on Amazon or Best Buy.

Good news! I've tested each of the following laptops and can wholeheartedly recommend them. More than that, I've been digging through the deals to find the best prices on the best laptops you can buy for back-to-school season. Below, you'll find lots of good cheap laptops as well as some great Chromebooks and gaming laptops that'll do just as well for schoolwork. You can even find some deals on laptop accessories.

Apple

Amazon (13-inch)

Amazon (15-inch)

B&H

Apple

If there is a quintessential college laptop, it's the MacBook Air M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It's been that way for many years. And even as Apple Silicon has transformed the MacBook Air into something far more capable, Apple has kept prices low enough to still make it the go-to choice. Right now, the starting configuration at Amazon is cheaper than it was on Prime Day at $800. That's even cheaper than the student discount offered by Apple.

What makes the MacBook Air such a perfect college laptop is its long battery life and portability. It's still one of the thinnest laptops you can buy, at 0.44 inches thick, and it weighs just 2.7 pounds. It's the kind of device that can go with you across campus and last well into the evening of studying all on a single charge. You can choose between the 13- ad 15-inch models, both of which are nearly identical, except the latter has more screen real estate and better speakers.

Dell

Dell

Amazon (258V)

When I initially tested the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Review), I gave it a hard time because of the $1,100 MSRP. But over the past month or so, Dell has kept a pretty generous discount intact. Right now, the starting configuration costs $750, which might not sound that cheap at face value, but when you consider what you're getting, you realize just how good a deal this is.

First off, that $750 gets you a whopping 1 terabyte of storage and a higher-resolution display (2560 x 1600), matching the MacBook Air in sharpness. It can even match the MacBook Air's battery life claims. And no, while it's not as thin or sleek as the MacBook Air, in exchange you get extra storage and more ports, making this my go-to pick for back-to-school season this year.

Asus

Amazon

Asus

Best Buy

The Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Review) has been my favorite budget laptop to come out this year, namely because it solves one of the main problems with laptops in this price range: battery life. It runs on Qualcomm's Snapdragon X chips, bringing fantastic efficiency to devices as affordable as the Vivobook 14.

It's not a perfect laptop. The display isn't too bright, and the colors look off on it. I also wish the touchpad were a bit more precise. But at this price, you won't find a better Windows laptop, especially since it comes with 512 GB of storage. If you can afford the extra cash for the Dell 14 Plus listed above, it's worth it for the improved display and bump in storage.

Microsoft

Amazon

Microsoft

2-in-1 laptops (otherwise known as detachables) are a great option for college. They're the lightest devices you can carry around that still give you access to a full version of Windows. The 2025 12-inch model of the Surface Pro makes this benefit even stronger, shrinking the screen down, but without losing performance or battery life. Due to its size, the Surface Pro 12 (6/10, WIRED Review) is a pure joy to use.

When it came out, it was too expensive compared to the larger 13-inch model, but on sale, it makes for an ideal college companion for note-taking in class and studying on the go. Just remember: You'll need to buy the keyboard, as it doesn't come bundled in.

Razer

Razer

The Razer Blade 16 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite gaming laptop, and it'd be a fantastic pick for college students if only it weren't so incredibly expensive. Normally, it starts at $2,400 for the RTX 5060 model, but Razer has a $400 back-to-school discount, meaning you can pick one up for as low as $2,000. I know that's not cheap, especially for this graphics card, but for a Razer Blade it's a rare discount. This is certainly the lowest price I've seen since the 2025 model came out. The 5070 GPU model is also on sale.

The draw to something like the Razer Blade 16 is that it can function as both your laptop for college work and a gaming device with your friends in the dorm. While you could buy just about any gaming laptop and pretend it's a school device, lugging that thing to class will be a nuisance, and once you get there, the design might be a distraction. The latest Razer Blade 16 is just 0.58 inches thick, making it surprisingly portable for a 16-inch gaming laptop. Outside of the Razer logo on the lid, you might not guess that it's even a gaming laptop. It goes without saying that because it has a discrete GPU, it'll serve as a good option for STEM students who need more performance.

Asus

Best Buy

Cheap Chromebooks should not be discounted as solid student laptops, and not all of them are as shoddy as their reputation has earned them. Despite its low price, the Asus Chromebook CX14 (6/10, WIRED Review) isn't half bad. It has a 1080p screen, even if it's not the best one I've tested, and there are lots of ports. It's reasonably portable with a solid keyboard to type on, too.

As usual with cheap laptops, the touchpad isn't the best, and battery life won't get you through a full day. But compared to the Chromebooks selling at this price in the past, the Asus Chromebook CX14 is a big step in the right direction. If your budget is under $300, look no further.

Samsung

Best Buy

Samsung

Now, if you want a more elevated Chromebook experience, you'll have to pay a little more. But as the price of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) proves, there are plenty of great deals to be found. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus has a superb OLED screen, something that's not common in Chromebooks, even those with the “Chromebook Plus” designation.

The Galaxy Chromebook Plus not only has a bright, 15.6-inch OLED display, but also the kind of high-end specs you'll most likely need for college. That includes 256 GB of storage, 8 GB of RAM, and an Intel Core 3 processor. Perhaps its most attractive quality, however, is its portability. It's the thinnest Chromebook you can buy at 0.46 inches thick—only a hair thicker than the MacBook Air.

Asus

Best Buy (RTX 4060)

If you want the sleek and minimalist design of the Razer Blade at a lower price, take a look at the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). It's just as gorgeous and thin and doubles every bit as well as a study laptop. The RTX 4060 configuration is what's cheap, which, admittedly, isn't the most impressive gaming GPU at the moment. Alternatively, you can also pick up a slightly older Intel model that comes with a more powerful RTX 4070 for the same price.

Either way, what you're getting is an extremely capable laptop with some extra performance behind it for those who need it. And yeah, it's also a killer gaming laptop in your downtime.

Best Buy (15-inch)

This was my favorite new laptop of 2024, and almost a year later it's still without a doubt one of the best laptops you could bring to school. The Surface Laptop 7th Edition (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is light and portable, has a fantastic screen, and an excellent touchpad. My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which means it has a taller shape, giving you more vertical screen space to work with than most other laptops.

The cheapest version you can buy is over on Amazon, where you can pick up the 1-TB model. It's $999 right now, and it will get you great performance with the Snapdragon X Elite chipset and all-day battery life.

I get it. You're a college student, and you're not worried about your posture. But trust me, your future self will thank you if you start using proper ergonomics earlier on in life, such as a laptop stand. This simple, cheap laptop stand is perfect for your dorm room and can fold down when you don't need it. You'll need to pair it with a good mouse and keyboard once you've raised the laptop to proper eye level.

There are tons of great laptop bags for lugging your new laptop around campus with you, and it's a great time to upgrade from whatever you were using in high school. This backpack is a common sight in schools for good reason. It's versatile for school and for day hikes or weekend trips. It comes in several colors, and has a 28-liter capacity—more than enough for a 13-inch laptop, jacket, snacks, and a water bottle.

Plugable

Plugable

Many of the laptops above don't include a full selection of ports, which you may need from time to time as a student. That's why everyone likely needs some kind of USB-C hub. I like this 9-port hub from Plugable because it supports USB-C power delivery, despite being relatively cheap. If you need something more powerful, consider the Satechi 8-in-1 Multiport Adapter or this 5-in-1 option from Anker, which is a more budget-friendly and basic alternative.

Soundpeats

You can't go off to college without a decent pair of earbuds, especially since you'll be needing to focus in public places many times. Sure, a pair of AirPods works just fine, but if you're looking for a cheaper alternative, our audiophiles have tested dozens of pairs of budget earbuds to recommend the SoundPEATS Capsule3 Pro+ (10/10, WIRED Recommends) as the way to go. Despite the price of under $100, our reviewers say it has “some of the best sound in the middle and treble registers I've heard from earbuds at any price.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Black Market for Fake Science Is Growing Faster Than Legitimate Research, Study Warns","https://www.wired.com/story/black-market-for-fraudulent-science-growing-faster-than-legitimate-research/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

A new study by researchers at Northwestern University has set off alarm bells about the future of academic research, warning that the publication of fraudulent science is growing at a faster rate than that of legitimate research.

Over the last four centuries, an implicit contract has been established between scientists and states: in exchange for producing knowledge useful for economic and social development, governments and other benefactors offer researchers stable careers, good salaries, and public recognition. This model, similar to that of a commercial enterprise, has proven to be efficient and has been replicated in most regions of the world.

However, recent research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) reveals that, in recent years, this system—composed of researchers, academic institutions, government agencies, private companies, and dissemination platforms—shows signs of breaking down.

The authors argue that due to the large scale and specialization of contemporary science, the contribution of each actor is no longer evaluated by the intrinsic merit of their work, but by quantitative indicators, such as the number of research papers published, how often articles are cited by other research, university rankings, or by awards and other recognitions obtained.

“These indicators have rapidly become targets for measuring institutional and personal impact, which has generated unbridled competition and growing inequality in the distribution of resources, incentives, and rewards,” the authors warn.

This in turn has led to the proliferation of fraud in some quarters of the scientific community, as researchers look for quick ways to acquire indicators of success. “The use of numerical metrics to evaluate projects and professionals … encourages the search for shortcuts,” says Pere Puigdomènech, president of the Committee for Research Integrity in Catalonia (CIR-CAT) in Spain. The types of fraud detected range from the creation of fictitious research, to plagiarism, to the buying and selling of authorship and citations in papers.

Northwestern's research shows that cases of fraud are often not isolated incidents, but rather the result of complex networks that operate systematically to undermine the integrity of science.

The research team behind this paper, led by Luis A. N. Amaral, professor of Engineering Science and Applied Mathematics at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, reached this conclusion after analyzing large volumes of data on retracted publications, editorial records, and image duplication.

Sources included major aggregators of scientific literature—such as Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and OpenAlex—as well as lists of journals removed from these databases for violating quality or ethical standards. In addition, data on retracted articles flagged by the investigative website Retraction Watch, comments on the science-paper review site PubPeer, and editorial metadata (editor names and submission and acceptance dates) were also collected and analyzed.

This analysis highlighted the work of “papermills”—unscrupulous organizations that mass-produce low-quality manuscripts and sell these, sometimes through intermediaries, to academics looking to publish material quickly. These papers often contain falsified data, manipulated or copyright-infringed images, plagiarized content, and even absurd or physically impossible claims. “These networks are essentially criminal organizations, acting together to fake the process of science,” Amaral said in a statement published by Northwestern University.

The researchers warn that more and more scientists are engaging with these networks, where they are not only acquiring articles, but also citations and authorship positions in papers, allowing them to appear prestigious without having conducted their own research.

To delve deeper into the phenomenon, the team developed a parallel project aimed at detecting articles coming from these papermills. An automatic analysis system was used on a large body of materials-engineering research and related sciences to identify authors who incorrectly reported the instruments used in their studies, a potential giveaway of a piece of research being fraudulent.

The experiment uncovered fraudulent articles even in prestigious journals such as PLOS ONE. It also detected a strategy in which these papermills seek out defunct journals to usurp their names or websites, giving the appearance of legitimacy to fake publications they then release under those titles.

“Intermediaries connect all the parties. You need someone to write the article, people willing to pay to appear as authors, a magazine willing to publish it, and editors who will accept it,” Amaral says. “Millions of dollars are invested in this process.”

To curb this threat, the Northwestern researchers propose a number of measures: strengthening the scrutiny of editorial processes, implementing more effective methods to detect false research, developing better understanding of the networks that facilitate these practices, and radically restructuring the incentive system in science.

The researchers stress that the scientific community itself must strengthen its oversight mechanisms to preserve its integrity, a challenge that becomes even more urgent with the eruption of artificial intelligence in the production and dissemination of knowledge.

“If we're not prepared to deal with the fraud that's already occurring, then we're certainly not prepared to deal with what generative AI can do to scientific literature,” warned Reese Richardson, a postdoctoral researcher at the McCormick School of Engineering and first author of the Northwestern study, in a statement. “We have no clue what's going to end up in the literature, what's going to be regarded as scientific fact and what's going to be used to train future AI models, which then will be used to write more papers.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","A Student's Guide to College and Career in the Age of AI","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/a-students-guide-to-college-and-career-in-the-age-of-ai-179860.html","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 12:00:56 GMT","

For generations, the path to a successful career has been clearly marked: get good grades, go to a four-year university, and get a stable job. But for today's students on the cusp of making these life-altering decisions, that path is becoming increasingly foggy.

The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is not just a technological shift; it's a fundamental reshaping of the workforce, and the aftershocks will be felt for decades to come. For students and their parents, this new reality demands a radical rethinking of what it means to be “educated” and “career ready.” The old rules no longer apply, and the learning strategies of the past are insufficient for the challenges of the future.

Let's talk about how AI is reshaping education, career planning, and the skills students will need to succeed. Then, we'll close with my Product of the Week, an AI tool that I've found incredibly useful lately for understanding new technologies and writing related papers: Google Gemini.

The conversation about AI and jobs often conjures images of robots replacing factory workers. However, the reality is far more nuanced and, for many, far more concerning. The jobs most at risk are not just those involving manual labor, but also a wide range of white-collar professions that have long been the exclusive domain of college graduates.

According to a study by the McKinsey Global Institute, by 2030, activities that account for up to 30% of hours currently worked across the U.S. economy could be automated, a trend that generative AI will accelerate.

This projected level of automation means professions centered on data analysis, administrative support, and even creative tasks face significant disruption. Jobs like market research analysts, paralegals, and even some entry-level software developers may see their roles dramatically transformed or diminished.

The key takeaway is that any job that relies heavily on pattern recognition, data synthesis, and routine cognitive tasks is vulnerable. The list of at-risk professions is not static; as AI capabilities expand, so will the scope of its impact on the job market. This fluidity makes long-term career planning a far more complex and uncertain endeavor than it was for previous generations.

Given this high rate of change, the traditional model of choosing a single, specialized major and sticking with it for four years is becoming increasingly risky. The job a first-year student is training for may look vastly different or may not even exist by the time they graduate.

In this environment, adaptability is the new currency. A more diverse educational background, one that combines a specialized major with a broad foundation in the liberal arts, can provide students with the intellectual agility needed to navigate this uncertain future.

A liberal arts education emphasizing critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving equips students with uniquely human skills AI cannot replicate. These are the skills that will be in high demand in a world where routine tasks are automated.

A student who majors in computer science but also takes courses in philosophy, history, and literature will not only be a better coder but also a more adaptable and resilient professional. They will have the ability to see the bigger picture, to ask the right questions, and to communicate complex ideas to a diverse audience.

This kind of intellectual cross-training creates a “portfolio” of skills and knowledge that can be applied to a wide range of careers, giving graduates the flexibility to pivot as the job market evolves.

The traditional four-year university experience is not the only — or necessarily the best — path for every student. In the age of AI, two-year community colleges and vocational schools offer a compelling alternative. These institutions are often nimbler and more responsive to the needs of the local job market, offering programs that provide students with practical, in-demand skills in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost.

For students interested in high-tech fields, a two-year program can be a gateway to a well-paying job in areas like cybersecurity, data analytics, or advanced manufacturing. These programs are often developed in partnership with local employers, ensuring that the curriculum is relevant and that students are learning the skills that are needed in the workplace.

This hands-on, applied approach not only prepares students for a specific career but also allows them to quickly determine if that career is a good fit. The shorter duration of these programs is a significant advantage in a rapidly changing world. A student who completes a two-year degree can enter the workforce and start gaining valuable experience while their peers in four-year programs are still in the classroom.

This “speed-to-market” can be a significant competitive advantage in a world where the half-life of skills is constantly shrinking.

The same AI that is reshaping the job market can also be a powerful tool for learning and personal development. Students who leverage these tools effectively will not only excel academically but also be better prepared for their careers. Here are some resources that can help:

The rise of AI is not a reason to fear the future, but it is a call to action. For students standing at the threshold of their adult lives, the message is clear: the old maps will not lead you to the new world.

The learning strategies that will lead to success in the age of AI are not about memorizing facts or mastering a single skill. They are about cultivating a mindset of lifelong learning, embracing intellectual diversity, and developing the unique human skills of creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration.

The future of work is a moving target, and the students who thrive will be those who learn, adapt, and reinvent themselves in a world of constant change.

Being flexible and informed about your interests, capabilities, and job market changes — coupled with a strong focus on educational diversity and AI use — will best prepare you for the world you'll graduate into.





As you prepare to start college, you're probably thinking about textbooks, dorms, and course schedules. But you should also be thinking about your most valuable academic partner: a smart AI assistant like Google Gemini.

While many specialized AI tools exist for specific tasks, a versatile, all-in-one generative AI chatbot is the most useful tool you can have in your academic toolkit. It's not a replacement for your work, but a powerful assistant that can boost productivity and deepen understanding across subjects.

One of its greatest strengths is its ability to streamline the research and writing process. You can use it to brainstorm ideas for an essay, generate a detailed outline, or create a list of potential topics for a paper. When you're ready to write, it can help you refine your arguments, check for grammatical errors, and suggest alternative phrasing to make your prose clearer and more concise.

A recent survey found that over 86% of students use AI for studying and 54% use it at least weekly, with around 25% using it daily. Remember, the key is to use it as a creative partner, not a crutch. Your professors want your original ideas, so always use the tool to enhance your work, not write it for you.

Beyond writing, a smart AI assistant can revolutionize how you study. Faced with a dense 50-page reading for a class? You can ask the AI to summarize the key arguments or explain a complex concept in simpler terms. You can also upload your own lecture notes or course materials and have it generate a study guide, create practice quiz questions, or produce flashcards to help you memorize important information.

This kind of personalized, on-demand support can be a game-changer, especially during late-night study sessions when a human tutor isn't available. The ability to learn and review at your own pace is one of the most significant benefits.

Ultimately, the most useful AI tool is one that can adapt to a variety of academic challenges. By learning to use a versatile AI assistant responsibly for brainstorming, research, writing assistance, and studying, you can free up valuable time and mental energy. It's a tool that can help you not only survive but truly thrive in your college career. Since Google Gemini does this for me — and can for you — it's my Product of the Week.

No matter how Tom Gurski crunched the numbers, there was no way the planet was going to switch to electric vehicles fast enough to meet even modest global warming targets. Gas-powered cars, trucks and SUVs are on the road for 20-plus years on average, and their usable lifespan keeps getting longer. Plus, it's a carbon-intensive waste to prematurely chuck all the steel tied up in the vehicles.

The longtime mechanical engineer believes he has a solution. 

From a two-car Seattle garage crammed with machinery that would make any gearhead swoon, Gurski has developed technology that can transform fossil fuel vehicles into plug-in electric hybrids — cars that can run on battery power for daily driving but switch to gas for longer trips — for a few thousand dollars and about a day of installation work.

“I'm fully convinced it's a solution the world needs,” he said. 

Gurski launched Blue Dot Motorworks five years ago to commercialize the technology, and his effort is kicking into gear:

The initial prototype, a product dubbed Narwhal, is designed to pair with pickup trucks. Its second version, called Humpback, will target cars and SUVs. 

Gurski has held mechanical engineering leadership roles at multiple companies and worked on sanitation technology for Gates Foundation-funded projects before starting his own engineering consultancy, which led into Blue Dot.

Redwood Stephens, former chief product officer for Rad Power Bikes and a past president of engineering company Synapse Product Development, recently joined the startup as a part-time CPO. The team includes Suzanne Ellis Wernevi, head of business development, communications and policy.

Stephens touts the universality of the technology as a major selling point as the business aims to get traction with outside investors. 

“If you have a solution that is agnostic to the make and model of the vehicle,” he said, “then suddenly the addressable market becomes massive.”

Gurski developed his prototype on his own 2001 Jeep Cherokee — a vehicle that gets a paltry 16 miles per gallon. On a recent test drive he put the key in the ignition, but instead of firing up the gas engine, he started it with a control unit mounted on the dashboard.

“You just turn the vehicle on without starting it, put it in neutral, power the system on,” he explained. A low hum indicated the different components were operating, and the dashboard device displayed that the battery was nearly fully charged, “and then off we go.”

On a quick spin through a residential neighborhood, the ride was a little louder and more rattling than a regular EV given the Jeep's age and a transmission feature that will change in the final product. But the vehicle worked as intended, smoothly accelerating and braking, all without pumping any CO2 into the atmosphere.

The Blue Dot conversion is a variation on traditional plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The vehicles operate entirely electrically until their batteries run out and they switch over to internal combustion engines. The hybrids have a much shorter battery range than 100% EVs, but given that most drivers make daily trips of 35-40 miles, they're running fossil fuel-free most of the time.

“If you look at any existing car on the road, it's already 80% of a plug-in hybrid. It's already a car … It's already got the combustion-powered part of the equation. All you need to do is add the electric side of the equation, and you've got a plug-in hybrid,” Gurski said. “So the trick is, how do you do that in a way that can be done cost effectively and scalably?”

Automakers including Toyota, BMW, Kia, Hyundai and others sell plug-in hybrid electric vehicles off the lot and sales have been increasing. Entrepreneurs have tried, and largely failed, to create retrofit solutions for converting gas-powered vehicles.

But Jay Donnaway, past president of the Seattle Electric Vehicle Association (SEVA) and long-time EV enthusiast, is “cautiously optimistic” that Blue Dot has landed on a winning strategy. Most other technologies added battery power to boost a gas vehicle's efficiency, he said, but didn't include the ability to drive purely as an EV.

“Without EV-only mode, you leave the easiest savings on the table,” Donnaway said, “because you can't even drive to the mailbox and back without turning on the engine.”

Blue Dot's team is prepping to build about 10-12 prototype kits for pilot tests on light-duty vehicles at Royal Roads University on Vancouver Island and the Richmond School District in British Columbia. The organizations will buy the kits, test the technology for six months, and can remove and return the systems for a full refund if they aren't satisfied.

The technology “makes good sense to me,” Donnaway said. “Mechanically, [Gurski] has been extremely careful.”

But there are plenty of challenges for Blue Dot to navigate. Building hardware is expensive, particularly for initial, limited-run production. Trump administration policies are undermining EV adoption by cutting tax rebates for vehicle purchases and eliminating funding for charging infrastructure — though the loss of rebates could make Blue Dot's proposition more cost competitive. And there's the hurdle of educating drivers on the existence of this technology and its benefits.

The Narwhal system includes a battery and electronics box about the size of a small truck-bed toolbox that's installed inside the bed. The system inserts a motor drive unit into the truck's drive shaft, allowing it to turn the rear wheels with battery power.

A dashboard display shows battery charge and allows drivers to switch between electric and gas power. It will give audible and visual warnings if the battery power gets low. The technology includes regenerative braking and enables one-pedal driving.

The system for cars and SUVs will be similar, but the motor drive unit will be placed on the rear wheels, and the battery component will go in the trunk or on a trailer hitch.

The conversion kit targets a price of $6,000-$9,000 based on vehicle type, plus roughly $500-$1,000 in labor costs for installation. The system is designed so any mechanic can install it.

The upfront costs are significant, but vehicles with poor fuel efficiency can make up the investment in three or four years given that electricity is cheaper than filling up with gasoline. There are additional maintenance savings as the combustion engine will see less wear and tear. 

After 10 years chasing a plug-in hybrid solution, Gurski thinks he's there.

“You could say that the best inventions are the ones that seem obvious once they're invented. And I think this kind of falls into that category,” he said. “It's like, yeah, obviously that'll work — but I had to come up with this.”

Learning to code and working hard hasn't been quite enough to land the coveted tech jobs and six-figure starting salaries that computer science graduates were promised, according to a new report in The New York Times this weekend.

As the industry grapples with layoffs and the rise of artificial intelligence tools that can perform jobs faster, recent grads paint a picture in which they're applying for hundreds if not thousands of tech positions only to be ghosted and left feeling “gaslit” about their career prospects.

Some of the grads, who had visions of cruising into the tech workforce with skills that were deemed highly coveted, are resorting to jobs in the fast food industry.

“It is difficult to find the motivation to keep applying,” said an Oregon State University grad who has applied for 5,762 tech jobs since graduating in 2023, according to the Times. He's had 13 job interviews but no full-time job offers.

The Times says the spread of AI is not helping, as tech firms embracing AI coding assistants reduces the need for some companies to hire junior software engineers. Other firms are using AI to automatically scan resumes and reject candidates. Some graduates described feeling caught in an AI “doom loop,” The Times reported.

Another data science graduate told the Times that she received a rejection email three minutes after applying for a job. More companies are using AI to screen candidates and are removing the human element from the process. Seattle-based Humanly unveiled “AI interviewers” last month in which job candidates interact with an AI-generated video interviewer.

“It's hard to stay motivated when you feel like an algorithm determines whether you get to pay your bills,” the grad told the Times.

While the report does namecheck Amazon and Microsoft for recent layoffs and an embrace of AI tools, and University of Washington students and graduates are among those who replied to questions from the Times, a GeekWire report last month offered a different perspective.

In that story, Amazon was said to have hired more than 100 engineers from the latest graduating class at UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering — an all-time high, according to university data shared with GeekWire. Microsoft, Meta and Google were each hiring more than 20 UW CSE grads, reflecting a strong talent pipeline between the UW and Seattle's tech industry.

Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that while the U.S. labor market is cooling, AI can be ruled out — so far — as a culprit in any hiring slowdown. U.S. workers whose jobs involve tasks that AI can do are actually much less likely than other workers to be unemployed, according to an analysis by the Economic Innovation Group.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke announced on Monday that he's stepping down from his role. Dohmke will remain at the Microsoft-owned company until the end of the year, after which he will depart to become “a founder again,” he wrote in a blog post.

Axios reports that Microsoft will not directly replace the position, and that GitHub leadership will now report to several Microsoft executives.

“With more than 1B repos and forks, and over 150 million developers, GitHub has never been stronger than it is today,” Dohmke wrote. “We have seen more open-source projects with more contributions every year. AI projects have doubled in the last year alone. And our presence in companies of any size is unmatched in the market.”

The move comes as GitHub is facing growing competition from companies like Google and Cursor over AI tools for programmers.

Elon Musk confirmed over the weekend reports that Tesla has disbanded the team working on its Dojo AI training supercomputer, just weeks after announcing he expected to have Tesla's second cluster operating “at scale” in 2026. 

“Once it became clear that all paths converged to AI6, I had to shut down Dojo and make some tough personnel choices, as Dojo 2 was now an evolutionary dead end,” Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, on Sunday. “Dojo 3 arguably lives on in the form of a large number of AI6 [systems-on-a-chip] on a single board.”

After bringing its first Dojo supercomputer to life and powering it with a mix of Nvidia GPUs and in-house-made D1 chips, Tesla had planned to build a second Dojo factory — referred to by Musk as “Dojo 2” — that would have been powered by a second-generation D2 chip. 

It appears the D2 chip under development has been shelved along with the broader Dojo project as Tesla shifts its focus to its AI5 and AI6 chips, which are being manufactured by TSMC and Samsung, respectively. The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla's driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training.  

“It doesn't make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. “The Tesla AI5, AI6 and subsequent chips will be excellent for inference and at least pretty good for training. All effort is focused on that.”

He added that for a supercomputer cluster, it makes more sense to put “many AI5/AI6 chips on a board, whether for inference or training, simply to reduce network cabling complexity & cost by a few orders of magnitude.” 

“One could call that Dojo 3, I suppose,” he said.

Musk has talked about Dojo since 2019, reiterating that Dojo would be a cornerstone of Tesla's mission to achieve full self-driving and commercialize humanoid robots. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.”

It's not clear if Cortex is still in the works. TechCrunch has reached out to Tesla to learn more, as well as to inquire about the fate of the Dojo facility Tesla had invested $500 million to build in Buffalo, New York. 

The shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk's forays into politics. Musk has worked to convince investors that Tesla still has a future in autonomy, despite a slow and limited robotaxi launch in Austin this past June that resulted in numerous reported incidents of the vehicles exhibiting problematic driving behavior.

Revel has shut down its ride-hailing service in New York City, in yet another pivot for the company that started out by renting electric scooters in 2019. Moving forward, Revel will instead focus on its nascent EV charging business, which includes operating five stations in New York and one in San Francisco.

A visit to Revel's app on Monday showed a message thanking users for “riding with us the last 4 years!” and announcing it has “permanently closed our rideshare service.” Revel's website echoed the same message, adding: “Moving forward, Revel will continue to grow our Fast Charging business with more sites and cities opening soon.”

“We have made the difficult decision that the best way we can keep the EV transition moving forward is by ending our rideshare service and focusing on building the fast charging infrastructure our biggest cities need to keep going electric,” Revel co-founder and CEO Frank Reig said in a statement to TechCrunch. 

Revel will sell or return the bright-blue Tesla and Kia vehicles that make up its fleet, according to Bloomberg News. The company will also sell the 165 “for-hire vehicle license plates” attached to those vehicles, which Reig told Bloomberg could be worth between $20,000 and $25,000 each.

Revel revealed its first chargers in 2021, around the same time it launched the ride-hail fleet. But the company slow adoption in those early years for its charging business. The company told TechCrunch that total utilization of the network in early 2023 was just 21%, with 19% of that coming from Revel's own ride-hail fleet.

Fast forward to early 2025, and that utilization rate had jumped to 45%, with only 12% of that charging coming from Revel's fleet. The company got a big boost in 2024 when Uber struck a deal to send many of its drivers to Revel's chargers. Revel says it plans to have “over 400” charging stalls operational in Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco by the end of 2026.

Nvidia on Monday unveiled a set of new world AI models, libraries, and other infrastructure for robotics developers, most notable of which is Cosmos Reason, a 7-billion-parameter “reasoning” vision language model for physical AI applications and robots.

Also joining the existing batch of Cosmos world models are Cosmos Transfer-2, which can accelerate synthetic data generation from 3D simulation scenes or spatial control inputs, and a distilled version of Cosmos Transfers that is more optimized for speed.

During its announcement at the SIGGRAPH conference on Monday, Nvidia noted that these models are meant to be used to create synthetic text, image, and video datasets for training robots and AI agents.

Cosmos Reason, per Nvidia, allows robots and AI agents to “reason” thanks to its memory and physics understanding, which lets it “serve as a planning model to reason what steps an embodied agent might take next.” The company says it can be used for data curation, robot planning, and video analytics.  

The company also unveiled new neural reconstruction libraries, which includes one for a rendering technique that lets developers simulate the real world in 3D using sensor data. This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. There's even an update to the Omniverse software development kit.

There are new servers for robotics workflows, too. The Nvidia RTX Pro Blackwell Server offers a single architecture for robotic development workloads, while Nvidia DGX Cloud is a cloud-based management platform. 

These announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.

I took a tour through a few 10Q reports this week to get a sense of how EV makers like Rivian and Lucid (or even legacy automakers that also sell EVs) feel about the one-two punch of tariffs and the end of the federal tax credit. Although these documents are loaded with legalese, it's clear that both economic developments are on the minds of their respective executive teams. 

Rivian and Lucid both make specific and multiple mentions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in the risk factors section of their 10Qs. The OBBBA eliminates certain tax credits for EV buyers and essentially devalues the zero-emissions regulatory credit market. Tariffs and trade policy risks also make cameos. 

Lucid notes in its 10Q that it is assessing the impact of OBBBA. “If any of the Company's suppliers, sub-suppliers or partners experience financial distress, insolvency or disruptions in operations, they may be unable to fulfill their obligations or meet the Company's production and quality requirements.”  Meanwhile, Rivian tries to strike a “glass half full” tone by noting that 45X tax credit for domestic battery production remains. 

Ford and GM also make mention of the OBBBA, although both spend more time talking about the potential effects of tariffs. GM says it's unable to estimate the financial impacts of the OBBBA, but notes it “could be material and may adversely affect electric vehicle profitability.”

Here's the unfortunate upshot (and potential third punch): A new 100% import tariff on semiconductor chips could squeeze automakers even more. Anyone who paid attention during the COVID pandemic remembers how supply constraints on chips hurt automakers. Industry experts estimate that a modern vehicle contains more than 1,000 — and in some cases more than 3,000 — chips. None of these companies want to go through this again. 

The question is how they will qualify for exemptions; the Trump administration said it will award them to companies that manufacture the chips domestically. Automakers don't typically make chips, which means these companies may all turn to domestic suppliers. This is, of course, a TBD scenario since the administration has a history of changing policy, and it has yet to provide details on this 100% tariff and exactly how to secure an exemption. 

The end result is uncertainty, the wet blanket of any enterprise.

You would think that a trade war with China and concerns about protecting American technology would discourage Chinese companies from setting up shop in the U.S. But lately, I have heard some chatter from a few birds in the industry that Chinese companies, specifically those working on autonomous vehicle technology or adjacent tech, are repatriating to the United States. Stay tuned as I dig into this one.

Remember Blade, the helicopter ride-share business? The urban air-mobility business, which went public via a merger with a blank-check company, enjoyed its fair share of buzz and controversy since its founding in 2014.

And now it's owned by electric air-taxi developer Joby Aviation. The deal is worth up to $125 million and includes the Blade brand and its passenger business, which has operations in the United States and Europe. Blade's medical division isn't included in the transaction and will remain a separate company.

Blade founder and CEO Rob Wiesenthal will continue to lead the business, which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Joby.

I wasn't exactly expecting this deal, but it sure does make sense. Blade has sought partnerships with other electric aircraft companies, including Wisk. And Joby will need the infrastructure if it wants to ramp up commercial operations — once its electric aircraft receives the Type Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.

The deal gives Joby instant access to a network of 12 terminals in key markets like New York City — notably, a dedicated lounge and terminal bases at John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport, as well as in Manhattan's West Side and East Side and on Wall Street.

Other deals that got my attention this week …

Drone startup Destinus, which supplies weapons to Ukraine, plans to buy Daedalean, a Swiss company developing autopilot systems for aviation. The deal is reportedly for $223 million in cash and stock.

Jeh Aerospace, an Indian aerospace component-manufacturing company with headquarters in Atlanta, raised $11 million in a Series A round led by Elevation Capital, with participation from General Catalyst.

Uzum, the Uzbekistan-based express food delivery and fintech startup, raised $65.5 million in a round co-led by China's Tencent and the New York- and London-based VR Capital, with participation from U.S.-based FinSight Ventures.

Foxconn has sold a former GM factory (and surrounding land) for $88 million and machinery and equipment from its EV subsidiaries for around $287 million. Reminder: Foxconn never managed to scale production of EVs at the plant after three years of ownership. So what is to come of this factory? The buyer is reportedly SoftBank, and the plan is to turn this factory into an AI data center.

Lyft made a strategic partnership with Baidu to deploy the Chinese tech giant's Apollo Go autonomous vehicles across several European markets. The companies want to launch robotaxi services in Germany and the United Kingdom in 2026.

Rivian filed a lawsuit to be able to sell its electric vehicles directly to consumers in Ohio. The company claims existing law unfairly benefits Tesla, which received a special exemption.

Zoox has received an exemption from federal safety regulators to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads. There is some considerable backstory here, so I recommend reading my article. TL;DR: This clears up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox robotaxis complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards. It also puts an end to a related investigation into whether the Amazon-owned company had sidestepped federal regulations.

The Tesla news cycle just won't quit. And for some, it may feel contradictory. The company's board of directors approved a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk worth around $29 billion in shares, with the company citing the “ever-intensifying AI talent war and Tesla's position at a critical inflection point” as reasons for the payout. Meanwhile, Tesla, which has seen automotive revenues drop, is pushing to turn its AI and autonomy ambitions into moneymakers. 

Two developments this week have chipped away at those aspirations. First, Tesla has shuttered its Dojo supercomputer program, ending its bid to develop in-house chips for driverless technology. And separately, a jury found Tesla partly to blame for a fatal 2019 crash and ordered it to pay around $242.5 million in punitive and compensatory damages. It's a notable case in which plaintiffs successfully argued there is a gap between how Tesla talks about its Autopilot driver-assistance system and its actual capabilities. (The Verge has an interesting interview with the attorney.)

The Autonocast, a podcast about the future of transportation that I happen to co-host, had a fun guest recently. Boris Sofman, who led Waymo's now-shuttered self-driving trucks program and co-founded Anki Robotics, came on the show to discuss his new autonomous vehicle technology startup Bedrock Robotics. Give it a listen!

Apple in 2024 showed a swanky demo of what it said would be a new, intelligent Siri that would connect with different apps to fetch all kinds of information. But this new Siri has yet to see the light of day, as the company seemingly hasn't been able to get it ready. 

However, Bloomberg now reports that Apple is testing a version of Siri that will be able to take actions on your behalf across various apps by following voice commands. The company plans to release a new version of App Intents, its framework that gives developers the ability to allow users access to parts of their app via different systems, like search and Shortcuts.

Bloomberg reported that if this new version of Siri and App Intents works well, a user would be able to ask Siri to search for a photo, edit it, and send it to someone; post comments on a social app; or log in to a service.

The company is already testing this feature with apps like Uber, AllTrails, Threads, Temu, Amazon, YouTube, Facebook, and WhatsApp, the report said. The publication previously reported that Apple planned to release an overhauled version of Siri in spring 2026.

Training AI agents to use computers, browsers, and software is one of the highest-potential opportunities for AI. To date, however, this capability is still unreliable. The emerging method to improve this is called Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, researchers are currently bottlenecked by a lack of high-quality simulators and task + verifiers.To solve this problem, we're building Westworld, a fully-simulated internet made up of synthetic versions of the most common consumer and enterprise apps. Agents use Westworld to learn how to do economically valuable tasks.For example, AI agents can practice planning vacations on a simulated flight booking site (https://flights.halluminate.ai/), or learn how to reorganize outdated information in your sales platform, or train to do financial modeling directly in a spreadsheet.Here's a demo showing our flight booking simulation: https://www.loom.com/share/74a3b28067e24c1b886054ba90a90aa5.How it works: AI agents access our environment and are given a task + verifier. A task is basically an objective for the agent to achieve, for example ""Book me a flight from SF to NYC on this date with x, y, z filters.” A verifier is a programmatic way to determine if the task was successfully completed. For example, in this case it might be a json that checks if the final flight data matches expectations. These signals can then be used to calculate a reward in RL.The more simulators we build, the more AI labs can improve on capabilities that computer use agents are currently weak at. One of our customers saw a ~20% improvement in date-picking performance when training on our flight booking simulator.Two things make this hard so far:(1) The simulations have to be realistic. You can't get away with a vibe-coded “80% solution” because even small divergences impact performance. Generating simulated data is even harder. For example, massaging flight data to look realistic took a lot of trial and experimentation.(2) The tasks you train agents on have to be well-chosen. They are only valuable if they reflect work that people actually want solved. We need a lot of feedback from domain experts to get this right.That said, we find this work incredibly interesting and are excited to tackle these issues. A few things we are pumped to ship in the near term: - Ability to train on long-horizon tasks by stringing multiple simulators together for extended workflows; - Procedural data generation. Instead of synthetically generating all the data upfront, how can we model data generation so that our simulators are populated procedurally as agents explore (think Minecraft); - Open source! We plan to release our environments to the public so developers/researchers can hack them for their own experimentation.RL simulators are just one part of our business. The other part is around human data creation (think Scale AI but for computer use). We produce off-the-shelf pre-training/fine-tuning datasets, expert human evaluation/error analysis, or any other data needs for our customers. There are also a lot of exciting overlaps between the two - for example, using human experts to help create our simulators/tasks. Happy to go in more detail, but we thought that simulators would make for the more interesting HackerNews post :)Finally, about us: Wyatt and I met while studying CS at Cornell and have been living and working together for over 7 years. I previously led product/research at Capital One Labs, where I launched one of the first AI agents in banking. Wyatt previously was a Cornell Milstein scholar and did large-scale data engineering for 2 early-stage startups in NYC. We left our jobs last year, and faced these problems first-hand while building evals for our customers who were browser/computer use agent companies.If anyone has any questions, feedback, or thoughts please let us know! Looking forward to your comments.

My own experience makes me lean toward thinking that the truth is somewhere in the middle in this situation, and that simulators like these will be valuable. I've been experimenting a lot with computer use on my website Bingeclock, passing through different prompts along the lines of ""make a movie marathon based on X."" The newest agents are consistently impressive, while also being consistently imperfect in surprising and interesting ways.Whether or not all the labs are already running this kind of thing internally for themselves, you would know better than I. But it's an idea that seems very useful nonetheless. Congratulations on the launch!

re: labs doing this internally. They definitely are! However, the scale of sims buildout is going to be massive, probably many orders of magnitude above what we have today. We think it makes sense for one central player to do this because a really good simulator can be used by multiple people at once. It doesn't make sense for every AI lab/company to build out their own environments if an industry standard catalog exists.

If it gets a major travel detail wrong, purchases a business class ticket on accident, etc. and I need to adjust the booking by calling the airline, then I'm way less happy than I was if I just bought the ticket myself. Not to mention what happens when Google flights gets a UI refresh and knocks the accuracy rate of the agent down even 10%.Digital criminals are gonna love it, though.I'm personally much more interested in automating browser tasks that aren't economically valuable because that mitigates the risk.

I think this will probably be a mixture of automated QA/engineering and scale.Another interesting path is actually partnering directly with software providers to offer their platforms as simulators IF they see there is a competitive advantage to training agents to perform well on their UI.This idea we're really excited about, but it would require a company to see real revenue potential in enabling agentic access vs not. I'd say we're still on the ""block them out"" phase of the internet (ex. see Cloudflare's recent post about bot detection: https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-unde...)

However, in talking with my AI Labs, their perspective on flight booking is a little different. ""Solving"" flight booking requires the AI agent to solve a LOT of hard problems. Namely, personalization, context, weighing multiple options, interacting with the UI, math, then wrapping that all up into a coherent response. The thought process is IF a computer use agent is able to solve flight booking well, then we will have developed many other powerful primitives that will scale to other problems.So as a standalone use case, I'm inclined to agree this might not be where the most agent traction is seen. However, as a research/capability goal, there are some generalizations that could apply to other very important use cases.

If you're rich, you can just look for the ticket at the time you like on your preferred airline and buy a first class ticket, whatever the price, for whenever you want to fly, even if it's tomorrow. For the rest, that's not practical. So the flight search has to begin a few months out, with the burden of doing multiple searches (in incognito mode) across various airlines and/or aggregators, in order to optimize various factors. This takes a non-trivial amount of time. Add in looking for hotels and rental cars, and for some it's fun,
for others it's an annoying burdensome chore that stands in the way of being on vacation.It's just an example use case though. Similar to how ""robot maid"" that folds clothes isn't the be-all or end-all for robotics, if an AI is able to perform that task, it's going to have capabilities necessary for performing a wide variety of other tasks.

As the line between helping and judging blurs, the cost of errors is steep.

The propensity for AI systems to make mistakes and for humans to miss those mistakes has been on full display in the US legal system as of late. The follies began when lawyers—including some at prestigious firms—submitted documents citing cases that didn't exist. Similar mistakes soon spread to other roles in the courts. In December, a Stanford professor submitted sworn testimony containing hallucinations and errors in a case about deepfakes, despite being an expert on AI and misinformation himself.

The buck stopped with judges, who—whether they or opposing counsel caught the mistakes—issued reprimands and fines, and likely left attorneys embarrassed enough to think twice before trusting AI again.

But now judges are experimenting with generative AI too. Some are confident that with the right precautions, the technology can expedite legal research, summarize cases, draft routine orders, and overall help speed up the court system, which is badly backlogged in many parts of the US. This summer, though, we've already seen AI-generated mistakes go undetected and cited by judges. A federal judge in New Jersey had to reissue an order riddled with errors that may have come from AI, and a judge in Mississippi refused to explain why his order too contained mistakes that seemed like AI hallucinations. 

The results of these early-adopter experiments make two things clear. One, the category of routine tasks—for which AI can assist without requiring human judgment—is slippery to define. Two, while lawyers face sharp scrutiny when their use of AI leads to mistakes, judges may not face the same accountability, and walking back their mistakes before they do damage is much harder.

Xavier Rodriguez, a federal judge for the Western District of Texas, has good reason to be skeptical of AI. He started learning about artificial intelligence back in 2018, four years before the release of ChatGPT (thanks in part to the influence of his twin brother, who works in tech). But he's also seen AI-generated mistakes in his own court. 

In a recent dispute about who was to receive an insurance payout, both the plaintiff and the defendant represented themselves, without lawyers (this is not uncommon—nearly a quarter of civil cases in federal court involve at least one unrepresented party). The two sides wrote their own filings and made their own arguments. 

“Both sides used AI tools,” Rodriguez says, and both submitted filings that referenced made-up cases. He had authority to reprimand them, but given that they were not lawyers, he opted not to. 

“I think there's been an overreaction by a lot of judges on these sanctions. The running joke I tell when I'm on the speaking circuit is that lawyers have been hallucinating well before AI,” he says. Missing a mistake from an AI model is not wholly different, to Rodriguez, from failing to catch the error of a first-year lawyer. “I'm not as deeply offended as everybody else,” he says. 

In his court, Rodriguez has been using generative AI tools (he wouldn't publicly name which ones, to avoid the appearance of an endorsement) to summarize cases. He'll ask AI to identify key players involved and then have it generate a timeline of key events. Ahead of specific hearings, Rodriguez will also ask it to generate questions for attorneys based on the materials they submit.

These tasks, to him, don't lean on human judgment. They also offer lots of opportunities for him to intervene and uncover any mistakes before they're brought to the court. “It's not any final decision being made, and so it's relatively risk free,” he says. Using AI to predict whether someone should be eligible for bail, on the other hand, goes too far in the direction of judgment and discretion, in his view.

Erin Solovey, a professor and researcher on human-AI interaction at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, recently studied how judges in the UK think about this distinction between rote, machine-friendly work that feels safe to delegate to AI and tasks that lean more heavily on human expertise. 

“The line between what is appropriate for a human judge to do versus what is appropriate for AI tools to do changes from judge to judge and from one scenario to the next,” she says.

Even so, according to Solovey, some of these tasks simply don't match what AI is good at. Asking AI to summarize a large document, for example, might produce drastically different results depending on whether the model has been trained to summarize for a general audience or a legal one. AI also struggles with logic-based tasks like ordering the events of a case. “A very plausible-sounding timeline may be factually incorrect,” Solovey says. 

Rodriguez and a number of other judges crafted guidelines that were published in February by the Sedona Conference, an influential think tank that issues principles for particularly murky areas of the law. They outline a host of potentially “safe” uses of AI for judges, including conducting legal research, creating preliminary transcripts, and searching briefings, while warning that judges should verify outputs from AI and that “no known GenAI tools have fully resolved the hallucination problem.”

Hallucinations from AI in court documents are infuriating judges. Experts predict that the problem's only going to get worse.

Judge Allison Goddard, a federal magistrate judge in California and a coauthor of the guidelines, first felt the impact that AI would have on the judiciary when she taught a class on the art of advocacy at her daughter's high school. She was impressed by a student's essay and mentioned it to her daughter. “She said, ‘Oh, Mom, that's ChatGPT.'”

“What I realized very quickly was this is going to really transform the legal profession,” she says. In her court, Goddard has been experimenting with ChatGPT, Claude (which she keeps ""open all day""), and a host of other AI models. If a case involves a particularly technical issue, she might ask AI to help her understand which questions to ask attorneys. She'll summarize 60-page orders from the district judge and then ask the AI model follow-up questions about it, or ask it to organize information from documents that are a mess. 

“It's kind of a thought partner, and it brings a perspective that you may not have considered,” she says.

Goddard also encourages her clerks to use AI, specifically Anthropic's Claude, because by default it does not train on user conversations. But it has its limits. For anything that requires law-specific knowledge, she'll use tools from Westlaw or Lexis, which have AI tools built specifically for lawyers, but she finds general-purpose AI models to be faster for lots of other tasks. And her concerns about bias have prevented her from using it for tasks in criminal cases, like determining if there was probable cause for an arrest.

In this, Goddard appears to be caught in the same predicament the AI boom has created for many of us. Three years in, companies have built tools that sound so fluent and humanlike they obscure the intractable problems lurking underneath—answers that read well but are wrong, models that are trained to be decent at everything but perfect for nothing, and the risk that your conversations with them will be leaked to the internet. Each time we use them, we bet that the time saved will outweigh the risks, and trust ourselves to catch the mistakes before they matter. For judges, the stakes are sky-high: If they lose that bet, they face very public consequences, and the impact of such mistakes on the people they serve can be lasting. 

“I'm not going to be the judge that cites hallucinated cases and orders,” Goddard says. “It's really embarrassing, very professionally embarrassing.”

Still, some judges don't want to get left behind in the AI age. With some in the AI sector suggesting that the supposed objectivity and rationality of AI models could make them better judges than fallible humans, it might lead some on the bench to think that falling behind poses a bigger risk than getting too far out ahead. 

The risks of early adoption have raised alarm bells with Judge Scott Schlegel, who serves on the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal in Louisiana. Schlegel has long blogged about the helpful role technology can play in modernizing the court system, but he has warned that AI-generated mistakes in judges' rulings signal a “crisis waiting to happen,” one that would dwarf the problem of lawyers' submitting filings with made-up cases. 

Attorneys who make mistakes can get sanctioned, have their motions dismissed, or lose cases when the opposing party finds out and flags the errors. “When the judge makes a mistake, that's the law,” he says. “I can't go a month or two later and go ‘Oops, so sorry,' and reverse myself. It doesn't work that way.”

Consider child custody cases or bail proceedings, Schlegel says: “There are pretty significant consequences when a judge relies upon artificial intelligence to make the decision,” especially if the citations that decision relies on are made-up or incorrect.

This is not theoretical. In June, a Georgia appellate court judge issued an order that relied partially on made-up cases submitted by one of the parties, a mistake that went uncaught. In July, a federal judge in New Jersey withdrew an opinion after lawyers complained it too contained hallucinations. 

Unlike lawyers, who can be ordered by the court to explain why there are mistakes in their filings, judges do not have to show much transparency, and there is little reason to think they'll do so voluntarily. On August 4, a federal judge in Mississippi had to issue a new decision in a civil rights case after the original was found to contain incorrect names and serious errors. The judge did not fully explain what led to the errors even after the state asked him to do so. “No further explanation is warranted,” the judge wrote.

These mistakes could erode the public's faith in the legitimacy of courts, Schlegel says. Certain narrow and monitored applications of AI—summarizing testimonies, getting quick writing feedback—can save time, and they can produce good results if judges treat the work like that of a first-year associate, checking it thoroughly for accuracy. But most of the job of being a judge is dealing with what he calls the white-page problem: You're presiding over a complex case with a blank page in front of you, forced to make difficult decisions. Thinking through those decisions, he says, is indeed the work of being a judge. Getting help with a first draft from an AI undermines that purpose.

“If you're making a decision on who gets the kids this weekend and somebody finds out you use Grok and you should have used Gemini or ChatGPT—you know, that's not the justice system.”

Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of their revenue from their specialized chip sales in China, in a deal so unconventional the business world is still reeling.

The arrangement, effectively a new kind of “export tax,” is an unprecedented move that ends a months-long blockade and reopens one of the world's largest markets for America's two most valuable chipmakers.

The news, first reported by the Financial Times, reveals the original and transactional tactics the Trump administration is deploying to generate revenue and control the flow of strategic technology. Nvidia and AMD chips are highly sought after by companies and governments to train their AI tools in the current AI race.

For Nvidia and AMD, agreeing to pay the government a portion of their profits was the lesser of two evils. Being completely locked out of the Chinese market was a financial catastrophe.

Nvidia had been hit particularly hard. After the administration blocked its China-specific chips in April, the company was forced to take a $4.5 billion charge for excess inventory it could no longer sell.

In May, it warned investors that the restrictions would cost the company an estimated $8 billion in revenue for the full fiscal year. Faced with losing billions, handing over 15% of future sales was a price they were willing to pay.

The standoff is the latest chapter in the long-running U.S.-China tech war. The U.S. government has been trying to slow Beijing's military advancement by blocking its access to high-end AI chips.

After the previous administration banned the sale of their most powerful processors, Nvidia and AMD cleverly designed special, less-powerful “compliance chips” — like Nvidia's H2O and AMD's MI308 — specifically for the Chinese market.

But in April, the Trump administration tightened the screws, requiring a special license to sell even these less powerful chips. That move triggered months of intense, high-stakes lobbying, marked by several White House visits from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, which ultimately led to this new arrangement.

For the Trump administration, the deal is a win on multiple fronts. It provides a new stream of federal revenue that could help finance the massive tax cuts in the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the president's signature legislation.

It also allows the administration to look tough on China while simultaneously protecting the financial health of critical American companies.

In a carefully worded statement to Gizmodo, an Nvidia spokesperson avoided confirming the 15% figure but acknowledged the new reality.

“We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” it reads. “While we haven't shipped H2O to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”

The spokesperson added: “America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunications leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world's standard if we race.”

This new deal is a radical departure from traditional trade policy.

Governments typically encourage and subsidize exports from their national champions to boost trade balances. This new model, however, forces America's most successful companies to pay for the privilege of competing abroad.

It's a pragmatic compromise that gives Nvidia a path to reclaim its dominant market position and potentially push its market value past the unprecedented $5 trillion threshold. But it also sets a startling precedent for how the U.S. government could exert control over its most strategic industries in the future.

AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

We all want more for less—or at least I do. It's that Holy Grail of deals that makes the idea of budget gadgets so appealing, and especially so in the world of phones. The whole idea of a budget phone is pitching you what may as well be the bargain of the century. For less money, budget phones ostensibly offer you a device that does it all: browses the web, retrieves your email, makes calls and texts, gives you near-unlimited access to apps, and even captures important memories like your niece's first birthday and the horrible decision to hire a clown (therapy stuff). It's everything for almost nothing—write that down, phone companies.

But if you're like me, you see a good deal, and you wonder, “What's the catch?” That's what I say when I see a budget phone, but each and every time, I put my skepticism aside and open myself up to the prospect of forgetting the idea of flagships and embracing the warm bosom of budget stuff. That's what I did with the CMF by Nothing Phone 2 Pro (hereafter shortened to the shorter CMF Phone 2 Pro), and surely this will be the one that clicks… right?

CMF Phone 2 Pro

The CMF by Nothing Phone 2 Pro is a budget phone with more value than you'd expect.

Pros

Cons

There is a sea of budget phones out there, and most of them aren't even trying to be different. The same can't be said for the CMF Phone 2 Pro, a $280 device from a subbrand of Nothing, the company that makes see-through earbuds and, most recently, the divisive Phone 3. What makes CMF different in the budget phone space? A host of first-party accessories that position its Phone 2 Pro as modular in some ways. At launch, CMF offered a few: an attachable lanyard, additional camera lenses that include a fisheye and macro, a “universal cover” for actually putting stuff on, and a magnetic wallet mount. There's even a cool screw for attaching the lanyard built into the bottom of the device!

See CMF Phone 2 Pro at Amazon

They're not groundbreaking accessories by any means, but the idea of a modular phone is a provocative one, especially in the budget space where things get vanilla very fast. The problem? I haven't gotten to try any of that out. According to a spokesperson for Nothing, there was a manufacturing issue with the universal case that actually allows you to attach things, which prevents me (the person who's supposed to test this phone out) from, well, testing this stuff out. Not off to a great start when it comes to budget phone impressions.

Still, there's a lot of phone to test here, even if the main thing that makes this budget phone interesting isn't one of them. So, let's start with the more traditional stuff.

There are a few notable upgrades over the CMF Phone 1, and one of them is the camera. This time, the Phone 2 Pro gives you a three-lens system that includes a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 50-megapixel telephoto, and an 8-megapixel ultrawide. That's, on the surface, a pretty good deal, but what matters is how all that actually translates to the pictures the phone takes. And the answer to that is… honestly, better than you'd think.

Obviously, you can't expect a $280 phone to take flagship-level pictures, but you want them to be above potato quality all the same. I'd say the CMF Phone 2 Pro sometimes takes pictures at a level you'd expect, but a lot of the time exceeds your expectations. This generation's camera was designed specifically to capture more light with its sensor, and it definitely succeeds in that endeavor. Even photos shot outdoors on a cloudy day looked plenty bright—so bright that I would say I was actually surprised.

Any issue I have with the camera system doesn't have to do with its ability to capture light; it would be with its sharpness. Pictures on the CMF Phone 2 Pro tend to all look a little soft, with edges that can get a little blurry. This is a budget phone, after all, but something to be aware of if you're stepping down from a midrange device or, God forbid, a flagship. To avoid that dullness as much as you can, I'd recommend shooting in 50 megapixels for the highest resolution by changing your camera's settings, which are set to 12 megapixels by default. That won't change the fact that this lens (a budget one) may just be on the duller side, but it won't hurt.

Speaking of shooting in 50 megapixels, you should be prepared for a slight delay on the shutter when you're snapping pictures—sometimes that delay between button press and a picture actually being taken is about two seconds. Again, these are the types of sacrifices you'll make when buying a budget phone, and it may be a deal-breaker for some, but if you're not expecting the best and fastest all the time, it may be worth the savings. Overall, I would describe the photos as a step above what I was expecting from a sub-$300 device, slightly soft-looking warts and all.

So far, we've got a better-than-you-think camera, nonexistent accessories, and a very affordable price. But what about the rest of the Phone 2 Pro? If you're going to be taking pictures, you need a screen that actually lets you look at them with the right amount of color contrast, brightness, and clarity, and I can say the CMF Phone 2 Pro has that. There's a 6.77-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that provides 3,000 nits of peak brightness. In phone speak, that equates to a fast, fluid screen with good color contrast that makes editing photos, scrolling web pages, and watching YouTube videos feel seamless. Swiping between apps and pages on the phone is responsive, just like any other phone with a 120Hz refresh rate.

Performance-wise, the Phone 2 Pro is using a budget chip, the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro, but as I've said in many other phone reviews, an older chip often doesn't matter much. The only time I noticed any real, perceptible slowness was when I was taking photos, but outside of that—if you're just web browsing and using apps like most people—then this will be enough performance to get you by.

While the biggest differentiator of the Phone 2 Pro is still the accessories, the second biggest is probably Nothing OS, which is Nothing's custom skin over Android that comes with some visual flourishes, including a monochrome setting that defaults all your app icons to black and white. If you don't want that, you can easily change your phone to stock Android, but it's nice to have the option. As is the case with other Nothing phones, Nothing OS runs smoothly on the CMF Phone 2 Pro even with a slower chipset. Again, this is not a phone built for machine learning, Apple-style computational photography, or graphics-intensive 3D gaming, but for all the normal stuff you do on a day-to-day basis, it performs reasonably well.

One thing that I love to see in the second-gen CMF phone is an NFC chip, which means that you can actually use mobile payments. Everyone is different, but not being able to use my phone to pay for things would be a dealbreaker, so it's nice to see CMF upped its game here. Battery-wise, the CMF Phone 2 Pro comes with a 5,000mAh battery, which lasted about two days for me with normal usage. For reference, that's the same size battery you'd get on the Nothing Phone 3a Pro and lots of other phones for that matter. The CMF Phone 2 Pro also supports fast charging, but only up to 33W, compared to the Phone 3a Pro's 55W. One feature that was surprising to me was the inclusion of reverse charging, which operates at a slow and steady 5W, but it is still nice to have in a pinch. I was able to top up my Nothing Ear wireless earbuds, which was pretty neat.

One thing that you're going to get in basically any budget phone on the market is less expensive materials—this isn't an iPhone, no titanium here. The CMF Phone 2 Pro is no different and is made mostly from plastic. The bad news is the phone feels cheap in your hand, but the good news is it's also incredibly light, which I don't hate. Design-wise, I think the look of the CMF Phone 2 Pro is actually a step down from the CMF Phone 1, especially because it doesn't have a modular backplate anymore that lets you customize the look. The glass is glued on, despite the screws that would have you thinking otherwise. My main gripe aesthetically is that the “light green” colorway actually looks more blue or silver than anything else. I even did an impromptu quiz in the Gizmodo office, and most guesses were “silver.” I'm not going to go full color police here, but if your name is CMF (an acronym for color, material, and finish), you ought to nail the whole color thing.

I'm going to be honest with you: I won't be using a budget device any time soon—I've grown accustomed to snappy pictures aided by computational photography, beefy chipsets, and a weight and feel that some midrange and budget devices don't offer. But just because I won't be switching doesn't mean you shouldn't. The fact of the matter is that the CMF Phone 2 Pro does what you need it to and even excels in categories that you wouldn't expect.

The CMF Phone 2 Pro has a camera that performs much better than it ought to, a solid battery, a screen that will please most people in most scenarios, and even ventures to offer unique perks like accessories and bespoke software, even if one of those things was actually kind of botched at launch. In the budget world, I think it's hard to find all of those pros in one package, and for $280 it's encouraging to know that you can get a device that won't make you feel like you've stepped back in time to a point where people still said the “cell” in front of “phone.” I hope that CMF figures out its modular identity, though. A glued-on backplate is a step back, and not having accessories available at launch is a bad look, but the idea of a modular phone is one that I think could appeal to the masses.

Budget phones will never be for the legions of spoiled iPhone users, but for the rest of the world, options like the CMF Phone 2 Pro are here to fill in the gaps and offer you quite a lot for not a lot of money, and it's nice to know that if you ever wanted to, you could still buy a sub-$300 phone and get away with it.

A clean workspace is a productive workspace. If you're looking to improve your setup, a good docking station can be a smart investment, and right now, you don't have to pay the full price for one.

The HP USB-C dock G5 is down to $110 on Amazon after a 52% discount. That's more than $100 off a compact yet powerful device, but the discount might not be around for long. Snag it up while it's still available.

See at Amazon

Starting with what matters the most – ports. This compact box gives you four USB‑A ports, a USB‑C port up front for data transfer and power (up to 15W output), an audio jack, and wired connectivity options like HDMI 2.0 and dual DisplayPort 1.4. It covers everything from essentials like a mouse, keyboard, and webcam. You can even connect up to three monitors for a more expansive and productive workspace. Take video meetings on one while having work documents open on the other, or game while also chatting with friends on the side — options are endless.

There's an RJ-45 Ethernet port for a stable, wired internet connection, as well. You won't have to worry about your Wi-Fi signals dropping during important tasks.

It even saves you from those dreaded IT department visits. HP packs it with features like PXE Boot, MAC address pass-through, and Wake-on-LAN. These let tech teams access, manage, and troubleshoot your device remotely. For example, if your company needs to install new software or fix an existing issue, the IT team will handle all complications in the background while you keep working.

The dock is manufactured by HP, but supports universal compatibility. It works with both HP and non-HP USB-C and Thunderbolt-enabled laptops. It's a flexible option for homes with multiple users and will still work with future laptop upgrades.

Plus, since it's less than 5 x 5 inches, it takes very little space and is easy to carry with you around. Plug your devices in, place it near your monitor or laptop, and you're set.

In short, we all know how messy setups can get when you have multiple devices. At a little over $100, this dock offers a great way to cut down on cord clutter and manage all your gear from a single place. It keeps your desk neat and saves you from constantly swapping cables. If your current setup feels cluttered and unorganized, we recommend jumping in on this deal for a budget-friendly upgrade. Just note that it might not last long, so act fast while you can.

There are only a few brands that truly get over-ear headphones right, and Bose is one of them. The brand's QuietComfort lineup is especially great for anyone looking for decent noise cancellation with all-day comfort, and right now, you can grab a pair for less.

Amazon has slashed the price of the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones to $229, which is 34% off the usual price. This is the lowest we've seen in a while, and the discount is available on multiple color options.

See at Amazon

As with most Bose products, a premium finish and solid build quality are a given. Earcups are plush, and the headband is padded, so having these on for extended periods won't leave you with red, sore ears.

Noise cancelling is the big feature here, but Bose makes it flexible. You're getting two noise control modes. Quiet mode blocks out the world when you want to be completely immersed in whatever's playing. Aware mode lets you stay connected to the background voices and laughter while still enjoying quality audio. Want to listen to the latest Coldplay song while feeling every beat? Go for the quiet mode. Working in a cafe and want to hear when the barista calls your name? Aware mode it is.

Those who prefer more control over their audio will appreciate the adjustable EQ in the Bose app. It lets you fine-tune the bass, mid-range, and treble for a personalized experience. They're also versatile, so you can connect to multiple devices at once and switch between them without constant re-pairing.

Long commutes and work hours will be covered, too. Bose packs these with up to 24 hours of battery life on a single charge – enough for one full day of listening. Even better, a quick 15-minute top-up gives you about 2.5 hours of playback. They are essentially wireless, but Bose does include an audio cable so you can keep listening even when the battery levels are running low or you just don't have a stable Bluetooth connection.

Overall, this is a solid chance to pick up a pair of premium over-ear headphones at one of the best prices we've seen. You're getting excellent comfort, two audio modes that let you customize your experience, a solid battery life, and more. The discount is available on multiple color options, including some limited-edition pairs like the Twilight Blue. At $229, it is still a bit of an investment, but you're paying for gear that's made to last.

Controversial lightning rod Elon Musk is making major moves in the United Kingdom, as his electric car company Tesla looks to find new ways to diversify its income streams.

According to OFGEM, the U.K. energy regulator, Tesla has formally applied for a license to sell electricity to households and businesses across Britain.

Approval of that application could be a major boost for both Musk and Tesla, which has seen sales skid as Musk has become an increasingly polarizing figure in American politics.

Data published last week by the U.K.'s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed Tesla's new car sales dropped by nearly 60% to 987 units last month, down from 2,462 a year ago.

In Germany, meanwhile, Tesla car sales fell to 1,110 units in July, down 55.1% from the same month in 2024.

The company continues to face stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational damage from Musk's incendiary rhetoric and fractious relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration.

The filing was submitted at the end of last month by Tesla Energy Ventures and signed by Andrew Payne, who oversees the company's European energy operations.

If it is approved, it could clear the way for Tesla to join the ranks of retail energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales as early as next year.

The UK's energy sector generates over $200 billion a year and a slice of that could be exactly what Musk is looking to use to shore up Tesla.

Tesla is already active in power generation and storage: The company develops rooftop solar systems and home battery products, and operates an electricity service in Texas called Tesla Electric, launched in 2022.

That service lets customers decide when they use power and rewards them for selling surplus energy back to the grid during peak demand, potentially lowering their bills or even earning them money. It's a model Tesla appears poised to replicate in the U.K. market. The goal of this ecosystem is to have a Tesla in your driveway, Tesla solar panels on your roof, a Tesla Powerwall battery in your garage, and now, a Tesla electricity plan to manage it all. This license is the final, crucial piece of that puzzle.

We need an affordable MacBook, now more than ever. It's time to face the fact that today's headlining laptop chips are overkill for what most folk need a computer for. If the majority of internet users are browsing the internet on phones that cost $200 or $400 less than the cheapest MacBook Air, it only makes sense to put a mobile chip into a laptop shell and call it a day. New rumors suggest that Apple could do just that, and we could see this cheapo Mac before the end of the year.

Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, a semi-reliable source for upcoming Apple products, proposed the Mac maker was on the road to a cheaper MacBook. A new report from DigiTimes Asia (spotted by MacRumors) adds fuel to that kindling rumor. The site reported, based on anonymous “supply chain sources,” that there's a 12.9-inch MacBook in the works that could hit the scene this year. Better yet, it will cost between $600 and $700. The reason it will go for close to $400 under the current MacBook Air M4 is because it will use one of Apple's A-series mobile chips, likely the A18 Pro found on the iPhone 16 Pro, rather than Apple's M-series silicon.

The next MacBook would be slightly smaller in size compared to a MacBook Air with a 13.6-inch display. If Apple does manage to push out this cheapo Mac, it likely won't be here until the tail end of the year. Recent rumors from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman suggest Apple could push its next MacBook Pros to 2026. A cheap MacBook would be one way to fill the gap in its release schedule. In the meantime, today's iPads are also split between devices like the iPad mini with an A17 Pro chip and the iPad Air and iPad Pro with M-series silicon. It makes sense for Apple to split up its laptops in the same way.

Apple's current cheap iPhone, the iPhone 16e, lacks some of the modern amenities of today's iPhones, like the Dynamic Island and wireless MagSafe charging. A cheap MacBook would likely sport a basic IPS LCD panel and very few I/O ports. It could feature lower resolutions of earlier Intel-based MacBooks like the discontinued 12-inch MacBook. No matter what, its main selling point will be its affordability. Apple would allow users to access the new macOS 26 features alongside quality-of-life capabilities like AirDrop and access to iMessage. Today's A18 chips are based on a 3nm process, which in layman's terms means they're very fast and power efficient. As long as you're not looking to play AAA games or work on more-intensive rendering apps, such mobile chips would be perfectly serviceable.

While us computing nerds press our noses to the screen to identify the minute differences between single- and multi-core CPU benchmarks across PC and Mac chip generations, the rest of the world isn't aware or just doesn't care about how powerful their laptop is. Most consumers just want a device that can browse their socials, hit up their favorite apps, and let them type out a few emails. A phone can do all that, and it's small enough to fit in your pocket. U.S. census data shows us that most households use phones as their main computing device. Families who only access the internet via a smartphone normally make much less money as a whole than those with home computers and are much more likely to live below the poverty line. There are some people who have no choice but to opt for cheaper devices. Luckily, with today's variety of chips, cheaper doesn't need to be worse.

We're in a place where affordable laptops don't have to be so much worse. Today's sub-$500 PCs are relatively serviceable, even with low-end Intel and AMD chips. That doesn't mean there isn't a floor for specs that users need to make a laptop worth the money. Today's Chromebook models have been supplemented by the addition of “Chromebook Plus” with minimum specs like 8GB of RAM. Still, even an excellent laptop like Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 feels constrained by the focus of cloud-based apps on ChromeOS. If Apple sticks macOS 26 on its cheapo MacBook, users would have access to the full gamut of Mac-enabled features.

3D printing metal just got way more practical.

The Korea Institute of Industrial Technology recently announced an incredible breakthrough in the world of additive manufacturing (aka 3D printing) and its practical application in the space industry. In a joint project led by the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI), KP Aviation Industries, Hanyang University, and AM Solutions, the group managed to 3D print a fuel tank out of titanium that was able to pass a critical durability test, as reported by Popular Science.

It seems that things are ramping up when it comes to getting space-ready 3D printed objects. It was just last week that another team showcased their efforts in getting 3D printed components to pass crucial tests for space travel. In that situation, the 3D printed pieces were coated before passing particle contamination tests. This is different from this project, in which the researchers have created metal-based components that are passing tests for durability.

The team decided to work on 3D printing a fuel tank, which has high-performance requirements when it comes to the ability to withstand pressure. Typically, tanks are forged using molds that titanium alloys can be poured into. This is great for reproducing the same piece over and over again, but much harder to adapt for custom designs. The ability to 3D print a fuel tank out of metal that is strong enough to withstand the pressure requirements for space launch is a huge step in enabling private and one-off space tech.

The 3D printed tank was created using Ti64 titanium alloy and measured 640mm across in diameter. The unit was able to withstand pressure as high as 330 bar. The tank was also cooled using liquid nitrogen, reaching a temperature of -320.8 F° (-196°C).

The technology definitely shakes things up a bit by bringing the production of space industry hardware local. However, this work is still in early development and won't be commercially abound any time soon. There are still tons of cool options out there for anyone interested in dabbling in the world of 3D printing. Check out our list of the best 3D printers to see what we recommend and what to look for when shopping for a 3D printer.

""We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Both Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of China-sourced revenues to unlock export licenses for previously restricted chips. Under the reported terms of the new deal, Nvidia will be able to resume H20 chip sales, and AMD will be able to sell its MI308 accelerators into China. The deal, not officially announced, has been reported independently by a multitude of outlets, including the BBC, FT, and Reuters. We also followed up with Nvidia for more details.

The restrictions on exports of such potent AI accelerators were originally put in place due to national security concerns, but the 15% levy marks a significant shift in that strategy. The revenue-share deal would represent a landmark foray into uncharted territory. Several news agencies, such as the BBC and FT, point out that a deal where commercial entities pay a revenue share in exchange for government export license approval is unprecedented.

Furthermore, the FT asserts that the U.S. Commerce Department has already started issuing H20 licenses last Friday. That would be just two days after Jensen Huang last met in person with President Trump.

It is understood that AMD's licenses were also being inked ahead of the weekend. We don't have any AMD statements about the new 15% revenue-sharing deal at the time of writing.

Nvidia has been quite quick to trot out an official statement. This morning, an Nvidia spokesperson told Tom's Hardware, “We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets.” Providing some context to the newly announced export license approval process, they added, “While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”

In addition, the statement repeated arguments in favor of relaxed cutting-edge technology export controls we have seen previously, “America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunication leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world's standard if we race,” ended the short statement.

For Nvidia and AMD, perhaps this policy shift has come at a pivotal time. There have been signs of China-based competitors raising their competitiveness on several fronts.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

Only yesterday, we reported on Chinese state media molding public opinion by characterizing Nvidia H20 GPUs as “neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe.” The safety concerns seem to be a tit-for-tat response to Western powers, who cite similar concerns regarding Chinese-sourced semiconductors. and electronics. Nvidia has strenuously denied the existence of any kill switches, back doors, or spyware in its GPUs.

Reuters provided some interesting context to the new 15% deal between Nvidia, AMD, and the U.S. government. According to the latest financials, Nvidia raked in $17 billion in revenue during its latest financial year from China. AMD's China business scored $6.2 billion in revenue in 2024.

With the Green and Red team's expensive AI chips now available for sale in China, we could expect both yearly revenue figures to increase impressively. However, 15% of the total combined $23.2 billion (latest combined figures) is less than $3.5 billion for the U.S. Treasury. Also, we must remember that the 15% deal only covers the advanced AI chips that require these export licenses. In other words, the 15% deal is ‘small potatoes' to a country like the U.S., when judged purely on financial terms.

Through the looking glass of silicon.

In today's world of bleeding-edge processes and packaging techniques, the Intel 386 doesn't look like much—a grey ceramic slab with 132 gold pins, something you'd expect to find rattling around in an old parts bin at this point. But behind that dull façade lies a marvel of late-1980s chip packaging, the kind of engineering we've taken for granted. Using a CT scanner and some clever digital dissection, Ken Shirriff managed to explore every layer of this classic CPU without once touching a screwdriver or desoldering gun.

The scan produced hundreds of razor-thin X-ray slices, which were stitched into a 3D model you can spin, zoom, and digitally “peel” layer by layer. The first reveal is a halo of gold bond wires, each just 35 µm thick, far thinner than a human hair, radiating from the silicon die. These act as microscopic suspension bridges between the die's pads and the package's internal routing. Some carry simple data or control signals, others gang together—up to five on a pad—to handle the heavier demands of power and ground.



Pull back another layer, and the 386's package shows its true sophistication: it's essentially a six-layer circuit board in miniature. Two internal layers carry the signals while four dedicated copper planes deliver clean, stable power and ground to different sections of the chip. This “single-row double-shelf” bonding method, described in Intel's own packaging literature attached below, was a way to cram maximum connectivity into a surprisingly compact footprint.



Digging deeper into the scans, Shirriff was able to map which pins connect where—some routing directly to I/O pads, others buried deep into the power and logic supply network. The CT imaging even caught details Intel probably never intended anyone to see, like the fine side wires used during manufacturing to electroplate the pins in gold. These plating contacts, barely visible spikes along the package edge, were confirmed when he lightly sanded the ceramic to match the scans.



Moving on, the scans compare the signal and power layers side-by-side, which reveals the design's sophistication. The signal layers are like a tangled web of thin copper paths, weaving between tiny vias, carrying all the data and control signals across the chip. They're intricate and precise, designed to navigate the complex logic inside.

Power layers, by contrast, are almost solid sheets of copper, with only a few holes where the bond pads and vias break through. These planes deliver clean, steady power and ground to the chip, making sure everything runs smoothly without interference or noise that could cause glitches.



Beneath the silicon die, the X-ray reveals a bright patch—that's silver-filled epoxy. This isn't just glue; it's a carefully chosen material that pulls heat away from the chip while also providing a direct, low-resistance ground connection. It's a subtle but vital part of how the package keeps the 386 stable and reliable under load.

The packaging acts like a bridge across massive differences in scale. Inside the silicon die, the tiniest features are about 1 micrometer wide—barely visible even under a microscope. These then expand to wiring on the die around 6 micrometers, which connect to bond pads spaced about a quarter of a millimeter apart.

Those bond pads link to package pads spaced at half a millimeter, and finally to the pins on the bottom of the chip, spaced 2.54 millimeters apart. It's an incredible zoom-out—roughly 2,500 times—from the microscopic core logic to the bulky socket pins you can see and touch.



If you lined up one of the 386's bond wires next to the socket pins it connects to, the size difference would be absurd. That's the beauty of this packaging: it not only protects the die, but transforms it from a delicate, microscopic device into a robust, installable part you could—in theory—swap in and out of a motherboard by hand.

Moreover, the 386 package includes eight pins labeled as “No Connect” (NC), meaning they aren't wired to the motherboard and appear unused. Inside the die, most of these NC pads are nearly connected, with internal wiring and pad spots ready for bond wires. Intel left these as placeholders, likely for testing or debugging during manufacturing. Interestingly, one NC pin is actually connected to the die and functions as an output, hinting at hidden signals Intel kept under wraps. Refer to the second gallery image to identify the NC pins on the die.

For enthusiasts, we highly urge you to check out the original blog post to learn more; it goes into far more detail for those intrigued and looking for more technicalities. For Intel, this ceramic multi-layer approach wasn't just about elegance; it finally broke through the company's early obsession with keeping pin counts low—a relic of Intel management's 'bizarre belief that chips should never have more than 16 pins', according to Shirriff —which limited the potential of their first processors from the 70s.

The 386 marked a culmination of Intel's move to fully embrace high pin counts and advanced packaging, recognizing that complex chips demanded sophisticated, multi-layered ceramic packages to handle power, signal integrity, and heat. This shift was pivotal, enabling the performance leaps that made modern computing possible.

It's easy to forget now, but the 386 was the CPU that made contemporary multitasking PCs possible, and its packaging was as important to that leap as its transistor count. Shirriff's CT scan work doesn't just satisfy curiosity; it's a reminder that in the early microprocessor wars, Intel invested some of the world's best engineering talent into what seemed like the most mundane aspect—""the box it comes in."" Only time will tell if the once-iconic innovation powerhouse will return to its former glory.

Nvidia has just launched two more Blackwell GPUs designed for professionals. The RTX Pro 4000 SFF and RTX Pro 2000 have been unveiled at SIGGRAPH 2025. These GPUs round out the company's workstation lineup, slotting in under the top-of-the-line RTX Pro 6000 that was released earlier this year. Aside from their increased performance over prior-gen products, Nvidia says that these GPUs are also tailored for AI acceleration that works across varying workflows in different industries.

The RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell SFF is a smaller version of the already available RTX 4000 Blackwell card. The company claims that it offers more than twice the AI performance of the previous-generation RTX A4000 SFF, with improved ray tracing capabilities and 50% more bandwidth — all while retaining the same 70-watt maximum TDP of the previous card.

With 24GB of ECC GDDR7 memory and a claimed 770 AI TOPS of throughput, this GPU could be a great option for professionals looking for more power in a smaller package. Those characteristics make it especially useful for workstations with limited space or tight power and thermal budgets.



There's also a new RTX Pro 2000 card with 16GB of ECC GDDR7 memory and 545 AI TOPS of power in the same 70W TGP. Nvidia says this card is built for mainstream design and AI workflows. This GPU is claimed to be around 1.5 times faster than the Nvidia RTX A2000 in 3D modeling, computer-aided design, and rendering. The company also says it's useful for AI image and text generation, boosting its AI performance to make AI-powered workflows faster and more seamless.

Unfortunately, we don't have detailed pricing for these GPUs yet — we expect that information to come from its authorized resellers and system integrators. The company also did not reveal the exact specifications for the RTX Pro 4000 SFF and RTX Pro 2000 on stage.

These GPUs are expected to become available later this year, with the RTX Pro 2000 available through PNY and TD Synnex for those looking for individual cards to upgrade their existing units, and from system integrators including Boxx, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, for those looking for complete workstation solutions. The Nvidia RTX Pro 4000 SFF will be available in systems from Nvidia partners like Dell, HP, and Lenovo.

'Promptware' uses prompts to exploit flaws in LLM integration

SafeBreach researchers have revealed how a malicious Google Calendar invite could be used to exploit Gemini—the AI assistant that Google has built into its Workplace software suite, Android operating system, and search engine—as part of their ongoing efforts to determine the dangers posed by the rapid integration of AI in tech products.

The researchers dubbed an exploit like this ""promptware"" because it ""utilizes a prompt—a piece of input via text, images, or audio samples—that is engineered to exploit an LLM interface at inference time to trigger malicious activity, like spreading spam or extracting confidential information."" The broader security community has underestimated the risks associated with promptware, SafeBreach said, and this report is meant to demonstrate just how much havoc these exploits can wreak.

At a high level, this particular exploit took advantage of Gemini's integration with the broader Google ecosystem, the ability to clutter up Google Calendar's user interface with invitations, and their intended victim's habit of thanking an automaton for... automaton-ing. The researchers said this allowed them to indirectly trigger promptware buried within the user's chat history and perform the following actions:

Check out the full report for a step-by-step breakdown of how the exploit worked. The researchers said they disclosed the flaws to Google in February and that Google ""published a blog that provided an overview of its multi-layer mitigation approach to secure Gemini against prompt injection techniques"" in June. (It's not clear at what point those mitigations were introduced between the disclosure and the blog post.)

This kind of back-and-forth has been a mainstay of computing for decades. Companies introduce new technologies, people find ways to exploit them, companies occasionally come up with defenses against those exploits, and then people find something else to take advantage of. So, in that sense, the SafeBreach research just reveals another problem to add to the seemingly infinite array of such issues.

But a number of factors combine to make this report more alarming than it might be otherwise. Those include SafeBreach's point about security pros not taking promptware seriously, the ""move fast and break things"" approach companies are taking with their ""AI"" deployments, and the incorporation of these chatbots into seemingly every product a company offers. (As highlighted by Gemini's ubiquity.)

""According to our analysis, 73% of the threats posed to end users by an LLM personal assistant present a High-Critical risk,"" SafeBreach said. ""We believe this is significant enough to require swift and dedicated mitigation actions to secure end users and decrease this risk.""

A new minimally invasive device, while still in development, could become a lifesaver for individuals with diabetes who experience hypoglycemia, according to researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In a paper published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, Siddharth R. Krishnan, PhD, now an assistant professor of electrical engineering at Stanford University in Stanford, California, and colleagues at MIT described a wireless device implanted into diabetic mice that prevented hypoglycemia.

The implant weighs < 2 g and is only 3 cm3 in size; it remains under the skin and releases a powdered version of glucagon automatically when a sensor detects low blood sugar.

The researchers simulated hypoglycemia in the mice, and the release of the dry glucagon was triggered wirelessly. Measurements showed a rapid rise in blood glucose soon after the release, with a peak of 30 mg/dL after no more than 15 minutes.

A second set of studies replicated conditions that often drive hypoglycemia, such as missed meals and automated infusions from insulin pumps. Similarly, the use of the wireless release of dry glucagon resulted in blood glucose concentrations above the threshold for hypoglycemia (average concentration of 80 mg/dL) within the first hour after the release. An area under the curve analysis over 30 minutes after release showed significant changes in the glucose group compared with the control group who received lactose.

“Glucagon is widely administered as an emergency rescue drug for patients suffering acute hypoglycemia, particularly in the context of type 1 diabetes,” corresponding author Daniel Anderson, PhD, a professor at the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, told Medscape Medical News.

Glucagon's short half-life and low stability in solution has made development of pump systems a challenge, he said. By contrast, “Dry powder versions of glucagon offer long-term stability but are difficult to deliver,” he said. “An implantable device that can respond to hypoglycemia and release dry powder glucagon potentially offers a pathway to emergency rescue from hypoglycemia events without the need for patient intervention,” Anderson said.

The early impact of the dry power was unexpected, Anderson said. “The glucagon in our system is a dry powder that we designed to dissolve directly in biofluid, and the timeline for this dissolution and subsequent availability of the drug in circulation was an open question when we started this project,” he noted. “The fact that we saw biological activity within 5 minutes of drug release was an important result in this context, and not one that we predicted.”

Although the device is not ready for human use, the size and longevity are key questions for adoption in clinical practice, Anderson told Medscape Medical News. “We are working on miniaturizing the device, so it is compatible with minimally invasive insertion techniques, and with a sufficient number of doses to provide protection from acute hypoglycemia for multiple years,” he said. “So far, we have validated the device in preclinical small animal models.” Simultaneously miniaturizing the system and optimizing the dose and longevity in large animal models are the next steps for research, he added.

“Hypoglycemia and fear of hypoglycemia remains major barriers to optimal glycemic control for those with diabetes,” said Andrew Kraftson, MD, a specialist in endocrinology and internal medicine at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, in an interview.

“Glucagon emergency delivery devices have advanced and become more user friendly but will not work if not available or expired. Liquid glucagon presents numerous challenges and is not yet commercially available for dual hormone insulin pump use,” said Kraftson, who was not involved in the research.

“Dual hormone pumps that are being studied or have been approved in Europe are large/bulky, may require two CGM [continuous glucose monitoring] sensors, and may require glucagon to be refilled more frequently than insulin, so a nonliquid, implantable device could avoid some of the obstacles posed by liquid glucagon,” Kraftson noted.

However, more research is needed on the logistics of human implementation of the glucagon delivery device tested in the current study, Kraftson told Medscape Medical News. Questions include how the device would be implanted; how many doses the reservoir would hold; and how often, on average, it would need to be changed, he said. Other factors include how cumbersome this device might be for humans, potential risks for irritation or infection, and options for manual delivery in the event of a malfunctioning CGM or signal challenges in device communication, he said.

“Ideally, glucagon use for patients with diabetes would expand beyond emergency rescue,” Kraftson added. “Reducing or even holding insulin is sometimes insufficient to avoid hypoglycemia, particularly rapid onset.” 

“Additionally, eating carbohydrates to prevent or treat hypoglycemia is not ideal given the risk of subsequent overcorrection/hyperglycemia and weight gain; therefore, more frequent, sensor/algorithm-based use of glucagon can more effectively achieve stable glucose levels and help avoid the ‘rollercoaster,'” he said.

The small size of the device in the current study may limit its ability to participate in the larger mission of glucose management but could certainly still play an important role in hypoglycemia reduction, he noted.

This study was funded by the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, the National Institutes of Health, a JDRF postdoctoral fellowship, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.

Anderson and several coauthors reported being inventors on a patent application relevant to the technology described in this study but had no other financial conflicts of interest.

Kraftson had no financial conflicts to disclose.

Edited by Michael Hilleary

 August 11, 2025  

In patients with multilayer in-stent restenosis (ISR), treatment with a paclitaxel-coated balloon reduced target lesion failure (TLF) at 1 year to 23.8% compared with 40% with an uncoated balloon. The approach showed consistent benefits in patients with multilayer and single-layer ISR, with a greater absolute reduction in risk among multilayer cases.

“The treatment of multilayer ISR represents a unique clinical challenge for practicing clinicians. The incidence of recurrent ISR following PCI [percutaneous coronary intervention] is relatively high in this group of patients, and finding optimal solutions can be challenging because of the presence of multiple layers of existing stents,” the researchers wrote. “Treatment with the paclitaxel-coated balloon led to greater absolute risk reduction in 1-year TLF among patients with multilayer ISR compared with an uncoated balloon,” they added.

“An important takeaway from this AGENT IDE subgroup analysis is the need for a lifetime management strategy in patients with ISR undergoing” PCI, Roxana Mehran, MD, of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital, in New York City, and her colleagues, wrote in an editorial accompanying the journal article. The findings support the use of drug-coated balloons “as a treatment option in high-risk patients with multilayer ISR, offering a chance to improve its otherwise poor prognosis. At the same time, the overall unfavorable outcomes observed in this condition highlight the importance of selecting the optimal strategy at the first ISR occurrence,” they added.

This study was led by Ajay J. Kirtane, MD, SM, of Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and the Cardiovascular Research Foundation in New York City. It was published online on August 11, 2025, in Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

According to the authors, lesion preparation in this study was relatively conservative, with specialty balloons used in < 40% of cases. The researchers noted that more aggressive, mechanism-driven lesion preparation could have potentially further optimized outcomes, particularly in patients with complex multilayer disease. Additionally, intravascular lithotripsy and stent ablation, which are potential strategies for ISR, were not explored in the study.

Boston Scientific Corporation provided funding for the study. Kirtane received institutional funding to Columbia University and/or Cardiovascular Research Foundation from multiple organizations including Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Abbott Vascular, Amgen, CathWorks, Concept Medical, Philips, ReCor Medical, Neurotronic, Biotronik, Chiesi, Bolt Medical, Magenta Medical, SoniVie, and Shockwave Medical.

The advent of second-generation anti-VEGF drugs is transforming the treatment of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) due to their prolonged efficacy, which allows for fewer injections but at the cost of a higher risk for inflammation. A presentation at the 131st Congress of the French Society of Ophthalmology, held in Paris, France, reviewed the impact of these new approaches.

The therapeutic management of AMD has undergone significant changes in recent years, the most important of which is undoubtedly the introduction of second-generation anti-VEGF agents (brolucizumab, faricimab, and aflibercept 8 mg), with administration schedules that allow up to 5 months between injections.

While these new developments will redefine therapeutic management in AMD, for now, “it remains difficult to arrive at a simple algorithm,” as management has become so complex, stressed Sarah Mrejen, MD, from the Centre Hospitalier National d'Ophtalmologie des Quinze-Vingts, Paris, during her presentation.

Adjustments are particularly expected with the use of new anti-VEGFs, following the emergence of a signal of poorer tolerance in real life with these drugs, particularly brolucizumab. This observation raises questions about the best strategy to follow, particularly after the appearance of intraocular inflammation under second-generation anti-VEGF treatment.

AMD is characterized by progressive degeneration of the macula, the central part of the retina. It is the leading cause of vision loss in older adults. In the exudative form of AMD (approximately 10% of cases), abnormal blood vessels develop in the macula, leading to rapid central vision loss.

AMD treatment involves intravitreal injections of an anti-VEGF drug under local anesthesia. Ranibizumab and aflibercept 2 mg were the first approved treatments for AMD, with a regimen that includes three consecutive monthly induction injections followed by maintenance doses based on disease activity.

These anti-VEGF drugs have allowed better disease control, but 20%-25% of patients still require injections at least every 2 months. To improve the duration of action and avoid patient noncompliance, other anti-VEGF drugs have been developed.

Brolucizumab is the first second-generation anti-VEGF to have obtained marketing authorization for AMD in 2020. It is an antibody fragment that targets all isoforms of VEGF-A. The HAWK and HARRIER phase 3 trials demonstrated noninferiority to aflibercept 2 mg.

Brolucizumab was administered with monthly injections for the first 3 months of induction. It was then administered every 2-3 months depending on disease activity, while aflibercept was administered every 2 months during the maintenance phase.

Results showed that brolucizumab was noninferior in terms of visual acuity after 1 year, and this benefit was maintained up to 2 years. Anatomically, brolucizumab showed superior efficacy, with significantly greater drying of the macula. More than 75% of patients on brolucizumab maintained a 3-month interval between injections.

Faricimab is a bispecific antibody targeting both VEGF-A and angiopoietin-2. Its noninferiority to aflibercept 2 mg was demonstrated in the TENAYA and LUCERNE trials. After monthly induction, it was then injected every 2-4 months, depending on disease activity.

In both the TENAYA and LUCERNE trials, faricimab maintained visual acuity at 2 years. At that time, 71% of patients in the TENAYA trial and 81% in the LUCERNE trial had an injection interval of 3-4 months compared with the bi-monthly regimen of aflibercept.

Finally, aflibercept 8 mg was compared with aflibercept 2 mg in the PULSAR trial. After an induction phase of three monthly injections, patients receiving aflibercept 8 mg were able to switch to injections every 2-4 months depending on disease activity.

Again, noninferiority was shown for aflibercept 8 mg. After 2 years, 88% of patients on aflibercept 8 mg maintained an injection interval of at least 3 months.

These three second-generation drugs are now indicated, alongside first-generation anti-VEGFs, for first-line treatment of exudative AMD, but with different administration regimens. For faricimab, the injection interval cannot exceed 4 months during maintenance compared with 5 months for brolucizumab and aflibercept 8 mg.

However, studies have reported differing safety profiles, with brolucizumab being associated with more frequent and severe intraocular inflammation, including retinal vascular occlusions, Mrejen noted. “These occur later, after 6-8 months of treatment.”

In contrast, intraocular inflammations are rare and reversible with both faricimab and aflibercept 8 mg. These typically occur early in treatment, after 2-4 injections. This observation remains to be confirmed in real-world practice with aflibercept 8 mg, “for which we have less experience.”

These findings suggest that first-generation anti-VEGFs still remain a good first-line treatment choice. Ranibizumab and aflibercept 2 mg “have excellent safety profiles and very good efficacy,” said Mrejen.

The advent of biosimilars for first-generation anti-VEGFs, which are more affordable but still underutilized, also supports the preference for these drugs as first-line options. Ranibizumab biosimilars became available in 2023, while aflibercept biosimilars are expected to launch in 2026.

However, after the induction phase with first-generation agents, “if macular fluid control is not optimal, or it is difficult to extend the injection interval beyond 2 months, it is better to switch to second-generation molecules with more potent efficacy,” said Mrejen.

Among second-generation anti-VEGFs, brolucizumab occupies a unique place due to its less favorable safety profile. “It should be reserved for second-line treatment, especially in more severe forms of AMD,” said Mrejen. Faricimab and aflibercept 8 mg, which are better tolerated than brolucizumab, are not recommended as first-line agents “in the case of prior inflammation.”

Ultimately, the use of these new anti-VEGF drugs requires personalized care, with an emphasis on evaluating prior inflammation history before prescribing. Mrejen stressed the importance of having clear communication with patients to explain the early warning signs of intraocular inflammation, such as pain, redness, or blurred vision. In the event of inflammation, patients should be referred for urgent consultation.

In the case of inflammation under second-generation anti-VEGFs, opinions remain divided on the best course of action to prevent further deterioration into retinal vasculitis. This was revealed during a discussion following the presentation of the session on exudative AMD.

Mrejen recommended that once intraocular inflammation resolves, patients should switch to a first-generation molecule. Paris-based ophthalmologist Maté Streho, MD, argued that the therapeutic switch should depend on the severity of the inflammation, especially given patients' reluctance to have more frequent injections.

The session moderator, Stéphanie Baillif, MD, PhD, head of the Department of Ophthalmology at the Nice University Hospital, Nice, France, reminded the audience that inflammation under second-generation anti-VEGFs primarily occurs during the induction phase, “after the first two or three monthly injections.” According to her, patients typically accept switching to a first-generation molecule at this point.

The risk also depends on the type of anti-VEGF used. In the case of inflammation under brolucizumab, switching to another second-generation anti-VEGF (faricimab or aflibercept 8 mg) may be considered. However, this is not the case for the reverse scenario. Until more data are available to guide strategies, the precautionary principle should be applied by opting for the better-tolerated molecules, said Baillif.

 August 11, 2025  

A network of virtual services in British Columbia (BC) is increasing healthcare access and support in rural, remote, and First Nations communities, a new analysis revealed.

But more needs to be done to fully bridge healthcare gaps.

The Real-Time Virtual Support (RTVS) network is an integrated, hybrid-care model that delivers publicly funded virtual care. Staffed by BC-licensed providers, RTVS builds capacity to enhance — rather than replace — existing healthcare infrastructure. The network offers both direct patient care and clinical decision support for community health professionals. A shared electronic record documents all care activities, with structured communication protocols connecting primary and emergency care providers.

“Virtual care boomed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet there has been so far a lack of definitive evidence in the literature as to whether virtual care truly improves access, efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness for patients and the health system,” lead author, Kendall Ho, MD, told Medscape Medical News.

Ho said he hopes his recent article, published online on July 28 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, will contribute positive evidence of virtual care and how he and his team approach its coordinated delivery, encouraging further knowledge exchange between provinces and other virtual care programs.

Ho is a professor of emergency medicine at faculty of medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, and medical director of the BC Ministry of Health's HealthLink BC 8-1-1 virtual physicians program.

“With the right partnerships and coordination, virtual services can actually enhance and increase capacity for in-person services,” Ho noted. For example, the network's peer-to-peer services partner with rural providers to help maintain care services and to offer access to more specialized services in the community when needed.

“Our virtual, direct patient services help patients appropriately manage health concerns at home when emergency visits are not necessary and accelerate those needing urgent treatments to go to emergency rooms, thereby relieving pressure on our emergency service,” he added.

Nurses triage 8-1-1 callers using the Healthwise algorithm and their clinical judgment to a visit with a virtual physician — who provides assessment and advice via telephone or video conferencing — or to in-person primary or emergency care.

Since its founding in 2020, RTVS has had more than 20,000 encounters with peer-to-peer services in 129 rural, remote, and Indigenous communities; 12,000 appointments annually with First Nations primary and specialist services; and 176,000 patient calls to the 8-1-1 virtual physician service, the authors reported.

The urgent generalist service, Rural Urgent Doctor In-aid, mainly has supported

nurses at rural health centers (76% of encounters), according to the authors. Pediatric peer support (ie, Child Health Advice in Real-Time Electronically) was sought more often by physicians (78%), whereas obstetric peer support (ie, Maternity and Babies Advice Line) was almost evenly split between physicians and nurses.

The First Nations primary and specialist services, respectively, generally provide 11,000 and 2000 encounters annually, with clients pri­marily from the Northern, Interior, and Vancouver Island regions. In addition, clients have about 3-4 visits lasting 30-40 minutes annually, suggesting that these Indigenous-led services address an important healthcare gap for First Nations clients in BC.

However, the authors wrote, “evidence is limited, and Indigenous-led evaluation will be prioritized to share learnings from these pathways.” 

The authors also noted a potential “harm” with RTVS — namely a deepening of the “digital divide”, as individuals who have digital access and skills may be offered better services, thereby marginalizing those without access.

“We envision a new normal when virtual care will be tightly integrated with in-person care for complementarity, and that conventionally underserved populations — in particular, rural, remote, First Nations, and Indigenous populations — will be able to access the care they need just in time, just for them, and with just-in-case availability,” Ho concluded.

Shortly before the publication of the CMAJ article and in line with its messages, the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (CAEP) released a statement highlighting the need for “smart, sustainable networks of emergency care…especially in rural and remote communities.” 

“Rural emergency care is not optional. It is essential,” according to the statement. For that to happen, emergency medicine needs “networks, not silos.”

CAEP Past President Michael Howlett, MD, adjunct associate professor of emergency medicine at Queens University, Kingston, Ontario, and associate professor at Dalhousie University, Halifax, commented on the RTVS article for Medscape Medical News, and its relevance for emergency physicians in BC and other regions.

“RTVS is doing an excellent job with what they're given,” he said. “The biggest problem is the lack of boots on the ground — the lack of people actually present in person to deal with high-level emergencies.”

“Their service can facilitate patients' knowing where they need to go or what they need to do next, but they can't actually lay hands on someone to fix a problem,” he continued. “If you have a broken leg and it needs to be set, you can't reach through the TV camera and do it. You can't reach through the screen and take out a foreign body. You can't do certain types of exams on people. You have to have someone do it.”

“My biggest worry is that when systems like this are successful, governments will see virtual care as fixing the entire capacity problem and miss the point that even though they don't happen as often, serious, life-threatening problems require a different sort of care than virtual care. They require someone there.”

Often, he said, “We're doing virtual care because we have no choice not because it's the best way.”

Clinicians working in small communities also need to be aware that not everything can be delivered virtually, Howlett added. “If you're going to work in these systems, you have to know the limitations and you have to know what resources you have to give people as alternatives. You also need to know that the system requires advancement and capacity, and we all should be advocating for that.”

No funding was reported. Ho reported leading the Digital Emergency Medicine Unit at The Univer­sity of British Columbia. The BC Ministry of Health provided funding to Ho's unit, through an explicit arrangement with The Uni­versity of British Columbia, for the unit to help organize and implement the BC Ministry of Health 8-1-1 Virtual Physicians line and to evaluate the RTVS net­work. Howlett reported no relevant financial relationships.

A tapering strategy for TNF inhibitors maintained low disease activity in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and those with axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA) over 24 months. Protocol-driven tapering achieved a greater reduction in the mean dose of TNF inhibitors than routine care tapering, with both methods equally effective for disease control.

“[T]hese data indicate that a taper-to-target strategy is effective and leads to substantial TNF inhibitor dose reduction, but optimal execution of such a strategy in routine care is more challenging than in the context of a clinical trial,” the authors of the study wrote. “Considering the risks and benefits of tapering, we suggest that disease activity-guided tapering could enable more optimized and personalized treatment in patients with psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis.”

The study was led by Amy C.D. Peeters, MD, and Celia A.J. Michielsens, MD, PhD, Sint Maartenskliniek in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It was published online on July 24, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

Measurements for disease activity were missing at 18 and 24 months. The absence of validated flare criteria until 2022 may have led to an overestimation of flare incidence. Radiographic progression was not assessed at the 24-month follow-up. Allowing tapering in the control group during the extension phase reduced the difference between groups.

The study was funded by ReumaNederland. Some authors reported receiving grants from multiple companies including Novartis, Eli Lilly and Company, and AbbVie to their institution. One author reported receiving support for attending meetings and/or travel from Pfizer, Novartis, and UCB.

Among normotensive patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and a dipping blood pressure (BP) pattern, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevented increases in BP over a 3-month follow-up period, with significant reductions in nighttime diastolic BP compared with usual care.

“Overall, this randomised trial provides novel insights into the potential benefits of CPAP therapy as a preventive measure for the development of hypertension. Further larger studies, including a greater proportion of women and potentially guided by polysomnography-based phenotypes, are needed to better understand the impact of OSA therapy in individuals with normal BP,” experts wrote in an accompanying editorial.

This study was led by Adriano D.S. Targa and Gerard Torres, Translational Research in Respiratory Medicine, Hospital Universitari Arnau de Vilanova-Santa Maria, Biomedical Research Institute of Lleida, Lleida, Spain. It was published online on July 24, 2025, in European Respiratory Journal.

The single-center design potentially limited the generalizability of the findings. The sample size was powered to detect a difference of ≥ 3 mm Hg, but the true effect in normotensive individuals with OSA may have been smaller, leaving the analysis underpowered.

This study was supported by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, co-funded by the European Union, Sociedad Española de Neumología y Cirugía Torácica, and Diputació de Lleida. Some authors disclosed receiving financial support from Instituto de Salud Carlos III, co-funded by the European Union, and the Catalan Institution for Research and Advanced Studies Academia programme.

The launch of Canada's first Black medical journal has been welcomed by the Black community as a major step toward promoting diversity in healthcare research.

The Nigerian Canadian Medical Journal was launched on August 3 in Edmonton by the Canadian Association of Nigerian Physicians and Dentists (CANPAD).

“This new journal can make a significant difference in addressing the health and social issues faced by Black Canadians,” Hadal El-Hadi, MD, founder of Black Physicians of Canada, told Medscape Medical News. “By providing a dedicated platform for research, scholarship, and dialogue, it can elevate the voices of Black scholars and practitioners.” 

El-Hadi, who is not involved in the journal, added that it could further play a role in highlighting critical health disparities, promoting culturally relevant research, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, and serving as a resource to guide the development of effective interventions and strategies that are tailored to the unique needs of Black communities.

The journal's editor-in-chief, Moses Ademola, MD, explained to Medscape Medical News that the aim was to create a peer-reviewed, open-access publication that provides fresh insights and a new global perspective that appeals to readers within and beyond the Nigerian community.

“We know from working around different teams that a diverse team improves outcomes for our patients, who, increasingly, are coming to us in diverse forms,” said Ademola, who is an emergency physician at Sturgeon Community Hospital, St. Albert, Alberta, and Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton.

“The CANPAD journal was formed to enrich medical discourse, offer mentorship, and foster collaborative research. While the journal is published by a Black committee, it's aimed at a broad global audience. It's our hope and prayer that it will reflect the multicultural and inclusive values of Canada. We'll follow the science and go where we feel we can make a difference. We want to be a platform for voices that would otherwise be missed,” Ademola explained.

A Government of Canada public health agency study published in 2020 reported that racism has been increasingly recognized as an important driver of inequitable health outcomes for visible minority Canadians.

“The healthcare challenges faced by Black Canadians are distinct due to historical factors, including the legacy of colonialism and systemic racism, which create unique barriers to care,” said El-Hadi. “Black patients can experience discrimination within healthcare settings, leading to mistrust and inadequate treatment. Additionally, cultural differences in health perceptions and the stress from ongoing racism contribute to disparities in health outcomes,” she said.

Lack of inclusion and diversity continues to be a source of concern for the Black community and public health organizations.

“Research gaps and health inequalities exist, and some of these are not modifiable,” explained Ademola. “The Irish population tends to have cystic fibrosis. Blacks have a disproportionately high incidence of sickle cell disease. And Ashkenazi Jews are enriched for carriers of a fatal form of Tay-Sachs disease.” If clinicians aren't equipped to manage them well, the outcomes tend to be poorer, he said.

El-Hadi said there is a need for focused research on chronic diseases within Black communities, particularly concerning the impact of racism and stress.

Historically, the Black population in Canada and globally has been underrepresented in clinical research in terms of participation in clinical trials, as researchers, and in access to funding. Health studies often lack sufficient representation of Black Canadians, limiting understanding of their specific health needs. Cultural differences in health behaviors are also often overlooked, skewing data applicability.

“The medical community will have to work harder to ensure we don't end up with an unintended racial bias. The government must be intentional in ensuring that equity gaps are bridged. Scholars and scientists everywhere have to be aware of this blind spot. We need to work together so that health outcomes in all our population are similar,” said Ademola.

Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council developed a work plan in 2020 to address anti-Black racism in research, leading to the establishment of an external advisory committee of Black researchers. The council says it aims to ensure that Black researchers have fair access to research support and is working with stakeholders to advance their equitable participation in the research ecosystem.

Ademola and El-Hadi reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Individuals with HIV who were resistant to all four antiretroviral drug classes experienced higher mortality than those who were not resistant, a difference primarily due to lower CD4 cell counts.

""The priority for this vulnerable population is achieving virological control to enable immune recovery,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Andrea Giacomelli, MD, Università degli Studi di Milano, Milan, Italy. It was published online on August 01, 2025, in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

This study was limited by its retrospective design and the small sample size of four-drug-class-resistant patients. Recruiting the control group from a single centre introduced selection and information bias. Moreover, approximately 30% of four-drug-class-resistant participants lacked data on causes of death.

This study was conducted as a part of routine work of the PRESTIGIO Registry, which received support from ViiV Healthcare, Gilead Sciences, Merck Sharp & Dohme, and Janssen-Cilag. Some authors reported receiving consultancy fees, speaker honoraria, and honoraria for lectures and presentations and having other ties with the registry funders and various pharmaceutical companies.

In euthyroid patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), relatively higher free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels within the normal range were linked to a lower risk for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and better nerve function.

“Within the normal range, a relatively high level of FT3 (> 4.3 pmol/L) was associated with a reduced risk of DPN [diabetic peripheral neuropathy]. Thyroid hormones may be beneficial for patients with DPN if their FT3 levels are near the low end of the normal range,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Bing'er Xu, Department of Endocrinology, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China. It was published online in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

This study was limited by its single-center design and focused on hospitalized patients with T2D in Shanghai. It measured only specific peripheral nerves' conduction parameters. The Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted only in Europeans, requiring validation in other ethnic populations.

This study received support from the National Science and Technology Major Project, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality, and other sources. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

The government has pledged to give newly qualified nurses and midwives easier access to thousands of new posts under a “Graduate Guarantee” scheme. 

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the scheme would “make sure there are enough jobs for every newly qualified nurse and midwife in England” and allow NHS trusts to hire newly qualified staff “based on projected need” rather than current vacancies.

Officials said the package aimed to tackle graduates' concerns about job availability. Health Secretary Wes Streeting called it “absurd” to train thousands of nurses and midwives each year only to leave them without work when hospitals are short of staff.

Record numbers began nursing studies during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, with fewer nurses and midwives leaving the profession, some areas now have up to three times as many graduates as vacancies.

“No one who dedicates themselves to a nursing or midwifery career should be left in limbo, when their skills are so urgently needed in the effort to rebuild our NHS,” Streeting said.

Professor Nicola Ranger, Royal College of Nursing (RCN) general secretary and chief executive, said the scheme should offer “hope to students.”

“When the health service urgently needs nursing staff, it was absurd to leave people in limbo,” she said.

Gill Walton, Royal College of Midwives (RCM) chief executive, said student midwives would be relieved to learn they could start their careers without unnecessary barriers.

Professor Greta Westwood, chief executive of the Florence Nightingale Foundation, said the announcement sent a clear message: “Your skills are valued, your future is supported, and your place in the NHS is secure.”

However, Westwood cautioned that more was needed to retain new recruits “They must be supported by high-quality, structured preceptorship that supports their development into confident, capable, and compassionate professionals,” she urged.

NHS Providers Chief Executive Daniel Elkeles also welcomed the move but questioned whether the scheme would be fully funded.

“Trust budgets are already under enormous pressure. There is no spare money. Any further unfunded measures risk eating into frontline services,” he warned.

Details of the package emerged following talks between the government, the RCM, and the RCN. 

Other measures in the Graduate Guarantee include:

The DHSC said it hoped the changes would help distribute healthcare professionals across a wide range of sectors.

“The test of this will be if students can find jobs, vacant posts are filled, and patients receive the care they deserve,” said Ranger.

Canada has released an updated guideline on pharmacotherapy for obesity management in adults that includes six new and seven revised recommendations, reflecting the latest evidence through May 2025.

Obesity pharmacotherapy “is one of three pillars of treatment outlined in the full Canadian Adult Obesity Clinical Practice Guideline, with other pillars being behavioral and psychological and surgical approaches,” said the author in a press release. “Obesity treatment should always be tailored to each person's specific health needs, values, and preferences.”

The study, led by Sue Pedersen, MD, endocrinologist and obesity medicine specialist in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and lead author of the guideline, was published online in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

The guideline has limitations, in that it includes only medications currently approved in Canada, although other medications are approved for obesity management in other countries. Also, there are more than 200 health complications associated with obesity, and it was not feasible to search the literature for all of them.

Pedersen reported receiving grants for clinical trials from Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, Eli Lilly and Company, Boehringer Ingelheim, Prometric, and Pfizer, and consulting fees from AstraZeneca, Bausch Health, Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, Janssen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi, Merck, Abbott, Dexcom, HLS, Bayer, AbbVie, Roche, Amgen, and Pfizer. She has also received payment for medical education lectures and speakers bureaus from AstraZeneca, Bausch, Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim, Sanofi, Merck, Abbott, Dexcom, HLS, Bayer, and Pfizer, and has received travel support from AstraZeneca, Bausch, Eli Lilly and Company, Novo Nordisk, Boehringer Ingelheim, Abbott, and Dexcom. In addition, Pedersen reported participating on a data safety monitoring board for Regeneron. The other coauthors also report receiving fees from multiple commercial entities. These competing interests are included in the paper.

Healthcare use was elevated much earlier than previously recognized among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) in new research. Physician visits for “ill-defined symptoms and signs” increased from 15 years before MS symptom onset and mental health-related and psychiatry visits increased 14 years and 12 years before, respectively. However, nervous system-related and neurology visits increased significantly only 4 years and 8 years before the onset of MS symptoms.

“MS can be difficult to recognize as many of the earliest signs — like fatigue, headache, pain, and mental health concerns — can be quite general and easily mistaken for other conditions,” study investigator Helen Tremlett, The University of British Columbia and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, said in a press release.

“Our findings dramatically shift the timeline for when these early warning signs are thought to begin. By identifying these earlier red flags, we may eventually be able to intervene sooner — whether that's through monitoring, support, or preventive strategies,” Tremlett added.

This study was led by Marta Ruiz-Algueró, MD, PhD, The University of British Columbia and Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health. It was published online on August 1 in JAMA Network Open.

This study lacked detailed clinical information and only considered issues that prompted individuals to seek medical care. Potential miscoding or misclassification may have occurred. Additionally, a potential recall bias and challenges with medical history taking may have influenced the findings.

This study was funded in part by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and MS Canada. Several investigators reported having financial ties with various sources either during the conduct of the study or outside the submitted work. Full details are provided in the original article.

Patients with psoriasis have significantly more difficulty sleeping, particularly in new environments, than matched individuals without the condition. Problems sleeping also rose in conjunction with disease severity. 

“We don't have the time to tackle all the different comorbidities in patients [with psoriasis] and talk about every symptom that they are having,” said study author Tina Bhutani, MD, dermatologist with the University of California, San Francisco, and in private practice. “But what we can quickly ask is if they are having trouble sleeping, or if they wake up multiple times during the night or whether they feel rested in the morning. That way we can provide them with resources where they can get more support.”

Bhutani and her colleagues conducted the research, which Bhutani presented by video conference at the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2025 Annual Meeting and Training Symposium in Bogotá, Colombia. 

The small sample size meant that some results of interest did not reach statistical significance.

GRAPPA provided funding for the study. Bhutani disclosed having served as an advisor or speaker for or receiving research funding from, AbbVie, Amgen, Arcutis, Aslan, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Castle, CorEvitas, Dermavant, Eli Lilly, Galderma, Incyte, Janssen, LEO Pharma, Novartis, Ortho, Pfizer, Regeneron, Sanofi, Sun Pharma, and UCB.

A retrospective study found that patients with mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer had numerically longer overall survival (OS) than those with MMR-proficient tumours.

""This large study of patients with advanced/recurrent EC [endometrial cancer] from selected NHS trusts in England benchmarked treatment patterns and outcomes,"" the authors wrote. However, they added that ""although this analysis is suggestive of a difference in outcomes between MMR subgroups, attainment of MMR status was low, and further research comparing real-world outcomes based on molecular profile, including MMR subgroups, is warranted.""

This study was led by Jamie Wallis, Arcturis Data, Oxfordshire, England. It was published online on August 01, 2025, in Oncology and Therapy.

The small sample size and the short follow-up period of the MMR subgroups significantly affected result interpretation. Staging information and clinical progression data were not available, requiring the use of TTNT as a proxy for progression-free survival. Additionally, the high proportion of White patients in the study reflected disparities in care.

This study was funded by GSK. Four authors reported being employees of and holding financial equities in GSK. Additional disclosures are noted in the original article.

A new policy statement from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) warns that stroke survivors across the US face steep barriers to rehabilitation, including insurance denials, geographic “care deserts,” and high out-of-pocket costs.

The statement urges policy and performance measure reforms to ensure survivors receive the intensive therapy proven to restore independence.

It was published online on July 31 in Stroke.

Stroke rehabilitation is the “lifeline of hope” for survivors, their caregivers, and their communities in the days, months, and years after stroke, said the writing group.

Clinical guidelines from the AHA/ASA recommend that discharge planning and rehabilitation decisions be based on a stroke survivor's functional needs, group chair Nneka Ifejika, MD, MPH, chief scientific officer at Ochsner Health System in New Orleans, noted in a news release.

“However, research shows that nonclinical factors including the size and scope of a hospital network, a patient's insurance status, and rehabilitation provider availability during the acute stroke hospitalization can limit access to appropriate care, resulting in poorer outcomes and higher long-term costs,” Ifejika said.

The writing group called for enacting measures to ensure full transparency in payer databases on the rehabilitation services patients with stroke receive and their outcomes, as well as the rate of denials for postacute stroke care.

A recent Senate investigation found that a major Medicare Advantage company used artificial intelligence algorithms to deny nearly 1 in 4 requests for postacute stroke care requests in 2022 — double the denial rate just 2 years earlier, the group pointed out.

The writing group also called for:

“The quality of one's recovery from stroke should not depend on their ZIP code, insurance status, or the cultural competency of their healthcare providers when describing the importance of postacute care,” Ifejika said in the release.

“Every stroke survivor should be evaluated to receive high-quality, patient-centered rehabilitation and should have equitable access if postacute care is needed,” Ifejika added.

Reached for comment, Joseph Broderick, MD, stroke expert and neurologist at the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, told Medscape Medical News this is a “very important and timely statement.”

He noted that the problem of postacute care is not at the acute care hospitals, where acute care is standardized, measured, and recognized by certification programs and Get With The Guidelines measurements of key acute care metrics.

“The problem comes when the recommendation for inpatient rehab or skilled nursing facility is made to the insurance carrier and managed governmental programs. There is an incentive to not approve inpatient rehab and particularly long-term acute care — even when the patient meets the criteria,” Broderick said.

Another problem is that insurers that approve where patients are going for postacute care are not open for decision-making and interactions on the weekend. “So a key part of the health system for determining postacute care is not only delaying disposition but doesn't function 2 days a week,” he noted.

“It would be like pilots in the airline industry not available to fly on the weekends and passengers piling up at the airport and surrounding hotels until Monday, when the pilots came back online and take them to their next destination,” Broderick said.

He noted that cardiac rehab is “universally much clearer and better financially reimbursed than stroke rehab. But it is also much more straightforward than stroke postacute care.”

“Private and government insurers and the postacute facilities need to develop a better system, which is patient-centered rather than money- and profit-driven, standardized with patient and caregiver valued metrics of institutional performance, and a strong push for research to determine how type and intensity of various therapies improve outcome,” Broderick told Medscape Medical News.

“Our stroke patients need us all to do better after they leave the acute care hospital,” he said.

Parents in the year following birth residing in rural areas experienced more healthcare barriers, including reduced access to obstetric care and increased emergency department visits, than their urban counterparts. While infant care was similar between rural and urban areas, postpartum parents reported delays in medical care compared with their infants in both settings.

“Investments in rural health care infrastructure may support rural families,” the authors wrote. “Integrating and incentivizing care for postpartum parents alongside their infants may address differential use and access to care in this critical period.”

The study was led by Sara C. Handley, MD, MSCE, of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. It was published online on August 3, 2025, in The Journal of Rural Health.

The analysis did not include specific weighting to represent the US population of parent-infant dyads. The cross-sectional design did not specify the age of the infant, which could have affected the reported number of visits and limited comments on completeness of the care. 

The study received support through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the University of Minnesota Foundation Rural Health Research Center Fund, and the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy. The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

New evidence from decades of data reveals why your method of potato cooking, or what you swap it for, could make a big difference to your long-term diabetes risk.

Study: Total and specific potato intake and risk of type 2 diabetes: results from three US cohort studies and a substitution meta-analysis of prospective cohorts. Image credit: Alexeysun/Shutterstock.com

A study in the BMJ evaluated whether total and individual potato intake differentially impacts type 2 diabetes (T2D) and assessed the effect of replacing potatoes with whole grains and other major carbohydrate sources on T2D.

Potatoes are the third most consumed food, providing substantial daily energy. They contain various nutrients, such as vitamin C, fiber, potassium, polyphenols, and magnesium. However, the high starch content of potatoes can increase the glycemic index, thereby elevating the risk of metabolic diseases. Furthermore, specific cooking methods also decrease their nutrient content.

Although previous studies have investigated the association between potato consumption and T2D, their findings have remained inconclusive. For instance, some studies have shown a positive correlation between potato consumption and T2D, while others have observed an inverse association. A US-based individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis revealed no association between T2D and total potato intake but a modest increased risk with fried potato intake.

Inconsistency in the effect of T2D was observed when potatoes were replaced with alternative carbohydrates, whole grains, and non-starchy vegetables. These inconsistencies in research findings could stem from variations in methodology, regional differences in potato consumption, and inadequate control for confounding variables.

Considering the contradictory findings regarding the association between potato consumption and T2D, long-term observational studies with standardized methodologies and high-quality data are needed.

In the last four decades, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII), and Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) have repeatedly assessed the impact of diet and other variables on health.  The current study utilized the above three cohorts to evaluate the effects of total and specific potato intake and T2D risk and compare the associations of potatoes and whole grains with T2D risk.

The NHS, NHSII, and HPFS cohorts were initiated in 1976, 1989, and 1986. They contain a sample of male and female registered nurses between 25 and 75.

Participants in these cohorts were initially surveyed using questionnaires, which obtained information about their new diagnosis of T2D, lifestyle, diet, and health. Dietary intake was reassessed every two to four years, and cumulative average intake was used in the main analysis to better capture long-term patterns. Those with incomplete information about age or potato intake were excluded.

Participants were asked whether they consumed potatoes as baked, boiled, mashed, French fries, or as potato or corn chips. Portion sizes were adjusted over time using weights from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Total potato intake was measured by adding the servings of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes and French fries, excluding potato or corn chips because they were grouped in the questionnaire and could not be separated.

A total of 22,299 individuals were diagnosed with T2D. Men and women who reported higher potato intake were found to be less likely to be physically active, take supplements, and have a higher total energy intake. In all three cohorts, the average frequency of consuming boiled, baked, or mashed potatoes was considerably higher than that of French fries. A pooled analysis revealed a positive but modest association between total potato intake and a higher risk of T2D.

Participants who reported consuming seven or more servings of total potatoes weekly had a 12% higher risk of T2D than those with less than one serving weekly. An increase of three servings weekly of total potatoes elevated the risk of developing T2D by 5%. However, this risk varies depending on the cooking method.

Compared to those who almost never consumed French fries, those who consumed five or more servings weekly showed a 27% increased risk of T2D. Every three additional servings of French fries weekly was associated with a 20% higher incidence of T2D. Dose-response analysis revealed a linear association, indicating that a steady increase in French fry intake increases the risk of T2D.

After multivariable adjustment, no increase in T2D incidence could be linked to baked, boiled, or mashed potato intake or potato or corn chip intake. An increased weekly intake of baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes and potato or corn chips also exhibited a statistically null T2D risk.

Replacing three servings of total potatoes per week with whole grains resulted in an 8% lower T2D rate. More specifically, substituting baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with whole grains was estimated to lower T2D incidence by 4%. The current study also indicated that substituting total potatoes with non-starchy vegetables, replacing French fries with legumes, starchy and non-starchy vegetables, and even refined grains, leads to a reduced T2D incidence. Replacing total or baked, boiled, or mashed potatoes with white rice was associated with an increased risk of T2D.

The current study conducted a meta-analysis that included 13 prospective cohort studies (out of 503 screened) related to potato intake and the risk of T2D. Out of 587,081 participants across the selected studies, 43,471 individuals were diagnosed with T2D during follow-up, ranging from 4 to 27 years. The T2D risk increased by 16% for each three-serving-per-week increment of fried potatoes. A much weaker association was observed between T2D incidence and the consumption of non-fried potatoes.

Additional analyses showed that body mass index (BMI) mediated about 50% of the association between French fry intake and T2D risk. The association between total potato intake and T2D was strongest 12 to 20 years before diagnosis, and results were more robust when using cumulative average dietary intake rather than baseline-only measurements.

The current study found that French fry consumption primarily drove the association between total potato intake and the risk of T2D. Substitution analysis indicated that replacing total potatoes with whole grains reduces the risk of T2D. However, replacing boiled, baked, or mashed potatoes with white rice increased the risk of T2D. These findings highlight that risk varies by cooking method, the food replacing the potatoes, and individual factors such as BMI.

A new generation of malaria drugs failed clinical trials, in part because they were hard to swallow. UCSF chemists remodeled their structures to make them more soluble, while maintaining their effectiveness against drug-resistant parasites.

The search for new ways to treat malaria - a disease that kills some 600,000 people a year, most of them children in Sub-Saharan Africa - may have just gotten a boost.

Chemists at UC San Francisco have found a way to rearrange the atoms in a new generation of malaria drugs to make them easier to put into pill form without forfeiting their effectiveness against the malaria parasite.

New malaria drugs are desperately needed, as the parasite that causes the disease has developed resistance to today's best therapies, and this new resistant form is spreading from Southeast Asia into Africa.

Now that drug resistance is in Africa, many more lives are at risk. These new molecules could give us the upper hand we need to control this deadly disease.""

Adam Renslo, PhD, professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in the UCSF School of Pharmacy and senior author of the paper

The work, which appears Aug. 8 in Science Advances, was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

For centuries, malaria has been known for causing cyclical and sometimes deadly fevers. In the 1950s, chemists developed new and more potent malaria drugs based on quinine, an anti-malarial compound found in plants. 

Over time, the parasites evolved to resist the best of these drugs, chloroquine, and the global health community scrambled to find new ones. 

Today's most essential anti-malarial therapies include a compound called artemisinin that is found in sweet wormwood, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine. As with quinine, artemisinin gave chemists inspiration to make more effective drugs. 

Artemisinin was combined with other effective drugs into a cocktail, known as artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), that became the standard malaria treatment. But resistance appeared once again.

We've tracked artemisinin resistance for years in Southeast Asia, but we're now seeing it spread to Africa, where 95% of cases and 95% of deaths occur. Given how long it takes to develop new drugs, there is widespread consensus that we need better drugs to circumvent this resistance ASAP.""

Phil Rosenthal, MD, professor of medicine at UCSF and co-author of the paper

Artefenomel, a newer artemisinin-inspired variant, was intended to replace ACTs in time to stanch the spread of artemisinin resistance, which was just beginning to emerge. It was potent enough that scientists hoped it could cure malaria in a single dose. This would have been an improvement over ACTs, which must be taken for three days in a row to be effective. 

""For a disease like malaria, you would ideally like to cure the patient with one pill or a handful of pills and be done with it,"" Renslo said. ""A multi-day regimen risks missing a dose.""

But artefenomel proved difficult to study in clinical trials. The drug had to be given as an oral suspension - it resisted dissolving, so it needed to be shaken up with a liquid and swallowed quickly. This finicky nature also made it hard to combine with other drugs in a pill. 

Children also had trouble keeping the oral suspension down after drinking it, making it hard to know whether they had received the intended dose. In January of 2025, artefenomel was pulled from clinical trials.

Renslo and his team realized that the symmetry of the artefenomel molecule might be the problem: highly symmetrical molecules tend to clump into crystals that are slow to dissolve. 

The scientists thought that a less-symmetric version of artefenomel might avoid this clumping and dissolve more readily, making it easier to put into pill form. Their first successful attempt at making this molecule proved them right when it disappeared immediately into a water-like solution. 

The team continued tweaking the new molecules, testing how they worked against malaria parasites in cells, and then animals, and finally against artemisinin-resistant parasites sourced from blood samples from malaria patients in Uganda. 

The optimized compound passed with flying colors: it was just as potent as artefenomel, and much more effective than artemisinin, against artemisinin-resistant parasites. 

""We're optimistic that a simple chemical change like this can pave the way for an effective successor to artemisinin,"" Renslo said, ""one that's cheap to make and easy to combine with other anti-malarial drugs.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Brain cells follow rhythmic patterns during learning and memory retrieval","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250811/Brain-cells-follow-rhythmic-patterns-during-learning-and-memory-retrieval.aspx","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:21:00 GMT","

A research team from the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn, and the Medical Center - University of Freiburg has gained new insights into the brain processes involved in encoding and retrieving new memory content. The study is based on measurements of individual nerve cells in people with epilepsy and shows how they follow an internal rhythm. The work has now been published in the journal Nature Communications.

""Similar to members of an orchestra who follow a common beat, the activity of nerve cells appears to be linked to electrical oscillations in the brain, occurring one to ten times per second. The cells prefer to fire at specific times within these brain waves, a phenomenon known as theta-phase locking,"" says first author and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bonn, Dr. Tim Guth, who recently joined the Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience group at the UKB from the Medical Center - University of Freiburg.

The research team led by Tim Guth and Lukas Kunz found that the interaction between nerve cells and brain waves is active in both the learning and remembering of new information - specifically in the medial temporal lobe, a central area for human memory. However, in the study on spatial memory, the strength of theta-phase locking of nerve cells during memory formation was independent of whether the test subjects were later able to correctly recall the memory content. ""This suggests that theta-phase locking is a general phenomenon of the human memory system, but does not alone determine successful recall,"" says corresponding author Prof. Dr. Lukas Kunz, head of the Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience working group at the Clinic for Epileptology at the UKB and member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) ""Life & Health"" at the University of Bonn.

While most nerve cells always fired at the same oscillation time, some nerve cells interestingly changed their preferred timing between learning and remembering. ""This supports the theory that our brain can separate learning and retrieval processes within a brain wave, similar to members of an orchestra who start playing at different times in a piece of music,"" says Guth. The study provides new insights into how nerve cells and electrical signals in the brain interact while new memories are formed.

A better understanding of these processes could help us in the long term to better understand memory disorders and treat them more effectively. ""

Prof. Dr. Lukas Kunz, head of the Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience working group at the Clinic for Epileptology at the UKB

The research team was able to observe the interaction between nerve cells and brain waves during the memory process in the study by exploiting a special feature of epilepsy therapy. Patients with particularly difficult-to-treat epilepsy have electrodes implanted in their brains for diagnostic purposes. The aim is to determine the exact origin of the epileptic seizures in order to achieve better surgical results. However, these implanted electrodes can also be used to record human brain activity at the level of individual cells. The researchers used measurements taken at the Medical Center - University of Freiburg and would like to thank all patients who participated in this study.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has validated Kenya as having eliminated human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness as a public health problem, making it the tenth country to reach this important milestone. HAT is the second neglected tropical disease (NTD) to be eliminated in Kenya: the country was certified free of Guinea worm disease in 2018.

""I congratulate the government and people of Kenya on this landmark achievement,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""Kenya joins the growing ranks of countries freeing their populations of human African trypanosomiasis. This is another step towards making Africa free of neglected tropical diseases"".

HAT is a vector-borne disease caused by the blood parasite Trypanosoma brucei. It is transmitted to humans through the bites of tsetse flies that have acquired the parasites from infected humans or animals. Rural populations dependent on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting are most at risk of exposure.

As the name indicates, HAT is transmitted only on the African continent. The disease exists in two forms, gambiense and rhodesiense. The rhodesiense form (r-HAT), which is found in eastern and southern Africa, is the only one present in Kenya. It is caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and progresses rapidly, invading multiple organs including the brain. Without treatment, it is fatal within weeks.

""This validation marks a major public health milestone for Kenya, as we celebrate the elimination of a deadly disease in our country. The achievement will not only protect our people but also pave the way for renewed economic growth and prosperity,"" said Dr Aden Duale, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for Health. ""This follows many years of dedication, hard work and collaboration"".

The first cases of HAT in Kenya were detected in the early 20th century. Since then, Kenya has engaged in consistent control activities, without indigenous new cases reported for over 10 years. The last autochthonous case was detected in 2009, and the last two exported cases, infected in the Masai Mara National Reserve, were detected in 2012.

Recently, Kenya strengthened HAT surveillance in 12 health facilities in six historically endemic counties to act as sentinel sites. They were equipped with diagnostic tools and had their clinical personnel trained on diagnostic procedures, including the most sensitive and practical tests for r-HAT. The country also actively monitors the control and surveillance of tsetse flies and animal trypanosomiasis, both within and beyond the historical HAT endemic areas, supported by the national veterinary health authorities and the Kenya Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Council (KENTTEC). These activities and the related data provide supplementary backing to the claim of HAT elimination as a public health problem.

""This key milestone reflects Kenya's efforts and commitment over many years, as a collaboration between national and county governments, national research institutions, development partners and affected communities,"" said Dr Patrick Amoth, EBS, Director General Health, Ministry of Health, Kenya. ""The country remains fully committed to sustain the quality of care and surveillance in line with WHO's recommendations"".

Supported by WHO and partners, including FIND, Kenya's HAT elimination programme will now implement a post-validation surveillance plan to detect any potential resurgence or reintroduction of transmission. WHO continues to support ongoing monitoring in previously affected areas and maintains a stock of medicines to ensure rapid treatment of possible future cases, thanks to donations from Bayer AG and Sanofi.

This success was made possible by the Ministry of Health's leadership, the dedication of health workers in areas at risk and the support from key partners. WHO is proud to have contributed to this achievement and encourages all stakeholders to remain involved in post-validation monitoring"".

Dr. Abdourahmane Diallo, WHO Representative to Kenya

A total of 57 countries have eliminated at least one NTD. Of these, 10 (including Kenya) have successfully eliminated HAT as a public health problem. The other countries that have reached this milestone are Benin, Chad, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Guinea, Rwanda, Togo and Uganda.

A new DNA methylation-based blood test can identify type 2 diabetes patients at the highest risk of heart attack or stroke years in advance, beating traditional risk scores and opening the door to earlier, more targeted prevention.

Study: Epigenetic biomarkers predict macrovascular events in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Image Credit: Dragon Claws / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Cell Reports Medicine, researchers identified epigenetic biomarkers predicting incident macrovascular events (iMEs) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

People with T2D have two to four times higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than non-diabetic individuals. Identifying individuals at risk for macrovascular events (MEs) is crucial for disease prevention. Nonetheless, ME prediction in people with T2D is suboptimal. While risk stratification scores for CVD are available, they have a moderate ability to stratify T2D patients. As such, there is a need to identify new biomarkers to improve CVD and ME prediction in T2D subjects.

In the present study, researchers identified blood-based epigenetic biomarkers to predict iMEs in people newly diagnosed with T2D. They included 752 participants with newly diagnosed T2D with available DNA methylation (DNAm) data and without known MEs from the All New Diabetics in Scania (ANDIS) and Uppsala County (ANDiU) cohorts in the “prospective cohort for MEs in T2D.” Of these, 102 individuals developed MEs over a mean follow-up of about four years and a maximum of seven years, while 650 did not.

The researchers analyzed DNAm of over 853,000 sites in blood to identify epigenetic biomarkers associated with future MEs. They found that DNAm of 461 sites was associated with iMEs using a Cox regression model adjusted for gender, age, body mass index (BMI), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). These sites, annotated to 422 genes, were distributed across the genome.



Garcı´a-Calzo´ n et al. identify a bloodbased epigenetic biomarker tool that helps predict future cardiovascular disease, which individuals with type 2 diabetes are more likely to develop. Their findings support the use of epigenetic biomarkers to improve risk stratification and guide more personalized prevention strategies in diabetes care.

Further, results remained consistent, with about 453 sites associated with iMEs, after additional adjustment for medications, smoking, lipid profiles, and cell composition. Next, the team examined whether a methylation risk score (MRS) would predict future MEs in individuals newly diagnosed with T2D. Methylation sites with absolute methylation differences ≥ 2% between controls and individuals with iMEs were filtered for inclusion in the MRS.

The MRS included 87 methylation sites; most sites (74%) were hypomethylated in those with iMEs relative to controls. Besides, the MRS was significantly different between controls and individuals with MEs. Next, the team performed five-fold cross-validation using logistic models to assess whether the MRS could differentiate between controls and individuals with iMEs in the prospective cohort for MEs in T2D.

For comparison, a cross-validation analysis was performed with only clinical risk factors of MEs. Moreover, the combination of clinical factors and MRS was examined. Receiver operating characteristic curves revealed that the MRS predicted iMEs with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81, while clinical risk factors alone predicted iMEs with an AUC of 0.69. The combination of the MRS and clinical risk factors yielded an AUC of 0.84.

Statistical testing showed the MRS performed significantly better than clinical risk factors alone (p = 0.001), and the combined model significantly outperformed clinical risk factors (p = 1.7 × 10⁻¹¹). Precision–recall analysis, appropriate for imbalanced data, also showed improved sensitivity and precision for MRS-based models.

Next, the ability of MRS to predict MEs was compared with established CVD risk scores, a polygenic risk score (PRS) based on 204 coronary artery disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and epigenetic clocks of mortality and aging. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and SCORE2-Diabetes risk scores that predict CVD in diabetic individuals had AUCs of 0.54 and 0.62, respectively, in predicting MEs.

The PRS, epigenetic clocks and mortality, and other risk scores (multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis, atherosclerotic CVD, and Framingham risk scores) were significantly worse than MRS or MRS plus clinical factors, with AUCs ranging between 0.61 and 0.68. The optimal cutoff point for the combined biomarker tool, which showed the best prediction, was estimated to be 0.023, with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.804 and 0.728, respectively. At this cutoff, the model achieved a high negative predictive value of 95.9% and a moderate positive predictive value of 31.8%, meaning it could reliably identify individuals unlikely to experience iMEs but was less accurate for confirming those at risk. Net reclassification improvement analyses showed a 28.2% categorical and 90.2% continuous improvement over clinical risk factors alone. The test was estimated to cost approximately $200 per sample, a factor the authors suggest could be feasible for clinical screening if used selectively in high-risk populations.

Further, the researchers evaluated whether the 64 genes annotated to 87 methylation sites in MRS exhibit differential expression in carotid plaques from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. They found differential expression of four genes in plaques from symptomatic patients compared to asymptomatic patients. They also reported that 72% of the MRS genes had prior links to CVD in literature or GWAS data, and that several methylation sites overlapped with those differentially methylated in aortic plaque tissue.

Next, the team performed validation analyses of the methylation sites associated with iMEs in OPTIMED and EPIC-Potsdam cohorts. They validated 43 and 32 methylation sites in OPTIMED and EPIC-Potsdam cohorts, respectively, using Cox regression models adjusted for BMI, age, gender, and HbA1c. Moreover, five out of 87 sites in the MRS were associated with iMEs in the OPTIMED cohort.

An MRS developed using these five sites (MRS5sites) was significantly different between controls and individuals with iMEs in the OPTIMED cohort and the prospective cohort for MEs in T2D. The combination of clinical risk factors and MRS5sites had an AUC of 0.8 in the OPTIMED cohort and 0.78 in the prospective cohort of MEs in T2D. Notably, OPTIMED included newly diagnosed T2D participants, whereas EPIC-Potsdam was a general population cohort, supporting the broader applicability of the findings.

In sum, the study identified and validated a blood-based epigenetic biomarker predicting the risk of the first ME, in combination with and independently of clinical risk factors, in individuals newly diagnosed with T2D. T2D subjects with an MRS in combination with clinical risk factors of more than 0.023 were likely to develop MEs over the maximum follow-up of seven years. Overall, the epigenetic biomarker predicts iMEs better than established risk scores, supporting its future clinical use.

The authors note, however, that external validation in other ethnicities is needed, and that the moderate PPV likely reflects the low prevalence of events in this newly diagnosed population. They also caution that environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, and medications can influence DNA methylation, and that these were not fully captured in the current cohorts.

Mitochondria, the tiny organelles without which our bodies would be deprived of energy, are gradually revealing their mysteries. In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers from Inserm and the University of Bordeaux at the NeuroCentre Magendie, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, have for the first time succeeded in establishing a causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the cognitive symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases.

Thanks to the creation of a specific and unprecedented tool, they succeeded in increasing mitochondrial activity in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, where they observed an improvement in memory deficit symptoms. While these are only initial results, they open the door to considering mitochondria as a new therapeutic target.

The mitochondrion is a small intracellular organelle that provides the energy needed by the cell to function properly. The brain is one of the most energy-demanding organs, and neurons rely on the energy produced by mitochondria to communicate with one another. Indeed, when mitochondrial activity is impaired, neurons do not have the energy required to function correctly.

Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive impairment of neuronal functions leading to the death of brain cells. In Alzheimer's disease, for example, it has been observed that neuronal degeneration, which precedes cell death, is accompanied by impaired mitochondrial activity. However, due to the lack of suitable tools, it has been difficult in the past to determine whether mitochondrial alterations play a causal role in these conditions or are simply a consequence of the pathophysiological process.

In this new study, researchers from Inserm and the Université de Bordeaux, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, developed for the first time a tool that allows to temporarily stimulate mitochondrial activity. They hypothesized that if this stimulation led to an improvement of symptoms in animals, this would mean that the impairment of mitochondrial activity precedes the loss of neurons in the context of a neurodegenerative disease.

In previous studies, the research teams already described the specific role of G proteins in the modulation of mitochondrial activity in the brain. In the present paper, the researchers succeeded in generating an artificial receptor, called mitoDreadd-Gs, able to activate G proteins directly in the mitochondria, thereby stimulating mitochondrial activity. The stimulation of mitoDreadd-Gs in the brain led to the normalisation of both mitochondrial activity and memory performance of dementia mouse models.

""This work is the first to establish a cause-and-effect link between mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial activity could be at the origin of the onset of neuronal degeneration"", explains Giovanni Marsicano, Inserm research director and co-senior author of the study.

""These results will need to be extended, but they allow us to better understand the important role of mitochondria in the proper functioning of our brain. Ultimately, the tool we developed could help us identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for dementia and facilitate the development of effective therapeutic targets"", explains Étienne Hébert Chatelain, professor at the Université de Moncton and co-senior author of the study.

""Our work now consists of trying to measure the effects of continuous stimulation of mitochondrial activity to see whether it impacts the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and, ultimately, delays neuronal loss or even prevents it if mitochondrial activity is restored,"" added Luigi Bellocchio, Inserm researcher and co-senior author of the study.

Building upon the success of the first in utero brain surgery for Vein of Galen Malformation (VOGM) reported in 2023, new data published today in JAMA provides further evidence for the potential use of fetal embolization for this condition.

VOGM is the most common type of congenital blood vessel abnormality, in which the earliest arteries that develop in the brain connect directly with the dominant vein in the young brain, rather than nourishing the brain tissue. This causes a tremendous rush of high-pressure, high-flow blood into the veins, putting the fetus at high risk for mortality, heart failure, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delay. To improve outcomes for patients, a team at Boston Children's Hospital designed a fetal embolization procedure that results in markedly diminished blood flow through the malformation, without blockage, and launched a clinical trial. Outcomes from their first successful procedure were reported in Stroke in 2023.

In this new report in JAMA, the team describes outcomes from the first 7 patients enrolled in the trial; the fetal procedure was successfully completed in 5 of the 7. With standard postnatal care, even at expert referral centers, this high-risk fetal cohort had an expected 90% mortality, with only 9% likelihood of reaching developmental milestones at age 6 months. Notably, the enrolled patients had a dramatic reduction in mortality to 43%, and 3 of the 5 successfully treated patients survived past the neonatal period; all are thriving, without sign of neurodevelopmental delay. The investigators point out that five of the seven enrolled patients had unscheduled deliveries, including three preterm, at a mean of approximately 3 days post-intervention.

These early results build on the success of our first case, demonstrating the feasibility of fetal embolization for VOGM and strongly suggesting that the procedure is safe and effective, though a full trial needs to be completed in order to draw solid conclusions.""

Darren Orbach, MD, PhD, Co-Director of the Cerebrovascular Surgery and Interventions Center at Boston Children's Hospital and PI of the study

The research team plans to complete a full trial of this approach, weighing potential reduction in mortality, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delays against an increased risk of unscheduled, preterm delivery.

A new research paper was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on July 25, 2025, titled ""Dissecting the functional differences and clinical features of R-spondin family members in metastatic prostate cancer.""

In this study, researchers led by first author Aiden Deacon and corresponding author Justin Hwang from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities investigated a group of genes known as the R-spondin family (RSPO1/2/3/4) in advanced prostate cancer (PC). The RSPO gene family regulates Wnt signaling, a pathway involved in cancer progression.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the United States and becomes especially dangerous when it spreads beyond the prostate. Most patients are treated with hormone therapies that target the androgen receptor; however, many tumors eventually become resistant.

The research team analyzed thousands of tumor samples and found that RSPO2 alterations were more common than changes in other R-spondin genes or even some well-known cancer-related genes like CTNNB1 and APC. RSPO2 amplification occurred in over 20% of metastatic prostate cancer. Patients with these alterations showed signs of more aggressive disease, including higher mutation rates and greater tumor complexity.

Using laboratory models, the team discovered that RSPO2 increases cancer cell growth and triggers a biological process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is known to promote tumor spread and resistance to standard treatments. Unlike other genes in the same pathway, RSPO2 also appeared to reduce the activity of androgen receptor genes, suggesting it drives a type of prostate cancer that no longer relies on hormones for growth.

""In cell lines, RSPO2 overexpression caused up-regulation of EMT pathways, including EMT-regulatory transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2, and TWIST1.""

Importantly, RSPO2 showed structural differences from other R-spondin proteins, which may allow researchers to design drugs that specifically block its activity. Current therapies targeting the Wnt pathway are limited, and there are no approved drugs that inhibit RSPO2. However, this study highlights RSPO2 as a promising therapeutic target, especially for patients who do not respond to existing hormone-based treatments.

This research adds critical knowledge about how aggressive prostate cancers develop and persist despite therapy. The identification of RSPO2 as a key driver of disease progression opens new possibilities for treatment strategies aimed at improving outcomes for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Tokyo researchers reveal key role of Fen1 in resisting antiviral and anticancer drug effects","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250810/Tokyo-researchers-reveal-key-role-of-Fen1-in-resisting-antiviral-and-anticancer-drug-effects.aspx","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 03:45:00 GMT","

Researchers from Tokyo Metropolitan University have discovered a new pathway by which cells counteract the action of alovudine, an important antiviral and anticancer drug. The protein flap endonuclease-1 (Fen1) was found to improve cell tolerance by counteracting the toxic accumulation of another protein, 53BP1. A renewed spotlight on the underappreciated role of Fen1 promises not only new cancer treatments, but a way to gauge the efficacy of existing treatments.

Chain-terminating nucleoside analogs (CTNAs) are molecules which closely resemble nucleosides, the building blocks of DNA. They have been used as antiviral and cancer treatments since the 1980s due to their ability to bind to DNA as they are replicated. Since replication rates are abnormally high in infected or cancerous cells, these cells take up more of the drug, suppressing their growth. However, there is much that we don't know about how healthy cells resist the action of CTNA toxicity, limiting how we put them to good use. For example, alovudine, a CTNA containing fluorine, was envisioned as an HIV treatment, but clinical trials were stopped at phase II due to their toxicity.

A team led by Professor Kouji Hirota of Tokyo Metropolitan University have been looking at the pathways by which healthy cells resist the action of CTNAs. In previous work on alovudine, they had discovered the important role played by breast cancer type I susceptibility protein (BRCA1), a key player in DNA repair. Now, they have turned to the underappreciated role played by flap endonuclease-1 (Fen1), another DNA repair protein responsible for cutting off short, single-stranded DNA sections hanging off a replicating section of DNA known as an Okazaki fragment.

In their experiments with genetically modified chicken DT40 cells, a common model system, the team discovered that suppression of Fen1 made cells extremely susceptible to alovudine toxicity, with replication speeds significantly reduced. Strikingly, they discovered that the further loss of a gene encoding for an entirely different protein led to recovery of alovudine tolerance. Known as 53BP1, this protein is known to collect at nicks in double-stranded DNA. This suggests a mechanism where a lack of Fen1 firstly leads to long overhangs, or ""flaps"", being left on replicating DNA. When alovudine is incorporated, the 53BP1 accumulates around the flap, impeding other available mechanisms for cleaving off the overhang, effectively terminating DNA replication.

The team also carried out experiments extending their previous work on BRCA1. At the time, they found that homologous recombination (HR), a key DNA repair pathway involving BRCA1, was significant in their alovudine tolerance. While having either Fen1 or HR suppressed led to lowered resistance, having both led to significantly more suppression. This suggests that the newly found significance of Fen1 is independent of the previous role identified for BRCA1.

A deeper understanding of CTNA tolerance might yield not only promising new treatments but also effect biomarking of cancerous cells which often have a Fen1 deficiency, and a way to ascertain how effective drugs like alovudine might be. The team aims to move to studies in human cells, and work on how such treatments might be applied to different cancerous tissues, such as solid tumors.

This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grants-in-Aid (JP25K02256, JP21K19235, JP20H04337, JP22K15040, and 19KK0210), Tokyo Metropolitan Government Advanced Research Grant Number (R3-[2]), the Takeda Science Foundation, and the Uehara Memorial Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New web-based tool helps fight lung cancer mortality and advance treatment","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250811/New-web-based-tool-helps-fight-lung-cancer-mortality-and-advance-treatment.aspx","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 11:02:00 GMT","

Experts have created a customizable, web-based tool that provides state and local leaders with tailored resources to reduce lung cancer mortality rates and advance treatment. The tool's development and features are described in an article published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths worldwide, screening rates have remained low, leading to delayed diagnoses and care and ultimately resulting in high mortality rates.

To reduce lung cancer deaths, the American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable (ACS NLCRT) was founded in 2017 to unite public, private, and non-profit groups, with more than 200 leading patient advocacy organizations, professional medical societies, state and federal government agencies, cancer centers, academic institutions, health systems, health plans, and corporate associations joining together to lend their expertise. Among its 10 task groups, the State-Based Initiatives (SBI) Task Group was charged to provide states with tailored resources, best practices, and implementation strategies to address lung cancer, and to create a centralized, web-based tool.

The SBI Planning Tool was developed through meetings, interviews, and usability testing, and the website's content, layout, and navigability were reviewed biweekly. User feedback was also gathered through surveys. The developers made an effort to allow users to navigate the webpage towards tailored recommendations based on their needs because every state or region has unique challenges and assets dependent on existing work in lung cancer, availability of funds, policies in place, levels of provider engagement, and community perceptions.

Also, as limiting interventions to better-resourced communities without including underserved areas could worsen geographic, demographic, and cultural disparities in lung cancer outcomes, a focus on health equity was integrated throughout the SBI Planning Tool.

Before the ACS NLCRT was established, but more so after, state coalitions focused on public health initiatives to reduce lung cancer deaths have sprung up. It is often said that 'all public health is local,' and the aim of the ACS NLCRT State-Based Initiatives Task Group is to give local leaders, health care professionals, and advocates the tools to efficiently and effectively develop tailored programs to advance lung cancer control in their state. Among the many achievements of the ACS NLCRT, the development of the SBI Planning tool ranks high on the list.""

A team led by Ralf Jungmann (Chair Professor for Molecular Physics of Life at LMU and leader of the Molecular Imaging and Bionanotechnology research group at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry) has now taken an unprecedented look at how therapeutic antibodies reshape receptor organization at the single-molecule level, and how this affects the function of the antibodies.

Using Resolution Enhancement by Sequential Imaging (RESI) - a novel super-resolution microscopy technique capable of visualizing single proteins - the researchers directly imaged the nanoscale architecture of CD20 receptors and their interactions with widely used anti-CD20 antibodies such as Rituximab and Obinutuzumab.

""For the first time, we can visualize in intact cells how antibody-receptor complexes organize at the single-protein level,"" explains Ralf Jungmann, senior author of the study, which was published recently in the journal Nature Communications. ""These nanoscale patterns directly correlate with therapeutic function and provide a blueprint for rational antibody design.""

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies act through multiple mechanisms - triggering immune cells, activating complement pathways, or directly inducing cell death. These effects depend on how antibodies bind and reorganize receptors on the cell surface. However, traditional imaging methods lacked the resolution to reveal these arrangements in their native cellular context.

The Jungmann team overcame this barrier by implementing multi-target 3D RESI imaging, a method that labels receptors and antibodies with orthogonal DNA barcodes and sequentially visualizes them at sub-nanometer precision. This allowed the team to resolve the organization of CD20 receptors and their bound antibodies directly on the cell membrane.

We can now directly see how structural changes in antibody design translate into different receptor patterns and cellular responses. This opens the door to structure-guided development of next-generation monoclonal antibodies.""

Isabelle Pachmayr, first author of the study

Beyond CD20, this RESI technology is capable of investigating virtually any membrane receptor and therapeutic antibody with molecular resolution directly at intact cells. Because RESI visualizes whole cells with high throughput, it enables systematic analysis of antibody candidates at a resolution previously only accessible through cryo-EM, but now directly in the cellular environment and with unique molecular specificity.

Looking ahead, the team envisions combining RESI with the imaging of multiple receptors and intracellular signaling molecules to map entire therapeutic pathways. ""For the first time, RESI combines the structure of nanoscale receptors with their function in a cellular context,"" summarizes Jungmann. ""This technology has the potential to fundamentally transform immunotherapies.""

People who practised blowing through a conch shell regularly for six months experienced a reduction in their symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), according to a small randomised controlled trial published today (Monday) in ERJ Open Research.

OSA is a common sleep disorder where breathing repeatedly stops during the night due to a blocked airway. It leads to loud snoring, restless sleep and daytime sleepiness. It also increases the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke.

Blowing the conch shell, or shankh blowing, has been part of Indian culture for thousands of years. The new research showed that people with moderate OSA who practised shankh blowing slept better, felt more alert during the day and had fewer breathing interruptions at night. The researchers say conch blowing is a simple, low-cost intervention that could help reduce symptoms without the need for medication or machines.

The study was led by Dr. Krishna K Sharma from the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute in Jaipur, India.

The standard treatment for OSA is a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, which keeps the patient's airway open by blowing air through a facemask throughout the night. While effective, many patients find it uncomfortable and struggle to use it consistently.

In my clinical practice, several patients reported feeling more rested and experiencing fewer symptoms after regularly practising shankh blowing – a traditional yogic breathing exercise involving exhaling through a conch shell. These observations led us to design a scientific study to rigorously test whether this simple, ancient practice could serve as a meaningful therapy for people with OSA.""

Dr. Krishna K Sharma, Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute, India

The study included 30 people with moderate OSA, aged between 19 and 65, who were assessed at the Eternal Heart Care Centre and Research Institute between May 2022 and January 2024. They were tested with polysomnography, meaning they are monitored throughout a night's sleep, and asked questions about the quality of their sleep and how sleepy they feel during the day.

They were randomly assigned to either be trained to practise blowing through a conch shell (16 patients) or to practise a deep breathing exercise (14 patients). Participants were provided with a traditional shankh used in yogic practices. They were trained in person at the clinic by a study team member before beginning home-based practice. Participants were encouraged to practise at home for a minimum of 15 minutes, five days per week. After six months, the patients were reassessed.

Compared to the people who practised deep breathing, the people who practised shankh blowing were 34% less sleepy during the daytime, they reported sleeping better and polysomnography revealed that they had four to five fewer apnoeas (where breathing stops during sleep) per hour on average. They also had higher levels of oxygen in their blood during the night.

Dr. Sharma said: ""The way the shankh is blown is quite distinctive. It involves a deep inhalation followed by a forceful, sustained exhalation through tightly pursed lips. This action creates strong vibrations and airflow resistance, which likely strengthens the muscles of the upper airway, including the throat and soft palate – areas that often collapse during sleep in people with OSA. The shankh's unique spiralling structure may also contribute to specific acoustic and mechanical effects that further stimulate and tone these muscles.

""For people living with OSA, especially those who find CPAP uncomfortable, unaffordable, or inaccessible, our findings offer a promising alternative. Shankh blowing is a simple low-cost, breathing technique that could help improve sleep and reduce symptoms without the need for machines or medication.

""This is a small study, but we are now planning a larger trial involving several hospitals. This next phase will allow us to validate and expand on our findings in a broader, more diverse population and assess how shankh blowing performs over longer periods. We also want to study how this practice affects airway muscle tone, oxygen levels and sleep in greater detail. We're particularly interested in comparing shankh blowing with standard treatments like CPAP, and in examining its potential help in more severe forms of OSA.""

Professor Sophia Schiza, Head of the ERS group on sleep disordered breathing, based at the University of Crete, Greece, who was not involved in the research said: ""Obstructive sleep apnoea is a common disease around the world. We know that OSA patients have poor quality of sleep, and higher risks of high blood pressure, strokes and heart disease. A proportion of patients experience sleepiness during the day. While CPAP and other treatments are available based on careful diagnosis of disease severity, there is still need for new treatments.

""This is an intriguing study that shows the ancient practice of shankh blowing could potentially offer an OSA treatment for selected patients by targeting muscles training. A larger study will help provide more evidence for this intervention which could be of benefit as a treatment option or in combination with other treatments in selected OSA patients.""

The planetary health diet aligns nutritional needs with environmental sustainability to reduce chronic disease risk while conserving global ecosystems. It promotes plant-rich eating patterns with limited animal products, adaptable to cultural and regional contexts.

The Planetary Health Diet (PHD), also referred to as the EAT–Lancet reference diet, is an eating pattern devised by the 2019 EAT-Lancet Commission to align nutritional adequacy with the ecological limits of planet Earth. The overarching aim of the PHD is to promote and preserve human health while keeping global food production within sustainable planetary boundaries by lowering diet-related chronic disease risk and protecting long-term planetary conservation.

The PHD is a flexitarian, health-, and environment-oriented eating pattern that emphasizes vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, unsaturated oils, and fish while limiting red meat, pork, and in more moderate amounts, poultry, eggs, dairy, potatoes, and added sugars. Seafood and poultry are considered optional in modest amounts, while dairy is occasional, and starchy vegetables such as potatoes are minimized. The PHD is intentionally flexible and culturally adaptable, as this universal “reference diet” was designed to be accepted across food traditions while maintaining sustainability goals.

The PHD prioritizes plant diversity, using seafood judiciously, and low meat consumption to reduce diet-related ecological footprints. Ultra-processed food and refined sugar intake are intended to be occasional rather than regular.2

The PHD supports cardiovascular and metabolic health to align individual health with environmental goals. Across large cohorts, sustainable diets like the PHD are associated with a reduced risk of major non-communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, as well as obesity and overweight, both of which are directly linked to metabolic disease.3

Reduced intake of red/processed meats and ultra-processed foods, both of which are key features of unhealthy eating patterns, while increasing the consumption of fiber-rich whole foods improves nutrient density and may lower the risk of certain cancers, particularly colorectal cancer, by reducing exposure to carcinogens from processed/red meat, including nitrites/nitrates and compounds formed during high-temperature cooking, as well as chronic inflammation and hormonal drivers of disease. While evidence from meta-analyses suggests a protective association, certainty is rated as low due to heterogeneity and potential residual confounding. The PHD encourages balanced nutrient intake without relying on animal products by emphasizing diverse plant foods and limiting red meat.3

The PHD reduces demand for resource-intensive products and encourages efficiency along supply chains. Furthermore, the PHD lowers climate impacts and pressure on croplands and irrigation, thereby conserving water and preventing soil depletion. The magnitude of these benefits depends on specific food choices within the PHD framework and regional agricultural practices, as some healthy foods, such as certain nuts or greenhouse-grown vegetables, can have relatively high environmental footprints.

The PHD and other sustainable diets also support biodiversity and soil health to reduce incentives for deforestation and monocultures. Healthier crop rotations, reduced fertilizer loads, and a decrease in total manure production alongside better manure management can also improve soil structure and nutrient cycling, limiting erosion and runoff.4

Overall, the PHD is an eating pattern that simultaneously advances human health and environmental stewardship. These benefits include lower emissions, restrained land and water use, as well as the development of production systems that provide long-term protection for biodiversity and soils.4

The EAT-Lancet Commission explicitly sets intake ranges and targets for major food groups to allow countries to adapt the PHD to local crops, cuisines, and supply chains while staying within health and environmental limits.

This adaptability is crucial, as national dietary quality varies widely. For example, Mediterranean nations align closely with PHD principles through higher intakes of vegetables, fruits, and unsaturated fats, whereas North America and Latin America/Caribbean cuisines incorporate more red/processed meat and added sugars.5

Effective adaptation must also consider affordability and food-system incentives. In low-income settings, limited purchasing power often causes consumers to favor refined staples, starchy vegetables, and cheap added fats. Comparatively, in high-income settings, policies that favor commodity crops lead to lower meat prices and more expensive fruits/vegetables.

Lebanon, Tunisia, Greece, Egypt, Libya, and Cyprus report some of the highest PHD Index (PHDI) scores (based on 2024 data; global average adherence is about 85 out of 140), which reflects plant-rich patterns with low added sugars and saturated fats. Conversely, several Latin American countries, including Chile, Honduras, Argentina, Bolivia, and Colombia, rank among the lowest PHDIs due to higher red meat and sugar intake. India scores higher partly because cultural and economic factors limit red-meat intake; however, dairy intake is relatively high, and trans-fat regulation remains a challenge.5

Geographic distribution of the PHDI for people aged over 20 in 171 countries/territories in 2018. The PHDI ranges from 0 to 140, where 0 indicates nonadherence to the Planetary Health Diet and 140 indicates perfect adherence. PHDI, Planetary Health Diet Index.5

In low-income settings, limited purchasing power causes consumers to purchase cheap staples and added fats. In some areas, legumes and pulses, the main PHD protein sources, may also be expensive or seasonally unavailable, further limiting adherence. These food environments may also lack reliable cold storage and hygiene for indigenous produce, thereby reducing access to diverse plant-based foods.5,6

Current shortfalls of the planetary health diet from a plant-forward perspective6

Nutrient adequacy is a concern, as low levels of calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin B12 can arise if plant-forward patterns are not carefully planned. To overcome these limitations, certain strategies like fortification, biofortification, and targeted supplementation can be adopted.5,6

Agricultural policies in many high-income countries maintain a low cost for red meat, whereas fruits/vegetables are comparatively expensive, which strongly influences consumption patterns. These feasibility constraints, unresolved nutrient-adequacy concerns, stakeholder resistance, and policy/infrastructure gaps prevent the large-scale adoption of the PHD, which must be addressed through locally adapted planning, stronger public policy, and dietary guidance.5,6

Governments are encouraged to incorporate front-of-pack labels that clearly guide consumers toward healthier and low-impact foods, as these are more effective than dense numeric back-panel labels. National dietary guidelines should also integrate sustainability considerations to better guide school meals and industry reformulation.7

The agricultural sector must transition away from subsidized staples toward diversified production of fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts. These efforts can improve affordability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while investing in irrigation, energy, roads, storage, and cold chains reduces loss, costs, and price volatility for perishable, nutrient-dense foods. Reducing food waste along the supply chain is also a key strategy to improve both environmental and nutritional outcomes.7

Implementation of these strategies is most effective when community-led efforts are supported by local governments to improve access. A supportive political environment that encompasses commitment, coherent policy packages, social mobilization, and accountability, are imperative to sustain change.7

Routine childhood and adolescent immunizations declined in Michigan between 2017 and 2023, particularly among counties with lower household income and higher uninsurance rates, a new study suggests.

For many key pediatric vaccines, completion rates dropped sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic and have not yet recovered, according to Michigan Medicine led findings in Pediatrics.  

""Our findings show that progress towards increasing childhood and adolescent immunizations is stalling in Michigan, increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases,"" said senior author Kao-Ping Chua, M.D., Ph.D., a pediatrician and researcher at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children's Hospital and the director of the Susan B. Meister Child Health Evaluation and Research (CHEAR) Center.

Researchers analyzed county-level data from Michigan's immunization registry between 2017 and 2023. During the study period, completion rates of a recommended group of childhood immunizations among toddlers (including vaccines for pertussis, polio, and measles-mumps-rubella among others) fell from nearly 76% to 67%.

Meanwhile, completion rates of a recommended group of vaccinations among adolescents (including vaccines for meningitis, pertussis, and tetanus) declined from about 81% to 75%.

The study also assessed adolescent completion rates of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series – which can prevent several types of cancers, including cervical and throat cancer. Although completion rates rose modestly - from 35% to 42% for males and 43% to 45% for females - the increases were smaller than expected based on pre-pandemic trends, in part because the rate of increase slowed after the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Our findings suggest that the pandemic interrupted the progress that was being made in increasing HPV vaccination rates in adolescents.""  

Kao-Ping Chua, M.D., Ph.D., pediatrician and researcher at University of Michigan Health C.S. Mott Children's Hospital 

The researchers examined trends in immunization completion rates by county socioeconomic factors, including income and insurance coverage. The decline in the completion rates of the recommended group of childhood and adolescent immunizations was greater in counties with lower income and higher uninsurance, while the increase in the rate of the male HPV vaccination series was slower.

""These changes often resulted in the creation of new gaps in immunization completion rates by county income or uninsurance rate or the widening of pre-existing gaps"", said Chua, who notes that this is one of the first studies to examine recent changes in childhood and adolescent immunizations by county characteristics.

Vaccines have long been one of the most effective tools in public health. In 2019, childhood immunizations were estimated to prevent over 24 million cases of vaccine-preventable diseases nationwide. Yet in 2025, the U.S. reported its highest number of measles cases in 33 years - a disease that had been declared eliminated in the country in 2000.

Michigan also saw a spike in measles with more than a dozen cases reported in 2025 as well as pertussis (whooping cough), with 855 cases reported the same year, including 152 in children under two.

""Reversing the declines in childhood and adolescent immunizations is crucial to prevent further outbreaks of measles and pertussis, both in Michigan and in the U.S. more broadly,"" Chua said.

""To achieve this goal, broad-based efforts to increase immunization rates in all counties should be coupled with targeted efforts focused on counties with lower income and higher uninsurance rates.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Parasitic worm evades detection by suppressing skin neurons","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250811/Parasitic-worm-evades-detection-by-suppressing-skin-neurons.aspx","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 12:46:00 GMT","

New research, published in The Journal of Immunology, discovered that a parasitic worm suppresses neurons in the skin to evade detection. The researchers suggest that the worm likely evolved this mechanism to enhance its own survival, and that the discovery of the molecules responsible for the suppression could aid in the development of new painkillers.

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by helminths, a type of worm. Infection occurs during contact with infested water through activities like swimming, washing clothes, and fishing, when larvae penetrate the skin. Surprisingly, the worm often evades detection by the immune system, unlike other bacteria or parasites that typically cause pain, itching, or rashes.

In this new study, researchers from Tulane School of Medicine aimed to find out why the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni doesn't cause pain or itching when it penetrates the skin. Their findings show that S. mansoni causes a reduction in the activity of TRPV1+, a protein that sends signals the brain interprets as heat, pain, or itching. As part of pain-sensing in sensory neurons, TRPV1+ regulates immune responses in many scenarios such as infection, allergy, cancer, autoimmunity, and even hair growth.

The researchers found that S. mansoni produces molecules that suppress TRPV1+ to block signals from being sent to the brain, allowing S. mansoni to infect the skin largely undetected. It is likely S. mansoni evolved the molecules that block TRPV1+ to enhance its survival.

""If we identify and isolate the molecules used by helminths to block TRPV1+ activation, it may present a novel alternative to current opioid-based treatments for reducing pain,"" said Dr. De'Broski R. Herbert, Professor of Immunology at Tulane School of Medicine, who led the study. ""The molecules that block TRPV1+ could also be developed into therapeutics that reduce disease severity for individuals suffering from painful inflammatory conditions.""

The study also found that TRPV1+ is necessary for initiating host protection against S. mansoni. TRPV1+ activation leads to the rapid mobilization of immune cells, including gd T cells, monocytes, and neutrophils, that induce inflammation. This inflammation plays a crucial role in host resistance to the larval entry into the skin. These findings highlight the importance of neurons that sense pain and itching in successful immune responses

Identifying the molecules in S. mansoni that block TRPV1+ could inform preventive treatments for schistosomiasis. We envision a topical agent which activates TRPV1+ to prevent infection from contaminated water for individuals at risk of acquiring S. mansoni.""

Dr. De'Broski R. Herbert, Professor of Immunology, Tulane School of Medicine

In this study, mice were infected with S. mansoi and evaluated for their sensitivity to pain as well as the role of TRPV1+ in preventing infection. Researchers next plan to identify the nature of the secreted or surface-associated helminth molecules that are responsible for blocking TRPV1+ activity and specific gd T cell subsets that are responsible for immune responses. The researchers also seek to further understand the neurons that helminths have evolved to suppress.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Inside the CDC, shooting adds to trauma as workers describe projects, careers in limbo","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250811/Inside-the-CDC-shooting-adds-to-trauma-as-workers-describe-projects-careers-in-limbo.aspx","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 10:39:00 GMT","

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workers whose jobs have been reinstated after dizzying Trump administration disruptions say they remain stuck in a budgetary, political, and professional limbo.

Their work includes major agency priorities such as HIV testing and monitoring, as well as work at the nation's leading sexually transmitted infections lab. And while employees are back, many projects have been canceled or stalled, as funding disappears or is delayed.

""For a while, work was staring at a blank screen,"" an HIV scientist said. ""I had a couple of projects before this. I'm trying to get them restarted.""

""We don't know what's happening or what to do,"" said an HIV prevention researcher who was fired then rehired.

These employees voiced deep concern over the future of the agency and its work on HIV and other threats. The unprecedented downsizing could lead to loss of life and higher spending on medical care, they say. Their uncertain employment status has sunk morale. Many worry about the future of public health.

On Aug. 8, a gunman identified by Georgia authorities as Patrick Joseph White fired shots at CDC buildings in Atlanta. A first responder on the scene, DeKalb County police officer David Rose, was killed. White, who was found dead, was possibly motivated by his views on vaccines, according to news reports.

The attack added another level of anxiety for agency workers.

""We feel threatened from inside, and, obviously, now from outside,"" a lab scientist said Aug. 10. ""The trauma runs so differently in all of us. And is this the last straw for some of us? The overall morale — would you go back in the building and you could be shot at?""

Healthbeat interviewed 11 CDC workers, who offered a rare glimpse into conditions at the agency. All but one had been fired then offered their jobs back. Most have worked on HIV-related projects for at least several years. All spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing a fear of retaliation.

They fear their employment, in the HIV scientist's terms, ""is on shaky ground.""

""I'm concerned there is chaos and that we lost ground on HIV prevention"" from reductions in data collection and layoffs of local public health workers, an HIV epidemiologist said. ""I feel like a pawn on a chessboard.""

HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard responded to a query with this statement:

""Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, the nation's critical public health functions remain intact and effective. The Trump administration is committed to protecting essential services — whether it's supporting coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH, safeguarding public health through lead prevention, or researching and tracking the most prevalent communicable diseases. HHS is streamlining operations without compromising mission-critical work. Enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans remains our top priority.""

The workers received some positive news July 31, when a Senate committee voted to keep CDC funding at more than $9 billion, near its current level. ""It is very encouraging, but that's only one step in the appropriations process,"" the HIV researcher said.

Still, under the Trump administration's budget request, the CDC's programs on HIV face uncertainty. John Brooks, who retired as chief medical officer of the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention last year, expressed concern over the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative. Launched in President Donald Trump's first term, it ""breathed new life into HIV prevention,"" Brooks said.

The successes of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative are jeopardized by the administration plan to scale back HIV prevention efforts, Brooks said. That would include the potential elimination of the CDC Division of HIV Prevention, which provides funds to state health departments and other groups for testing and prevention, conducts HIV monitoring and surveillance, researches HIV prevention and care, and assists medical professionals with training and education.

""There is no way to achieve the goals of EHE without maintaining the national prevention infrastructure it depends on,"" Brooks said. ""There is every reason to worry that in fact new HIV infections will rise again.""

Under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Department of Health and Human Services carried out widespread layoffs at the CDC and other health agencies beginning in early April. Lawsuits over those mass firings are playing out in federal courts.

The administration's budget blueprint would move CDC HIV work — with many fewer employees, according to people Healthbeat interviewed — to the Administration for a Healthy America, a new HHS division Kennedy has championed.

The Medical Monitoring Project, which tracks outcomes, quality, and gaps in HIV treatment, is set to be a casualty under the Trump restructuring plan, an HIV prevention physician said.

HHS officials have not communicated with the rank and file about the restructuring, several CDC workers said.

""It's been crickets,"" the HIV scientist said.

The White House's proposed CDC budget for the next fiscal year contains a cut of more than 50%, plummeting from $9.2 billion in fiscal year 2025 to about $4.2 billion, according to administration documents and public health advocacy groups, with some agency functions transferred to the proposed AHA. The Senate committee, by an overwhelming vote, injected billions back into the agency budget and declined to fund the AHA.

U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Georgia Democrat, thanked the committee for ""rejecting the unacceptable effort to defund most of the CDC.""

""The budget request from the White House included a 56% cut to the world's preeminent epidemiological agency,"" Ossoff said. He also criticized a ""systematic destruction of morale at the CDC, the disbandment of entire agencies focused on maternal health and neonatal health and disease prevention at the CDC.""

If the White House prevails and the prevention program is eliminated, ""we would see most states have no funding for HIV prevention,"" said Emily Schreiber, senior director of policy and legislative affairs for the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors. ""That means most states would not be able to conduct any HIV testing, any referral to care, and/or referral to preventive services like PrEP,"" or pre-exposure prophylaxis, a drug that can prevent HIV infections.

""It means that states would not be able to help people get access to medications,"" she said, ""and that means that we would see new cases and an increased spread of HIV across the United States.""

""We would definitely see layoffs at the CDC, and I think we'd probably see them at state health departments and community-based organizations as well,"" she added.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has recently laid off or reassigned dozens of HIV workers due to funding problems, according to a statement emailed to Healthbeat.

""I fear all HIV prevention work will go away permanently,"" the HIV prevention researcher said. ""I don't think this administration wants HIV prevention work to be done by the federal government.""

Georgia leads U.S. states in the rate of new HIV infections, according to the latest data from AIDSVu. CDC workers also said they're concerned that vulnerable communities of color and LGBTQ+ communities would be deeply harmed by funding cuts.

In Georgia and other states, information provided by the Medical Monitoring Project about access to care will disappear, the HIV physician said. Information on prevention and treatment will dwindle for people who are disadvantaged, he said, including those with substance abuse problems or mental illness, transgender people, and those living in poverty.

""There is a lot of anger and sadness among people over the termination of the project,"" the physician said. ""A lot of the enthusiasm is gone.""

An effective home testing program for HIV plans to shutter this fall, said Patrick Sullivan, the Together TakeMeHome project's lead scientist and a professor at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. In its notice canceling funding for the project, the CDC said it no longer had the staff to oversee it. Based at Emory, the project delivered more than 900,000 free home testing kits to people across the country through an easy-to-use website and integration with dating apps.

More than 100 HIV workers were among the more than 450 CDC staffers brought back, said employees interviewed by Healthbeat. Some cited media coverage, support in Congress, and advocacy by patient groups and pharmaceutical companies for their reinstatement. ""Members of Congress are going to bat for HIV,"" the epidemiologist said.

Several are closely watching a lawsuit brought by 20 Democratic attorneys general, seeking to halt an agency restructuring plan Kennedy announced in March. They are also paying attention to a lawsuit filed in California that challenges the firings.

A few people whose jobs were restored have retired or moved on to other work. ""Some people aren't trusting we will remain, so they're leaving,"" the HIV prevention researcher said.

At the CDC's sexually transmitted infections lab in Atlanta, work has also slowed due to a shrinking staff and new spending constraints on supplies, the lab scientist said.

Restored lab workers are focusing on high-priority areas such as syphilis and gonorrhea while other diseases have been back-burnered, the scientist said, adding ""a lot of what we were doing was staying ahead of the next pathogen, and we feel like our time and effort to do that now is limited.""

""We're all public health because we know what the mission is,"" the scientist said. ""We just want to get our job done and protect the American public.""

World Cup

U.S. men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams was back in Chicago for a second time this summer.

He had been in the Windy City with the U.S. team in the first days of June for its pre-Concacaf Gold Cup camp, where the United States' 2022 World Cup captain was intent on making a statement to head coach Mauricio Pochettino ahead of the 2026 edition.

Now, in the first days of August, he was back, with AFC Bournemouth this time, on tour in the United States and preparing for the new Premier League season — a campaign he believes can be an important chance to level up at a vital time. (And with his club facing reigning champion Liverpool at Anfield in Friday's curtain-raiser, it won't be long before he's facing a first significant challenge.)

That he was not only in the same city but the very same hotel felt symbolic. It was a reminder of the 26-year-old's approach to the year leading into that largely home World Cup next summer. Adams says he feels motivated and all-in.

Adams' presence with the U.S. this summer shouldn't have been newsworthy. But for a Gold Cup that became as much about who wasn't in camp as who was, it was notable that the defensive midfielder was there despite a foot injury that kept him from fully training or playing in the first weeks of camp.

Adams had gotten just one camp with Pochettino to that point since the Argentine's appointment in September last year, and he felt it was important to begin to prove himself and understand his new national-team manager better.

“It was a great learning experience,” Adams tells The Athletic. “Just because I hadn't been in his initial camps to begin with. So I think a lot of guys had a lot more time with him than I've had. Just ironing out that relationship, what he wants from the players, how the players can get the best out of the coaching staff, just balancing that relationship.

“You hear about him in the way that he works, but until you spend a month with him, you don't really know. I've had the opportunity to do that now, so I feel like that will be really helpful in the long run, for not just myself, but a lot of the young guys that had the first opportunity as well.”

While the U.S. was missing several regulars due to injury and Club World Cup duties, the controversy of the summer revolved around Christian Pulisic's decision to opt out of the Gold Cup. The Milan forward and sometimes USMNT captain felt he needed rest if he was going to be ready for the 2025-26 season — and, as an extension, primed for the World Cup.

Pochettino and his staff agreed to let him skip the tournament. But the coach, responding to Pulisic's comments to CBS that he wanted to take part in the two warm-up friendlies in June before missing the Gold Cup itself, was clearly bothered by the idea that those types of decisions would be left to the players.

“I am the head coach,” Pochettino said. “I am not a mannequin.”

It raised the question as to whether Pulisic will have to earn back the trust of the coaches — and maybe even his teammates, too. Adams pushes back hard on the idea that he had anything to prove.

“It's a topic that everyone wants to have an opinion on, of course, but what Christian did is what he had to do for himself,” Adams says. “He doesn't have to earn the respect of anyone in the group. Everyone knows who Christian is as a person, and how good of a player he is as well. But everyone needs time in certain moments of their career or life to just say: ‘Let me take a step back, focus on myself for a second and then move forward'.

“I speak to Christian all the time. We're obviously super close. And I just know that this summer, while he took a step away, he didn't anticipate that there was going to be that much noise and heat around it. But again, everyone wants to throw his name in the gutter because it creates a big story, or it creates noise around (the team). And that's how big of a player he is and how important of a player he is. But everyone in the team knows how important he is, what an amazing person he is.

“I can't say enough good things about him. He's one of the leaders of our team. The decision that he made was best for him, and it's going to help him in the long run.”

Pulisic's absence didn't just spark criticism. It also turned a spotlight on what feels like a growing divide between the program's current players and its alumni, many of whom have taken on roles in the media.

Several former USMNT players harshly criticized the team for its disappointing performances in the Concacaf Nations League finals in March, pointing to a perceived lack of heart or passion in losses to Panama and Canada. Multiple high-profile predecessors then offered thoughts on Pulisic's Gold Cup absence, including Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan and Tim Howard.

The comments from Donovan and Howard eventually led to Pulisic's CBS interview.

“You can talk about my performances, whatever you want, but to question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line, but that's how it is,” Pulisic told the Call It What You Want podcast.

Asked about what feels like a disconnect between players past and present in the program, Adams calls it “the strangest thing.”

“I can't even explain it,” he says. “I'm not a social-media guy, so I don't follow anything, but when people bring up some of the things that are being said and some of the stories that are being created, it feels weird, because it feels like not long ago that every single one of those people were on board with, like, the direction that the federation was going and how well the players were doing. And it feels like any setback, is (treated) like a disaster is happening. Do you know what I mean?

“And that happens in football. I get it. Some people have jobs where their job is to speak about the sport, and if that's their opinion, that's their opinion. My goal is to try to create an environment, especially within our team, where guys feel like they can go out, be themselves, be comfortable. We're all on the same page and want to grow the sport in America. People's opinions are people's opinions at the end of the day.”

Adams says he's “always a truthful guy” and that “the truth can hurt sometimes,” so he doesn't shy away from tougher conversations. That would include talks with former players who have criticisms, or with coaches who might want more from him, or initiating difficult conversations with teammates when the time calls for it.

It's part of what has made Adams one of the leaders of this team. He called being the U.S. captain in the 2022 World Cup “one of the most special moments of my career,” and though center-back Tim Ream has been wearing the armband most regularly under Pochettino – no official captain has been designated yet by the new manager – Adams says he will continue to be himself and help to the lead the group.

His goal for now, though, is to progress at the club level this season. He noted that this is his first chance to go through a full preseason in three years, and after having a full campaign last year without an injury, 2025-26 with Bournemouth is about reaching his peak form going into next summer.

“This past season gave me the confidence that I needed to now say: ‘You could take the next step. Let's take another step in development. Take a step in pushing yourself',” Adams says.

There is no doubt that as the USMNT continues to push through what has been a tumultuous two years, it would benefit significantly from having Adams consistently available and in the lineup, much as he was throughout the previous World Cup cycle ending wth the tournament itself in Qatar. The Gold Cup was a huge step forward in that regard. Adams feels confident he's rounding into form at just the right moment.

“Now it's like: ‘OK, I'm back to myself, I feel like myself',” he says. “I've had a nice break. I'm going to be able to get a nice preseason. And (then) it's go time.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT Player Tracker: Musah on the move as Richards starts season with silverware","https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6546209/2025/08/11/usmnt-musah-richards-arfsten-pulisic-tracker/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 11:51:49 GMT","

We are back again for another season of tracking the fortunes of USMNT players in Europe.

And as we gear up for the 2025-26 campaign across the continent's major leagues, this isn't just any football season: it's one that ends with a World Cup co-hosted by the United States next June and July, a tournament which will be the pinnacle for most of these guys' careers.

So, welcome aboard as we keep tabs each week on who is flourishing and who is struggling in this vital period, who is making a bid to impress head coach Mauricio Pochettino ahead of next summer and who could be a surprise contender for that all-important World Cup roster.

Let's start with one of the national team's more established players — and one who could be set for a big move before this transfer window closes on September 1.

The noise has ramped up in recent weeks that Yunus Musah might be leaving Milan, where he shares a dressing room with Christian Pulisic. Yesterday, The Athletic reported that the Premier League could be his destination. Talks are underway between Nottingham Forest and Milan over a deal for the 22-year-old, who has made 47 appearances for the USMNT.

And as chance would have it, Musah spent Saturday and Sunday facing Premier League opposition in two friendly matches against Leeds United and then Chelsea.

How did he do? The midfielder played 45 minutes of the 1-1 draw with Leeds at Dublin's Aviva Stadium. He was deployed as a right-sided wing-back for new manager Max Allegri, going up against Leeds' Wilfried Gnonto and Gabriel Gudmundsson.

His ongoing battle with Gnonto was the most eye-catching, as the Italian forward found space on multiple occasions and proved to be one of his team's best attacking outlets. Musah put in some strong tackles on both of his opponents, while his best attacking moment came in the latter stages of the first half. He collected the ball at speed down the right and skipped over a sliding Ao Tanaka before seeing his delivery cleared.

But it was a more chastening experience for Musah, and Milan, 24 hours later after they moved on to London. The Serie A side were soundly beaten 4-1 by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and Musah endured a tough 73 minutes.

Playing as a right midfielder in the first half, he struggled to get into the game. There were a few early one-on-ones against new Chelsea signing Jamie Gittens. In the first of them, Musah conceded a foul as Gittens went past him, while in the next, he did well to recover and win a corner. Then there was a frustrating moment when he failed to control a cross-field ball.

Musah wasn't alone in struggling: Milan could not get near Chelsea, who won the Club World Cup in the United States last month. To compound a rough afternoon, Musah conceded a pretty harsh penalty in the second half. Trying to recover to intercept a low cross from Liam Delap, he was deemed to have fouled another Chelsea new boy, Estevao. Delap converted the ensuing spot kick.

The writing already appears to be on the wall for the American's long-term suitability at San Siro.

Milan appointed Igli Tare as sporting director recently, and earlier this summer he said: “I consider Musah an excellent player, but we are looking for profiles with characteristics that fit the project we have with coach Allegri. We are seeking deep-lying midfielders for a three-man midfield; Musah doesn't have these characteristics. He can play in a two- or three-man midfield, but with different characteristics. This is the real reason why we want to do something different.”

Musah joined Milan from Valencia of Spain in the summer of 2023 despite interest from Premier League sides Fulham and West Ham United at the time. Now he might be primed for a second chance at testing himself in England's top flight.

Musah may not be the only American heading to England this window. EFL Championship club Middlesbrough, for whom U.S. midfielder Aidan Morris has already become a key man, are now interested in Columbus Crew winger Max Arfsten.

Arfsten, 24, was involved in this summer's Concacaf Gold Cup campaign and scored during the quarter-final win over Costa Rica.

Before they opened their second-tier campaign with a 1-0 home win against Swansea City on Saturday, Middlesbrough manager Rob Edwards admitted his admiration for the Californian. “I don't like talking about other clubs' players — I know I'm batting that one back. He's a good player, but I can't talk about it,” said Edwards.

Asked if he thought the interest in Arfsten would progress, Edwards replied: “I've no idea where it's at at the moment. He's a good player, but he's not ours.”

Well, for starters, it's worth noting those who didn't do anything because of their persisting injury issues.

Christian Pulisic was not involved in either of Milan's friendlies, with suggestions in Italy that he is still struggling with an ankle problem picked up during the 4-2 preseason win against Liverpool last month in Hong Kong.

Another gifted USMNT star, Malik Tillman, is also out of action. The midfielder, who joined Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the summer after helping Dutch side PSV retain their Eredivisie title, was missing from the German Bundesliga team's 2-0 loss at Chelsea on Friday night.

According to the club, Tillman is still suffering from an injury or, more specifically, “A mild stress reaction after training.”

“I can't say anything about his return,” Leverkusen manager Erik ten Hag told Sky Sport Deutschland. “We have to take it day by day.”

Asked if the injury has worsened, Ten Hag added: “We don't think so. We have to wait and see, day by day.”

Finally, what of Folarin Balogun? The forward has played and scored this pre-season for Monaco of France's Ligue 1 (in a 3-1 win over Torino from Italy and a 2-2 draw with Dutch side Ajax) but he wasn't in the squad for their 2-1 loss to Serie A visitors Inter on Friday.

While his previous runouts suggested Balogun is over the ankle injury that curtailed his hopes of featuring in the final games of the last campaign, his absence for what was Monaco's final pre-season game was put down to a leg problem he picked up against Ajax. The club do not consider it a serious issue, though.

But one USMNT veteran did feature over the weekend, and he was up against a young prospect. Weston McKennie played 24 minutes from the bench in Juventus' 2-1 win at Germany's Borussia Dortmund. If McKennie is already missing his pal Tim Weah, who left the Italian club for French side Marseille last week, he could at least have had a chat with young compatriot Cole Campbell, 19, who had a 15-minute cameo for Dortmund on Sunday.

Another USMNT international lifted some early-season silverware. Crystal Palace's Chris Richards played all 90 minutes of his team's Community Shield game against Liverpool as the FA Cup winners beat the Premier League champions 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw in normal time.

Richards was solid alongside Marc Guehi and Maxence Lacroix as Oliver Glasner picked the same starting line-up that defeated Manchester City in May's cup final. The centre-half, a popular member of the Palace squad, is expected to also start their first Premier League game of the campaign, away to Chelsea, next Sunday.

See if Pulisic has recovered in time to feature for Milan in their return to competitive action, as they host second division Bari in the first round of the Coppa Italia on Sunday (3:15pm, Paramount+). Before that, Damion Downs, who had an eventful debut for Southampton on Saturday — he was credited with assisting his new team's 96-minute winner against Championship newcomers Wrexham — could be in action again tomorrow (Tuesday) in the Carabao Cup's first round at third-tier Northampton Town (2:45pm, Paramount+).

And of course, excitement is building ahead of the Premier League's return on Friday, when Liverpool host Bournemouth in the big kick-off. Maybe Tyler Adams can help spoil the Anfield club's bid for a winning start to their title defence? (3pm, USA/Universo).

To advance in the 2026 World Cup, the USMNT must be sound and stable defensively. With the tournament less than a year away, things are looking good at center back with Chris Richards and Tim Ream. But a stable of defensive midfielders is also key to protecting the goal. Therefore, it's worth taking a look at the players who could be on the USMNT World Cup roster at that position.

For the U.S., the defensive midfield position begins with team captain Tyler Adams. At age 26, Adams has 50 caps and is the unquestioned leader of the national team. One could argue that he doesn't contribute enough to the attack, despite his incredible goal against Mexico in the 2024 Nations League final. One could also argue that he hasn't fully lived up to his promise as a player. But he was a key cog in helping an injury-plagued Bournemouth side finish ninth in the Premier League last season, which is no small feat.

Barring an injury, it's hard to imagine the USMNT kicking off its World Cup campaign without Adams in the starting lineup. Admittedly, injuries have sidelined him or hindered his play in the past. But Adams has a stable club situation and faces quality competition in the Premier League, so there is little reason to think that he won't be in good form and ready to play in the World Cup next summer.

Behind Adams, the U.S. has players who are capable of filling in, starting with Johnny Cardoso. While a terrible mistake against Türkiye and a subsequent ankle injury limited his minutes during the Gold Cup, better days are surely ahead for the New Jersey-born but Brazilian-raised midfielder. A move to Atletico Madrid this summer is a good move that has a chance to elevate Cardoso's game. If Adams were unavailable, he would likely be the replacement. Cardoso will also be useful as a late-game substitute when the U.S. is trying to hold a lead.

Tanner Tessmann is another deep-playing midfielder who looks like a strong candidate for the World Cup roster despite having just eight caps. Tessman left MLS in 2021, and after three years with Venezia in Italy, he now plays for French giants Lyon. While not quite 24, Tessman was a part-time starter for Lyon last season and still has room to grow. Should Mauricio Pochettino play a double-pivot with two holding midfielders, Tessman would be a candidate to play alongside Adams or Cardoso, adding to the depth the USMNT has at that position.

The depth at defensive midfield extends beyond the trio of Adams, Cardoso, and Tessman. Aidan Morris has put himself into the conversation after putting in consistent performances for Middlesbrough in the English Championship last season. He was also solid in USMNT friendlies last fall and should be on the radar.

Aidan Morris captained Middlesbrough in their preseason match yesterday. Pay no attention to the score - they were up 3-1 in the 60th then subbed off some good players, including him. He was dominant. Let's hope the new manager leans into him as a leader. #Crew96 https://t.co/gXH3Ur0xrx

Luca de la Torre could also be part of the conversation. A loan move to MLS in the prime of his career was a questionable move, but he proved to be an industrious and useful midfielder throughout the Gold Cup. He could serve in a variety of roles for the USMNT, including an option as a double-pivot alongside Adams or Cardoso. Keep in mind that de la Torre was on the 2022 World Cup roster despite not playing in the tournament and has 31 international caps, so he does bring experience to the table.

Digging even deeper into the USMNT depth at this position, the likes of Sean Zawadzki, Emeka Eneli, and Lennard Maloney could also be considered long shots to make the World Cup roster. All three have at least one international appearance, and if any of them can stand out over the next several months, Pochettino could consider including them.

Outside of an injury, Adams and Cardoso are poised to be the USMNT's workhorses in the defensive midfield at the World Cup. Further depth at that position is likely to be provided by Tessman, with Morris having a chance to earn his way onto the roster as well. However, taking any additional defensive midfielders seems unlikely. The good news is the U.S. appears to have enough depth at this position, just in case injuries pop up between now and the World Cup.

EXCLUSIVE: GOAL sat down with the American teenager to discuss his soccer journey, career aspirations and unique flow

Ask about Mathis Albert and it quickly becomes apparent that everyone, no matter who they are, has a story. Whether they met him as a kid in Los Angeles or at this summer's Club World Cup, just about everyone can remember the first time they ran into him.

More accurately, they remember the first time he ran by someone in their presence. That's usually how these stories begin.

Just 16 years old, Albert might be the brightest prospect in American soccer. He was the youngest player at this summer's Club World Cup, where he joined Borussia Dortmund in the latest show of faith from the German giants. He's part of a rising generation of American teenagers looking to make their mark, both at home and in Europe. He's a super-talented new-age winger, defined by being both willing and able to absolutely embarrass the guy on the other side - no matter who they are or how impressive their resume.

But, most of all, Albert is a teenager who - despite the impact he's already left on soccer people all over the world - is still just navigating this weird life of his. Just a few years ago, he was a torturing anyone who got in his way at UCLA pickup games.

Now, he's meeting Kylian Mbappe postgame while looking to follow in the footsteps of the best the game has to offer. Can Albert get to that level someday? No one can be sure. Those who know these sorts of things, though, believe the ceiling is unlimited.

So what's the secret? What magic does Albert has? The answer is complicated. It's a combination of talent and work ethic, both of which were repeatedly brought up by anyone who has crossed his path. The other ingredient? Confidence, swagger, a unique faith in both himself and the world around him, which allows him to continuously try things that he has no business trying.

""My goal in every training and every game is to just go,"" he tells GOAL. ""I don't think too much. I just do whatever and, if I mess up, I just do it again. If you keep messing up, doesn't matter, just have fun. I think that's one of my best traits. To this day, it doesn't matter how big or strong you are because I'm just going to do whatever and I hope and I think it will work.

""If I feel that, then it probably will work. That's what develops your confidence over time.""

That confidence is still developing and Albert, as a player and a person, is still blossoming. So how did he get here and what's next?

GOAL spoke to Albert and those who have worked with him to learn more about a player who might just be Dortmund's next American star.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Sports Business Reporter


	After streaming FIFA's first reformatted Club World Cup around the globe in a $1 billion tie-up, DAZN is hoping to maintain its momentum in the U.S. with a focus on Hispanic viewers.


	DAZN streamed 63 matches for free in Spanish and English, providing commentary in 17 languages in total. Viewers watched 12.2 billion minutes of action on DAZN's platform, across “tens of millions of unique devices,” the company said. 


	It also sublicensed a series of matches to TNT Sports, which reached 11.4 million viewers on linear TV across 24 matches, alongside international linear partners. Bleacher Report content was seen by 350 million people across platforms, TNT Sports said. Coverage of the final, in which England's Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain, 3-0, averaged 1.3 million U.S. viewers. 

	











	While the Club World Cup was playing out, DAZN finalized U.S. deals for Spanish-language streams of 38 UEFA Champions league matches and every Serie A match from Italy, starting this season. DAZN will also continue airing marquee boxing matches, including a bout between Dillian Whyte and Moses Itauma on Saturday.


	“We also have some ambitious plans around original programming,” DAZN U.S. president and global chief revenue officer Walker Jacobs said in an interview. “We want to really sort of lean in and double down on the momentum from the Club World Cup and from FIFA.”


	DAZN is now looking to build deeper relationships with the millions of new connections it has around the world, as those touchpoints make the streamer more valuable to rightsholders looking to grow their international footprint. The NHL, for instance, recently inked a deal to distribute NHL.TV via DAZN in nearly 200 countries. DAZN boasted more than 300 million regular viewers globally in 2024.


	In the U.S., the new soccer rights will largely be kept behind DAZN's paywall. But the company is open to other distribution opportunities to expand its audience, starting with leveraging its social reach and potentially including more free streams. Its soccer-focused social footprint grew 66% over the summer, Jacobs said. 

	











	“One of the things that makes our company successful and an exciting place to work is that we are opportunistic,” Jacobs said, “and we don't set really rigid boundaries that we need to stay within.”


	DAZN rolled out several features for the Club World Cup, including a virtual reality viewership mode within Meta Quest devices. It's open to serving as a streaming service for a traditional media company that doesn't have similar capabilities, or co-bidding on upcoming rights, Jacobs said.


	Top-tier sports rights have become increasingly difficult to acquire in the U.S. as the biggest tech companies in the world—from Apple and Amazon to Google's YouTube—became regular suitors. But DAZN, while expanding around the world, intends to stay in the American game. 


	“We have a lot of discipline around making sure that what we're buying is strategic and aligns with our vision, and that the economics makes sense and that it fits in with the overall consumer value proposition of DAZN,” Jacobs said. “But continuing to grow English language and continuing to add to our programming—both on the original and studio show side, as well as social originals, as well as live rights—is an area where you're going to see a lot of continued interest on our part.”

There was a point in Chelsea's 2024-25 season where manager Enzo Maresca looked to be teetering on the brink. Towards the end of the campaign, fans weren't happy with the Italian's timid style of play and they were in danger of missing out on Champions League football. How things have changed since then.

The Blues enjoyed a strong finish to the season as they won five of their last six matches to ensure they came fourth. Then Maresca rounded things off by winning the UEFA Conference League.

And if that wasn't enough, they went on to be crowned world champions by winning the new-look Club World Cup in the U.S., thumping Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final. Suddenly, the sky seems like the limit for the Blues.

They've pocketed an eye-watering prize of around £97m for winning the competition and put it to good use by making a total of eight signings, including a handful that could have a real impact on the first team.

It's been a turbulent few years for the club, who have been through six managers since American owner Todd Boehly succeeded the popular Roman Abramovich at Stamford Bridge, but they finally look to have found their footing with Maresca.

The Italian is a disciple of Pep Guardiola's and he has certainly followed his blueprint in terms of playing intricate passing football, as well as backing it up by winning silverware.

Chelsea have a real shot of challenging high up the table, especially after spending well with a handful of impressive new recruits, with even more possibly on the way — though Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City will give them stiff competition.

Chelsea are in strange territory because they clearly have a long-term plan. You only need to see the seven and eight-year deals they hand every signing. Maresca said last season he was not expected to deliver Champions League football last season and he did it. That means they're ahead of schedule.

Winning two trophies in the same season on top of that wasn't in the script either, and the Italian may have inadvertently increased the expectations for himself. Finishing in the top four (or five if that's still enough for a Champions League place) will certainly be the minimum expectation for Chelsea now, anything less will be considered a disappointment.

Chelsea will also want to continue their momentum by delivering another trophy to add to their ever-growing trophy cabinet. The club's social media channels proudly declared: “We've won it all” after they clinched the Club World Cup, but that doesn't mean they'll be satisfied to stop here.

So a realistic expectation for Maresca's Chelsea this season would be top four/five and a trophy to boot, though lifting the Premier League and Champions League might be a little bit too ambitious. Winning either the Carabao Cup or FA Cup is much more feasible.

The key for Chelsea will be finding some consistency. Last season they dropped too many previous points against teams in the bottom of the table.

Fans were fuming over relegated Ipswich getting four points against them this season, while they were also beaten at home by Fulham. Getting better results at Stamford Bridge will be a priority after they dropped points in a total of eight matches at home last season.

Chelsea have the fourth-shortest odds to win the Premier League with Betfair this season after being given odds of 9/4. That shows the uphill task the Blues face to keep pace with the likes of Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City.



They have been given odds of 3/1 to finish in the top two, while they are at 4/7 to finish in the top four this season. Finishing in the top five is much shorter at 2/7.

Chelsea have been given odds of 2/1 to win any of the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup or League Cup and 40/1 to win any of the two cups other than the league title.

Chelsea have shown they mean business in this window and their dealings could even put them in title contention. There's no doubt about the club's ambitions after making eight transfers this summer — with a focus on youth.

Their oldest signing so far is 23-year-old João Pedro from Brighton, who arrived for a £60m fee. He already scored three crucial goals for Chelsea in the Club World Cup, two in the semi and one in the final. The Brazilian scored 10 goals and grabbed six assists in the Premier League last season and should be a valuable addition in attack.

He's not the only attacking star that's arrived. Liam Delap joined in a £30m deal from Ipswich and will add to their options up front alongside the likes of Nicolas Jackson and Christopher Nkunku.

Maresca has also been bolstered with additions of wingers Jamie Gittens from Dortmund — costing around £53m — and 18-year-old Brazilian prodigy Estêvão, who is being tipped to achieve huge things.

New centre-back Jorrel Hato, who is just 19, has also arrived to give the team more options in defence, which should be useful considering how injury prone Wesley Fofana has been.

He's not the only youngster to join the Blues this summer. Midfielder Dário Essugo has joined from Sporting Lisbon for around £18.5m while they have also signed 18-year-old Kendry Páez from Independiente del Valle in Ecuador and Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg, but he has gone back to the club on loan.

Chelsea have been enjoying a three-week break since their Club World Cup triumph but are now preparing for an opening Premier League clash at home to Crystal Palace on August 17.

They'll then travel to West Ham on August 22 before welcoming Fulham at home on the 30th, with a trip to Brentford after the international break on September 13 to make it four London derbies to open the season.

Their first big test comes against Manchester United away on September 20 before facing Liverpool at home on October 4.

Joao Neves will miss Paris Saint-Germain's Super Cup clash with Tottenham following his red card in the Club World Cup final.

Spurs and PSG will face off in the one-off clash between the between the reigning Champions League and Europa League winners at the Stadio Friuli in Udine, Italy on Wednesday.

The showdown will be new head coach Thomas Frank's first competitive game in charge of the north London side.

It will also mark the Dane's first taste of European football following his arrival from Brentford in June, and he has already been handed a huge boost.

European champions PSG will be without key midfielder Neves after he earned himself a two-match suspension in their last outing.

In the Club World Cup final in July, the Portuguese star was sent off late in the French side's 3-0 defeat to Chelsea for a pull on Marc Cucurella's hair following a VAR review.

This was the first red card of Neves' career, and will also see him miss PSG's Ligue 1 opener against Nantes on Sunday.

According to RMC Sports insider Fabrice Hawkins, the French giants have worked around the 20-year-old's absence, putting together a tailored training programme for him since starting their pre-season.

With last season's extended schedule and the Club World Cup in the United States, PSG postponed their players' holiday period, and only resumed training on August 6.

As a result, Luis Enrique's team are yet to play a warm-up match ahead of the new season, and will return to action in the Super Cup.

And they will be looking to make the perfect start to the season by landing silverware, especially after enjoying huge success last term.

On top of winning a fourth straight Ligue 1 title, the Parisians finally captured their elusive first Champions League title in May.

PSG dismantled Inter Milan with a thumping 5-0 win, thanks to goals from Desire Doue, Achraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelai and Senny Mayulu.

Neves also played a significant role, as he started in the historic triumph before being substituted in the 84th minute.

His absence is sure to be felt against Tottenham, having been a mainstay in the PSG midfield throughout all of last season.

The Portugal star was pivotal in the 2024/25 campaign, making 59 appearances altogether and registering seven goals and 10 assists.

Spurs will certainly be looking to take advantage of Neves' suspension, as they head into the clash as underdogs.

They booked their spot in the Super Cup by winning the Europa League with a 1-0 victory over Manchester United under previous head coach Ange Postecoglou.

But with the Australian later being dismissed following a poor Premier League campaign and replaced by Frank, the final represents the perfect chance for the 51-year-old make his mark.

Speaking ahead of the final, Spurs' new boss admitted his side face a huge challenge, and urged his players to draw on their previous final experience as they eye up more silverware.

Frank told UEFA.com: ""We're playing in a final - it's fantastic. 

""Hopefully we can use some of the experience we have from the last final that the team played against Manchester United. 

""[Paris] are the best team in Europe. They won the treble and it looks like they are extremely strong in all 11 starting positions.

""It's a fantastic challenge to have in the first game but, of course, we believe in ourselves. We're going to a final and there will be one objective – try to win it. 

""We don't see it as a test; we see it as two good teams against each other, and we want to win.""

...

Former Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has backed the new-look Club World Cup and said that the players' high salaries are one reason why clubs have to participate in such events.

Rummenigge told Monday's edition of Kicker sports magazine that he doesn't want to ""dramatise"" the additional burden for players at the event held recently in the United States.

""As a player I would have been happy to take part in such a tournament. Of course the Club World Cup means more games in that season but you must also say: This tournament is only every four years,"" the Bayern board member said.

""And many players – together with their advisors – have contributed to this situation. They are demanding ever higher salaries, forcing clubs to tap into additional sources of income. That's why new formats are emerging.

""On the other hand, I see little willingness to take a pay cut. That's a contradiction that needs to be clearly addressed.""

The Club World Cup offered an overall prize money of around $1 billion. Bayern reached the quarter-finals of the 32-team event won by England's Chelsea, which replaced the Confederations Cup for national teams which was in the past held every four years.

Rummenigge said that the Club World Cup was good for Bayern's visibility abroad and that shirt sales rose seven-fold in the US. He also spoke of good TV ratings in Germany despite plenty of criticism in the run-up.

""Many of our national team players would otherwise have played in the Confed Cup in the USA – without any added value for the club,"" he said.

""Now FC Bayern has been able to showcase itself on the world stage, gain new fans and also benefit financially. It pays to think outside the box from time to time.

""I really enjoyed the competition and watched almost all of the matches,"" Rummenigge said.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Sports Business Reporter


	After streaming FIFA's first reformatted Club World Cup around the globe in a $1 billion tie-up, DAZN is hoping to maintain its momentum in the U.S. with a focus on Hispanic viewers.


	DAZN streamed 63 matches for free in Spanish and English, providing commentary in 17 languages in total. Viewers watched 12.2 billion minutes of action on DAZN's platform, across “tens of millions of unique devices,” the company said. 


	It also sublicensed a series of matches to TNT Sports, which reached 11.4 million viewers on linear TV across 24 matches, alongside international linear partners. Bleacher Report content was seen by 350 million people across platforms, TNT Sports said. Coverage of the final, in which England's Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain, 3-0, averaged 1.3 million U.S. viewers. 

	











	While the Club World Cup was playing out, DAZN finalized U.S. deals for Spanish-language streams of 38 UEFA Champions league matches and every Serie A match from Italy, starting this season. DAZN will also continue airing marquee boxing matches, including a bout between Dillian Whyte and Moses Itauma on Saturday.


	“We also have some ambitious plans around original programming,” DAZN U.S. president and global chief revenue officer Walker Jacobs said in an interview. “We want to really sort of lean in and double down on the momentum from the Club World Cup and from FIFA.”


	DAZN is now looking to build deeper relationships with the millions of new connections it has around the world, as those touchpoints make the streamer more valuable to rightsholders looking to grow their international footprint. The NHL, for instance, recently inked a deal to distribute NHL.TV via DAZN in nearly 200 countries. DAZN boasted more than 300 million regular viewers globally in 2024.


	In the U.S., the new soccer rights will largely be kept behind DAZN's paywall. But the company is open to other distribution opportunities to expand its audience, starting with leveraging its social reach and potentially including more free streams. Its soccer-focused social footprint grew 66% over the summer, Jacobs said. 

	











	“One of the things that makes our company successful and an exciting place to work is that we are opportunistic,” Jacobs said, “and we don't set really rigid boundaries that we need to stay within.”


	DAZN rolled out several features for the Club World Cup, including a virtual reality viewership mode within Meta Quest devices. It's open to serving as a streaming service for a traditional media company that doesn't have similar capabilities, or co-bidding on upcoming rights, Jacobs said.


	Top-tier sports rights have become increasingly difficult to acquire in the U.S. as the biggest tech companies in the world—from Apple and Amazon to Google's YouTube—became regular suitors. But DAZN, while expanding around the world, intends to stay in the American game. 


	“We have a lot of discipline around making sure that what we're buying is strategic and aligns with our vision, and that the economics makes sense and that it fits in with the overall consumer value proposition of DAZN,” Jacobs said. “But continuing to grow English language and continuing to add to our programming—both on the original and studio show side, as well as social originals, as well as live rights—is an area where you're going to see a lot of continued interest on our part.”

As volunteer applications open Monday, FIFA organizers here are looking to fill more than 5,000 spots, with a main hub coming to the Fashion District. 

FIFA announced an open call for volunteers ahead of next summer's men's World Cup on Monday, and with Philly as a host city, it will again need to rally one of the largest contingents of support. 

Those interested can pick where they'd like to support the tournament by applying at fifaworldcup.com/volunteers. According to a release, FIFA will invite selected applicants to its volunteer team tryouts, expected to begin in October, with additional training to continue in March 2026.

FIFA anticipates that it will need close to 65,000 volunteers across 11 host cities in the United States, as well as five additional cities in Canada and Mexico. All three nations will host the World Cup from June 11 to July 19. Mexico City is slated to host the first game of the tournament on June 11. Lincoln Financial Field will host its first of six scheduled matches on June 14. 

According to FIFA, volunteers must be 18 or older at the time they apply. They must commit to a minimum of eight shifts during the tournament or before the official starting date. They also must speak English and agree to a background review. 

FIFA World Cup 26 Philadelphia, the collective that is planning events ahead of the tournament, has been involved in opening its volunteer center in the Fashion District along Market Street, also known as the old Gallery complex. The group expects it to be the hub for the nearly 5,000 volunteers it will need before, during, and after the tournament. 

In addition to match-day services, volunteers will be expected to fill roles across 23 facets, which include work at training sites and concierge services at hotels, airports, etc. FIFA World Cup 26 Philly localized its information for volunteers at phillyfwc26.com/volunteer. 

“Hosting the FIFA World Cup 26™ is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for our city, and volunteers will play a critical role in ensuring Philadelphia shines on the global stage,” said Alison Grove, senior director of strategy, operations, and partnerships for FIFA Philly 26. “Whether you're a lifelong soccer fan or simply proud to represent Philadelphia, this is your chance to create a truly unforgettable fan experience for visitors from around the world. We're calling on the community to answer the call, get involved, and be part of history.” 

Philadelphia will host its matches across the group and knockout stages. This summer, the region received a litmus test courtesy of FIFA's Club World Cup, which saw the Linc host eight matches over three weeks. 

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” Gianni Infantino, FIFA's president, said in a release. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament, and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event. We hope interested individuals will join us as we welcome the world to North America in 2026.”

One of those volunteers in Philly-based digital marketer Agatha Nothem, served during the Club World Cup and chronicled her experience on her Instagram page and shared with Philadelphia Soccer 2026. 

“Volunteering at the Club World Cup here in Philly was incredible,” Nothem said via Instagram. “It felt like I was a part of something bigger … you'll never forget the experience.”","{'href': 'https://www.inquirer.com', 'title': 'Inquirer.com'}","soccer"

FIFA today launched the application process for the FIFA World Cup 26™ volunteer programme. This once-in-a-generation community of volunteers will help bring to life a tournament uniting three countries and billions of hearts around the world.

With around 65,000 volunteers expected to participate, the FIFA World Cup 26™ Volunteer Community will be the largest volunteer programme for a FIFA event to date. Given the expanded 48-team format and activity across 16 Host Cities over the course of six weeks, the FIFA Volunteer Community – now one million members strong and growing – will be called on to join in support of the biggest FIFA World Cup yet. Volunteers will provide support across 23 functional areas at official and non-official sites such as stadiums, training sites, airports, hotels and more.

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” said FIFA President Gianni Infantino. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event. We hope interested individuals will join us as we welcome the world to North America in 2026.”

With millions expected to attend the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States, FIFA is looking for passionate and enthusiastic volunteers to help make this FIFA World Cup an unforgettable experience for all.

Boston 25 Now



BOSTON — The Boston Host Committee for the FIFA World Cup 2026 announced Monday that it's seeking thousands of volunteers to apply to be part of one of the world's most iconic sporting events.

As one of 16 Host Cities across North America, Boston will welcome the FIFA World Cup to Boston (Gillette) Stadium in Foxboro and the Greater Boston area next summer for seven matches, including one quarter-final game. 

Volunteers will play a crucial and critical role in delivering an unforgettable experience for fans, teams, media, and officials from around the globe, according to the Boston Host Committee.

“Boston is one of the most historic and influential cities in America, and hosting the FIFA World Cup will be another landmark moment for our city,” Mike Loynd, CEO of FIFA World Cup 26 Boston, said in a statement. “We're thrilled to invite our community to be part of history and show the world the pride, passion, and spirit that define Boston.”

The volunteers are needed to fill a variety of roles, with opportunities available across Boston, Foxboro, and other key locations before and during the tournament. 

Applicants must be at least 18 years old and able to commit to eight shifts between June 11, 2026, and July 19, 2026.

Tsitsipas – Bonzi: 11.08.2025 20:00 CEST
H2H: 3-0

Stefanos Tsitsipas has lost four of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, Tsitsipas was upset by O'Connell in the opening round. This week in Cincinnati, the Greek defeated Marozsan in the opening round in straight sets. He was great under pressure, saving all three breakpoints.

Benjamin Bonzi has lost three of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, the Frenchman defeated Arnaldi in the opening round in three tight sets. After losing the opening set 6-7, Bonzi turned the match around after playing for three hours. In the second round, he upset Musetti in three tight sets.

According to the bookies, Bonzi is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. He had two great matches this week in Cincinnati and will be confident coming into this match. On the other hand, Tsitsipas struggled with his form throughout the whole season. We expect a tight match that could go either way.

That being said, Bonzi covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Benjamin Bonzi +2.5 games handicap @2.00 @bet365

Sinner – Diallo: 12.08.2025 01:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Jannik Sinner has won seven straight matches. The last match he played before the ATP Cincinnati was at Wimbledon, where he defeated Alcaraz in the final in four sets. Sinner is the defending champion in Cincinnati. Last season, the Italian defeated Tiafoe in the final in straight sets. This week, he demolished Galan in the opening round in straight sets.

Gabriel Diallo has lost three of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, the Canadian lost to Fritz in the third round in straight sets. This week, Diallo defeated Baez in the opening match in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Sinner is the big favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is in great form and the best player in the world.  Diallo has no weapons to match Sinner's game. We expect Sinner to win easily once again.

That being said, Sinner covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jannik Sinner -5.5 games handicap @1.73 @bet365

Khachanov – Brooksby: Time TBA
H2H: 0-1

Karen Khachanov has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, the Russian had a great run, reaching the final. He eventually lost to Shelton in three tight sets. This week in Cincinnati. Khachanov defeated Royer in straight sets in the opening match.

Jenson Brooksby has lost four of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, the Brit has been granted a wild card. In the second round, he defeated Cazaux in straight sets comfortably.

According to the bookies, Khachanov is the big favourite in this matchup, but we disagree. He looked physically and emotionally tired in the opening match against Royer. On the other hand, Brooksby dominated against a solid opponent. We expect a tight match that could go either way.

That being said, Brooksby covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Jenson Brooksby +3.5 games handicap @1.83 @bet365

MASON, OH − The singles field at the Cincinnati Open is getting noticeably thinner as the tournament moves into its second week Aug. 11.

The Round of 32 begins Aug. 11 from the Lindner Family Tennis Center and there's no shortage of stellar matches on tap, including the No. 1 player from both the ATP and WTA.

Reigning Cincinnati Open champion and World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka matches up with No. 30 seed Emma Raducanu for the third time. Sabalenka is 2-0 in previous meetings, but their last bout was a competitive 7-6 (6), 6-4 clash on the Wimbledon grass.

ATP No. 1 Jannik Sinner is looking for a second-straight Rookwood Cup. Sinner is 38-2 on hard court this season and is a monster favorite on Center Court Aug. 11 against 23-year-old Canadian Gabriel Diallo.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time updates from the third round of the Cincinnati Open.

Felix Auger-Aliassime, the ATP No. 23 seed, is through to the Round of 16 after his opponent, France's Arthur Rinderknech, retired in the second set. Auger-Aliassime won the opening set 7-6 (4) and was leading 4-2 in the second.

Holger Rune has now reached the Round of 16 in back-to-back ATP 1000 events after a 7-6 (4), 6-3 win over American Alex Michelsen.

Jessica Bouzas Maneiro has now won 10 of her last 12 matches after taking out American wild card Taylor Townsend on Center Court.

Maneiro is one victory away from back-to-back WTA 1000 quarterfinals appearances after going 4-1 in the Canadian Open.

Ekaterina Alexandrova, the WTA No. 12 seed, is in the Round of 16 after an efficient 6-4, 6-3 victory over Maya Joint of Australia.

Alexandrova, the WTA No. 16, dished out seven aces to reach the Round of 16 for the first time in Cincinnati. She was previously 0-3 in the Round of 32 with losses in 2019, 2020 and 2022.

The seventh day of the Cincinnati Open has started from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

Wild card Taylor Townsend, the WTA No. 1 in doubles, is looking for another Cincinnati Open run (Round of 16 in 2024) in singles. She leads Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 3-2 in the first set on Center Court.

ATP No. 7 seed Holger Rune is on the Grandstand Court against No. 28 seed Alex Michelsen. Rune trails, 4-3, in the first set.

There are four Americans ranked in the WTA Top 10. Two of them won Aug. 10 (Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula) while Madison Keys (No. 6) and Amanda Anisimova (No. 8) will take the court Aug. 11.

The doubles bracket continues with both Cincinnati natives Caty McNally and Peyton Stearns in action Aug. 11.

Three years ago, it looked like Felix Auger-Aliassime was on his way to establishing himself as a top-10 talent on the ATP Tour. 

The Montreal native went to the semifinals at the 2021 US Open, won four titles in 2022, and was runner-up to Taylor Fritz at the ATP Finals at the end of the season.

Auger-Aliassime ended the 2022 campaign ranked as the No. 6 player in the world, and he was considered one of the sport's most promising young talents.

These days, Auger-Aliassime is known as a cautionary tale about how quickly things can change in the world of tennis.

Auger-Aliassime's career has been defined by inconsistent play and disappointing results in big tournaments. 

The 25-year-old has been eliminated in the first or second round in 10 of the last 13 Grand Slams, and he's just 2-5 this season at Masters 1000 events.

Auger-Aliassime has an opportunity to buck that trend at the Cincinnati Open, where he's a chunky -250 favorite over Arthur Rinderknech in the Round of 32.

The issue is that nothing is ever straightforward with Auger-Aliassime these days.

The same can be said of Rinderknech, who is in the midst of a bizarre stretch of tennis that saw him beat No. 3 Alexander Zverev in Round 1 of Wimbledon and No. 13 Casper Ruud last round in Cincinnati. In between, he lost back-to-back matches against players outside the top 100 in July.

It's impossible to predict what will happen when either of these players steps onto a tennis court right now, but only one of them is a -250 favorite.

Nine's Wide World of Sports

Billionaire heiress and eighth seed Emma Navarro has been stunningly sent packing from the Cincinnati Open, upset by German qualifier Ella Seidel in three sets on Monday morning (AEST).

After two hours and 10 minutes, Seidel prevailed 6-4, 1-6, 6-4 to progress to the third round.

Ranked world No.125 and competing in her first WTA 1000 tournament, Seide progressed through the qualifying rounds to book her place in the main draw for the tune-up tournament for the US Open.

In the first set, Seidel broke with her first opportunity, going up 5-4 before saving several break points against her to take the set 6-4.

But Navarro responded in the second set, claiming the first five consecutive games to take the set comfortably.

With all the momentum going into the deciding set, it seemed that the local would be the one to go for the victory.

Navarro led 4-1, 30-15 in the final set before capitulating, losing five games in a row.

The win marks Seidel's first win against a top-20 player.

The loss is a huge blow to Navarro, whose billionaire father, Ben Navarro, has invested more than $300 million in this tournament.

Through his private investment firm, Beemok Capital, Ben Navarro purchased the tournament in October 2022 and recently funded significant upgrades to the venue and its facilities for players and spectators.

Navarro and her sister Margaret also lost their doubles match together on Sunday.

Ben Navarro also owns the Charleston Open.

With another early elimination, Navarro is struggling to find form after returning to hardcourts. She will arrive at the US Open with only one win and three defeats.

Seidel will face another American in McCartney Kessler, in the third round at the Lindner Family Tennis Centre in Mason, Ohio.

Fellow American heiress Jessica Pegula advanced after securing a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Australian Kimberly Birrell.

Coco Gauff is back to winning ways on the court at the Cincinnati Open, but now faces a tricky rematch against Dayana Yastremska.

Gauff and Yastremska met in the first round of Wimbledon last month, where the Ukrainian pulled off a stunning upset.

Yastremska loved playing against Gauff, who she beat 7-6(7-3), 6-1 less than a month after the American won the French Open.

A rematch between the pair has now been served up in the third round of the Cincinnati Open, the latest event on the WTA Tour.

Gauff has set up the clash after defeating Wang Xinyu 6-3, 6-2 in her opener, having received a bye in round one.

And while Wimbledon will undoubtedly be on the back of her mind going into the match, the world number two will be eager to completely put those memories behind her with a win this time around.

Speaking ahead of the match, she said: “I don't ever think of revenge-type tennis. At first I used to think like that but then I am like I have to play too many people too many times to have a revenge mindset.

“I think for me it's a good measure to see where my game is. I thought that Wimbledon match was a tough loss for me and I don't think I approached it well.

“I always have trouble against her, she is a tough opponent, great ball striker who can pull winners out of anywhere.

“So it will be a tough test for me, especially having to play her again, but I think I have had more time to work on things in the hard court season and I definitely think it's a better surface than grass for me.

“So it's going to be a tough match but I am looking forward to it and hopefully I can do better than Wimby.”

Gauff was under immense pressure arriving at the All England Club, having only just beaten Aryna Sabalenka in Paris.

That stunning victory represented her second Grand Slam title, and indeed her second Grand Slam final win over Sabalenka.

But early signs of a potential Wimbledon flop were apparent not long after, as Gauff lost her opener to Wang in Berlin.

She then suffered the same fate against Yastremska at Wimbledon, and has since lost in the round of 16 at the Canadian Open.

That defeat came against eventual champion Victoria Mboko, who also shocked the likes of Elena Rybakina and Naomi Osaka en route to the trophy.

Gauff did, however, manage to clinch silverware in Montreal, winning the doubles event alongside McCartney Kessler.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Eight pairs have qualified via their combined rankings, and Rune (No. 9 in the world) and Anisimova (No. 8 in the world) made the cut without any difficulty. The Danish tennis star is optimistic ahead of the new Grand Slam initiative.

""We talked a bit and agreed that she will take care of the base line, and then I will take the net. I have seen both her forehand and backhand, and she has a lot of power, which is beneficial for me. And she has great hands, so I think we have a good chance.""

""I won't say too much, but I believe that we can play some good doubles tennis together"", says Rune to the Tennis Channel.

The US Open mixed doubles tournament will be held this year on 19/20 August  preceding the start of the US Open on 24 August. Rune and Anisimova were for a while just outside the group of eight couples who could qualify directly for the US Open's new mixed doubles initiative but thanks to Anisimova's Wimbledon campaign she moved up the rankings. 

""I saw her play at Wimbledon, and it's actually a lot of fun, that I said already at Queens that she would win Wimbledon. And then she went all the way to the final. It's fantastic to be allowed to share the court with her"", says Rune.

Eight pairs have qualified for the mixed tournament, while eight wildcards will also be awarded. The following pairs are qualified via the combined ranking:

It was a match Raducanu was wishing she could play again.

It's like a fact-finding match so you can see where you are in comparison to the top. I also think form fluctuates so much on the day, so you can lose 2&1 one day, and you could make it close the next day. It can be down to a few points. I'm excited either way. Aryna is world No. 1, so it'll be an exciting match and a good experience. Emma Raducanu on facing Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati

“I would say I thought, ‘I would love to have another crack at that, on grass, tomorrow,'” Raducanu said with a laugh after her own opening win against Olga Danilovic. “But I know and I'm honestly reasonable enough and honest enough with myself to know that different surfaces favor different people and where my game is at in comparison.“I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage, but we'll see how it goes [on hard courts].”Sabalenka has indeed been one of the best players on hard courts since winning her first of two Australian Open titles in 2023. The top seed captured her first US Open title last summer after first storming to the Cincinnati title, but Raducanu has proven her mettle on concrete, winning the 2021 US Open as a qualifier.The years that followed for Raducanu were riddled by physical setbacks and multiple surgeries. Now healthy and flanked by a strong team, one that recently added former Rafael Nadal coach Francisco Roig, the 22-year-old has slowly climbed back up the rankings from an April 2024 low of No. 303.

“It's important being seeded at these tournaments,” said Raducanu, the No. 30 seed in Cincinnati. “At Masters, you get a bye, which helps a lot. Then at the Slams, you avoid playing a top seed in the first round. Equally, with the stage that I'm at with my tennis and my development right now, it's about just improving the overall level and feeling I have on court, not having holes as much, I think that's my main priority.“I know there will be a time where I'll be targeting big tournaments, Masters, and Slams. Right now, that's not my goal. My goal is to improve as a player.”Sabalenka took note of some of those improvements first hand at SW19, the top seed praising the Brit ahead of their third-round rematch.“She played incredible tennis,” said Sabalenka. “I'm super happy to see her mentally and physically back. She'll definitely be back in Top 10 very soon.”Both Sabalenka and Raducanu plan to embrace the meeting as a challenge. But for the latter, it's more of a litmus test.

My goal is to improve as a player.”Sabalenka took note of some of those improvements first hand at SW19, the top seed praising the Brit ahead of their third-round rematch.“She played incredible tennis,” said Sabalenka. “I'm super happy to see her mentally and physically back. She'll definitely be back in Top 10 very soon.”Both Sabalenka and Raducanu plan to embrace the meeting as a challenge. But for the latter, it's more of a litmus test.

Sabalenka leads their head-to-head 2-0, but Raducanu played Sabalenka tough over two sets at Wimbledon last month.

“It's like a fact-finding match,” she mused, “so you can see where you are in comparison to the top. I also think form fluctuates so much on the day, so you can lose 2&1 one day, and you could make it close the next day. It can be down to a few points. I'm excited either way. Aryna is world No. 1, so it'll be an exciting match and a good experience.”For one who has ready achieved so much, Raducanu is proud to take on an underdog role, perhaps as a means of reducing pressure but also nodding to the reality that this is effectively her first full season as a healthy top tier player.“It was great to have had a bye so we can actually get two days of training,” she said of her early work with Roig. “That was really crucial, to be honest. Other than that, in the last few months, I haven't actually had many training weeks because I've been doing better in tournaments, which is a great thing. I actually find that my level improves more with practice than it does with playing matches. Playing matches, you get better at playing big points, you get more match fit. But I think actual quality and level improves with practice.”The combination of Sabalenka's consistency with Raducanu's calm, confident approach could yield the first must-watch match of the tournament, and one that could determine who goes on to wear the crown in Queen City.

Will Raducanu exact revenge for her defeat by Sabalenka at Wimbledon?

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

Emma Raducanu is playing Aryna Sabalenka today in the third round of the Cincinnati Open. 

The British No 1 battled gamely against the world No 1 in a tight encounter on Centre Court at Wimbledon last month before succumbing to a 7-6, 6-4 defeat, and is out for revenge here. Raducanu carries reasonable form into the contest after reaching the semi-finals of the Washington Open in late July, although she was then thrashed by Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova in Montreal. 

As the 30th seed in Cincinnati, Raducanu received a bye to the second round where she met Serbia's Olga Danilovic, who beat Britain's Katie Boulter in round one. Raducanu came through in straight sets to set up this match with Sabalenka, who comfortably saw off the 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in her second-round tie.

The tournament is staged at the Lindner Family Tennis Center and is one of the 10 WTA 1000 events on the calendar. It is also considered the key tune-up before the US Open, where Raducanu won her shock grand slam title in 2021, and where Sabalenka is the reigning champion.

Follow all the latest updates below as Raducanu meets Sabalenka in Cincinnati.

Raducanu hits a lovely forehand winner on to the tramline at 30-0, whipped over the net with top-spin, and then serves it out with an ace. 

Sabalenka will serve to stay in the first set.

Sabalenka looks frustrated as she makes a couple of wild swings during her service game, but she still holds with an ace to stay on serve.

At 30-15, Raducanu throws in a loose double fault to give Sabalenka a sniff and the world No 1 earns herself a break point opportunity, but fires wide with a forehand to bring up deuce. An excellent wide serve by Raducanu gives her advantage, but she loses the next point and then follows it with another double fault. 

Sabalenka is just as erratic with her return, though, eventually firing a forehand into the net and a backhand long to give up the game.

“Relax, stay positive,” says Francis Roig repeatedly to Raducanu from courtside. 

Raducanu rushes over to speak to him at the end of the game, and she's told off by the umpire: “You cannot actively go to him.”

“I cannot hear him, the music is too loud,” Raducanu complains.

“Then he needs to speak louder,” comes the umpire's reply.

 Break! Raducanu earns two break-back points at 15-40, but loses the first with a wild forehand on the stretch. She takes the next one, though, as Sabalenka crashes a backhand into the net!

We've got a match, here.

At 15-30 down, Raducanu twice serves to the Sabalenka backhand and draws errors to avoid facing more break points. She finishes off the game with a fabulous serve which hits the corner of the service box.

Sabalenka rattles off another service game and she's in full control of this first set now.

Break! Ominous, this, as Sabalenka rattles off a series of sensational groundstrokes off both wings to break again, finished with a forehand winner. 

This is shaping up to be the most Sabalenka set, with wild swings of quality, but at her best she is almost unplayable.

A quick hold, and Sabalenka squares the scoreboard after that shaky start.

Break! Sabalenka wins her first point of the match at the 10th attempt, and then follows it with a powerful backhand winner that had some frustration in it. Raducanu misses with a backhand and Sabalenka takes the first of two break points to get quickly back on serve.

Break! This is superb from Raducanu, taking advantage of some early mistakes from Sabalenka to break to love. 

The world No 1 has not yet won a point, dumping a forehand into the net to seal the break.

Jannik Sinner has admitted Carlos Alcaraz is too good for him – at golf. The world No. 1 overcame the Spaniard in the Wimbledon final a month ago, gaining his revenge after losing to the world No. 2 in the French Open final.

The two young tennis stars look set to dominate the sport in a similar way to Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic did before them. When Sinner and Alcaraz step onto the court with each other, fireworks and breathtaking tennis are almost a guarantee. But while the duo are always leathering huge forehands and backhands past each other, the story is different when they are playing with their clubs rather than their rackets.

Despite being narrowly ahead of Alcaraz in tennis in the rankings, Sinner insists there is only one winner when they have a game of golf together.

While speaking to The Tennis Channel, Sinner offered an insight into their battles on the course together. The Italian said: “Yeah, we actually played a couple of times before the tournament. I am not a good golfer, but I love to spend time doing different things.

“Sometimes we will be talking and then it'll be, ‘Maybe now, we go, because it is not late and tomorrow we have one day off, so maybe we will play a couple of holes here' – [it was the same] also last year.



“Here is the best place to play golf. In Cincinnati there is not so much to do. We are actually lucky the golf course is there. The first hole should be straight, but on the left there are lots of cars. If one ball finishes in the car [park] then that's me [done].”

When asked if they were going to face each other in Cincinnati, Sinner quickly replied: ""No, no, no Carlos is too good for me. Me and my team is better [for me].”

At the Cincinnati Masters, Sinner has been the player who has been far too good. He opened his hard court campaign with a first round match against Daniel Elahi Galan.

The world No. 1 dominated the Colombian star, winning 96% of his 1st serve points on his way to a comprehensive 6-1, 6-1 triumph. He next faces 30th seed Gabriel Diallo of Canada in the second round.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz made hard work of beating Bosnia and Herzegovina ace Damir Dzumhur. Alcaraz won the first set with ease 6-1, but lost the second set 6-2, after Dzumhur raised his game

He would go on to regain his composure in the third and final set, winning 6-3 to move into the next round. The two-time Wimbledon winner will need to improve when he faces Hamad Medjedovic next.

                            • 2 MINUTE READ
                    

British players enjoyed a standout week in South West London at the Lexus British Pro Series Roehampton, with home players featuring in all four finals, three of which were all-British ties, in a week which demonstrated the ever-growing depth of the sport in Britain. 

The event saw a second consecutive ITF World Tennis Tour women's W35 event at the National Tennis Centre, along with a men's M25 event.

In the men's event, Wimbledon breakout star Oliver Tarvet continued his strong summer by claiming his sixth ITF singles title, and first on home soil. The number one seed reached the final without dropping a set, including in a strong semi final win over former Wimbledon Boys' champion Henry Searle, and faced fellow Brit and number two seed Paul Jubb for the title. Jubb looked all set to claim his third title of the year, taking the first set 6-4 and leading 5-2 in the second, but Tarvet managed to find another gear and roared back to win the next nine games, taking the second set 7-5, and racing into a 4-0 lead in the third. Jubb managed to get just a solitary game on the board in the final set, as Tarvet went on to secure victory 4-6 7-5 6-1.

Following his win, Tarvet will continue his rise up the rankings to a new career-high of 385, once rankings are updated

In the second all-British final of the weekend, James MacKinlay and Connor Thomson secured their first title as a pair, overcoming third seeds James Story and Matthew Summers 7-5 5-7 10-7. The title is MacKinlay's third of the year and second of the summer, having won the ATP Lexus Nottingham Challenger title in July, whilst the title is Thomson's first since an ITF M25 title with current British star Jacob Fearnley in Edgbaston in 2023.



Connor Thomson (left) and James MacKinlay (right) claimed their first title together as a pair at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton.

After claiming the women's doubles title in Roehampton the previous week, Alicia Dudeney claimed her first senior ITF singles title, defeating rising British star Hannah Klugman in Sunday's final. Dudeney enjoyed some strong performances throughout the week, coming through three-set battles against fellow Brits Emily Appleton and Brooke Black, as well as beating number one seed Tiantsoa Rajaonah, en-route to the final. Facing a confident Klugman, who came into the final having not dropped a set all week, Dudeney raced into an early lead, dominating the first set to take it 6-1. Klugman responded in the second set, and at 4-1 up looked to be taking the match to a decider, before Dudeney reeled off five games in a row, claiming the title with her first match point 6-1 6-4.

After claiming the title, Dudeney said, “I played really well and I've been building on my matches all week. Today I came out and I really tried to just play my game and I thought I did that really well.” Dudeney will be certain of a new career-high singles ranking once rankings are updated, with the 22-year-old sitting at 701 in the current live rankings. 

In the women's doubles, Naiktha Bains, along with India's Rutuja Bhosale, came out on top in a close final against American duo Mary Lewis and Brandy Walker. After losing a tight first set, Bains and Bhosale, stormed back to take it to a champions tiebreak, ultimately coming out on top 4-6 6-1 12-10.

Tournament Director Annabel Graham said, The Lexus British Pro Series Roehampton here at the National Tennis Centre was a great week of tennis. We had a strong player field across the draws, and British representation was testament to the excellent work of the LTA performance and pathways team. To have all Brits in the singles finals for the Men's and Women's and British representation in the doubles was wonderful for the spectators and tournament alike.”

International tournaments such as the Lexus British Pro Series Roehampton are part of the LTA's Performance Competitions Calendar (PCC) which provides significantly enhanced opportunities for British players at each age and stage of the performance player pathway on home soil. The calendar is designed to provide comprehensive opportunities for British players to play, earn ranking points and win prize money at home, throughout the year. This week, the action moves to Aldershot Tennis Centre, as the Hampshire venue hosts a joint ITF W35/M25 event.

MASON, Ohio — Doubles specialist you say? Not so fast.

Taylor Townsend, the 29-year-old single mom from Chicago who became the top-ranked doubles player in the world last month, advanced to the third round in singles of the Cincinnati Open after an aggressive and creative 6-2, 6-4 upset of 13th-seeded Liudmila Samsonova from that country that can't be named, otherwise known as Russia on Saturday.

Her nice two-match singles streak came to a sudden halt Monday morning, though. A lethargic Townsend was easily beat by Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, a 22-year-old Spaniard who kept Townsend out-of-rhythm to move through the third round.

Townsend had begun her journey through the draw with an intense all-American matchup over Danielle Collins  that left a frustrated Collins in tears and Townsend contemplating an interesting question.

Given a choice, Townsend was asked, would she prefer to win one singles major title or sweep the four Grand Slam doubles championships in a single year. Her quick answer was the one singles triumph. But then she stopped. “Wait,” she said, “no one has ever won all four doubles Slams in a season, right? OK, I'll take that. Something that's never been done.”

That's the unconventional Townsend at her most honest. Her tennis career has not been linear. In a time long, long ago Chicago native Townsend was the No. 1-ranked junior in the world. It didn't take an expert to notice her magnificent hand-eye coordination, her naturally easy service motion, her quick reactions on the court, her in-game savvy. Or her weight.

In 2012 there was an ugly controversy with the United States Tennis Association (USTA), when its spokesman Patrick McEnroe suggested Townsend was denied a wild card into U.S. Open qualifying, an honor almost always given the top American junior.

Without exactly saying Townsend's weight was the issue, McEnroe said the USTA asked Townsend to sit out the U.S. Open junior tournament besides denying her wild card request. “Our concern is for her long-term development,” McEnroe said at the time. “We have one goal in mind: for her to be playing in Arthur Ashe Stadium in the main draw and competing for major titles when it's time.”

Lindsay Davenport, another top-ranked junior who struggled with her weight as a teenager plus Serena Williams and Martina Navratilova all vocally criticized the USTA and Townsend quit her USTA coaches, choosing to train with 1990 Wimbledon finalist Zina Garrison.

Ever since, Townsend has gone her own way. She moved from Chicago to Atlanta to be coached by the father of Donald Young, another Chicago junior protégé. She had a son, Adyn Aubrey, four years ago, and she's proud Adyn has already picked up a racket and is a lefty like his mom.

When you watch Townsend play tennis, it is with wonder. Her hands are soft. You can imagine her catching baseball line drives with ease. She has impeccable instincts at the net, so good it brings to mind John McEnroe and his creative net game. Her excellence in doubles has given her the ability to confound opponents with a serve that she places well and that has various spins and curves.

And she isn't afraid to promote herself in ways beyond tennis. Being the best women's doubles player in the world wasn't enough to get Townsend a clothing contract so she unveiled her own line of apparel at this year's French Open, in collaboration with Alexander Julian.

In Paris, Townsend said, “I'm No. 2 in the world in doubles and still don't have a clothing sponsor. This is just the start.” Her outfits now have the logo TT and they fit her sturdy, athletic body perfectly.

Townsend is only the 13th American to be the top-ranked women's doubles player, a statistic that makes Townsend smile.

Her superior conditioning was in evidence Saturday afternoon. At every changeover Samsonava was wrapped in ice towels and packets so that she resembled a mummy and the Russian who was a Wimbledon quarterfinalist this year, left the court after losing the first set to change clothes and presumably enjoy a little air conditioning. Townsend stayed on the court, walking around and talking to her coach and seemed to be barely sweating.

Here in Mason, Townsend is seeded No. 3 in doubles with partner Zhang Shuai, a 36-year-old from China. It is always musical partners in tennis doubles. Shuai has won two doubles majors, both with partner Samantha Stosur, an Australian who once won the U.S. Open singles title.

Townsend won Wimbledon in 2024 and the 2025 Australian Open with Katerina Siniakova and overall has eight WTA Tour doubles championships. She made it to the finals of the 2022 U.S. Open with Cincinnati's Caty McNally. Siniakova, of the Czech Republic and who has 30 career doubles titles, chose not to play her since she wouldn't be in the singles draw.

But if Townsend continues to play with the confidence she showed in her wins over Collins and Samsonava, she may be playing singles more than she expected at the U.S. Open. Townsend finished her first-set win over Samsonava with an emphatic ace, her sixth of the set, and won on her first match point with a satisfying service winner at 40-15. It was her third service winner in that final game, evidence of her confidence and maturity.

But Monday for Townsend who is ranked 75th, the 50th-ranked, Spaniard Jessica Bouzas Maniero, continued her solid play her. She came isoff her own upset of 21st-seeded Canadian Leylah Fernandez who was a finalist at the 2021 U.S. Open to get to Townsend. So there will be no singles and doubles titles here for Townsend. Maybe one day.","{'href': 'https://www.cincinnati.com', 'title': 'Cincinnati Enquirer'}","tennis"

Ben Shelton had an earlier night than expected at the Cincinnati Open Sunday when Camilo Ugo Carabelli retired early in the second set with a knee injury.

Competing just three days after winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Toronto, Shelton was leading 6-3, 3-1 after 64 minutes when the Argentine retired.

“It's definitely not easy to play a couple of days after winning a title,” said Shelton, when told that the Canada champion had not won his Cincinnati opener since 2021. “I feel for Camilo and it's obviously not the way that you want to go through. I hope that he has a quick recovery.

“I'm just excited for the opportunity to play here in Cincinnati. This is the tournament where I had a big breakthrough and one that I never want to miss.”








Ugo Carabelli grasped his knee on the first point of the fourth game of the second set after an awkward movement coming forward into the court. After a medical timeout he could not move freely and retired after completing Shelton's service game.

Shelton, 22, next faces Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut.

Karen Khachanov, who fell to Shelton in a third-set tie-break in the Toronto final, won his opening Cincinnati match against French qualifier Valentin Royer 6-4, 7-6. The World No. 12 hit seven aces according to Infosys ATP Stats and took charge with his forehand in his one hour, 50-minute win. He next faces American wild card Jenson Brooksby.

World No. 3 Alexander Zverev dropped a serving masterclass on American Nishesh Basavareddy to breeze into the third round with a 6-3, 6-3 win, his 40th of the year.

The German put 82 per cent of first serves into play, fired 12 aces and did not face a break point in the 66-minute match. 

Zverev said that he was happy to get through without expending too much energy, and to avoid playing in the heat of the day.

Watch highlights from Zverev's win in Cincinnati:

""I requested [a night match], coming from Toronto, where it's a lot colder, I need some days getting used to the heat and conditions,” he said. “I'm happy with the win and happy with how I played.”

The two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion will next play 27th seed, American Brandon Nakashima, who toughed out a 4-6, 6-3, 7-6(5) win over Belgian qualifier Alexander Blockx.

He was four points away from that milestone three days ago in Toronto, but got it done on Sunday in Cincy instead.ByJohn BerkokPublished Aug 11, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 11, 2025

Karen Khachanov is fresh off an incredible week and a half in Toronto, where he reached the second Masters 1000 final of his career—and his first since 2018, when he won indoors in Paris—before finishing runner-up to Ben Shelton on Thursday night.And on Sunday night, he kept the wins coming.Khachanov defeated French qualifier Valentin Royer in an entertaining two-setter in his opening match in Cincinnati, 6-4, 7-6 (6), for the milestone 200th hard-court win of his career.He very nearly hit that milestone in the Toronto final, coming within just four points of beating Shelton multiple times—the American served to stay in the match twice in the third set, at 4-5 and 5-6, before clawing out a marathon 6-7 (5), 6-4, 7-6 (3) victory.But Khachanov hit the big 2-0-0 in Cincinnati anyway with his victory over Royer, becoming the 10th man born in 1990 or later to record that many career hard-court wins, and just the seventh man born in 1996 or later—or even 1992 or later—to achieve the feat.MEN BORN SINCE 1990 WITH 200+ CAREER WINS (tour-level):318: Grigor Dimitrov [born in 1991]309: Daniil Medvedev [born in 1996]288: Alexander Zverev [born in 1997] (plays tonight)264: Milos Raonic [born in 1990]253: Andrey Rublev [born in 1997]228: David Goffin [born in 1990]221: Taylor Fritz [born in 1997]219: Stefanos Tsitsipas [born in 1998]212: Alex de Minaur [born in 1999]200: Karen Khachanov [born in 1996]

Khachanov's victory over Royer was anything but straightforward, particularly the second set, where he not only had to battle back from 4-2 down, but also from 4-1 down in the tie-break—he even faced a set point down 6-5 in the breaker. But he snuck out the last three points in a row to finally close the Frenchman out.And with that victory, Khachanov has now won 13 of his last 16 matches on the tour, a stretch that dates back to mid-way through the grass-court season and includes reaching the semifinals in Halle, the quarterfinals of Wimbledon and the final in Toronto.He went into that stretch ranked just outside the Top 20, at No. 22, and he's now just outside the Top 10, at No. 12. A former world No. 8, he has a good chance of returning to the Top 10 after Cincinnati.Awaiting him in the third round of the Masters 1000 event will be American wild card Jenson Brooksby, who defeated French lucky loser Arthur Cazaux in straight sets earlier in the day, 7-5, 6-1.Brooksby won the pair's only previous meeting, and handily, too, prevailing 6-0, 6-3 in the second round of Indian Wells in 2022.

Raducanu gave the No. 1 all she could handle on grass; can she do it again on hard courts?ByDavid KanePublished Aug 11, 2025 copy_link

Published Aug 11, 2025

CINCINNATI, Ohio—The Cincinnati Open will host a rematch of one of the most intriguing clashes of the 2025 Wimbledon Championships as world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka takes on Emma Raducanu in a battle of US Open champions on Monday.“She challenged me in that match,” Sabalenka said in a post-match mixed zone following her opening-round win over Marketa Vondrousova, “and I like to accept tough challenges, so I'm super excited facing her on a hard court.”🖥️📱 Click here for live coverage on TennisChannel.com Estimated start time: 12:10 p.m. ET, Monday, August 11A former world No. 10, Raducanu gave Sabalenka all she could handle over two sets beneath the Centre Court roof, forcing a tiebreaker in the first set and leading 4-1 in the second before Sabalenka ultimately secured an electric victory, 7-6 (6), 6-4.It was a match Raducanu was wishing she could play again.

It was a match Raducanu was wishing she could play again.

It's like a fact-finding match so you can see where you are in comparison to the top. I also think form fluctuates so much on the day, so you can lose 2&1 one day, and you could make it close the next day. It can be down to a few points. I'm excited either way. Aryna is world No. 1, so it'll be an exciting match and a good experience. Emma Raducanu on facing Aryna Sabalenka in Cincinnati

“I would say I thought, ‘I would love to have another crack at that, on grass, tomorrow,'” Raducanu said with a laugh after her own opening win against Olga Danilovic. “But I know and I'm honestly reasonable enough and honest enough with myself to know that different surfaces favor different people and where my game is at in comparison.“I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage, but we'll see how it goes [on hard courts].”Sabalenka has indeed been one of the best players on hard courts since winning her first of two Australian Open titles in 2023. The top seed captured her first US Open title last summer after first storming to the Cincinnati title, but Raducanu has proven her mettle on concrete, winning the 2021 US Open as a qualifier.The years that followed for Raducanu were riddled by physical setbacks and multiple surgeries. Now healthy and flanked by a strong team, one that recently added former Rafael Nadal coach Francisco Roig, the 22-year-old has slowly climbed back up the rankings from an April 2024 low of No. 303.

“It's important being seeded at these tournaments,” said Raducanu, the No. 30 seed in Cincinnati. “At Masters, you get a bye, which helps a lot. Then at the Slams, you avoid playing a top seed in the first round. Equally, with the stage that I'm at with my tennis and my development right now, it's about just improving the overall level and feeling I have on court, not having holes as much, I think that's my main priority.“I know there will be a time where I'll be targeting big tournaments, Masters, and Slams. Right now, that's not my goal. My goal is to improve as a player.”Sabalenka took note of some of those improvements first hand at SW19, the top seed praising the Brit ahead of their third-round rematch.“She played incredible tennis,” said Sabalenka. “I'm super happy to see her mentally and physically back. She'll definitely be back in Top 10 very soon.”Both Sabalenka and Raducanu plan to embrace the meeting as a challenge. But for the latter, it's more of a litmus test.

Sabalenka leads their head-to-head 2-0, but Raducanu played Sabalenka tough over two sets at Wimbledon last month.

“It's like a fact-finding match,” she mused, “so you can see where you are in comparison to the top. I also think form fluctuates so much on the day, so you can lose 2&1 one day, and you could make it close the next day. It can be down to a few points. I'm excited either way. Aryna is world No. 1, so it'll be an exciting match and a good experience.”For one who has ready achieved so much, Raducanu is proud to take on an underdog role, perhaps as a means of reducing pressure but also nodding to the reality that this is effectively her first full season as a healthy top tier player.“It was great to have had a bye so we can actually get two days of training,” she said of her early work with Roig. “That was really crucial, to be honest. Other than that, in the last few months, I haven't actually had many training weeks because I've been doing better in tournaments, which is a great thing. I actually find that my level improves more with practice than it does with playing matches. Playing matches, you get better at playing big points, you get more match fit. But I think actual quality and level improves with practice.”The combination of Sabalenka's consistency with Raducanu's calm, confident approach could yield the first must-watch match of the tournament, and one that could determine who goes on to wear the crown in Queen City.

Other than that, in the last few months, I haven't actually had many training weeks because I've been doing better in tournaments, which is a great thing. I actually find that my level improves more with practice than it does with playing matches. Playing matches, you get better at playing big points, you get more match fit. But I think actual quality and level improves with practice.”The combination of Sabalenka's consistency with Raducanu's calm, confident approach could yield the first must-watch match of the tournament, and one that could determine who goes on to wear the crown in Queen City.

This year, there are more ups and downs.“But still, I think my level is there, I just need to find the consistency in every tournament… To be focused in every tournament, to take some rest when I need it, to practice when I need it, and to step on court focused—I think that's the key.”

CINCINNATI, Ohio—Fresh off a post-Wimbledon holiday, Carlos Alcaraz is all business at the Cincinnati Open, taking to the practice court almost immediately after a 6-1, 2-6, 6-3 win over Damir Dzumhur on Sunday.“I just wanted to hit some balls just to pull out all the negative feelings that I could have had from the match,” Alcaraz said in his post-match mixed zone. “I just wanted to feel much better and think and feel like my tennis is there, and it's just about good feelings.

I think here, in Cincinnati, when you lose your feeling, in two or three points, then it's really, really difficult to come back. Everything goes super-fast, the ball flies even more than what we are used to. Carlos Alcaraz

“I remembered the match last year, which is sometimes tricky to forget about it,” said Alcaraz.“There weren't so many rallies in the first set, which, I couldn't get the good rhythm,” he explained. “But I felt great. Then, second set, I think he started to play much better. I just made a few early mistakes in the first two, three games. Then, I just lost my feeling, lost completely my feeling.”The five-time Grand Slam champion has played some spectacular tennis in Cincinnati, finishing runner-up to Novak Djokovic back in 2023 in what was largely considered one of the best matches of that year, but admitted he can indeed lose his rhythm on quicker courts.

I'm just glad that we're going to play our first ATP match, which is great to see how far we went. He's a really powerful player. I've seen a lot of his matches already. He's got a big forehand, big shots. I have to be ready for that because here is even tougher with the speed of the court. We will see but I'm excited.”The match will likely take place on Tuesday, giving Alcaraz plenty of time to continue honing his game on the practice court as he aims to channel the form that took him to his first US Open title back in 2022.

IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe picks out five drivers Cadillac could bring to the F1 grid in 2026.

One of the biggest questions that still remains about Cadillac's nascent F1 program is who will be tapped to drive for them. While some established F1 veterans have been touted as front runners for the ride, it is no secret that one day they would love to have a US driver in their stable.

So if one of the seats had to be earmarked for an American, who would the best options be? We asked IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe to pick out five drivers Caddilac could bring to the F1 grid…

Cadillac: Everything You Need To Know About F1's New Team

F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto recently sat down with Fred Vasseur for a chat about all things Ferrari.

We're on the top level of Ferrari's motorhome in Budapest, Hungary, and while the F1 crew are setting up their cameras and repositioning the sofas for our interview, Ferrari boss Fred Vasseur is leaning on the balcony, surveying the paddock containing the engineering trucks that will be under his leadership for at least the next couple of years.

The day before, Ferrari announced they had extended Vasseur's stay at F1's most famous team on a multi-year deal (the three-year contract he signed ahead of joining in 2023 expiring at the end of this season). It brought to an end speculation in the Italian press around the time of the Canadian Grand Prix that his position was under threat.

That speculation came despite the fact Ferrari were – and still are – second in the Teams' Championship, admittedly well adrift of McLaren but ahead of power houses Mercedes and Red Bull. It comes after Ferrari came closer to winning a title than they have done in more than a decade by taking the fight in the Teams' Standings to the wire last year.

Cadillac: Everything You Need To Know About F1's New Team

F1.com delves into the origin stories of all 10 Formula 1 teams currently on the grid, ranging from those with a storied history through to some that have been through several identity changes.

The teams currently on the F1 grid all bring with them very different back stories. From those who have built a storied history, through to some that have been borne out of the ashes of past outfits and others that arrived brand new, we've been taking a look at the fascinating family tree of all 10 outfits…

In terms of the sport's most historic names, McLaren is up there amongst them. The team were founded by Bruce McLaren and made their debut back in 1966, with the New Zealander himself at the wheel.

McLaren claimed the first win for his squad at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix and, following his death whilst testing a Can-Am car in 1970, the team bearing his name have gone on to score a total of 200 Grand Prix victories to date along with nine Teams' Championships and 12 Drivers' titles.

The outfit are the second oldest team on the grid, behind another famed name in motorsport history…

Having arrived in Formula 1 when the championship made its debut back in 1950, Ferrari are the only team to have competed in every season since, and in that time the Scuderia have built an illustrious legacy.

Famed for their scarlet livery, the Italian outfit have attracted some of the most famous drivers over the years and collected titles with many of them, including Alberto Ascari, Niki Lauda and Michael Schumacher.

While their last Drivers' Championship came courtesy of Kimi Raikkonen in 2007 – with the Teams' crown following in 2008 – Ferrari have well and truly earned their place in the F1 history books.

Mercedes first appeared in Formula 1 back in 1954 and 1955 but, following their withdrawal from motorsport after the latter year, the name did not return as a manufacturer until many years later.

The outfit now known as Mercedes started life as Tyrrell back in 1970, before being purchased by British American Racing in 1998, resulting in the team being rebranded one year on.

Another change came in 2006 when Honda took over but, after the company opted to withdraw at the end of 2008, Ross Brawn famously purchased the squad for one pound, leading to the fairytale championship-winning 2009 season for the Brawn GP squad.

Mercedes acquired the team at the end of that year, meaning that the Silver Arrows name returned for 2010. In the years since, the Brackley-based outfit have achieved seven Drivers' Championships – six courtesy of Lewis Hamilton – alongside eight Teams' titles.

The origins of the Red Bull team can be traced back to Stewart Grand Prix, the squad founded by Jackie Stewart that went on to compete in F1 between 1997 and 1999.

When Ford purchased the outfit at the end of the latter year, the team were rebranded as Jaguar, a name that they raced under through to the 2004 season.

Energy drinks company Red Bull then acquired the squad, leading to the team becoming Red Bull Racing in 2005. The rest is history, with the outfit having gone on to win the Teams' Championship on six occasions and the Drivers' title a total of eight times, four apiece for Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen.

Another one of Formula 1's most historic names, Williams made their full-time debut on the grid back in 1978 with Alan Jones at the wheel. The outfit – co-founded by Frank Williams and Patrick Head – went on to experience championship glory for the first time just two years later.

Following plenty of success in the 1980s and 1990s, Williams have struggled to replicate that form in the years since, and a change came for the team in 2020 when they were purchased by Dorilton Capital.

While Frank Williams and daughter Claire stepped back from the team, the squad continue to carry the Williams name as they try to make their way back to the front of the grid.

Aston Martin briefly competed in F1 for just five races between 1959 and 1960, but the outfit that now carries the brand's name actually started life as Jordan back in 1991.

Founder Eddie Jordan sold the team to Midland Racing in 2005, who then rebranded under that name in 2006. The squad were subsequently acquired by Spyker, leading to another name change for the 2007 campaign.

Just one year on, the outfit became Force India after another buyout, a moniker that they raced under through to 2018. A consortium led by Lawrence Stroll took over during that final year to bring the struggling team out of administration, and another rebrand as Racing Point followed in 2019.

After Stroll's consortium took a 16.7% stake in Aston Martin, the team took on the famous manufacturer's name from 2021 onwards.

The Sauber name first arrived in Formula 1 in 1993, with Karl Wendlinger and JJ Lehto forming the line-up of Peter Sauber's eponymous squad.

When the team was purchased by BMW at the end of 2005, they began racing under the BMW Sauber moniker in 2006. However, after the manufacturer decided to withdraw from the sport at the close of 2009, the squad was sold back to Peter Sauber and returned to his name.

After partnering with Alfa Romeo in 2018, the team rebranded as Alfa Romeo Racing from 2019 onwards, a name that remained until the Italian brand exited after 2023.

While the team have been known as Kick Sauber since 2024, a big change is on the horizon next season when the squad will become Audi's works outfit, coinciding with a new era of technical regulations coming into effect in the sport.

Another team that has seen its fair share of identity changes is Racing Bulls. The life of the outfit actually goes back to 1985 and the arrival of Minardi, the Italian squad that remained on the grid through to the end of 2005.

Red Bull – off the back of purchasing the former Jaguar outfit – acquired Minardi ahead of the 2006 season, with the company deciding to run a second ‘junior' team in which they would develop young talent.

After making their debut under the Toro Rosso name, a rebranding saw the squad become AlphaTauri in 2020, which then changed to RB in 2024 before evolving into Racing Bulls for the 2025 campaign.

The newest team to arrive in Formula 1, Haas – established by American founder Gene Haas – entered the sport in 2016, having purchased the Banbury base of the former Marussia outfit to use as their headquarters in the United Kingdom.

With the line-up of Romain Grosjean and Esteban Gutierrez, Haas enjoyed the strongest debut of a new team in this century after placing in a respectable P8 of the Teams' Championship, before recording their best finish to date in 2018 with P5 at the end of the year.

While they have faced some highs and lows in the time since, the squad bounced back from a last place result in 2023 to become regular points scorers again in 2024, ending that campaign in seventh place.

Alpine are another team to carry a long history of name changes over the years. The origins of the outfit go right back to 1981 when Toleman arrived on the grid, the squad that famously gave Ayrton Senna his debut in 1984.

After being purchased by Benetton, they took the moniker of the Italian fashion brand in 1986. It was under this guise that the team experienced great success in the mid-1990s, with Michael Schumacher claiming back-to-back Drivers' Championships in 1994 and 1995.

The outfit became Renault in 2002 following their acquisition by the French manufacturer, with Fernando Alonso taking the Drivers' title in 2005 and 2006, before they changed to Lotus in 2012. Four years later, Renault took over again, a name that remained through to the end of 2020.

As of 2021, the company decided to rebrand the F1 team as Alpine. The squad have faced mixed fortunes in the years since, but have collected six podiums along the way as well as a surprise victory courtesy of Esteban Ocon at the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix.

While there are currently 10 teams on the grid, it is worth noting that another name will join the family as of 2026.

Cadillac are set to become F1's newest arrival next season. It was first confirmed in November 2024 that Formula 1 had reached an agreement in principle with General Motors (GM) to support bringing GM/Cadillac to the grid in the 2026 season.

The Cadillac Formula 1 Team then received final approval in March 2025 to join the sport next year, with the squad set to be led by Team Principal Graeme Lowdon, while General Motors and TWG Motorsports are also building a power unit facility which will ultimately make the Cadillac team a full-works operation.

The Russells (portrayed by Coon and Morgan Spector) have been an aspirational couple ever since the HBO Max series premiered in 2022. Coon speaks to THR about rocking that foundation.


							By 

	Ronda Racha Penrice



[This story contains major spoilers from the season three Gilded Age finale.]


	George Russell (Morgan Spector) cheats death and survives being shot, thanks to Peggy's Dr. Kirkland (Jordan Donica), but Team Russell takes a huge hit. Just when everything looks like it might be coming together for Bertha, her whole world falls apart. Gladys [Taissa Farmiga] is a duchess and is now happy with her duke, but the season three cliff-hanger makes it clear that Bertha and George are not OK, leaving both Bertha and the audience shellshocked after Sunday night's ending.

	Since The Gilded Age premiered back in 2022, the Russells have been an aspirational couple. One of the things fans admire most about them is their teamwork. In a time when women had far less agency, especially in marriage, George and Bertha were partners working together to solidify their place in business and society despite not having the required pedigree. As George excelled in business and Bertha in society circles, the power couple looked invincible.

	Marriage is a key theme throughout season three, especially with Bertha pushing Gladys to marry for status, not love. Divorce or divorced women, rather, is another key topic that has Bertha right in the middle of it, but this time on the right side. The Hollywood Reporter caught up with Carrie Coon, who portrays Bertha Russell, to discuss her thoughts on the season three finale, revisit Bertha choosing whom Gladys would marry, as well as Bertha backing off of Larry [Harry Richardson] and his choice, and what may be in store for Bertha in the already renewed fourth season.

	











	***


At the very end of the season three finale, Bertha is looking out the window as George is carried away to spend more time away from her. He has told her that he doesn't know if he wants to be with her. In that moment, has she gained the world but lost everything that matters?


	Yes, yes, I think she has. I think she's been very myopic, and she didn't feel the seismic shift that was happening under her feet with her husband and her son in particular. And even though she's right, she's feeling righteous. It has come at a tremendous cost. It was sad for us, very heartbreaking to act out for me and Morgan.


Yes, because one of the highlights of The Gilded Age has been The Russells' solid foundation.


	I know, I know. It's so sexy, so egalitarian, so respectful, and then here it goes. I know it's really exhausting. I hope we get a chance to make a repair.


It's ironic to see the end because Bertha has put her neck on the line to make sure divorced women are respected, not suspecting that she could join them.


	At least not consciously. Yes, she's always thinking ahead, that Bertha. I love that she's always willing to challenge what she finds silly. I mean she's playing the game and, at the same time, she's questioning the rules. And I've always loved that about her.


Let's revisit the cataclysmic event that creates this whole divide, which is Gladys marrying. Take us into Bertha's ideology. In the end, even Gladys sees that her mother was right, and perhaps the audience does, too, but talk about the lack of power in that era and how women marshaled that?












	Well, let's remember that women couldn't even get their own credit card in the United States until the 1970s. They're women of wealth, but they still are limited in what they're able to accomplish in the world. So a person of such cognitive ability and force as Bertha is relegated to a single sphere, and that is the social one. That is the marriage of her children and philanthropy. Period. End of story. With nowhere else to put that energy. So you have got to be darn sure Bertha's going to make sure her daughter makes a good marriage. And what Bertha observes in Gladys's early relationships are relationships she doesn't think are going to sustain Gladys for a 30-, 40-year marriage. She doesn't think puppy love is a foundation on which to build a marriage.


	Now it's hypocrisy. Yes, because did Bertha marry for love? Absolutely, she did. She had that joy and possibility in her life, but you know, Gladys is in a much higher social position, and therefore Bertha's not willing to give her that freedom, knowing what she knows about what it takes to maintain a marriage, and how unsatisfying it can be to be a woman in the world with no purpose. So Bertha wants to give her daughter the possibility of having a life that is meaningful and purposeful, and she knows that if she can elevate her socially, she will have tremendous influence in fashion, in social issues, in philanthropy; she will maximize Gladys' power in the world. Now whether or not Gladys cares about that is another matter. Bertha just knows if she were Gladys, this is what she would want. And aren't we all guilty of projecting onto our children our dreams?

	











Was Bertha truly ever unsure that Gladys would walk down the aisle?


	I think there was a kernel of doubt. And, you know, she wouldn't have allowed it. She would have found a way to get around it. Gladys certainly gave her a scare when she ran away. I feel like there's also a story in real life with Alva [Belmont Vanderbilt] and [her daughter] Consuelo. And of course, we're not following that story exactly, but I think Alva maybe even faked a heart attack at one point. There's something so dramatic that Alva did to get Consuelo to do what she wanted. She would stop at nothing to make sure that marriage happened. And of course, you know, Taissa's performance is heartbreaking. She's weeping down the aisle, which I can understand would cause some ire directly toward Bertha from the fans. 


Yes, it did feel a bit punishing.


	Bertha's really confident in what she's doing for Gladys. She is doing it out of love. I know people find her methods distasteful, but it is ultimately because she loves her so much and she wants her to have a fulfilling life.


Talk about Bertha's trip to England because it changes things for Gladys and appears to be a huge turning point.


	Yeah, it's really interesting, isn't it? What I love about that episode is that I think Gladys starts to understand that her mother actually does have wisdom, [that she] does have some useful tips to offer when it comes to a marriage and running a household. And hopefully this creates a new possibility for their alliance going forward, that she will now be able to share her experiences in a way that will be useful to Gladys. When Gladys was a young woman, they weren't necessarily applicable, but now they get to share this experience of being these influential women in the world, and [Bertha] is teaching her how to step into her power.

	











That moment with Lady Sarah is so subtle, but so powerful.


	And isn't Hattie Morahan just amazing as Lady Sarah?


Everyone in this show is spectacular.


	It's such a joy to do. We really have a wonderful time making it. Just the most amazing people. I maintain you only hear about the bad actors, the bad people who have bad reputations, but, honestly, most actors that I ever work with are just the most deeply curious and generous people in the world. We just have the most magnificent time.


Everyone in The Gilded Age seems to be there because they want to be. You're in The White Lotus and everybody has a lot going on, but they make time for the show.


	We really love it, and our crew is very special. They've all worked together in New York for decades. The best crew in New York City. They all know each other, and it really feels like a family. And so I do think you feel that energy in the show. There's a lot of love in it.


Speaking of love, why is Bertha so willing to back off her son Larry's choice in marriage? And why does she warm to Marian [Louisa Jacobson]?


	Well, I do think Bertha respects Marian. I think Bertha sees in Marian a good fashion sense, her ambition, right? She's ambitious for more than just making a good marriage. I think Bertha respects Marian, but she doesn't come with the wealth and pedigree that Bertha would have hoped for her son. However, what Bertha knows is she's going to have to give this one up if she wants George to be on her side again because she figures out she's messed up royally when it comes to Gladys by not giving him more say. So she's going to give him this one. So it's about marriage, and then she also knows her son is a rich white man and he's going to be fine. And we've seen Larry be fine. Everything Larry touches turns to gold. He's going to be fine. So she's willing to give that one up, reluctantly maybe, but you know he could have chosen worse; he's not with the divorcée.

	











Talk about the aftermath of George is shot. What are Bertha's emotions then? Especially since this season there was no indication that she could lose George.


	I think that's the stark reality that she's faced with, in that she really does almost lose him, and she starts to understand that there are some priorities maybe more important to her than she thought. She didn't think she'd ever lose him. But she comes close to losing him anyway, not only physically, but then their emotional life is in peril as well. And I think she feels like once he goes through that experience, they will be closer than ever, only to discover that this near-death experience for George has created a shift in him that she can't really access, which feels very truthful to me. When one person goes through something really dramatic and unsettling as that that they can't necessarily see eye to eye for a while and they're going to have to figure that out if they're given the chance. And so I think she underestimates what that experience has done for him in terms of his perspective on his life and his choices.


Bertha tells George that she knows what she wants. So what is it that Bertha wants?


	Bertha wants everyone to keep moving forward. She wants to stay married to George. She wants her children to be settled and to start to take their rightful place in society as influencers, so to speak. And she's ready to kind of conquer whatever the next challenge is. But she underestimated this impact. It feels out of the blue for her. Of course, the audience knows it's not out of the blue. She just wasn't paying attention.

	











Bertha had tremendous triumphs even before making her daughter Gladys a duchess. She bested Mrs. Astor [Donna Murphy] to become the belle of the ball in the opera wars. Her staff figured out how to get rid of the gossiper.


	Yeah, that's right.


So she should be on cloud nine.


	And why can't her family just celebrate her victories? Why can'tthey recognize how hard she's working?


And to be honest George is being a little hypocritical.


	Exactly!


When George asked to bring Mr. Morgan and others to the table, she did. And through those society connections George now dislikes.


	That's right, and those are parallel tracks. He cannot accomplish the things he needs to accomplish in business without that social piece in place. They are partners, and to have him disregard her sphere of influence is very dismissive. And he doesn't really understand it.


And the audience is like “this horrible Bertha,” but now it seems that Bertha may have been right about what's best for Gladys.


	I mean Gladys is happy. She's having a baby. Larry gets what he wants. So why can't George just get on board with the program?


Let's go back to the very end as George's carriage is leaving, and Bertha can't tell him he's going to be a grandfather. What kind of possibilities do you think that opens up for Bertha going forward?


	Oh, it's heartbreaking, of course. But, at the same time, her wheels are already turning about how she's going to fix it. You know she's not going to give up on it. She's indefatigable, of course. So I think she's looking out that window and she'll have a moment of grief, and then she's going to get to work on some kind of plan.

""We are not experts in the politics of the region, but we want our audience to know where we each stand,"" the band said in a joint introduction to the individual statements. 


							By 

	Abid Rahman


International Editor, Digital


	The four members of Irish rock supergroup U2 have weighed in on the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict, with each member — Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. — releasing individual statements. The four statements were shared on U2's official Instagram account and website Sunday, alongside the following joint message: “Everyone has long been horrified by what is unfolding in Gaza — but the blocking of humanitarian aid and now plans for a military takeover of Gaza City has taken the conflict into uncharted territory. We are not experts in the politics of the region, but we want our audience to know where we each stand.”

	Bono, the lead singer of the band and the most politically active member, released the longest of the four statements, nearly 1,250 words, in which he explained that he “generally tried to stay out of the politics of the Middle East,” not out of humility, but “more uncertainty in the face of obvious complexity.” The singer said he felt compelled to speak out about the Nova festival massacre on Oct. 7, an event which he described as “evil,” and which occurred while U2 was performing on stage at the Sphere in Las Vegas. Bono harshly criticized Hamas and its late leader Yahya Sinwar but he devoted much of his opprobrium on the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in particular, and he was at pains to separate the country's political leaders from its people. “We know Hamas are using starvation as a weapon in the war, but now so too is Israel and I feel revulsion for the moral failure,” Bono writes. He adds, that “the Government of Israel is not the nation of Israel, but the Government of Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu today deserves our categorical and unequivocal condemnation.”

	He continues, “Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood. We stand in solidarity with the remaining hostages and plead that someone rational negotiate their release.” Bono ends his statement calling on Israel and the international community to flood Gaza with aid. 


	In his statement, guitarist The Edge also lambasted Netanyahu and posed three questions for Israel's leader, adding that he asked “them in the hope of engaging the conscience and sanity of the people of Israel.” In his first question, The Edge wonders if Netanyahu's considers the impact of the situation on Gaza will have on the reputation of Israel and its people. “Do you not see that the longer this continues, the more Israel risks becoming isolated, mistrusted, and remembered not as a haven from persecution, but as a state that, when provoked, systematically persecuted a neighbouring civilian population?,” he writes. His second question takes Netanyahu's party Likud to task for its end goal in Gaza and the West Bank, and removing Palestinians from both occupied territories. And third, The Edge questions Netanyahu's political vision if he rejects a two-state solution. “Simply perpetual conflict? A future of walls, blockades, military occupation? A state of permanent inequality? And if this apartheid state transpires don't you destroy the very argument for Israel's existence as a moral response to the horrors of the Holocaust?”

	











	Clayton, U2's bassist, kept his statement short and questioned Israel's claims to have a superior technologically savvy army when it has wrought utter devastation in Gaza. “Preserving civilian life is a choice in this war,” Clayton writes. 


	And finally, Mullen, the band's drummer, acknowledged the horrors of Oct. 7 but also was disgusted by the imposition of man-made famine in Gaza by Israel. “To state the obvious, starving innocent civilians as a weapon of war is inhumane and criminal,” Mullen writes. He also lamented the silence over the famine. “Where is the outrage from within Israel, outside of a small, if increasingly vocal, minority? Where is the outrage from the diaspora? Beyond some reluctant and muted acknowledgement of a famine inflicted, nothing. Silence,” Mullen writes.


Bono's full statement:


Apart from the attack on the Nova music festival on October 7th, which felt like it happened while U2 were on stage at Sphere Las Vegas, I have generally tried to stay out of the politics of the Middle East… this was not humility, more uncertainty in the face of obvious complexity… I have over recent months written about the war in Gaza in The Atlantic and spoken about it in The Observer, but I circled the subject.


As a cofounder of the ONE Campaign, which tackles AIDS and extreme poverty in Africa, I felt my experience should be on the catastrophes facing that work and that part of the world. The hemorrhaging of human life in Sudan or Ethiopia hardly makes the news. Sudan alone is beyond comprehension, with a civil war that has left 150,000 dead and 2 million people facing famine.[1]












And that was before the dismantling of USAID in March and gutting of PEPFAR, life-saving programs for the poorest of the poor that ONE has fought for decades to protect… the cuts to which will likely lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children over the next few years.[2]


But but but…there is no hierarchy to such things.


The images of starving children on the Gaza Strip brought me back to a working trip to a food station in Ethiopia my wife Ali and I made 40 years ago next month following U2's participation in Live Aid 1985. Another man-made famine.


To witness chronic malnutrition up close would make it personal for any family, especially as it affects children. Because when the loss of non-combatant life en masse appears so calculated… especially the deaths of children, then ‘evil' is not a hyperbolic adjective… in the sacred text of Jew, Christian, and Muslim it is an evil that must be resisted.


The rape, murder, and abduction of Israelis at the Nova music festival was evil.


On that awful Saturday night/Sunday morning of October 7/8 2023, I wasn't thinking about politics. On stage in the Nevada desert, I just couldn't help but express the pain everyone in the room was feeling and is still feeling for other music lovers and fans like us — hiding under a stage in Kibbutz Re'im then butchered to set a diabolical trap for Israel and to get a war going that might just redraw the map from ‘The river to the sea'… a gamble Hamas' leadership were willing to play with the lives of two million Palestinians… to sow the seeds for a global intifada that U2 had glimpsed at work in Paris during the Bataclan attack in 2015… but only if Israel's leaders fell for this trap that Hamas set for them.












Yahya Sinwar didn't mind if he lost the battle or even the war if he could destroy Israel as a moral as well as an economic force. Over the next months as Israel's revenge for the Hamas attack appeared more and more disproportionate and disinterested in the equally innocent civilian lives in Gaza… I felt as nauseous as everyone, but reminded myself Hamas had deliberately positioned themselves under civilian targets, having tunneled their way from school to mosque to hospital. When did a just war to defend the country turn into an unjust land grab? I hoped Israel would return to reason. I was making excuses for a people seared and shaped by the experience of Holocaust… who understood the threat of extermination is not simply a fear but a fact… I re-read Hamas' charter of 1988[3]… it's an evil read (Article Seven!)


But I also understood that Hamas are not the Palestinian people… a people who have for decades endured and continue to endure marginalization, oppression, occupation, and the systematic stealing of the land that is rightfully theirs. Given our own historic experience of oppression and occupation, it's little wonder so many here in Ireland have campaigned for decades for justice for the Palestinian people.


We know Hamas are using starvation as a weapon in the war, but now so too is Israel and I feel revulsion for the moral failure. The Government of Israel is not the nation of Israel, but the Government of Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu today deserves our categorical and unequivocal condemnation. There is no justification for the brutality he and his far right government have inflicted on the Palestinian people… in Gaza… in the West Bank. And not just since October 7, well before it too… though the level of depravity and lawlessness we are seeing now feels like uncharted territory.












Curiously those who say these reports are not true are not demanding access for journalists and seem deaf to the revealing rhetoric. Examples that sharpen my pen include: Israel's Heritage Minister claiming that the government is racing to wipe out Gaza[4]… his Defense Minister and Security Minister arguing no aid should be let into the territory.[5],[6] “Not one grain of wheat.”[7] And now Netanyahu announces[8] a military takeover of Gaza City… which most informed commentators understand as a euphemism for the colonization of Gaza. We know the rest of the Gaza Strip… and the West Bank are next. What century are we in?


Is the world not done with this far, far right thinking? We know where it ends… world war… millenarianism… Might the world deserve to know where this once promising bright-minded democratic nation is headed unless there is a dramatic change of course? Is what was once an oasis of innovation and free-thinking now in hock to a fundamentalism as blunt as a machete? Are Israelis really ready to let Benjamin Netanyahu do to Israel what its enemies failed to achieve over the last 77 years? And disappear it from membership in a community of nations built around even a flawed decency?


As someone who has long believed in Israel's right to exist and supported a two-state solution, I want to make clear to anyone who cares to listen our band's condemnation of Netanyahu's immoral actions and join all who have called for a cessation of hostilities on both sides.












If not Irish voices, please please please stop and listen to Jewish ones – from the high mindedness of Rabbi Sharon Brous, to the tearful comedy of the Grody-Patinkin family – who fear the damage to Judaism, as well as Israel's neighbours. Listen to the more than 100,000 Israelis who this week in Tel Aviv protested for an end to the war.


Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood. We stand in solidarity with the remaining hostages and plead that someone rational negotiate their release. Could it be Marwan Barghouthi who the former head of Mossad Efraim Halevy described as “probably the most sane and the most qualified person” to lead the Palestinians?[9]


Wiser heads than mine will have a view, but surely the hostages deserve a different approach — and quick.


We urge more good people in Israel to demand unfettered access by professionals to deliver the critical care needed throughout Gaza and the West Bank that they best know how to distribute… and to let the correct number of trucks through. It will take more than 100 trucks a day to take seriously the need – more like 600[10] – but the flooding of humanitarian aid will also undercut the black marketing that has been happening to benefit Hamas.


The band is pledged to contribute our support by donating to Medical Aid For Palestinians.


	–Bono


The Edge's full statement: 












We are all deeply shocked and profoundly grieved by the suffering unfolding in Gaza. What we are witnessing is not a distant tragedy—it is a test of our shared humanity.


I have three questions for Prime Minister Netanyahu. I ask them in the hope of engaging the conscience and sanity of the people of Israel.


First: Do you truly believe that such devastation—inflicted so intentionally and relentlessly on a civilian population—can happen without heaping generational shame upon those responsible? Do you not see that the longer this continues, the more Israel risks becoming isolated, mistrusted, and remembered not as a haven from persecution, but as a state that, when provoked, systematically persecuted a neighbouring civilian population?


Second: If the end goal is, as the Likud platform suggests, the removal of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank to make way for a “Greater Israel,” then that is not peace—it is dispossession; it is ethnic cleansing, and, according to many legal scholars, colonial genocide. It is an injustice on a massive scale. And injustice, as we learned in Ireland, is never the path to security: it breeds resentment, it hardens hearts, and it guarantees that future generations will inherit conflict rather than peace. The oppressed do not forget. How can this course of action possibly make your people safer?


Third: If you reject the two-state solution—as your government now openly does—then what is your political vision? Simply perpetual conflict? A future of walls, blockades, military occupation? A state of permanent inequality? And if this apartheid state transpires don't you destroy the very argument for Israel's existence as a moral response to the horrors of the Holocaust? For if Israel comes to be seen as a state that systematically denies another people their rights, then the world will inevitably ask whether the only just and sustainable future, the only tolerable future, is a shared state—one where Jews and Palestinians live together as equals under the law.












We know from our own experience in Ireland that peace is not made through dominance. Peace is made when people sit down with their opponents—when they recognise the equal dignity of all, even those they once feared or despised.


There can be no peace without justice. No reconciliation without recognition. And no future unless we refuse to let the past be repeated.


The road to peace is difficult. But it is never too late, or too early, to begin walking it.


-The Edge


Adam Clayton's full statement: 


The humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by Israel's aid blockade and bombing looks like revenge on a civilian population who are not responsible for Hamas' murderous attack on October 7. If Israel moves to colonise the Gaza Strip, it will permanently undo any possibility of lasting peace or solution for hostilities. Forgetting the morality of the situation for a moment, doesn't the technical superiority of Israel's modern army make a boast of its precision targeting of individuals from thousands of miles away? And if so why are the IDF bombarding a civilian population from the skies indiscriminately destroying any bit of shelter and infrastructure?


Preserving civilian life is a choice in this war.


-Adam


Larry Mullen Jr.'s full statement: 


The images of the Hamas-led massacre of Israelis on October 7th and in particular the footage of innocent music fans being slaughtered, beaten and abused at the Nova Music Festival were harrowing to watch. Nothing was achieved except more misery for the region at the hands of Hamas and its allies.












So what did Hamas expect would happen when they committed mass murder and took the hostages?


Israel's response was expected.


After those attacks the total obliteration of Hamas was called for by Israel and its allies and was expected.


A ground war was expected.


Aerial bombardment and destruction were expected .


The indiscriminate decimation of most homes and hospitals in Gaza, with a majority of those killed being women and children, was not expected.


Imposing famine was not expected.


It's difficult to comprehend how any civilised society can think starving children is going to further any cause and be justified as an acceptable response to another horror. To state the obvious, starving innocent civilians as a weapon of war is inhumane and criminal.


Where is the outrage from within Israel, outside of a small, if increasingly vocal, minority?


Where is the outrage from the diaspora?


Beyond some reluctant and muted acknowledgement of a famine inflicted, nothing.


Silence.


The power to change this obscenity is in the hands of Israel


I undoubtedly support Israel's right to exist and I also believe Palestinians deserve the same right and a state of their own.


Silence serves none of us.

The Scott Cooper-written and -directed film stars Jeremy Allen White as the iconic musician alongside Jeremy Strong, Marc Maron, Stephen Graham, Gaby Hoffman, Paul Walter Hauser, David Krumholtz and Odessa Young.

	The 2025 New York Film Festival has added the premiere of Scott Cooper‘s Bruce Springsteen biopic, Deliver Me From Nowhere, starring Jeremy Allen White as the iconic musician, as its Spotlight Gala selection.


	The film, adapted from Warren Zanes' 2023 best-selling book of the same name, is set in the early '80s at a key time in Springsteen's career as he was recording the personal, acoustic songs that would make up his Nebraska album while also working on demos for Born in the U.S.A. and navigating his growing fame. Cooper directs from his own script. In addition to White, Deliver Me From Nowhere stars Jeremy Strong as Springsteen's longtime manager Jon Landau as well as Marc Maron, Stephen Graham, Gaby Hoffman, Paul Walter Hauser, David Krumholtz and Odessa Young. Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson and Scott Stuber produce, with Tracey London and Zanes executive producing. 20th Century Studios is set to release Deliver Me From Nowhere in theaters Oct. 24.

Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere will have its New York Film Festival premiere Sunday, Sept. 28, with Cooper, White, Strong, Young and Springsteen, himself, all expected to be in attendance.


	“The New York Film Festival has always felt like a spiritual home for the kind of cinema I believe in,” Cooper said in a statement. “To now arrive with a film about Bruce Springsteen — an artist whose music shaped not just a country but my own sense of storytelling — is something I could never have imagined. Getting to know Bruce, to explore his world and his spirit, has been one of the most profound creative experiences of my life. To share that experience with New York audiences, in a city that defines artistic possibility, is both an honor and a responsibility I hold with deep gratitude.”

	











	NYFF artistic director Dennis Lim added, “Taking its cue from the stark majesty of Bruce Springsteen's classic album Nebraska, Scott Cooper's Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere has an intimacy and immediacy that eludes most film biographies. Anchored by Jeremy Allen White's revelatory performance, this year's Spotlight Gala selection is a fitting tribute to a living legend.”


	The NYFF previously announced its currents lineup and main slate, including its opening-night film, Luca Guadagnino's Julia Roberts starrer After the Hunt, which also features Ayo Edebiri and Andrew Garfield; centerpiece film Jim Jarmusch's Father Mother Sister Brother; and closing night film Bradley Cooper's Is This Thing On?


	Additional highlights from the 34-film main slate include Jafar Panahi's Cannes' Palme d'Or winner It Was Just an Accident, Kathryn Bigelow‘s A House of Dynamite, Noah Baumbach‘s George Clooney and Adam Sandler starrer Jay Kelly, Kelly Reichardt‘s The Mastermind, the Laura Poitras- and Mark Obenhaus-directed Seymour Hersh documentary Cover-Up, and Mary Bronstein's Rose Byrne and Conan O'Brien starrer If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.


	The 63rd New York Film Festival, presented by Film at Lincoln Center, is set to run Sept. 26 to Oct. 13.

Obama and her brother's podcast, 'IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson,' taped live with the HBO hit series' Natasha Rothwell as their guest, who offered advice for Malia on making it in Hollywood, among other notable moments of the companionable chat. 


							By

	In front of a rapt Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival audience Aug. 9, Michelle Obama co-hosted with her brother a live taping of their podcast IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson. The former First Lady returned to the fest, where she and former President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance in 2022 to support the Netflix documentary Descendant, which they produced through their production company Higher Ground.


	Pinch-hitting for advertised guest Teyana Taylor, who stars in the upcoming feature One Battle After Another with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro, and who canceled due to unexpected vocal surgery, was The White Lotus‘ Emmy-nominated Natasha Rothwell.

	During the conversation, Obama shared a moment she particularly enjoyed about Rothwell's twice Emmy-nominated role as Belinda. “Not only does Belinda get her groove thing on,” she said, “but one of my favorite scenes, because this is a luxury resort, [is] where you're having tea or lunch by yourself, and you spot a Black couple. And most of us know when you're doing something really nice somewhere, especially when you see other Black people,” — Obama indicated a look of acknowledgement of folks within the community — “yeah, and you got that, you know. I love that.” 


	Rothwell provided the backstory: “I pitched that to Mike [White, White Lotus creator]. He's such a collaborative writer-director, and season one, we started working together because he's very aware that he's not a Black woman,” she explained. “When we were working on season three, I was like, ‘Mike, there has to be a moment where Belinda sees someone who looks like her, and almost seeing what's possible for herself, because she's there under work circumstances, but that couple's there just for them. And so just to have that look make the cut, I was so thrilled,” she shared. “So many people bring that moment up because it's just authentic for the experience.”

	











	As the predominantly Black crowd co-signed her assertion, Obama added: “It tells a fuller story of what it means to be Black because we leisure, we travel, right? We leisure all up and down Martha's Vineyard, don't we? It's a beautiful thing to see. We've got to make sure the rest of the world knows that we are traveled, and we do things besides serve other people,” she said to enthusiastic applause.


	The trio swapped stories of their childhoods: Obama was a self-proclaimed introvert, Robinson “was always trying to be outside,” and Rothwell was “an introverted extrovert” from a military family background, for whose service Obama thanked them. Rothwell also discussed her parents' happy 47-year-marriage, and shared that she is “childless by choice” and content with being single. Robinson asked, “Would anybody be upset if we introduced you to somebody?” Rothwell responded: “God is good!”


	Obama shared how she tells her girls — Sasha and Malia — not to rush into marriage. “I'm trying to instill in my daughters right now that marriage should be a choice. And sometimes we send subliminal messages to our kids; they could be doing great things, and it's like, ‘Well, are you dating anyone?,'” she offered as an example. “Or you could be conquering the world, and it's like, ‘When are you going to have a baby?,' all the while sending the message that who you are isn't good enough until you are partnered or paired off.”


	Emphasizing her love for her husband, despite various reports, Obama explained why she shares the difficulty of marriage. “I talk openly about it, not because I don't love my husband. I'm happy to be married. We have a wonderful relationship, but [society] sometimes set young couples up,” she said. “What I don't want young couples to do is walk away from the hard, because that's just waiting for you.”

	











	The companionable conversation covered what it was like for Rothwell as a junior writer on Insecure — “After the first writers' room, I went to my car and sobbed because I felt so seen,” she recalled — as well as leading her award-winning series How to Die Alone as creator, writer, producer and star despite its cancellation. “I'm so grateful that the series saw the light of day, and it's on Hulu,” she said of the show that took her eight years to make.


	Obama also sought Rothwell's advice for others, including her own daughter Malia, who feel compelled to share their voice in Hollywood: “I have a young creative child. I think a lot of young creatives, especially kids of color, with all that's going on in the world, they wonder, ‘Is there still room for this?'”


	Rothwell responded: “I think it's so important for young creators to know that in their pocket is a phone that is a movie studio. Do not wait for someone else to give you permission to live your dream.”


	“There's still a lot of white space for really good, different, diverse stories. And I don't care what we're going through in the world, there's always room for us to tell our stories,” Obama, a producer herself, noted before inquiring about the latest project Rothwell is developing, with which she was unfamiliar.


	Rothwell admitted she was unfamiliar with the viral TikTok sensation, Who TF Did I Marry? by Reesa Teesa — who narrates the story of her marriage to a man she later learns is a pathological liar — until social media began attaching her to the project, which she learned about on a 25-member family group text chain while she was in Thailand.

	











	Later, when it became a viable Hollywood property, Rothwell was amazed that her fledgling production company Big Hattie Productions won it. “It was a six-way bidding war,” she said of the mega popular TikTok series. “There was like the Shondas and the Lee Daniels, everyone was throwing their hat in the ring, because to get 500 million people to sit down and watch something, Hollywood sits up and takes notice.”


	Closing out the conversation, Obama circled back to Rothwell's parents being thrilled that she was sitting down with Obama and her brother.  “Please tell your parents that you made them proud,” she said.

Swifties are also certain the pop star's next album will have an orange theme.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	There's a lot going on in the Taylor Swift fandom right now. Though the pop star has been keeping out of the spotlight in recent months, the internet is swimming with theories that she's about to make her comeback — and she just might make the big announcement on boyfriend Travis Kelce‘s podcast. 


	It all started Monday morning (Aug. 11), when New Heights — the podcast hosted by the Kansas City Chiefs tight end and his brother, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce — posted an image on X teasing its special guest for this week's episode. In the photo, the two NFL stars smile on either side of a blacked-out silhouette, which Swifties think happens to look a lot like a certain 14-time Grammy winner.

	











	“92%ers, we're coming back early for a special episode with a VERY special guest,” reads the photo's caption, which notes that the episode will drop on Aug. 13, coinciding with Swift's favorite number.




			Trending on Billboard		







	The New Heights teaser image also features a glittery orange background, aligning with long-held fan theories that Swift's next album will have an orange theme. Plus, Jason appears to be wearing an Eras Tour T-shirt. 


	But if those apparent Easter eggs weren't enough to get Swifties riled up, the message Taylor Nation posted just 12 minutes later definitely was. Sharing four images of the musician on stage at past Eras shows, wearing the color — you guessed it — orange in each one, the official fan account wrote, “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era…'”


	Fueling the fire, Taylor Nation quickly followed that post up with two additional batches of four orange-themed Eras outfits in the replies, amounting to 12 pictures total. (Following 2024's The Tortured Poets Department, Swift's next album would be the 12th in her discography.)


	With all of that in mind, Swifties are absolutely losing their minds at the possibility that the singer has new music coming soon. “glittery orange background, taylor nation posted 12 minutes after new heights, the silhouette is shaped like taylor, Jason in eras merch, a ‘VERY' special guest…… what if she announces ts12 on Wednesday the 13th ON NEW HEIGHTS…..,” one person wrote on X.


	“TS12 IS ACTUALLY COMING THIS IS NOT A DRILL WHATS THE PROCEDURE!!” another excited fan posted.


	“travis looking to his left with his Taylor Smile, jason wearing merch, i can see the bangs from a mile away……but most importantly, the background…,” added a third Swiftie. “ts12 confirmed to be orange alert the troops.”


Billboard has reached out to Swift's rep for comment.


	Fans have been waiting to see what the musician will do next ever since the Eras Tour wrapped in December, tying a glittery bow on Swift's first two decades making music. Pulling in more than $2 billion in worldwide grosses, the trek went down in history as the highest earning tour of all time.

	











	And though Swift has never had trouble outdoing herself, her past few projects have left expectations quite high. Her 2022 album, Midnights, won album of the year at the Grammys — making the hitmaker the first artist to ever win the prize four times — while Tortured Poets spent 17 weeks atop the Billboard 200, the third-longest No. 1 run of any album in chart history.

Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. each provided their own take on the conflict, as well as issuing a joint communique on Sunday (Aug. 10).

	All four members of U2 issued statements on Sunday (Aug. 10) expressing their fears that the nearly two-year war between Israel and Hamas has sent the region into “uncharted territory.” In a joint statement from Bono, The Edge, Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton, the group wrote, “Everyone has long been horrified by what is unfolding in Gaza – but the blocking of humanitarian aid and now plans for a military takeover of Gaza City has taken the conflict into uncharted territory. We are not experts in the politics of the region, but we want our audience to know where we each stand.”

	The statements from the band came as experts are warning that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan for a renewed offensive in the Gaza Strip in which forces would take over Gaza City could further exacerbate a malnutrition and starvation crisis that has taken center stage on the eve of the two-year mark of the war.


	In his letter, singer and career-long activist Bono said that he has generally tried to avoid speaking on the politics of the Middle East — with the exception of marking the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on the Nova music festival on the day when Hamas killed more than 1,200 and took more than 250 hostages from Israel — not out of humility, but “more uncertainty in the face of obvious complexity.” 

	











	But as co-founder of the Arfrica-centered global anti-poverty, HIV/AIDS charity ONE, he felt his focus should be on the lives lost in the war in Sudan and Ethiopia, not to mention the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID and the U.S.'s life-saving PEPFAR initiative focusing on fighting HIV/AIDS.


	But, he wrote, “The images of starving children on the Gaza Strip brought me back to a working trip to a food station in Ethiopia my wife Ali and I made 40 years ago next month following U2's participation in Live Aid 1985. Another man-made famine. To witness chronic malnutrition up close would make it personal for any family, especially as it affects children. Because when the loss of non-combatant life en masse appears so calculated… especially the deaths of children, then ‘evil' is not a hyperbolic adjective… in the sacred text of Jew, Christian, and Muslim it is an evil that must be resisted.”


	Bono acknowledged that the rape, murder and abduction of Israelis at the Nova Festival was “evil” and that when he heard about the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas militants on Israel he didn't think of politics. Reacting in real time to the news from the stage of the Sphere where the band were in the midst of their venue-opening residency, he said he couldn't help but “express the pain everyone in the room was feeling and is still feeling for other music lovers and fans like us — hiding under a stage in Kibbutz Re'im then butchered to set a diabolical trap for Israel and to get a war going that might just redraw the map from ‘The river to the sea'… a gamble Hamas' leadership were willing to play with the lives of two million Palestinians… to sow the seeds for a global intifada that U2 had glimpsed at work in Paris during the Bataclan attack in 2015… but only if Israel's leaders fell for this trap that Hamas set for them.”

	











	The singer had pointed words for Israeli PM Netanyahu, as well as late Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, lashing the latter for what he said was Hamas' deliberate positioning of soldiers amid civilian targets, while also asking when a “just war to defend the country turn[ed] into an unjust land grab? I hoped Israel would return to reason. I was making excuses for a people seared and shaped by the experience of Holocaust… who understood the threat of extermination is not simply a fear but a fact… I re-read Hamas' charter of 1988[3]… it's an evil read (Article Seven!)”


	To date, Gaza's Health Ministry has said that more than 61,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, with experts warning that the Palestinian territories under attack could tip into widespread famine soon if food aid is not dramatically increased. 


	Bono said he understands that Hamas doesn't speak for the Palestinian people as a whole, acknowledging their decades of “marginalization, oppression, occupation, and the systematic stealing of the land that is rightfully theirs. Given our own historic experience of oppression and occupation, it's little wonder so many here in Ireland have campaigned for decades for justice for the Palestinian people”; Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap has spoken out loudly and frequently in support of the Palestinian people, drawing a series of festival bans and police investigations over  the past six months for statements they've made on stage.


	“We know Hamas are using starvation as a weapon in the war, but now so too is Israel and I feel revulsion for the moral failure,” Bono continued. “The Government of Israel is not the nation of Israel, but the Government of Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu today deserves our categorical and unequivocal condemnation. There is no justification for the brutality he and his far right government have inflicted on the Palestinian people… in Gaza… in the West Bank. And not just since October 7, well before it too… though the level of depravity and lawlessness we are seeing now feels like uncharted territory.”

	











	Citing a number of instances in which he said the Israeli government has reportedly acknowledged using starvation as a tactic and made their desire to take over the territory plain, the singer wondered how the world had gotten to this point, again. “Is the world not done with this far, far right thinking? We know where it ends… world war… millenarianism,” Bono asked. “Might the world deserve to know where this once promising bright-minded democratic nation is headed unless there is a dramatic change of course? Is what was once an oasis of innovation and free-thinking now in hock to a fundamentalism as blunt as a machete? Are Israelis really ready to let Benjamin Netanyahu do to Israel what its enemies failed to achieve over the last 77 years? And disappear it from membership in a community of nations built around even a flawed decency?”


	A longtime believer in Israel's right to exist, and supporter of a long-sought two-state solution, Bono made clear the band's condemnation of Netanyahu's “immoral actions” and their call for an immediate cease fire. “Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood,” said Bono, who provided a list of article citations in the notes of his message. “We stand in solidarity with the remaining hostages and plead that someone rational negotiate their release.”


	He said the band urges Israelis to demand unfettered access for professionals to help those in need in Gaza and let the correct amount of aid trucks through while pledging to support and donate to the group Medical Aid For Palestinians. 


	Guitarist the Edge also expressed their shock and profound grief at watching the destruction and starvation in Gaza. He posited three questions to Netanyahu: 1) Does he believe that such devastation can happen without “heaping generational shame upon those responsible?” 2) If the end goal is to remove Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank to make way for a “Greater Israel” is that not “ethnic cleansing” or “colonial genocide?” 3) And, if Netanyahu's government rejects a two-state solution, what is their vision for ending the conflict? 

	











	“Simply perpetual conflict? A future of walls, blockades, military occupation?” Edge asked. “A state of permanent inequality? And if this apartheid state transpires don't you destroy the very argument for Israel's existence as a moral response to the horrors of the Holocaust? For if Israel comes to be seen as a state that systematically denies another people their rights, then the world will inevitably ask whether the only just and sustainable future, the only tolerable future, is a shared state — one where Jews and Palestinians live together as equals under the law.”


	Taking the long-running, bloody Troubles in Ireland from the 1960s through the late 1990s as an example of what happens when one side tries to force peace through dominance, Edge said history has taught that “peace is made when people sit down with their opponents — when they recognize the equal dignity of all, even those they once feared or despised. There can be no peace without justice. No reconciliation without recognition.” 


	The message from Clayton echoed the collective feeling that the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza “looks like revenge on a civilian population who are not responsible for Hamas' murderous attack,” warning that if Israel moves forward with colonizing Gaza it will, “permanently undo any possibility of lasting peace or solution for hostilities.” 


	Mullen Jr. wondered what Hamas was thinking when they undertook their bloody incursion, noting that a ground war and aerial bombardment from the militarily superior Israeli forces was a given, though what he described as the “indiscriminate decimation of most homes and hospitals in Gaza, with a majority of those killed being women and children” was not expected. Nor, he writes, was “imposing famine.” 

	











	The Netanyahu government has repeatedly denied that a famine is taking place or that Israel is attempting to starve Palestinians by choking off food aid into the territories — often claiming that, despite scant evidence, Hamas is looting the supplies. Mullen said that it was difficult to comprehend how “any civilized society can think starving children is going to further any cause and be justified as an acceptable response to another horror. To state the obvious, starving innocent civilians as a weapon of war is inhumane and criminal.”


	He wondered where the outrage was from within, and without, Israel about the reported famine, noting that “the power to change this obscenity is in the hands of Israel.”

""We're in a time where the right price can silence the voice of free speech, which we should be very, very conscious of,"" said Batiste.

	Jessica Lynch



	Jon Batiste is speaking out following CBS' decision to end The Late Show With Stephen Colbert in 2026.


	In a new interview with Rolling Stone AU/NZ, the Grammy-winning musician and former Late Show bandleader called the move “a symptom of big money,” warning about the impact of corporate decisions on free speech.


	“We're in a time where the right price can silence the voice of free speech, which we should be very, very conscious of,” said Batiste, who led the show's house band from 2015 to 2022. “As artists, we have to constantly fight for free speech and fight for the ability to be able to share the authentic truth of our being.”

	CBS announced last month that the show would end next year, citing financial reasons. However, the decision has stirred controversy and drawn criticism from several high-profile figures, including Jon Stewart and David Letterman, and prompted speculation about possible political motivations.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Batiste reflected on his seven-year tenure alongside Colbert to the publication, which began when he was in his 20s. “It meant so much to be on national television and learning the ropes of being on a nightly show with a band, and really being on camera and doing that for seven years. And to evolve as an artist in partnership with him,” he said. “I'm very grateful to him and I think where he goes next, his voice won't be silenced.”


	The cancellation of The Late Show comes 10 years after Colbert took it over from prior host David Letterman. CBS has made it clear that it won't be replacing the Daily Show alum with someone new, but is canning the program altogether.

	











	“We are proud that Stephen called CBS home,” the network added in its statement. “He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television.”


	Batiste is set to release his new album Big Money later this year.

""That baby doesn't even know what it's doing here,"" Maluma told the fan at his Mexico City concert. ""Next time, protect their ears or something.

	Tyler Jenke



	Colombian musician Maluma has paused his recent show in Mexico City to stand up for one of his youngest concertgoers and their fragile ears.


	The incident, which took place during the singer's three-night run of shows at Palacio de los Deportes, saw the chart-topping artist focus his attention on an audience member who had brought a young child along to the show – apparently without proper ear protection.


	“With all due respect… how old are they?” Maluma can be heard asking the child's guardian in a video shared online, per Variety. “A year old? Less? A year. Do you think it's a good idea to bring a one-year-old baby to a concert where the decibels are this f–king high? Where is the sound this loud?

	“I'm telling you with all love and respect, now that I'm a father… would never bring them to a concert. For the next time, be a bit more aware.”

	As Maluma mentioned, he and partner Susana Gomez welcomed their first child last year, with Paris Londoño Gomez being born on March 9, 2024. The musician shared his first photos with his daughter just two weeks later, accompanying the post with a caption that read, “My first 15 days as a Dad, this is the best I've ever lived in my Life.”


	The recent incident took place as part of Maluma's +Pretty +Dirty World Tour, which launched in Spain in March before touring throughout Europe and Latin America until May. The current run of dates in Mexico launched in Mexico City on Aug. 6 and will wrap with a date in Guadalajara on Aug. 16 before the larger tour finishes with a show in El Salvador on Aug. 23.

EXCLUSIVE: Following word this past spring that a package was coming together for a Rambo prequel, Millennium Media looks to have its man as sources tell Deadline that Noah Centineo is attached to star in John Rambo. Sisu director Jalmari Helander is set to direct from a screenplay by writing duo Rory Haines and Sohrab Noshirvani.


	Sources say that the package still has a couple of hurdles to overcome, but things are headed in the right direction with hopes to shoot in the fall in Thailand. Insiders also add that while no deals are in place, Lionsgate is the front-runner to land the package. The studio has released the past two Rambo pics and also has a relationship with Helander having worked with him on Sisu.












	The film's plot is under wraps, but it will be the origin story of a young John Rambo during the Vietnam War. One of the most iconic action heroes in U.S. cinema, the character was created by David Morell in his novel First Blood. The original 1982 film saw saw Sylvester Stallone play the veteran Green Beret, who is forced by a cruel sheriff and his deputies to flee into the mountains and wage an escalating one-man war against his pursuers. The five movies in the franchise have generated more than $800 million worldwide; the most recent, 2019's Rambo: Last Blood, produced by Millennium and Sly's Balboa, made $92M at the box office.

	As for Stallone, when Deadline first reported on the package, insiders told Deadline he was aware of the project but was not involved, and as of today that remains the same. Sources now say that Stallone has been alerted to Centineo's attachment.

	











	Producers on the latest installment are Kevin King-Templeton on behalf of Templeton Media, Les Weldon, Jonathan Yunger and Avi Lerner. Executive producers include Trevor Short and Bonfire Legends' Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmyk.


	As for Centineo, his star has been on the rise after breakout roles in the Netflix hit series To All the Boys I Loved Before and The Recruit, but this is sort of role that could launch a young star onto the A-list. Up next, he will star as Ken Masters in Legendary's live-action adaptation of Street Fighter, starring opposite Jason Momoa and Andrew Koji. Directed by Kitao Sakurai, the film is slated for release in 2026.


	Most recently, Centineo appeared in A24's Warfare from Ray Mendoza and Alex Garland, as well as in Oscar Boyson's directorial debut Our Hero, Balthazar, which he also produced under his Arkhum banner. The latter premiered at this year's Tribeca Film Festival.


	Centineo is repped by WME and Myman Greenspan Fox.

EXCLUSIVE: A hot new bombshell enters Digital Brand Architects (DBA) as Love Island USA‘s Olandria Carthen signs with the UTA-owned management firm.

	The former Islander made waves on Love Island USA with her effortless confidence, southern charm, and striking on-screen presence. The 27-year-old Alabama native is also a first‑generation college graduate with a degree from Tuskegee.

	Carthen was a Love Island USA Season 7 fan favorite from the beginning as she showed her journey to finding love on the show.

EXCLUSIVE: In the latest streaming milestone, ESPN and Fox are forming a bundle of their soon-to-launch services, Deadline has learned.


Fox One, which brings together sports, news and entertainment from across Fox's broadcast and cable channels, and ESPN's dramatically beefed-up direct-to-consumer offering are both launching on August 21. Fox One is priced at $19.99 a month and ESPN has an introductory price of $29.99.


	The bundle will launch October 2 and cost $39.99 a month, according to a person familiar with the rollout.

	The team-up is the latest example of third-party bundling, but the first notable package involving major sports rights holders. Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery launched a combo last year of HBO Max, Disney+ and Hulu, with both companies indicating it has gained a degree of traction. Consumers are being confronted by significant price increases and overwhelming choice in the marketplace.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	While sports is the connective tissue between Fox One and ESPN, the former will also include programming from the Fox broadcast network and local stations as well as Fox News, Fox Business and Fox Weather. For an avid sports fan, given that ESPN offers marquee fare like the NFL, NBA and major college conferences, the bundle could be combined with Paramount+ and NBCUniversal's Peacock to offer fairly comprehensive reach below the price of most pay-TV packages.


	Execs at Disney and Fox have described their respective new outlets as complements to their linear business. Programmers across the industry are adjusting their strategies as the traditional bundle keeps shrinking. “We are ultimately going to judge ourselves based on the totality of people subscribing to ESPN,” ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said at a May press event for the new service. “We are not going to look at one specific platform.”


Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch has said that pricing for Fox One will be “healthy” and in line with wholesale rates charged to pay-TV distributors. Bundling, he said last May, is also a priority.

	











	Disney and Fox were partners, along with WBD, in the ill-fated Venu Sports, a joint streaming venture that was scrapped last January before it ever launched after an antitrust lawsuit by pay-TV operator Fubo. Some of Venu's infrastructure, which cost the JV partners tens of millions of dollars to develop, is being repurposed for Fox One. Pete Distad, who was heading up Venu, joined Fox earlier this year as CEO of Fox One. 


	“Working with Fox One on this bundle offer allows us to bring ESPN's world-class sports content to even more fans in a seamless and innovative way,” Sean Breen, EVP, Disney Platform Distribution, said in a statement. “This collaboration reflects our shared commitment to delivering premium experiences across platforms and meeting consumers where they are – anytime, anywhere.”


	Forming the bundle “is evidence of our desire to deliver the best possible value and viewing experience to our shared customers,” said Tony Billetter, SVP, Strategy and Business Development, Fox Direct to Consumer. Fox, he added, continues to seek “opportunities to streamline the user experience, especially for the ultimate sports fan.”


	The ESPN direct-to-consumer offering is available for pay-TV subscribers whose packages include ESPN. It offers all of ESPN's linear networks as well as ESPN on ABC, ESPN+, SECN+, and ACCNX, spanning some 47,000 live events a year as well as studio shows and original programming. NFL content on the app is also expanding via a deal announced last week between the league and Disney.


	 Along with the Fox broadcast network, cable's FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network, Fox One offers add-on subscriptions to Fox Nation and Big Ten premium outlet B1G+.

Coming on the heels of Fox canceling almost all of their sports related programming, this represents an very poor value.

Fox News? Nope.

If MNF and Fox's Sunday games remain available via an antenna, that's forty bucks I won't be spending.

Wait..they want me to get Fox News on my espn streaming device if I bundle this up? 

Not a chance.

Like it or not Fox holds the broadcast rights to most NFC NFL games and many college football games. I subscribe to YouTube TV but never watch Faux News.

This is nice progress.
I'll be interested to know if there are DVR capabilities.
A lot of sports air well past midnight on the east coast, and I like to catch up the next day to see the results.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Donald Trump said Monday that he was deploying the National Guard in Washington, D.C. and placing the city's Metropolitan Police under federal control.


	Portraying the capital city as a crime-ridden hellhole, Trump told reporters that the city “is becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness.”


	“We're taking our capital back,” Trump said.


	Attorney General Pam Bondi will oversee the city's police department. She was present along with Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News host, FBI director Kash Patel, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

	











	While there is a crime problem in D.C., and while stats are meaningless to victims, the rate actual fell last year, per the Metropolitan Police, with violent crime down 26%.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump also has announced efforts to clean up the city and rid the area of homeless encampments, and said the city would no longer be a sanctuary for illegal aliens.


	Even before Trump's announcement, which was expected, Democrats cast it as an effort to change the subject from a sputtering economy and continued inflation, as well as the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. And as the president has tried to characterize himself as a president of law and order, opponents point to his pardoning of those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on January 6, including those who attacked police officers.


	Trump posited cases of suspects spitting on cops, and said that the federalized D.C. police force will be able to do “whatever the hell they want.”

	











	As Trump spoke, protesters were gathered on 16th Street, near Lafayette Park, singing “D.C. is our home. You can't have it Trump.” In the 2024 election, Kamala Harris received 90% of the district vote compared to Trump. The president also has created further dismay among city residents with the mass layoffs of federal workers, which has been a gut punch to the region's economy.


	The president's action is his latest effort to exert more control over D.C. and its institutions in his second term. He ousted Biden-appointed board members of the Kennedy Center and ensured that he was named chairman, while ousting the Librarian of Congress and paving over the grass lawn near the White House Rose Garden.


	Trump controls the National Guard in the city, and he cited a provision in the Home Rule Act in federalizing the city's police department. 


	Trump's action follows some high-profile incidents, including the assault of a staffer for the Department of Government Efficiency during a carjacking.


	Trump's press conference today was carried by major news networks, with coverage also on local network broadcast stations. MSNBC broke away at one point for commentary, but returned when the president took reporters' questions.


	In his remarks, Trump decried a “sick woke culture,” as he referred to the toppling of statues following the killing of George Floyd in 2020. The protests near Lafayette Park beset the area near the White House for about a week, with a fence barrier erected around the grounds.


	Trump also said that it was essential to clean up the streets — from sidewalks to medians — to make a show to foreign leaders and tourists on their visit.


	Trump's deployment of the National Guard follows his federalizing of troops in June in Los Angeles, as protests broke out over his administration's ICE raids.


	He also signaled that he planned to take action in other cities, including Chicago, with his actions in D.C. as a model.


	“Maybe they will self clean up; maybe they will self do this,” Trump said, while he also cited cities with cashless bail.


	As he tends to do, during his press conference, Trump veered off into other topics, including transgender men playing in women's sports, and that the 2020 election was “rigged,” adding fuel to Democrats' argument that his press conference was an attention ploy.


	“Trump is testing his ability to take over entire cities with military force. This is terrible federal overreach,” the Democratic National Committee said in an X post.


	California Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office posted on X, “Washington, DC — here's what you can expect now that the president wants to cosplay as dictator in your city, too: Soldiers sitting around with nothing to do; Lies from all levels of the federal government; No meaningful impact.”

Distraction, in any form he can muster.

So when it's his supporters committing the violence and the vandalism and injuring police officers, that's the time to sit back and do nothing, especially if he's the entire reason they were there. And later pardon them. And even better, hire 'em in the DOJ.

But if you're homeless, an addict, or you're brown with a funny accent, the Gestapo's comin' for ya.

He also wants to take over cities with black mayors. Hmmm. Wonder what that is about.

Sick bloke culture: you refuse to call out the National Guard on Jan 6th for four hours, but you'll call them out to distract people from being all over the Epstein files.

Perfectly stated.

I wonder what the response would be if Biden or Obama tried to take over a Red city?

Political Editor


Donald Trump continued to rage at media figures overnight, this time former New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.


	Trump wrote on Truth Social late Sunday, “Paul Krugman of the New York Times has been predicting Doom and Gloom ever since my great election success in 2016. In other words, he has been wrong for YEARS, as ALL markets have been hitting new HIGHS, and are now higher than ever before. People stayed out of the ‘BEST MARKET IN HISTOY' [sic] because of this Trump Deranged BUM. Sue them!”


	Krugman left The New York Times late last year, but now writes a daily column on Substack. He's been especially hard-hitting on Trump's tariffs and the president's trade deals, while warning of stagflation.

	In his most recent column, posted on Monday morning, Krugman mocked Trump's effort to counter a recent dismal jobs report by holding a presentation in the Oval Office last week with economist Stephen Moore, with a chart that mistakenly labeled “median income”, “medium income.” Moore, Krugman wrote, “may be the last person on the planet you'd trust to tell you the economic truth.” Moore's figures, which showed a recent rise in median income with figures that were quickly challenged.

	“I don't mean that Moore is extremely right-wing, although of course he is,” Krugman wrote. “I don't even mean that he's a dishonest hack, although again of course he is. I mean that even among dishonest right-wing hacks Moore stands out for his pathological inability to get numbers and facts right.”

	











	As for Trump's attack on him, Krugman wrote, “Now this is flattering: Last night Donald Trump called me a ‘Deranged BUM.' Gonna add it to my profile.”

Dunno if Krugman is a “deranged ‘bum'” , but he certainly is a quack.

That's nice. Release the Epstein files.

JEFFREY EPSTEIN.

The Emperor has no clothes.

You sure about that? Trump is going to get Obergefell overturned, and it's a decision supported by a plurality of young voters. 

Meanwhile, Krugman has been exiled to “retirement”.

Overturning same sex marriage is not supported by a plurality of young voters, who can't even afford rent, bills, or home, let alone find jobs that pay a decent wage.  But go on…

Then why is everyone on TV constantly melting down?

I think people need to leave Trump  alone. He has done a good job so far.he has been criticized enough by the media. Also those democrats who left Texas need to  come back to work or lose their jobs. I am a navy veteran who is tired of democrats throwing hissy fits cause they didn't get there way

Quoth Marsha Stanley: “I am a navy veteran who is tired of democrats throwing hissy fits cause they didn't get there way”.
I think the English language requirement which the MAGAs are currently trying to implement would certainly put you on the ICE watchlist. Stop posting, go fishing.

Oh Marsha, Marsha, Marsha…….

As opposed to the sober, quiet Republicans?

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","AOL calls time of death on dial-up internet","https://www.avclub.com/aol-dial-up-ending-september","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:19:10 GMT","

The internet is changing rapidly, but the death of dial-up has been slow. According to The New York Times, in 2023 dial-up still served an estimated 163,000 households in the United States, or just over one percent of the nation's household internet subscriptions. That one percent will have to find an alternative come September, when AOL will officially shut down the iconic but already archaic method of getting on the web. 

“AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet,” the company wrote in a statement posted to its website. “This service will no longer be available in AOL plans. As a result, on September 30, 2025 this service and the associated software, the AOL Dialer software and AOL Shield browser, which are optimized for older operating systems and dial-up internet connections, will be discontinued.”

Given its very small customer base, the phasing out of dial-up was inevitable, though there are still places in the United States (and certainly the world) without reliable access to the internet. Satellite television is also on the decline; earlier this year DirecTV began “experimenting” with only offering streaming options in certain areas. In rural areas without internet access streaming would also be impossible, and there is not yet infrastructure in place for widespread broadband access. If services like these die before that infrastructure exists, there may be parts of the country completely cut off from access to information. For those of us who do have internet access, information is becoming completely siloed as Google devalues its own search engine in favor of generative artificial intelligence, a move that could in turn collapse the online media industry as we know it. It appears the Digital Age was built on a troublingly unsound foundation. At this rate, who knows what the next age is going to look like.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Spoiler Space: Tragedy doesn't actually bring anyone together in Weapons","https://www.avclub.com/spoiler-space-weapons-plot-structure-villain-reveal","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:33:59 GMT","

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Weapons and Barbarian.

Writer-director Zach Cregger's domestic anxieties have only gotten worse in the years since 2022's Barbarian. Leaving behind the specific issues of urban decay and gentrification, Cregger approaches broader themes for a wider audience in his major studio follow-up, Weapons. Broken into six chapters, Weapons tells of a community-wide tragedy from the perspective of six Maybrook households, with varying connections to the central disappearance of 17 schoolchildren. Continuing his idiosyncratic narrative structures, Cregger inverts Barbarian's form, shifting the question from “Whose house is this?” to “Whose house is that?” In doing so, his sprawling, Altman-meets-Twin Peaks dissection of a town shows how tragedy doesn't actually bring people together, but widens their divisions.

Drawing from America's real-life wealth of viral, chaotic PTA and school board meetings about guns, bathrooms, and books, a meeting in an auditorium is the only scene in Weapons where the town is shown together, and it immediately falls apart, leaving the attendees to break off into the night with no hopes of communal solutions. Cregger announces his structure shortly after, mirroring the fractured town by segmenting the film into interlocking stories that reveal how the disappearance of (almost) an entire elementary school class exacerbates pre-existing flaws. For the missing kids' teacher, Justine (Julia Garner), that means indulging her drinking problem and penchant for disastrous hookups. For Archer (Josh Brolin), the father of one of the missing, it means falling down the local conspiracy rabbit hole, poring over Ring cam footage for clues when he isn't painting “Witch” on the side of Justine's car. He doesn't even know how close he is to the answer.

Like a scary Short Cuts, Weapons creates a chain of cause and effect, with each character taking their pain out on a different neighbor. Archer harasses Justine, so Justine drinks too much and calls Paul (Alden Ehrenreich), a local cop and recovering alcoholic. Paul sleeps with Justine, gets caught, and takes his angry regret out on an unhoused meth addict, James (Austin Abrams). Ironically, in doing so, Paul prevents everyone from solving the central mystery, which James has the answer to. Cregger gives us a wider view of things, so we can squirm as Paul calls his wife two chapters after we saw him get with Justine. But the effect allows for a broader statement on how Americans treat each other when tragedy strikes. There is no community effort to find these kids, no sense of ongoing support or house-to-house searches, even though the entire class is only a few blocks away, standing in the basement of the house of the only kid who didn't run away. Clearly, Maybrook's antisocial tendencies existed before 2:17 A.M. As Archer learns, even the parents going through the same tragedy can't relate to one another; they've barely interacted.

Suburban, household horror is nothing new to Cregger. In Barbarian, he dug deep into the bones of an old house turned Airbnb. There's a specificity to Barbarian‘s primary location, 476 Barbary, the only home still standing in the decaying neighborhood of Brightmoor, Detroit. Cregger creates a layered narrative, starting at the top floor and digging down into the basement, sub-basement, and dungeon, revealing how deep the rot goes and the era that led to it. 

Barbarian kicked off a wave of movies about young people being lured into houses. Recently, Bring Her Back and Heretic saw innocent teens having their young lives upended by quirky adults who reveal themselves to be witches looking to shove them into an oven. Barbarian takes a different approach to a similar premise: Rather than spending the movie exploring what the villain wants, Barbarian wants to know who owns this space, and with every new revelation, we're introduced to another occupant and link in the chain that led to its current state. The movie takes us from Airbnb guests, gentrifying property managers, and absentee landlords, back to the homicidal original owner, whose terror lived in the Reagan era, when residents fled the area and allowed Brightmoor's urban blight to begin. This narrow focus allowed Cregger to address a specific problem facing cities. By moving to the suburbs, Weapons explores a broader issue of the antisocial surveillance state, where not even single-family fortresses are safe and nobody knows their neighbors.

In both films, Cregger places the same minotaur at the end of the labyrinth: A hag thriving off local strife. Like Barbarian‘s Mother (Matthew Patrick Davis), Weapons‘ central villain, Gladys (Amy Madigan), is a grotesque representation of an older woman playacting as a nurturing mother. Whether or not Cregger blames mothers for societal breakdown is between the filmmaker and his therapist, but they are manifestations of a persistent neglect. Gladys takes advantage of this, worming her way into the community by posing as a caretaker and letting the town do the rest. She lucked out by finding a place with no shared camaraderie, and school administrators who know nothing about their students.

Ironically, Weapons‘ expansiveness extends to Gladys' death. Instead of Mother's bullet to the brain for an audience of one, Weapons concludes with a tear through an entire neighborhood, introducing us to faces, backyards, and living rooms the characters never bothered to explore beforehand. For the first time since the school board meeting, the town gathers—this time to watch their children tear Gladys limb from limb. It's nice to see a community come together.

Fights are coming to Paramount. Well, fights over the future of the company have been happening behind the scenes, on camera, and in the government for months now, but this is a different, not as could-impact-the-foundation-of-our-country-forever type of fighting. The now-Skydance-owned media giant has secured rights to the UFC in a massive $7.7 billion deal, The Verge reports. Starting in 2026, Paramount will stream the UFC's full slate of 13 marquee events plus 30 “Fight Nights” for seven years. 

The fights will be streamed live for Paramount subscribers without any additional paywalls, bucking the pay-per-view model ESPN+ has utilized in the past. The Disney-owned streamer's deal with TKO Group, the UFC's parent company, expires at the end of this year. Paramount will also simulcast some events on CBS.

In a statement, TKO Group's president Mark Shapiro celebrated the change. “The pay-per-view model is a thing of the past,” he said, per CNBC. “What's on pay-per-view anymore? Boxing? Movies on DirecTV? It's an outdated, antiquated model. So, it was paramount to us—forgive the pun—where it's one-stop shopping, especially for our younger fans in flyover states. When they find out, ‘Wait, if I just sign up for Paramount+ for $12.99 a month, I'm going to automatically get UFC's numbered fights and the rest of the portfolio?' That's a message we want to amplify.”

New Paramount CEO David Ellison, a self-described UFC fan, expressed that he wanted to secure the pricey package due to the dearth of new sports rights currently available to streamers, CNBC reports. (The outlet points out that Formula 1 will likely go to Apple, while Major League Baseball is waiting until 2028 to reorganize its media packages.) “UFC is a unicorn asset that comes up about once a decade,” Ellison said of the deal. Paramount is reportedly also interested in purchasing UFC's international rights, but those are only available on a rolling basis. For now, the streamer's fights will remain on U.S. soil.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Bobby Whitlock, co-founder of Derek And The Dominos","https://www.avclub.com/bobby-whitlock-obituary-derek-and-the-dominos","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 00:37:00 GMT","

Bobby Whitlock has died. The co-founder of Derek And The Dominos, who, across his eclectic career, went from a fly-on-the-wall at Stax Records to backing up George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and The Rolling Stones, among others, writing and performing some of the 1970s' most beloved rock songs. His manager, Carol Kaye, confirmed that he died of cancer. He was 77.

“How do you express in but a few words the grandness of one man who came from abject poverty in the south to heights unimagined in such a short time?” Whitlock's wife, Coco Carmel Whitlock, said in a statement to CBS News. “As he would always say: ‘Life is what you make it, so take it and make it beautiful.' And he did. Farewell, my Love, I'll see you in my dreams.”

Born in Memphis in 1948, Whitlock started playing music as a teenager, performing with his band, The Counts. The band would cover Stax songs and caught the attention of artists like Wilson Pickett and Booker T. & The M.G's. He became the first white artist signed to Stax HIP label in the label's attempt to “cash in on contemporary pop.” But Whitlock wasn't much of a fan of the British invasion. He was into Memphis soul, and the signing allowed him to sit in on some of Stax's legendary recording sessions. Eventually, Stax session bassist Donald “Duck” Dunn took Whitlock to see husband and wife singer-songwriters Delaney & Bonnie. Whitlock played keyboards and sang on the group's first two albums, Home and Accept No Substitute, but, perhaps more significantly, the couple introduced the keyboardist to Eric Clapton. In 1969, Bonnie & Delaney & Friends were touring with one of Clapton's supergroups, Blind Faith. After the tour, Whitlock was out of the job and returned to England, where he and Clapton began writing what would become Derek And The Dominos' Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs.

“I learned from the best,” Whitlock said in 2012. “I'm probably the only person in the world that actually had hands-on guitar instructions from Eric Clapton and Duane Allman and Delaney Bramlett and George Harrison, that's for sure. Where they'd say, ‘No, Bobby, put your hands here, it goes like this.'”

In 1970, Whitlock was something of a classic rock Zelig, appearing on All Things Must Pass, Eric Clapton, Exile On Main Street, and Layla. While the latter is often considered a Clapton-first album, Whitlock wrote or co-wrote six of its 14 tracks, providing, as The A.V. Club's Noel Murray wrote in 2012, “a much-needed foil for Clapton, keeping him in a down-home, country-soul mood.” Derek And The Dominos broke up in 1971, primarily due to Clapton's drug use, which left him unable to play and damaged their friendship.

“Our dear friend Bobby Whitlock has passed away at 77,” Clapton wrote on Facebook. Our sincere condolences to Bobby's wife CoCo and his family on this sad day…. RIP.”

Whitlock continued releasing solo albums after the dissolution of the Dominos, including Red Velvet. After 1976's Rock Your Sox Off, Whitlock took a decades-long hiatus, moving to a Mississippi farm and taking the occasional session gig. Though he stopped because “there was nothing going on in music,” he did claim indirect responsibility for disco. [Clapton's manager] Robert Stigwood took the Dominos' money, used it to create RSO Records and record the Bee Gees.”

He returned to the stage with 1999's It's About Time. With his wife, musician CoCo Carmel, he released a live album, Other Assorted Love Songs, in 2003. Whittlock and Carmel would release several more records together, including 2008's Lovers and 2012's Esoteric. The following year, a compilation of his first two albums was released under the name ‌Where There's A Will There's A Way: The ABC-Dunhill Recordings.

Whitlock is survived by his wife and three children.

Jennifer Lopez handled an unexpected onstage visitor like a total pro. While performing during her Up All Night: Live in 2025 tour stop in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on Aug. 10, the 56-year-old superstar kept singing even as a large cricket crawled up her dress & onto her neck, before tossing it aside with a laugh.

A post shared by On The JLo (@onthejlo)

The former “American Idol” judge, 56, was in the middle of her Up All Night: Live in 2025 tour stop in Almaty, Kazakhstan, on Aug. 10 when a large cricket crawled up her dress in full view of the crowd.

While singing in front of a microphone, the insect made its way up her torso & onto her neck. Without missing a note, Lopez calmly grabbed the cricket & tossed it to the side of the stage.

“It was tickling me,” she laughed, telling fans before jumping right back into her performance.

In a video shared by Lopez's official fan account, the lighthearted caption read: “Plot twist: @JLo just started rehearsals for Kiss of the Cricket Woman … on stage … in real time. 😂💋🦗.”

The reference was a playful nod to her upcoming film “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” set to premiere this fall.

A fan wrote: “She is just the best! 🩷✨ really fun moment but so professional at the same time! 🦗✨” 

Another fan praised JLo and shared: “This is Hilarious OMG 😂hahahah love her” Third one chimed in and wrote: “My Brave Woman !Stay Blessed❤️”

The cricket cameo wasn't Lopez's only headline-making onstage moment this summer. On July 25, during her show in Warsaw, Poland, she experienced a wardrobe malfunction when her glittery skirt unexpectedly snapped off & fell to the floor.

Smiling & strutting around the stage in her underwear, Lopez laughed it off: “I'm out here in my underwear. That's gonna be everywhere.”

She later joked, “I'm glad they reinforced that costume. And I'm glad I had underwear on. I don't usually wear underwear.”

The lighthearted stage moments haven't slowed Lopez's tour momentum. Her Up All Night: Live in 2025 shows have been packed with high-energy performances & fan-favorite hits.

Later this year, she will star in “Kiss of the Spider Woman,” a new film adaptation of the 1993 Broadway classic, proving that whether on stage or screen, J.Lo knows how to keep audiences talking.

One of daytime's most legendary actresses is relocating at the age of 86. Susan Flannery, who played Laura Spencer Horton on “Days of Our Lives” and Stephanie Douglas Forrester on “The Bold and the Beautiful,” is moving Down Under. Her daughter, Blaise, has lived in Australia for years with her children, so plenty of family time is in Susan's future!

Her close friend from Days, Susan Seaforth Hayes, shared the news in a new Instagram post.

The iconic soap star has been close to both Susan Seaforth Hayes and Suzanne Rogers since the earliest  “Days of Our Lives” era. According to Soap Opera Digest, Rogers credits Susan Flannery with getting her hired by the soap.

When speaking about getting the role of Maggie, she said, “Susan Flannery was a big influence. She was walking through the booth at the time the two of us were testing, and she said some very nice things about me, so I understand, and that's how I got the part. I've always had a warm place in my heart for Susan.”

All three ladies got together before Susan's big move. Much to the delight of soap fans, Susan Seaforth Hayes shared the occasion on Instagram.

“3 Susies have breakfast at Art's Deli.

The occasion: Susan Flannery, one of the great ladies of daytime or anywhere she turns up- is moving to Australia. Flannery was a beloved mentor and pal to Suzanne and me in our early Salem Days together.

Laughs, love, tears, hugs… just like Salem.We will miss her.”

A post shared by Bill & Susan Hayes (@billsusanhayes)

Flannery has always been extremely private. Back in 2002, she confirmed that she had an adopted daughter named Blaise. It was recently confirmed that Blaise now lives in Australia with her children.

The actress's soap career is a dream come true. She earned 10 nominations in the Outstanding Lead Actress category at the Daytime Emmys, winning on her first try, in 1975, for her work on “Days of Our Lives.” Three more wins followed for her portrayal of B&B's Stephanie. 

Flannery became the first actress ever to win the Lead Actress award for two different roles on two different soaps. After 25 years on B&B, Susan Flannery retired from acting. She remains close friends with former co-star Katherine Kelly Lang, who has frequently posted photos of the two of them together.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jonathan Bennett Reveals Husband's Life-Altering Surgery Was a Success (VIDEO)","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/jonthan-bennett-husband-jaymes-vaughan-surgery/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:19:30 GMT","

For the first time in his adult life, musician and TV personality Jaymes Vaughan can eat without getting sick, thanks to a successful surgery for a condition he's been suffering from for years. His husband, Hallmark star Jonathan Bennett, shared the emotional update on August 10, 2025. 

“This is the first time over the over 3,400 meals I've sat across from him where I didn't feel like he was fighting for his life just to get through it,” Bennett captioned a social media photo that showed Vaughan chewing his food at a restaurant and getting choked up — not by the meal, but by the sheer emotion of being able to swallow his food normally. 

“My husband has a condition that made it impossible for him to eat without throwing up for almost his entire adult life,” Bennett revealed, and then shared more about the procedure that is changing Vaughan's life. 

A post shared by Jonathan Bennett (@jonathandbennett)

Opening up about Vaughn's surgery, Bennett shared in his post, “Yesterday he got the procedure to open up his throat and this is his first meal after fixing what's called a Schatzki ring. A Schatzki ring, also known as a lower esophageal ring, is a ring of tissue that forms at the lower end of the esophagus, near where it connects with the stomach. It can make eating incredibly difficult.”

The symptoms of a Schatzki ring typically develop after the age of 25, according to the Cleveland Clinic, and can cause food to get stuck. A person with the condition then struggles to swallow and may experience burning or sharp pains in their chest when they eat. 

For two decades, Vaughan didn't know why he had so much trouble eating nor that he had a Schatzki ring, named for the radiologist who first discovered the condition, per Cleveland Clinic. 

“Sharing this in case it could help someone who has this condition but didn't know about it for 20 years like my husband,” Bennett wrote in his post. “Talk to your doctor and ask questions, you never know how much it can help your life.”

Social media followers flooded Bennett's video, in which Vaughan got teary-eyed as he marveled at being able to swallow with ease.  

Bennett's “The Groomsmen” co-star Heather Hemmens wrote, “Omg 🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽” and Tyler Hynes left a healing heart emoji in the comments — “❤️‍🩹”

Another fellow Hallmark star, Hunter King, wrote, “❤️ this angel deserves the world!!!”

One of Bennett's followers who works in the medical field offered, “Being a Surgical RN, I'm familiar with the condition and procedure. So happy for him that he can now enjoy a delicious meal without worry. ❤️”

Hundreds of others celebrated the huge milestone for Vaughan, with one sweetly writing, “So, so happy for you both! He now knows the feeling of what we take for granted every day! I know it was hard watching him struggle, so happy for you too! ❤️❤️❤️”

Soap fans know that recasts are always tricky, but even more so for a beloved character. When Rory Gibson took over the role of GH's Michael Corinthos in May 2025, he had his work cut out for him, or so it seemed. Chad Duell had just left the role a few months earlier, and he had played Michael for over a decade. The deck seemed stacked against Rory, but from his very first appearance at the nurse's ball, everything just clicked.

Fans embraced him in his very first week on “General Hospital,” and he seems to fit right in amongst the cast. If you are new to the soap, then you'd likely think that Rory has been a part of the ensemble for years. 

Rory recently sat for “State of Mind,” his co-star, Maurice Benard's, mental health series, and gave a pretty raw interview. As it turns out, the actor has overcome mountains of adversity to get to where he is right now.

Before GH, Rory played the role of Sharon and Nick's son, Noah Newman, on “The Young and the Restless,” from 2021 to 2023. What started as a contract role turned into a recurring character that just disappeared. The actor discussed with Maurice how, after being let go from Y&R, he and his model fiancée, Alicia Ruela, struggled financially.

“Things got real, real bumpy for a while because we hit the (writers) strikes. I've never shared this publicly, but me and my fiancée were essentially homeless.”

He continued, “I was doing Y&R and then I went recurring, and I was working here and there for a little while. Then, I booked one really big one – a small role in like the Zack Snyder movie, I was pumped on it. Then, I kept testing for these big projects. I kept testing. I'm (feeling I'm) on the right road, and the  strikes hit, and everything shuts down. Simultaneously, I'm not getting called in for Y&R anymore. So, all of a sudden everything goes dry. I already wasn't making a ton of money. It got to a point where she (Alicia) was modeling professionally and that dried up too. Neither of us were making any money and we couldn't afford a rent, and we had to bounce out. We were couch-surfing for almost a year.”

Rory then explained how things slowly began to improve. “That was most of 2023 and then in 2024, I ended up getting back to work as a trainer at Barry's Bootcamp gym. It like I was resetting in a strange way. I started working there again, started doing my thing, and the industry was still really slow. Slowly, it started to pick up and life got kind of comfortable again.”

While going through the scary times and then slowly starting to stabilize his life, Rory found himself grateful.

He explained, “It was this weird acceptance of like, I'm pursuing the thing that I love (acting) and that I want to do, and that I want to make something out of my my life with, and I want to enjoy what I do while simultaneously having to accept the fact that its going to come with a lot of trials and tribulations.”

“In hindsight, you look back on it and say, ‘If I hadn't essentially been let go from Y&R and say, if I hadn't had to couch surf for a year, and if I wasn't broke, and I didn't have to go through all the other stuff too,” then maybe GH wouldn't have ended up being his current silver lining.

He also realizes that being let go from Y&R was a blessing because it wasn't the best role for his career. As for GH and the role of Michael Corinthos, Rory says, “I feel extremely fulfilled.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Has This Former RHOP Star Found a New Man?","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/rhop-star-mia-thornton-bobby-valentino/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:26:30 GMT","

Mia Thornton may be out at the “Real Housewives of Potomac,” but it looks like she may have found love with a new man. She first raised eyebrows on Aug. 7, 2025, when she was spotted smooching Bobby Valentino during DeShae Frost's Twitch stream.

Mia's appearance with Bobby wasn't just a fluke, because she has also taken to Instagram to share some fun times with her rumored new man.

The Twitch stream disappeared about one week after Mia popped up and surprised Bobby Valentino with a bouquet of flowers.

“Every legend deserves their flowers and your favorite snacks (grapes),” she said in an August 5, 2025, Instagram Story. “No, seriously. We celebrate all wins.”

After reading the card attached to the flowers, Bobby said, “Nobody ever does anything nice for me. Thank you, Mia. You're so sweet.”

The Bravolebrity had previously taken to social media to share a glimpse at some time spent with the singer.

Mia captioned her Instagram post, “This is definitely my ‘get prettier and have fun' era.”

A post shared by Mia Thornton (@mrsmiathornton)

Mia's love life has been more than a little messy over the last few years. She was married to Gordon Thornton for 11 years, and they share two children, Jeremiah and Juliana. They have split and reunited a few times since September 2023, and a lot of their arguments played out as RHOP cameras rolled. Gordon's Bipolar diagnosis is said to have played a significant role in the ending of their marriage. The two have been spotted spending quality time with their children together and have made co-parenting their top priority.

Mia has also been in an on-again, off-again relationship with a man known as Incognito. The former housewife last split from the Atlanta-based radio host in January 2025.

Back in April 2025, Mia officially announced her departure from RHOP. She simultaneously shared that she was relocating for a fresh start. She shared on Instagram at the time, “With every new season comes a new beginning, and I have some news to share. My family and I have made the decision to relocate to Atlanta, and with that, I will not be returning to The Real Housewives of Potomac next season.” 

A post shared by Mia Thornton (@mrsmiathornton)

Bravo does have that “Real Housewives of Atlanta” franchise. What are the chances that Mia will pop up there? Better yet, do you think that she relocated with that idea in mind? Mia wore out her welcome in Potomac, but would you like to see her appear with her new love in Atlanta?

It's fitting that the first good movie to meaningfully incorporate AI into its aesthetic should be about an undead bloodsucker that feeds on humanity in order to seem alive. And yet, for a three-hour film that opens with a chorus of computer-generated Vlad the Impalers staring into camera and demanding that we suck their cocks, Radu Jude's gleefully stupid “Dracula” proves much too expansive — and much too invested in the centuries of barbarism that paved the way toward Silicon Valley — to be misunderstood as a simple rebuke against the grotesqueries of algorithmic image-making. 

 










Jude is an erudite man of the people whose hyper-literate intellectualism is only matched by his Chaucer-like vulgarity, and his work has long reveled in an impish fascination with the relationship between art, labor, and technology. In that light, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that the guy behind the likes of “Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World” and “Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn” has a certain degree of affection for a tool that threatens to upend everything the arts hold sacred.

A quasi-picaresque anthology about an unnamed director (“Kontinental '25” standout Adonis Tanța) who relies on a Transylvanian bot to salvage his new vampire movie after it only earns an 80 percent approval score from its latest test audience, “Dracula” provides Jude a perfectly dumb excuse to unleash AI on the cinema, literature, and history of a civilization that had already been feeding on its own neck for a century or longer before ChatGPT first came online. 

Here is a film that feasts on AI image-making in its ugliest and most nascent form in order to argue that it really isn't anything new — that its cannibalistic appetite and taste for exploitation are precisely what make this technology such an honest expression of the culture that created it. As a bald man once said: The world is a vampire (sent to drain). With “Dracula,” Jude makes a fun and wildly freewheeling case that it sucks now in much the same way that it's sucked for the last several hundred years, and in doing so he suggests that AI might be more interesting for what it reveals about the way things haven't changed than it is for what it threatens to change about them. 

Having said all that, it would be a mistake to overstate the role that AI plays in Jude's anarchic hodgepodge. The technology is central to this project, as well as the ostensible author of the film's 14 segments, wraparound story, and framing device, but “Dracula” mostly relies on algorithmic kinks and chimeras to lubricate more analog examples of the past eating itself — to use images of, and stories about, Vlad the Impaler to illustrate how easily history is stripped of its meaning. 

 










Shot on an iPhone and steeped in its film's local bent (there's an inherent humor to the idea that Jude is tackling his country's most famous legend on such frivolous terms), the wraparound story forces “Dracula” back to that mission whenever it threatens to wander too far astray. Which is often. 

It hinges on a rundown theater in the heart of Transylvania's tourist district, where the director — Tanța, not Jude — emcees a low-rent immersive show that essentially bastardizes the legend of Vlad the Impaler into whatever the audience wants it to be. Whatever it means to Make Dracula Great Again.

Jude doesn't waste any time poking fun at the mass appeal madness of trying to create something for everyone. A group of American vacationers are seen in the crowd with their kids. The big guy sitting near them is wearing his clothes backwards and sporting the tattoo of a face on the back of his skull. One European woman, meanwhile, has clearly just come to work out her kinks, and leaps at the chance to bid on a backstage tryst with the limp-dicked old man playing the immortal vampire (Gabriel Spahiu as Sandu). Lest anyone imagined that Jude's film would offer a more reverent take on Romanian history, the sight of that naked theater-goer shouting “Lick my pussy, Dracula!” at the impotent actor behind her legs should be enough to put such thoughts to rest. 

 










Eventually, Sandu and his topless co-star (Oana Maria Zaharia as the otherwise unnamed “Vampira”) flee into the town square as the final act of the show, the audience chasing them with pitchforks and torches. One evening, however, the two actors conspire to make a break for it — to stay hidden from the horde of paying customers, escape from the exploitative conditions of their jobs, and use their meager earnings to start new lives in another country. In turn, the director of the show invites his audience to kill his cast for real; a serious gamble on his part, as Elon Musk and Donald Trump have supposedly booked their own private performance for the following month. 

Sitting at his desk and speaking to camera in between each of the film's segments, Tanța's character recognizes that we're curious about the fate of Sandu and Vampira, and graciously agrees to check in on them whenever the mood strikes. In the meantime, he busies himself by asking his AI bot to mock up a wide variety of Dracula riffs, most of which — per AI's functionality — are Frankensteined together from previous takes on the story and/or the published histories they ingested as part of their creation. 

One exploits the public domain status of F.W. Murnau's “Nosferatu” to stream footage from that vampire classic, only for the clips to be overrun with internet detritus like pop-up ads for penis-enlargement surgery and the like (it's a rare instance in which Jude's extremely cock-centric sense of humor deigns to use a more polite word for the male sex organ). Another runs into rights troubles when it tries to summon the multiplex eroticism of Francis Ford Coppola's “Dracula,” forcing the director to re-create that Eiko Ishioka-designed fever dream with a nightmare-inducing AI orgy that hallucinates bloody new sex organs into every fold of the human body. Later, the director asks to see Vlad reborn in the style of Samuel Beckett or Carl Theodor Dreyer, which results in a silent(ish) short where the toothache-ridden vampire pays a visit to Dr. Caligari D.D.S. 

 










Most of the vignettes tend to dig a bit deeper than mere cine-literate sight gags and in-jokes, even if they aren't substantially more highbrow for doing so. The first short, cheekily designated “Eutrophia” (a term describing the process by which a body, usually of water, becomes overly enriched with nutrients), is set in a rejuvenation clinic that was built as a youth hospital during Ceaușescu's reign of terror, and hosted a number of iconic Hollywood stars during their golden years. A wheelchair-bound grandma new to the facility is treated to a screening of some old Romanian films, when suddenly things go all “Sherlock Jr.” on her; the next thing she knows, Vlad the Impaler is standing before her in the flesh and demanding an exchange of fluids: He'll drink from her neck, and she'll give him a blow job. I suppose that's one way of staying young. Or two. 

Elsewhere, the past's hunger for the present — and the present's disinterest in the past — is explored in the weirdly adorable episode where a child-aged Vlad returns to his house, only to find that it's been renovated into a museum whose tour guide has little patience for interrupting kids. Jude later flips the script with a relatively dry and dutiful adaptation of Nicolae Velea's Romania-famous romance novel “Just So,” only to spoil the story's tragic emotional climax with a hilariously bad serving of gen-AI slop. I'm not sure that punchline is worth the 30 minutes or so it takes to set up (refreshing as it is to see Jude operate in a more classical mode for a while), but it's safe to say that no one will ever accuse the filmmaker of taking himself too seriously now that he's on the verge of displacing Cristian Mungiu as his country's most visible auteur. 

 










Of course, Jude's ascendency has long hinged on his eagerness to look for the absurdity in the serious, and the seriousness in the absurd. Compelled by the enduring savagery of a modern world that sells itself as being more evolved than the burial ground on which it was built, his films — as ultra-referential to the past as they are indifferent to it — have flourished at a time when history is being made by the same people who are most determined to erase it. As Wittgenstein is quoted here: “The thing about progress is that it always seems greater than it actually is.” 

That notion is most pronounced in a segment that plays on the Marxist concept of “dead labor,” undead in this case. It's called “Das Kapital,” and it finds Vlad returning to life as the ruthlessly capitalistic CEO of a gaming company whose employees farm experience points in order to sell their beefed-up accounts to lazy American players. (One of those employees is played by the great “Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World” star Ilinca Manoloche, the most recognizable of the 100+ actors who rotate into a variety of different parts throughout the movie.) 

Set on the site of a famous 20th century labor dispute but framed against a backdrop of MMORPGs and Twitter-era xenophobia, this ridiculous vignette — complete with Tanța as a boot-licking C-3PO — is the logical climax of a film that name drops both Umberto Eco and Britney Spears, and affords them roughly the same importance. In a far more pointed way than the film's stolid 50-minute re-creation of Romania's first vampire novel, or the similarly overstretched later chapter that offers a bawdy folk tale inspired by the author Ion Creangă (it starts with Jesus, and ends with Manoloche being pleasantly terrorized by a crudely animated flying dildo), “Das Kapital” collapses the distance between high and low, history and its end. The only distinction that matters in the end is what's alive and what's not, and Jude's exhaustingly exhilarating “Dracula” makes an effective case that it will only get harder to tell the difference from here.

 










“Dracula” premiered at the 2025 Locarno Film Festival. 1-2 Special will release it in the United States.

A revival of a beloved, iconic film? Groundbreaking, as Meryl Streep's “The Devil Wears Prada” character Miranda Priestly would say. 

But screenwriters, both those returning from some of the aughts' most beloved films, as well as the writers of new franchise editions for subsequent modern installments, are setting out to do just that: Make a sequel that's not only great, but necessary.

“Freakier Friday” is the latest film to get the legacyquel spin — and perhaps one of the first to be critically acclaimed as it hits theaters. Of course, “The Devil Wears Prada 2” already has high-brow power: While “Freakier Friday” boasts one Academy Award winner (Jamie Lee Curtis) among its ensemble, “Prada” is led by four Oscar nominees, with Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep both having won statues. (And Streep is reprising her “Prada” role, which she was also nominated for.)

The productions of “Freakier Friday” and “The Devil Wears Prada 2” have ignited viral internet fandom, with “Freakier Friday” in part landing a theatrical release due to the online support that the announcement of the sequel generated.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“Freakier Friday” being greenlit further seemed to open the floodgates for more 2000s nostalgic revivals: “Princess Diaries 3,” “Bend It Like Beckham 2,” “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” “My Best Friend's Wedding,” “The Holiday,” and even “Air Bud” are all getting millennial-centric installments. And that's not even including series sequels to '90s properties such as “And Just Like That” (RIP) and “Clueless,” which “Freakier Friday” scribe Jordan Weiss is writing for Peacock.

Are studios mining their existing films with 15th, 20th, and 25th anniversaries in mind, or are screenwriters pitching these revivals in droves based on their own childhood cinematic fandoms? Why is there this seemingly sudden push for rom-coms, or in millennial speak, girly pop films? 

And how much does “Barbie” have to do with all of it?

IndieWire spoke with “The Devil Wears Prada 2″ screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna, “Freakier Friday” screenwriter Jordan Weiss, and Elyse Hollander, who shares a co-story-by credit with Weiss on the “Freaky Friday” sequel, to unpack the nostalgic trend of 2000s films being brought into 2025 and beyond — and detail which early 21st century films they're each vying to revive.

The following interviews have been edited and condensed for length and clarity.
 










IndieWire: The overwhelming influx of 2000s films being turned into franchises has really marked a trend in recent years. Why do you think these millennial high concept favorites are getting newfound attention? Is this led by the studios or the creatives? 

Jordan Weiss: It was a combination of legacy producers [Kristin Burr and Andrew Gunn from the 2003 “Freaky Friday”] and millennial executives [such as Disney SVP of development Allison Erlikhman, who is also working on “Princess Diaries 3”] and a millennial screenwriter, who were all like, “We either love this movie because we worked on it” or “we were children when it came out and are obsessed with every part of it.” I think [Allison] being of this generation and having that close tie made her such an asset as a studio executive working on this.”

I think these revivals come about in a lot of different ways. Sometimes it's me picking up the phone and saying, “Hey, I have an idea for an interpretation of this piece of IP,” and sometimes it's a studio saying, “These two actors have remained in each other's lives and and are still friends and love each other and want to make another one of these because they've stayed so close over 20 years.” And then they find some fresh voices to bring in and help them work on that.

 










Aline Brosh McKenna: The desire to do this [“The Devil Wears Prada 2“] again came from the creative team. It didn't come from the studio. The only reason to do something like this is if you have something you want to say, something creative. I've certainly been approached with other remakes that, in other contexts, didn't make sense for me anyway. This was really coming from the folks on the creative team being the first ones coming together and wanting to continue this story.

I've talked to [“The Devil Wears Prada” director] David Frankel regularly over the last 20 years. A couple of years ago, I started saying to him, “You know, I actually think that there is a sequel here because the world that these characters live in is changing so dramatically and so rapidly. I really feel like there could be something there.” We just started mildly chatting about it, but really, I had no expectation and I was off doing other things. 

McKenna was the showrunner for “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” and made her directorial debut with rom-com “Your Place or Mine.”

Aline, I know that in the 20 years since “The Devil Wears Prada” was released, some actors did publicly shut down the idea of a sequel. 

Hathaway famously said in 2022 that she wasn't sure the film could even warrant any other installments due to the death of the print magazine industry: “I don't know if there can be [a sequel]. I just think that movie was in a different era. Now everything's gone so digital and that movie is centered around the concept of producing a physical thing and it's just, it's just very different.”
 










McKenna: They all said no [for years]. None of us really felt like it made sense earlier, and then all of a sudden, it really did make sense. 

So, why now? What made those no's become yes's?

McKenna: One of the original producers of the movie, Wendy Finerman, said, “I've spoken to Meryl. If you have something to pitch her, she would like to hear it.” That is really what started the process. The most important consideration was figuring out what a story would be, to have a story that would hold up. The only reason to do something like this [a sequel] is if you have something you want to say, something creative. I've certainly been approached with other remakes that in other contexts didn't make sense for me. I felt like this was really about the folks on the creative team from the first one coming together again and wanting to continue this story. And having the original cast together was so important.

For “Freakier Friday,” as a screenwriter joining the franchise with the legacy sequel, was there added pressure since the core original cast was returning, too? 

Hollander: It's a big risk for everybody involved to come back. You don't want to ruin the legacy, you want add to it. I was like, “I cannot be responsible for ruining a beloved film and adding to a cash grab, schlock pile that would be once direct to DVD.”

 










Weiss: I don't know, I think there's a lot of pressure on every film to be great because everybody working on it cares about it a lot, whether it's streaming or theatrical or of any size, but I think that there are, different challenges and different things that are fun about joining a franchise. No matter what IP you're adapting, whether it's a comic book or a legacy sequel, you're still opening a blank document and being tasked with creating an original new story, whether that's an original story inspired by or including characters from the past or inspired by or including characters from your own personal history. You're making a new experience for the audience. 

I really don't feel as though I'm not being given the opportunity to be completely original and creative, even when I'm working as part of like big legacy titles. I feel like this is a privilege. You always want to honor where something came from, whether it came from my own personal heartbreak when I was 16 or whether it came from an amazing movie starring Lindsay Lohan from 2003.

There are things that are really fun about it when it's an original, and there are also things that are really fun and special when it's me getting brought into a group project that's existed for 25 years or 30 years. Whether it's original or building off of a piece of IP is of secondary importance to me.

 










There have been some backlash about there being “too many” legacy sequels announced. Do you think this is a gendered criticism as all of the films receiving their flack are women-led rom-coms? 

McKenna: I don't think [the criticism is] gendered. I think, from what I can tell, people are really excited about a lot of these, and I know “Freakier Friday” is opening really soon. I really think it just boils down to the story you have to tell. We're also experiencing our own sense of nostalgia and revisiting a film. I think that's what we're hoping to do for an audience, for them to have that feeling of a reunion, too.

Weiss: The thing that is funny to me is that there's a lot of conversation now of like, “Oh, my God, everything's a reboot, everything's a sequel. I miss the '90s and early 2000s when everything was original,” and I'm like, “Those were also all remakes.” There are probably so many movies that people don't realize were actually movies from the '30s or '40s. I'm like, “Hollywood's built on it.” Maybe we're always re-innovating, but I have embraced it. I think that all of these stories are original, and you still are creating something new. I've really tried to be optimistic about the potential with that. If a cynical person wants to say that all [legacy sequels] come from the same cash grab, that's just not my view of it. But maybe I've got rose colored glasses on.

 










Hollander: I think the rom-com genre has been everyone's guilty pleasure, and we need to get rid of the guilt and just accept that it's super fun and fantastic. And I've actually heard that in addition to whatever the online troll comments are, there also has been such a push for romance and a return to big, emotional movie star-driven films that are not about capes and explosions. I think “The Devil Wears Prada 2” is happening because you have huge movie stars [in it] as well. 

McKenna: “Top Gun: Maverick” really showed that there was an interest in these [legacy sequels]. They really updated [Tom Cruise's] character to reflect his age and his experience. To me, these don't necessarily seem like cynical money grabs, which is how I think they're often portrayed. I think often, as in our case, and as in the case of “Top Gun,” it stems from like a legitimate desire to see these characters again. And in the '30s and '40s, they routinely made tons of sequels, and there wasn't an embarrassment about wanting to revisit beloved characters. The audience has asked for more of this and in this case, it just happened over such a long period of time.

Is this wave of 2000s fandom in Hollywood in part also due to “Barbie” making box office history? What happened to the pause of high concept rom-coms? Did that happen along with the condescension of the “chick flick” genre label? 
 










Hollander: I think it's realizing there's still a marketplace for what I like to call DryBar movies. In the early days of DryBar [the salon], you'd go, you'd get a glass of champagne, you get your hair blown out. It was like a very female-centric space and they would have a movie playing, our favorite rom-coms like “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,” “Bride Wars,” “He's Just Not That into You,” “Never Been Kissed,” all those great movies. And then at a certain point, someone decided that it wasn't commercial anymore.

McKenna: One of the reasons the fandom for [“The Devil Wears Prada”] and all of these movies is so enduring is because the culture was so much more focused on a few pieces. … I guess people call it the monoculture, but the audience [in the 2000s] wasn't as fragmented. So a lot of people did see this movie when it came out, and then it had this amazing life on DVDs which don't exist anymore, but that was a huge. That extended its life. 

And then the deals that were made for it to be on TV. I mean, [“The Devil Wears Prada”] is always on TV. “Prada” and “27 Dresses” are on TV just so frequently, and the thing that people say to me the most is, “Oh, if that's on, I'll watch the whole thing.” It's not just based on the quality of the movie itself, but also definitely based on a feeling. At the time [in the early 2000s], there was just more of a sense of bringing people together. Everybody watched the “Friends” finale, you know, and so those are all things that you could talk about in common. 

 










I think, in a way, the popularity of these older movies has something to do with our longing to have something that cuts across the whole culture. I think that drives a lot of the interest and so it's living on in the internet and on television. This one [“The Devil Wears Prada”] has lived on, but I also think it represents not just the nostalgia for this particular movie, but sort of a nostalgia for mass moviegoing and a common shared culture.

Fans of the respective original films have already made set photos for both “Freakier Friday” and “The Devil Wears Prada 2” go viral. “Freakier Friday” star and producer Jamie Lee Curtis slammed the leaked pictures in 2024, calling them an “intrusion … into the creative process of filmmaking.” What is your opinion?

Weiss: The parasocial relationship between fans and franchises is always interesting to me.

McKenna: We knew there would be a lot of interest. I personally hadn't experienced this level of people coming out [to the set], but it's the world we live in. In many ways, we're speaking to a different world than we did in 2006. … It stems from like a legitimate desire to see these characters again. As long as everyone's safe, what an honor that people are still interested.

How do you approach writing a legacy sequel? Did you always know you wanted to tap into early 2000s IPs? 
 










Weiss: When I'm looking ahead in my career, it's less about, “Do I want to reboot this specific title?” and more about deciding I want to do more rom-coms, I want to do more mother-daughter stories. Having the opportunity to do a big rom com that's original, great, but if I have the opportunity to do a big rom-com that's the remake of a beloved '90s rom-com, also great. If someone is like, “Can you believe you're working on another reboot?” I would be like, “This is was completely my original idea.” I think that's the best way to utilize IP though is to have an independent, original concept and then having it be within the safe haven of an IP so studios can greenlight it.

I think there's a lot of crossover with stuff. “Dollface” was wholly original, but it was taking inspiration from things like “Clueless.” Literally Brenda Song's original character description was “Millennial Cher Horowitz” in the script. … I wish that there would have been more of an audience for “Dollface” to last 10 seasons, but I think ultimately like it's easier to find an audience when you have IP.

Hollander: I think you can lean into some of those IP titles and use them in a sneaky way in to do something new. In a dream world, every movie could be an interesting small A24 Celine Song, like something that makes you question art in the world and your perspective, and I think there's space for that. 

 










After this interview was conducted, it was announced that Song is now also getting into the nostalgic reboot game with “My Best Friend's Wedding,” which she is writing for Sony.

I think at the same time too, Hollywood has always been a business where you have to sell a product, whether it's entertainment or joy or happiness or nostalgia. And it's your job as the writer to slide in deeper themes that you want to explore. Like a four-way swap and with a blended family storyline across multiple generations [as the “Freakier Friday” plot], I could describe the movie in a way that sounds like an A24 film, like a body horror swap thing, and then you realize, “Oh wait, it's Freaky Friday.” I feel like that's when it's really successful, when you're not sure by the logline what shiny veneer marker it has on it.

Are there any other 2000s films you want to reboot? 

Hollander: I'd love for the ['90s] “Charlie's Angels” to come back. I'd love for “Bring It On” to return, especially with the rise of “Cheer” and the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders series. I'd love to see Kirsten Dunst reprising her role and, what does that look like 20 years later, when you've aged out of like being a performer or cheerleader? Kind of make it like an “F1” event that Brad Pitt had.

 










McKenna: I remember when I first came to Hollywood, I really wanted to remake “Cheaper by the Dozen” because it had been a really successful book and movie way, way back and nobody was interested. I was a baby writer and then that turned out to be a huge hit movie. I don't even know if people connected it to the fact that it was a remake; it had to stand on its own.

Aline, would you more open to revisiting any of your past films now after returning to write “The Devil Wears Prada 2”? And if not, would you be OK with another writer taking on one of your IPs like with what happened with “Freakier Friday”?

McKenna: I tried to do a TV show with “27 Dresses,” but I haven't quite gotten there yet. The wedding industry has just exploded since we made that movie. I mean, when I see what young people are going through now with weddings, that seems quaint. I think that's primed for something. Out of the things I've written, I would say that's the one. I'm not sure that there will be a “We Bought Another Zoo.”

“Freakier Friday” is currently in theaters. “The Devil Wears Prada 2” is expected in theaters May 2026. Both are Disney releases.

Get ready for the walls of the Alice Tully Hall to reverberate with one plaintive cry in the coming weeks: “Bruuuuuuuucee!”

Film at Lincoln Center has today announced that Scott Cooper's “Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere” will celebrate its premiere (though, crucially in the wide world of fall festivals, it's unclear which premiere it will be and where else the film might be screening) as the Spotlight Gala selection of the 63rd New York Film Festival. The film will make its debut on Sunday, September 28, Cooper and cast members Jeremy Allen White, Jeremy Strong, and Odessa Young will be in attendance, along with Bruce Springsteen.

The much-anticipated feature stars White during a formative period in The Boss' life, as he set out to make the intensely personal album “Nebraska” while also dealing with his tremendous rising fame and starting to craft what would become the life-changing album “Born in the U.S.A.” Cooper himself adapted Warren Zanes' 2023 best-selling book of the same name for the film's script. 20th Century Studios will release the film in theaters on Friday, October 24.

Per today's NYFF announcement, “Jeremy Allen White inhabits a legend and lays bare his beating heart in this graceful, exceptionally moving film about a very specific part of peerless American rock icon Bruce Springsteen's life. … This biographical drama focuses with gratifying specificity on the nitty-gritty of Springsteen's songwriting, while never shying away from the realities of his familial traumas and personal depression. It's more than just a tour de force for its incandescent star — it's a reminder that the reason we love this seemingly larger-than-life hero is because he's always been palpably human.”

The film features an enviable supporting cast, including Jeremy Strong (as Springsteen's longtime manager and co-producer Jon Landau), Stephen Graham and Gaby Hoffmann (as Bruce's parents), Paul Walter Hauser, David Krumholtz, and Odessa Young. The film is produced by Cooper, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Eric Robinson, and Scott Stuber. Tracey Landon and Zanes executive produce. 

“The New York Film Festival has always felt like a spiritual home for the kind of cinema I believe in,” said Cooper in an official statement. “To now arrive with a film about Bruce Springsteen — an artist whose music shaped not just a country but my own sense of storytelling — is something I could never have imagined. Getting to know Bruce, to explore his world and his spirit, has been one of the most profound creative experiences of my life. To share that experience with New York audiences, in a city that defines artistic possibility, is both an honor and a responsibility I hold with deep gratitude.”

 










Added Dennis Lim, Artistic Director, New York Film Festival, “Taking its cue from the stark majesty of Bruce Springsteen's classic album ‘Nebraska,' Scott Cooper's ‘Springsteen: Deliver Me from Nowhere‘ has an intimacy and immediacy that eludes most film biographies. Anchored by Jeremy Allen White's revelatory performance, this year's Spotlight Gala selection is a fitting tribute to a living legend.”

As previously announced, the Opening Night selection is the North American premiere of Luca Guadagnino's “After the Hunt”; the North American premiere of Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother” is the Centerpiece selection; and the world premiere of Bradley Cooper's “Is This Thing On?” is the Closing Night selection. Last week, NYFF announced both its heavy-hitting main slate and its always compelling Currents section. The rest of the Spotlight slate, plus the Revivals lineup and Talks sections will be announced in the coming weeks.

The 2025 New York Film Festival will run from September 26 – October 13. 

The NYFF Main Slate and Spotlight selection committee is chaired by Dennis Lim, NYFF Artistic Director, and includes Florence Almozini, Justin Chang, K. Austin Collins, and Rachel Rosen. Violeta Bava, Michelle Carey, Leo Goldsmith, and Antoine Thirion are NYFF program advisors.

Remember the days of the seven-string guitar? Even if you weren't alive then, you surely have an image of what it felt like to be young in the years between 1995 and 9/11—between the death of Kurt Cobain and the supposed death of irony. Every popular rock band had a guy who wore contact lenses in unnatural colors and another who wore bucket hats. Girls displayed their whole thoraxes between low-cut jeans and tiny babydoll tees. Everyone wearing Black Flys sunglasses, everyone's tongue stained the nuclear yellow of Surge. Buying a Slurpee and trashing a 7-Eleven were the acts of Byronic heroes living life to the edge, or at least to the edge of the suburb.

Bugland, Jasamine White-Gluz's first album as No Joy album since 2020's Motherhood, lives in this memory. Many albums do in 2025, as fantasies about the supposed freedom and joy of the Clinton era reach their fifth year en vogue. The difference is that Bugland knows that it's living in a memory. With its title like something a precocious kindergartener would name a theme park, it is self-consciously a construction, and because of that, it knows that its radio-glossed guitars and scrolling pink mists of noise aren't artifacts to be considered but elements that can be molded and sculpted like so much Floam. Bugland is at once a perfect album for our current shoecraze and unlike any other record alongside which it might be discussed. It's poignant, yes, and full of wonder; you will find many vistas at which you might gawp and abysses into which you might weep. But its friendly relationship with the past means that Bugland's litter of sound is, more than anything, fun. It's so fun.

Bugland's hundreds of little delights should come as no surprise, nor should White-Gluz's ability to rewire memory's nostalgia trap into a present-day source of energy. On Motherhood, she enlisted slap bass and jewel-toned early-'80s keyboards—as well as guitarist Tara McLeod, from nü-metal first-wavers Kittie—to navigate the unsolvable labyrinth of birthing. For Bugland, she and experimental musician Angel Marcloid (aka Fire-Toolz) expand Motherhood's palette and range, making the latter feel tidy and subdued in comparison. Consider it Imaginal Disk's older sister.

That hyper-maximalist approach might make Bugland feel like an annoyingly complicated Magic Eye image if White-Gluz weren't such an expert arranger. Her songs tend to be thick and sedimentary, and part of her skill lies in eroding those layers a little bit at a time. About halfway through opener “Garbage Dream House,” lost among overlapping clouds of synth, chewed-up digital mash, and thick-cut Butch Vig guitars, White-Gluz sings with a pleasantly distant gaze. Breakbeats idle like they're reluctantly crouched at the starting line, cotton-candy-colored semi-drones fill the space, and as a snare calls the song to attention, it explodes into something as big and cathartic as “Ray of Light.” In the title track, she slaps riffs up on the wall like stickers on a locker while a slurry of liquid static fills the space around a shuffling drum machine.

Elsewhere in Bugland, White-Gluz pumps more and more—more texture, more ambience, many more kinds of guitar—into the songs until they're super-juicy, then allows them to burst in a rush of good feelings. Even the less wide-eyed moments, as when the sustained tolling of “Bather in the Bloodcells” twists into something like an alt-rock version of Madonna circa Paradise Garage, are perfumed by the album's prevailing senses of joy and gratitude. It's thrilling to hear someone embrace pleasure so wholly, yet that grounding means the album ends up somewhere near the kind of baggy indie-dance hybrid that few people have credibly attempted since Curve and Garbage invented it 30 years ago.

In her own records, Marcloid uses plonking new-age synths—picture the best preset on the most expensive keyboard at the oldest mall in your town—with black-metal shrieks and Weather Channel jazz in a way that feels both uncanny and caked in the dust of an imaginary past. So many of the sounds both she and White-Gluz deploy are now often reverse-read as cheesy and consciously era-specific, including the chunky, photorealistic guitars that, despite coming back into style recently, were seen as passé in the days of garage-rock authenticity and slimy post-punk. But like all ideas that attach themselves to an age, they were at the time used in great earnest, as a sincere attempt at expression. White-Gluz and Marcloid know this, too, and they often use that knowingness—both theirs and the audience's—to their advantage. When “Jelly Meadow Bright,” the album's noisiest track, brings together smooth-jazz sax, cherubim and seraphim vocals, Glassworks-style sequencer overloads, and grunting nü-metal guitar, the majesty it finally reaches is inseparable from both the emotional valences of those sounds and our knowledge of their collective datedness; it's the music that plays when your life flashes before your eyes.

Is that description a little much? Yes, of course it is. But the presence of subtlety doesn't necessarily make something artful, just as bombast and accessibility don't make it brainless. Taking in Bugland's spree of bright colors and surprise twists can feel like breaking a piñata onto the crazy-pattern carpet in the laser-tag arena: There is so much happening, and nearly all of it commands your attention. Memory fades, opportunity seems to narrow as we age, and a gnawing sense of futility overwhelms it all. Not so much an escape as a reminder, Bugland says, “Remember what it felt like to be pleasantly overwhelmed?”

The gnarliest drop I've heard this year isn't on the Skrillex tape or some new-gen dubstep demigod's SoundCloud page. It's midway through Vylet Pony's “LiveLaughLove2,” after a cutesy voice entreats listeners to “live, laugh, love” in the style of inspirational home décor. Synths growl, an eerie guitar ripples, and a torrent of bass hits like a 1,000 psi jetstream to the face. It's a highlight from the Oregon-based oddball's 21st album, Love & Ponystep, which combines two things that might seem diametrically opposed: cute ponies and crazed wubs. But this music is so clever and so admirably unhinged, it'll hook more than just the bronies and the brosteppers.

At the core of Zelda Trixie Lulamoon's work is a love of subculture in all its glory and garishness, and on a deeper level, the winding route to self-acceptance. Love & Ponystep is an ode to internet ephemera and cringe culture, yes, but it's also memeing as a defense mechanism, fantasy as allegory for things too uncomfortable to say openly. In a 26-page lyric booklet, Lulamoon credits part of her inspiration to a breakup, an experience mirrored in the narrative of her pony protagonist. Lulamoon's response to everything she's been through, and the putrid state of the internet, isn't to give up or go dissociative. Rather, it's to throw herself headlong into creating anything-goes experiments that urge listeners to be kind and live their truest lives.

The Vylet Ponyverse, inspired by My Little Pony but involving Lulamoon's own “original characters” (OCs), has enough lore to fill an encyclopedia. One actually already exists, compiling details on all the pony characters—occupation, sexuality, pronouns, ethnicity, past appearances, pretty much everything except a hoofprint scan. Love & Ponystep follows a lesbian alicorn (winged unicorn) character called Top Five Videos, or “Vid” for short, who's a YouTube host. We track Vid's breakup and eventual reunion with Dubstep Growl, a nonverbal, purple alicorn who likes to DJ.

Lulamoon once said that her artistic goal was to land “pony music” on Monstercat, and Love & Ponystep excels at smashing together trashy pop and bonkers brostep. She seems to relish breaking boundaries—not for the sake of provocation but to expand the Overton window that regulates which sounds represent the perceived limits of tasteful self-expression. Lulamoon has also described growing up in a household where her parents strictly controlled her media diet, feeling her brain split open when she first heard Scary Monsters & Nice Sprites. It's easy to imagine how a fixation like My Little Pony, never mind also being queer and trans, might leave you feeling alienated as a kid, and how that could later translate to eccentric, anarchic taste in music.

So that's how we get a song like “Worst rave EVER”: Imagine “Like a G6” with a pitched-up MC urging every mare to get crunk as fuck. At this point in Vid's breakup, we're past the devastation and ready to shake tail in the club. She's pony slizzard, popping bottles and bragging about how another alicorn wants her to sign her flank. Then there's “The Slow Dance,” an analog outlier that's like the Cranberries if they wrote songs about two alicorns in a situationship, sharing a bittersweet moment during their first and last waltz at the “Ponyville Prom.”

Lulamoon weaves effortlessly from sky-high EDM drops to mainstream radio LARPing, from lyrics about a “crackship AMV” (Anime Music Video) where Willy Wonka and Howl from Howl's Moving Castle are gay lovers to a not-unrelated screed against corporate control of intellectual property. “Webpunk,” which features the popular pony artist NekoSnicker, simultaneously deifies and defiles commercial media by flipping Katy Perry's “California Gurls” into a piracy anthem. “We're gonna party on the grave of a CEO, yeah!” she trills. “Kiss me over fat beats, download that/Revolution in a ZIP file, baby.” In one song, instead of falling in love with a human or a pony, Lulamoon sings about being in thrall to a “Corporate Illustration” she spots on an ad in the back of an Uber. Love turns to terror as she lists off ways that technocapitalism turns people into shells: tech steals our privacy, reshapes our desires, makes us feel reliant. Lulamoon calls on her audience to take back control. “Fall in love with a corpo bitch,” she sings. “So you can take everything from its corpse and split.”

Love & Ponystep is both a middle finger to copyright legislation and a love letter to the screens of Lulamoon's youth. She culls generously from video games, particularly the first-person shooter Call of Duty, in an attempt to queer the “masculine” pastimes of her childhood. Another wellspring is the montage parody scene (Mom, get the camera! Wow!), a 2010s YouTube community whose pop culture-defacing semioblitz mirrors the album's cluttered chaos. Highlight “My Love Is a Quickscope” satirizes homophobic COD obsessives, using the quickscope as a metaphor for an out-of-control parasocial relationship. The samples become her backup singers and internal monologue, a Greek chorus recontextualized as a gamer PvPing their demons.

If there's anything holding this album back, it's excess: 95 minutes with what feels like 5,000 references and endless allusions to past work. She enlists the narrator of the game Disco Elysium to provide cinematic voiceovers and a chess YouTuber named SadisticTushi to howl, “Hop in the pony, bring out the juicer!” “Walking Beside a Dragonfly” stitches a hard drive's worth of Discord calls and stream recordings into an affectionate eight-minute collage. A few tracks stretch on indulgently—one interlude feels more like a therapy session—but everything feeds back into Lulamoon's willfully messy, DIY ethos.

Inside this twee-ring circus of EDM insanity is a tribute to community, friendship, and a shame-free showcase of how maligned forms of culture—vomitous brostep, video game samples—can be turned into magical, meaningful art. In 2021, Lulamoon broke out with the hyperclop album CUTIEMARKS, containing her biggest song to date, “ANTONYMPH.” Celebrating digital pastimes more often denigrated as corny, the bubblegum singalong became an anthem for introverts who come alive online. Lulamoon's still living that life, far outside the bounds of commercial taste, telling even more complex stories and making even more addictive sounds. Let's hear one for the “rawr X3” kids.

Faith in an omniscient, benevolent God has always come packaged with a modicum of cognitive dissonance. If a God sees bad things and lets them happen, is it kind? If said God doesn't, is it truly all-knowing? A similar dissonance accompanies the consideration of Big Freedia's latest album Pressing Onward, which combines Southern gospel music with bounce, the inherently irreverent and often hypersexual flavor of uptempo hip-hop from New Orleans' housing projects. The line between the praise chorus and clapping cheeks is anything but straight (can you twerk in a Baptist church?)—but here, Freedia finds their common ground. Both the preacher and the bounce MC use similar call-and-response techniques to command those in their audience, after all, often helping them find God in the process.

Big Freedia has spent the last 25 years making bounce and bounce-adjacent records, but like many Black artists from the South, her musical journey began in the church. As a youngster, her mother put her in the choir at Pressing Onward Baptist Church, the house of worship from which her latest album draws its name. Back then she was known as Freddie Ross Jr., and those first performances were in front of a congregation that condemned her true self. Even then, Freedia knew she wasn't alone. “Growing up in the Black Baptist church here—in New Orleans especially—a lot of gay individuals are involved,” she told Billboard. Performing in church in crisp suits and shined shoes may not have been young Freedia's first choice, but she wouldn't be the first queer person moved by the salvation promised by hymns like “Amazing Grace.”

Freedia takes several approaches to the bounce-gospel synthesis on Pressing Onward. Some tracks sound like traditional contemporary gospel; others sound like Freedia simply brought bounce vocals to gospel songs or added choral harmonies and church organs to bounce tracks. And some—like the climactic penultimate track “Pew,” which borrows from funk, disco, and gospel in equal measure—sound like something else entirely. “Take My Hand” and “Let It Rain” are four-on-the-floor thumpers that feel like Freedia closed down Saturday night at Club Renaissance then strolled straight into Sunday service, co-opting the preacher's exultations to invite us to the Queendom. “Highway to Heaven” sounds dissonant at first, with a bounce vocal style straight from the Melpomene Projects standing in stark contrast with cheerful choral harmonies. But when both parts are layered on top of each other by the end of the song, it's so rhythmically complementary that the combination feels inevitable.

Early single “Church” is less innovative musically, cribbing much of Kirk Franklin's recipe for “urban” gospel. But its lyrics serve as the thesis statement of Pressing Onward, and, perhaps, queer Christianity at large: “We don't need a preacher to go to church/We don't need a deacon to hear the word/The love that we been seeking/It's higher than the ceiling.” It's a message ripped straight from the actual Gospels (Matthew 18:20), and the key to understanding how faith can empower someone even as its loudest followers vilify their existence. Freedia is undeterred by the bigots; she and her community define their own relationship with God. And there's beauty in her connection with other queer artists, including Billy Porter (featured on “Holy Shuffle”), whose journey of self-actualization also started in the church.

For an album with such an ambitious premise, it's not the big swings that disappoint; Pressing Onward is at its weakest when it's at its most conventional. The gentle swing and exhortations of the “Alpha and Omega” on “All I Need” are a needlessly boring detour from the songs that surround it, and “Celebration” tastes like uncut saccharine stadium pop, a surprising turn from an artist that has contributed to some of Beyoncé's most exciting mainstream moments of the past decade.

Freedia has assembled a crack team of players serving up virtuosic performances—her guitarist Danny Abel, in particular, isn't shy about showing off a squealing solo or two (“Revival”). But the star of any Freedia's track is her immense vocal talent, rooted in the high-octane rhythms of bounce, with lyrics bolstered by an unflappable charisma. At its best, Pressing Onward amplifies that magic with powerful choral harmonies, carving out new space in contemporary gospel and shaping it in her own image.

Bobby Whitlock, the singer-keyboardist and co-founder of 1970s blues-rock band Derek & the Dominos alongside Eric Clapton, has died, according to his manager, Carol Kaye. In a statement to Variety, Kaye shared that Whitlock died earlier this morning following a cancer diagnosis. He was 77.

Born in Memphis, Tennessee, on March 18, 1948, Robert Stanley Whitlock gravitated toward music at a young age, both as a fan and a student interested in learning the keyboard and organ. As a teenager, Whitlock started befriending artists in the Stax Records orbit, including Booker T. & the M.G.'s, the Staples Singers, Albert King, and others, eventually weaseling his way into their circuit by way of that respectful admiration. After he earned his first proper recording credit performing handclaps on Sam & Dave's single “I Thank You,” he signed to Stax—making him the first white artist to join the label's roster—and played organ regularly around the local scene, in part with the soul bands Short Cuts and the Counts.

Though Stax mentor Steve Cropper took him under his wing and Donald “Duck” Dunn and Don Nix were planning to produce a pop album by him, Whitlock decided to leave Memphis to pursue music with the rock and soul duo Delaney & Bonnie. He played keys and contributed additional vocals on their two 1969 albums, Home and Accept No Substitute. While touring with the duo, Whitlock met numerous musicians that he would collaborate with later on in his career, like Bobby Keys and Jim Price, as well as future Derek & the Dominos members Carl Radle and Jim Gordon. When Delaney & Bonnie opened for Clapton's supergroup Blind Faith, Whitlock and Clapton crossed paths for the first time. (Looking back on that leg, Clapton would describe Whitlock as “the most energetic sideman I had ever seen.”)

Once Delaney & Bonnie dropped their live album On Tour with Eric Clapton in 1970, Whitlock was eager to test his skills in a new band. He reunited with Clapton, Radle, and Gordon for a quick session before getting an invite to join Clapton on his debut solo album, Eric Clapton, and to accompany George Harrison in the studio as he recorded All Things Must Pass, the late guitarist's third solo album and first following the Beatles' breakup. Whitlock contributed heavily to that Billboard No. 1 album, playing organ, piano, harmonium, tubular bells, and backing vocals on most tracks, including the hits “My Sweet Lord” and “What Is Life.”

Upon regrouping, the four musicians started Derek & the Dominos as a blues-rock group focused on forming ideas at a natural pace and reveling in their relaxed friendship. After welcoming guitarist Dave Mason and coming up with their new band name, a rushed idea-turned-bungled onstage introduction, Derek & the Dominos played their first show and then entered the studio in June 1970 to record the singles “Tell the Truth” and “Roll It Over” with Phil Spector. That autumn, after Mason's departure, they hit up producer Tom Dowd to track their debut full-length: the 1970 double album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.

Together, Whitlock and Clapton wrote effortlessly romantic blues-rock hits like “Bell Bottom Blues” and “Layla,” the latter a seven-minute sprawler that, belatedly, became a staple of classic rock radio and a highlight of Clapton's career overall. They recorded only one studio LP together, but it's since considered to be a classic of the genre for its songwriting and performances—including one from the Allman Brothers Band's Duane Allman, who brought extensive contributions on lead and slide guitar, although he was not technically a member of the band. Halfway through writing their second album, Derek & the Dominos dissolved in a fit of tension and depression following the death of numerous friends in the months prior; Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident, and Jimi Hendrix died suddenly in his girlfriend's apartment.

Whitlock's songwriting ideas continued to flow freely, and he returned to the studio to start his own solo career. He released his self-titled debut studio album in 1972 and followed it with Raw Velvet later that same year. He went on to record four more solo albums, a few live LPs, and a handful of collaborative full-lengths with his partner Coco Carmel. Whitlock also steadily contributed to other artists' records, including Dr John's The Sun, Moon & Herbs, Clapton's The History of Eric Clapton, and Manassas' Down the Road. Whitlock also famously appeared, uncredited, on the Rolling Stones' essential 1972 album, Exile on Main St.

In 2024, Whitlock was awarded a Brass Music Note on Memphis' own Beale Street Walk of Fame for his work. “My business is to try to conduct myself as a decent person and a gentleman as much as I can, get through this world, navigate through this without making too many waves. But when you make them, make them big—ones to remember,” Whitlock told local outlet Everything Knoxville. “I know the role that I've been playing in everyone's music that I was a part of. Because my addition made that music mine as well—whether it's a Jeff Healy record or whatever. I put my stamp on it.”

							By 

	Kristine Kwak



	The days leading up to the launch of a new K-pop group are often hectic and intense. Years of training typically go into preparing a group — not just in music and dance, but also often in areas like English, all to get them ready for global stardom. Now BIGHIT MUSIC, the label behind BTS and Tomorrow x Together (TXT), has revealed its first new group in six years: CORTIS, a five-member group that launched with official social media accounts in early August.


	Over the past couple of years, fans have speculated about “BIGHIT's new boy group,” with sightings while filming in Los Angeles or attending labelmates' concerts. And yesterday morning, CORTIS released their first-ever song, “GO!” Much like their labelmates, Martin, James, Juhoon, Seonghyeon, and Keonho are heavily involved in production, and their other talents range from choreography to videography, allowing them to incorporate their creative ideas into everything the group will put out. 


	While “GO!” marks CORTIS' first-ever release, some of the members have had real-world experience in music. Martin had a hand in producing ILLIT's “Magnetic,” ENHYPEN's “Outside,” and most recently, “Beautiful Strangers” by TXT, just to name a few, and James was involved in choreographing for a handful of HYBE artists as well, including the viral “Magnetic” dance. All of the members of CORTIS are true creators in different avenues, and their management has empowered them to have real input into their music, choreography, and videos. 

	











	The group's name derives from the phrase “color outside the lines,” a nod to limitless creativity; it also draws inspiration from cortisol, a hormone linked to energy, action, and emotional intensity. After meeting the members and experiencing the music and accompanying music videos, the vision clicks into place. 

	











	CORTIS are here to push boundaries and offer a freer, more unfiltered take on what a K-pop group can be. Korean-Canadian Martin, the group's leader at age 17, is a natural creative who drives CORTIS' sound, and cites Tyler, the Creator and Mac Miller as some of his favorite artists. James, the oldest at 19, is Taiwanese and a dance prodigy with a black belt in taekwondo, as well as 10 years of ice hockey at a semi-pro level, an experience he credits with instilling discipline. Juhoon has a background as a youth model, appearing in commercials and music videos, and attended an international middle school before getting scouted to join BIGHIT MUSIC, where he sharpened his English skills. Seonghyeon, while soft-spoken at first, is a creative powerhouse with a sharp edge, and the ideas he brings to CORTIS as a topliner and a lyricist often come to fruition. The youngest member, Keonho, at 16, is a key contributor to the group's music videos, shapes up the group's dynamic, and defines their current headspace perfectly — curious about the future, wanting the whole world to know their names.

	For the group's first-ever interview, CORTIS met with Rolling Stone to discuss how they came together and the nerves they felt around finally debuting. Speaking mostly in English, with occasional asides in Korean, they were quick to support one another by helping find the right words, nodding in encouragement, and building on each other's stories as they dove into their shared experiences.


We first met two or three weeks ago in Seoul. How have these past few weeks have been for you?


James: We've been busy. We've been practicing a lot, as always, but also doing a lot of different activities — a lot of different schedules, which is new to us, because for us, we usually always have full days staying in the practice room. It hasn't fully sunk in yet [laughs]. Trying to get all the information, prepare as much as we can. I think as the days go by and the date is getting sooner and sooner, you kind of feel the anxiety coming up a little bit by bit. So yeah, definitely starting to feel it.

Seonghyeon: Same. [Laughs.] Yeah…  like, surreal? And I'm kind of nervous too, and also I'm very excited to get out there. I think it's going to be fun.


Juhoon: When we see our Google Calendar, it's starting to get filled up.  I'm kind of feeling it.


Tell us how you first got introduced to music. Did you play instruments growing up? What kind of music did you listen to?












Martin: I actually just bought a synthesizer. It's like a mini version of a Juno, and it comes in handy. I have been playing around with that a lot. I don't really know how to play the piano or the keyboard, but I know a couple chords, so I like to play it often.


James: For me, I've been listening to Michael Jackson since I was a little kid. Taking the bus, dancing around, with Michael Jackson in my earphones. The King of Pop never disappoints .


Seonghyeon: Before I came here, I never listened to hip-hop or R&B. But now, I listen to a bunch of different genres. Pop, hip-hop, jazz.


How has it been getting to know each other over the past couple of years? And are there any specific moments that you think helped you build a strong relationship?


Keonho: Well, after we lived together in the dorm…


James: Unfortunately, we lived together, right? [Laughs.] When you go to practice together and go back home together, you eat together, you watch stuff together, everything kind of just comes naturally. At times it's hard. It's kind of rough, like here and there. Especially on the holidays, when it's suddenly quiet. When everyone goes back home, suddenly it gets quiet, and then you're like, “Something's missing.” You kind of feel the decibel – it's not there.


What else have you done to bond as a team?


Martin: We went to Universal Studios. 


Keonho: After we finished our song camp. 


James: We milked our time there to the very last second. We ran all over the place to take rides. … But recently, we went to Six Flags. Actually, personally, I like Six Flags. Really personally.


Martin: I mean, Six Flags has much more extreme rides.


James: Six Flags was exciting. You can feel the adrenaline, you feel like you're gonna die! [Laughs.] But no! X2 was like —


That's the scariest ride I've ever been on. [Laughs.]


James: When we took off our shoes for the ride, it was nerve-wracking. 


Martin: We knew it was going to be something [big].


Now that you guys are debuting, I'm curious if you have any short-term goals, looking to the end of the year. And how about longer-term goals — like five years, 10 years?


Juhoon: Short-term, since we're just debuting, our goal is to show who we are to the audience and make sure that they understand who we are. 


James: Just trying to be at our best at introducing ourselves to the world. 


Keonho: I've never thought about long-term goals, but, I think… Now, I'm just curious. Curious about myself five or 10 years from now, I guess I could say I “want the whole world to know our name,” yeah. [Laughs.] That's actually lyrics from one of our songs. 

	











Have you gotten any advice from other HYBE artists or BIGHIT MUSIC artists that has stuck with you?


Martin: BTS gave us the advice to do well by the people that you're working with, the staff. And I feel like that's all that matters. To hit a long run, you've got to be good to the people around you. You've got to show love.


James: Yeah, I think in the end, we make up CORTIS, but at the same time, the staff and everyone included — they're all part of CORTIS. It's all a big team and big family.


Juhoon: Another piece of advice BTS gave us is that a lot of people may think it's the end once you debut. But actually, the debut is just the beginning, so there's no need to be perfect. Show improvement and keep evolving as you go. That's been helping me a lot for where we are right now in this particular moment in time when I'm just about to debut. 


In terms of preparing for your debut, I'm sure there's a lot of things that you're doing for the first time. Is there anything from the process that was surprising to you?


James: Today! [Laughs.]


Martin: We did a lot today. This is our first-ever interview. So today was a busy day, and it was actually pretty fun to just try all these new things. 


James: It's the first full day we didn't have dance class, but it's full with other schedules. It's just so fast. Everything is fast. 


Martin: Yeah, exactly! I was gonna say the same.


James: And, like, even now, at 11:30 pm, I still feel like it's lunch time. Everything went by so fast. I feel like I haven't done anything yet. But now it's like, the day is kind of coming to an end. It's like, what?


Seonghyeon: Usually we would have one class for like six hours, but now, we're doing a variety of things throughout the day. 


James: I think also because we're used to repeating the same thing for a very long time, and now it's like “this, that, this, that, this, that” is thrown at you, yeah?


Is there anything you've been doing to try to stay calm and not be as nervous?


James: We're nervous! [Laughs.] Yeah, we're just nervous.


Martin: I think all we can do is just get used to it, do more, if it's possible. I feel like, as we do it, we'll start to find more “know-how,” right? And that's how it will kind of brush off.


Martin, I know you worked on a lot of CORTIS' music, and you already have experience working on music. Do you have a favorite song or piece of art that you've worked on so far?

	











Martin: Wow. I mean, I contributed to a lot of other senior artists' tracks, such as ILLIT's  “Magnetic,” TXT's “Deja Vu,” et cetera. Working for other artists was fun. It also really influenced me to write and produce for Color Outside the Lines, our album. So for me personally, I just feel like the songs in our album… “Lullaby” was one of my favorite pieces that I worked on, because it wasn't working for someone else. It was really expressing myself. We get to release it, put our own words on it, put it together, recorded with every member's voice. The process of that was pretty fun, and hope I have more chances to have beats and songs I work on be used for our team.


What was it like when you first saw your name in the credits in a public setting?


Martin: It was definitely surreal, unbelievable, but I was trying to stay humble at first, and I wasn't trying to get on any high horses. Just stay as who I am, because I was still a trainee back then, and still am. I feel like I'm just trying to stay humble as much as I can. That's the most important thing, that's number one.


James, I know you also worked on a lot of other artists' choreo, and you have a background in sports as well. Is there any influence there between sports and choreo?


James:  I think my sports background definitely did influence me with just… discipline. I think discipline is a big thing — a mental state to carry through all kinds of different crafts. When you have to hone your own craft, the only thing you can really do is have discipline. Ice hockey taught me that. And through dancing, I was able to find different ways to learn, or even online, on YouTube, finding different artists to follow. My favorite song I participated in, personally, is “GO!” from our album. “GO!” was a song that really came from a very organic space, because we actually were in the studio, fooling around. It was our first day in L.A. at the time, and we didn't expect much from that day. But suddenly, “GO!” just pops out. Before that, everyone was kind of calm, but then everyone was jumping around and shouting all over the place. So the energy in the studio was very nice. Even with the choreo, “GO!” was choreographed wiht us five in the practice studio. Like, in two, three days. It was very fast. It's like we got into this flow state. Everything went by very smoothly. So definitely “GO!” was a very memorable experience,


Would the other members also say that “GO!” is the favorite?  Are you excited that that's the first song that's coming out? 












Seonghyeon: Yeah, definitely. I like it. And yes, we all like it. [Smiles.]


Juhoon: Yeah, one of our favorite tracks on this album. I think it's the best track to come as an introduction song. It really has our daily lifestyles, our vibes. It really introduces who we are.


Juhoon, we discussed a few weeks back about how you were scouted, and how you felt like if you didn't take this opportunity to join, it would be missing a once-in-a-lifetime chance.


Juhoon: At the time, I was a middle-school student, so I was studying hard. But one day, suddenly I was approached. It was kind of chaotic. I had the chance to visit the company and see the members, and see what they make. I really felt like this team is different. Their music is really unique, and I really loved their personalities. So I thought that it would be a great chance to join this team. And also, since I thought they were cool, I thought I might be cooler when I joined the team. That was a big point.


What were your first impressions when you met? 


James: This one might be rough. [Laughs.]


Juhoon: It's been a while… Seonghyeon and Keonho, they were really nice to me. 


Keonho: Wow!


So Martin and James weren't? [Laughs.] 


Juhoon: James, I didn't really have a lot of chances to talk with him at first. He was just like a big brother. So yeah, at first, it was a bit cold, I guess. [Laughs.]


James: I feel you. [Laughs.] Yeah, I can be quite intimidating when it's the first time meeting someone. For me, I'm a very, very, very introverted person. It's hard for me to talk the first time meeting someone. So yeah, I fully understand. 


Juhoon: [Laughs.] And for Martin, since I knew that he did training for the longest, I really looked up to him. I really thought that he was cool. He can sing well, dance well…


Martin: Thank you. [Laughs.]


Seonghyeon, I'm curious to hear more about what type of angle you bring to the group creatively. I know Martin does a lot of song production, and James does a lot of the choreo. And we talked a lot about how you will come up with ideas very quickly.


Seonghyeon: Great question [laughs]. I think my ideas are really…  I wrote the top line of “What You Want.” And “JoyRide,” I wrote a lot of the lyrics.


James: It turned out nice.


How would you say you work collaboratively with the team?


Seonghyeon: I think just by talking a lot. We share our opinions back and forth. I try to bring new ideas to the table. 

	











Where do you get your inspiration from these days?


Seonghyeon: Just…from what I'm doing, right? From whatever I'm up to these days, things that are close to me. 


Keonho, you do a lot of the video production, right? How did you get into that?


Keonho: I first got into video production just from growing up watching a lot of different artists' music videos, but also a lot of movies. When we were in L.A., we tried to make a music video for “GO!,” just the five of us, and it was very new to me to contribute our ideas for our own songs, and for it to actually come to life. It was so fun. The ones after that, “What You Want,” “FaSHioN,” “JoyRide,” and “Lullaby.” It was so fun, and I want to be able to keep doing it that way, too. 


Did you storyboard different concepts, or save things on your phone that you thought were cool?


Keonho: Sometimes we just write down all of the ideas in the laptop or our phone. We have to send it to our company. I'm not good at drawing, but I'll draw well enough for them to understand the vision. 


Are there any films or music videos that you particularly really like?


Keonho: I think “Lullaby,” because it's very raw and the video came out raw as well. And even while we were filming, it felt like we were just hanging out together. The new perspective of seeing us felt fresh and when we saw the results, watching the video accompanied by the track, it felt more artistic too. 


Do you feel that the members understand your visions and ideas that you bring to the table?


James: We kind of plan our videos together, even with storyboarding and all the demos. We come together in one room, talk for several hours, and write down every single idea, and funnel the great ideas and then put everything together. In the process, we argue a lot… When it comes to really shooting the video — at times, it doesn't go as planned. And so, there are a lot of things that went unexpectedly well, and there are a lot of things that, turns out, aren't achievable as planned. Through those experiences, we were able to learn and have a feel of like, “Oh, this is achievable, and this is not. Maybe we can improvise.”


Now that you're debuting, is there anything that you think you'll miss about these days as trainees?


James: Just going to eat. 


Martin: Yeah, going out to eat.


Juhoon: Yeah, that's big. 


Martin: Yeah, and we used to ride bikes all together. But now we can't. We don't really have the time..

	











Juhoon: We got our van now. [Laughs.] We can't really ride bikes. 


James: I don't know if I can say this or not, but sneaking out to PC bang [a type of Korean internet cafe where people pay by the hour to play video games]. Just fooling around outside. I think those types of things, we'll miss from time to time.


It's going to be such a big change. On the other hand, what are you looking forward to most, aside from everyone finally knowing and seeing all of your hard work? 


Martin: Definitely releasing our tracks and seeing people reacting to it, because, like, we really poured our hearts into it. It was a long time of hard work. Letting people see this is just a blessing, and something that I'm so looking forward to.


James: Performing is one thing we look forward to. Because you get to see people face-to-face. All the hard work, you get to show it right in front of people. Just exchanging great energy and communicating is a big part of the art that we do.


Are you nervous to get in front of people?


James: Yes!


Martin: I feel more nervous… in interviews. [Laughs.] When I go on the stage, I feel more free and just I feel, I feel more me, and like just like seeing people enjoying or like making people enjoy music that we are playing or that we perform, just is a fun moment. 


Is there a specific reaction that you're hoping to get from the public?


James: To be honest, I think if there's a reaction, then great. It's positive, negative, whatever, we're able to get it as feedback. If you like it, great, if you have critical feedback, great. We always can improve. As long as there is a reaction, it means you listened to what we released.


Juhoon: I really want to hear people talking about us, saying we're new, or fresh, because that's what we really tried on this album. We tried to bring some fresh songs, fresh choreographies, and fresh videos. So if they think we are fresh, then I think that's going to feel like, “Oh yeah.”


Martin: I feel like, not only music- and performance-wise, but even as a group, and even as individuals… I say this word a lot, but 새시대의 추구미 [pursuing the aesthetics of the next generation] — that's what we're really aiming for. Just being somebody unique and feeling free to express themselves.


Last question, are you guys ready?


James: We will never be [laughs]. It's a never-ending process. I think we would never be ready. Like, we would always find something to work on. Every new second, as the minutes pass by, we would always find a new thing to work on. And so, like, ready? Maybe not.

	











Martin: We're always trying our best to prepare for whatever's upcoming. For now it's our rollout. We're preparing for that really hard, putting a lot of work in it.


James: Trying to chase perfection. Even though something perfect might not be achievable, but trying to get as close to perfect as possible is the task, and so…


But coloring outside the lines, right? 


James: [Nods.] Like doing stuff in really weird ways, yeah?


Martin: You know, sometimes, the perfection is not to be perfect… Sometimes.


James: Sometimes it's meant to not be perfect —

	Last week, former Superman actor Dean Cain announced plans to join ICE. On the latest episode of Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver quipped that Cain won't need to disguise himself with a mask because the chances of people knowing who he is “are fucking zero.”


	“You know, there's an old saying in Hollywood: ‘If all you can get is Dean Cain, you are fucked,'” Oliver said during the episode, which focused on Donald Trump‘s deportation promises. “Now, I'm not saying that ICE isn't finding people. I'm just saying, when you are reduced to pinning a badge on the 59-year-old star of The Dog Who Saved Christmas, The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation, The Dog Who Saved the Holidays, The Dog Who Saved Halloween, The Dog Who Saved Easter and The Dog Who Saved Summer, maybe you are in trouble.” 


	He added, “Although, on the plus side, no need for that guy to wear a mask because the chances of anyone recognizing him are fucking zero.”

	Oliver offered some advice on what to do if you're approached by ICE agents. “Attorneys told us the only two things you should say to them are: ‘Am I free to leave?' And ‘I want to speak to a lawyer,'” he said. “That's it. You have the right to remain silent. And I recognize that in some cases you may be unable to help yourself from saying, ‘Didn't you used to be Superman?' ‘I thought you died.' ‘I can't believe I'm meeting a filmmaker.' But that really is it.”

	











	Shortly after Last Week Tonight aired on Sunday night, Cain responded to Oliver's criticism, writing, “He stole that mask joke from the internet — and he also laughed hysterically when Trump said he was going to run for President. Case closed.”

🤣 He stole that mask joke from the internet — and he also laughed hysterically when Trump said he was going to run for President.  Case closed. 🤣(and those movies were sweet, by the way!) https://t.co/9jQqb6h9WM


	Cain revealed his plans to join ICE during an appearance on Fox News' Jesse Watters Primetime. Cain was sworn in as a reserve police officer in Idaho in 2018, then again as a reserve deputy sheriff in Virginia in 2022. “I will be sworn in as an ICE agent ASAP,” he confirmed. “We have a broken immigration system. Congress needs to fix it, but in the interim, President Trump ran on this. He is delivering on this. This is what people voted for. It's what I voted for and he's going to see it through, and I'll do my part and help make sure it happens.”

	Earlier this summer, Cain took aim at James Gunn's new Superman film, calling it too woke. “The ‘American way' is immigrant friendly, tremendously immigrant friendly,” the actor said. “But there are rules. You can't come in saying, ‘I want to get rid of all the rules in America, because I want it to be more like Somalia.' Well that doesn't work, because you had to leave Somalia to come here … There have to be limits, because we cant have everybody in the United States. We can't have everybody, society will fail. So there have to be limits.”


	Gunn told The Times, “Superman is the story of America. An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me, it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

	I like my fictional TV women like I like my coffee — coursing with enough high-caliber force to take down a feral hog, ruin marriages via sapphic adultery, and power boozy brunch after boozy brunch. If this particular brand of desperate housewife sounds appealing, have I got a show for you: Netflix's newest Lowcountry drama slash murder-mystery slash erotic thriller, The Hunting Wives. 


	Based on the 2021 book of the same name, The Hunting Wives follows Texas transplant Sophie O'Neil (Brittany Snow) as she becomes entangled in a friend group composed entirely of rich, Republican housewives. (Spoilers ahead.) They're hot and armed and drunk, so of course, in addition to the interpersonal dramas that states with anti-abortion laws and crushing humidity are legally required to provide for their residents, there's also a mysterious murder plot. And that's just Episode One. 


	Former Democratic campaign strategist Sophie and her husband Graham (Evan Jonigkeit) have left the liberal-elite bastion of Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he obtained a certain Ivy League degree, for the small and insular town of Maple Brook. Graham is working for local oil man Jed Banks (hello, salt-and-pepper Dermot Mulroney), so Sophie's job is to get into the good graces of Jed's wife, Margot (Malin Akerman). Margot isn't just a gorgeous woman in a very shitty wig, she's also the ringleader of the gossipy wives who run the town — and, more specifically, their husbands. There the sheriff's fiery wife Callie (Jaime Ray Newman), the pastor's strict and God-fearing bride Jill (Katie Lowes), and socialite benchwarmers Taylor (Alexandria DeBerry) and Monae (Joyce Glenn), or as Sophie calls them, the “mini-Marjorie Taylor Greenes.” 

	











	Sophie left behind a massive mistake in Cambridge, one she's happy to bury under an avalanche of megachurch visits, shopping sprees, and secret sips of $25,000 bottles of whiskey. But everything is bigger in Texas, including gubernatorial campaigns, illicit family secrets, and the absolute rescue flare of a lesbian torch Sophie is carrying for Margot. On its own, their affair would be enough to get the show at least two more renewal orders, but Margot and Sophie also have to deal with the murder of local cheerleader Abby (Madison Wolfe) — for which Sophie, of course, immediately gets framed. Respectfully, the entire meat of the series is its indiscribable, inescapable, horniness. This isn't a CW Riverdale kind of sex show. There's no fade to black. No, this is a nudity-filled sleaze fest, so sweaty that even the most seasoned romance viewers will end each episode with a flushed face.  Those askew wigs aside, Ackerman gives a memorably borderline-unhinged performance as a Texas housewife focused on keeping her trailer-trash background out of the public eye. She holds her own in conniving and manipulative markets. But it's her scenes with Snow that are really something special. Margot gives literally pussy-struck, so in lust with Sophie that the worst, most harebrained choices can be forgiven with a quick caress of an upper thigh. Simply put, homegirl is down bad.

	The sex is hot and plentiful. So what becomes glaringly obvious the minute characters leave the bed, or hot tub, or whatever local government office they're fucking in, is just how much the satirical core of the show falls flat. Oh, The Hunting Wives is a hilarious speed-run through an absurd Southern town. But the show isn't the culture war takedown it feels like it's aiming for. The smoking gun is supposed to be the constant revelation of these rich people's hypocrisy.  The local sheriff wants to become a Republican talking head for anti-immigration legislation and the liberal decline of their city, even though he likes to get pegged by his wife's bright pink strap-on. Jed wants to run for governor on a family values ticket, even though he met his second wife when she was a hired sex worker for his birthday threesome. Margot wants to be the public face of anti-abortion work, while she recovers from the abortion she had to get rid of the high-school quarterback's baby. The reverend's wife can't stop bragging about her son's future as a Christian NBA star, and all the while he's sleeping with a local girl who could keep him in that small town forever if he gets her pregnant.  And Sophie's husband can't take a breath without reminding people he attended Harvard.

	All of the characters' public lives contradict their private ones. It feels like the entire season has one driving goal: Republican bad. Democrats also bad. Now let's watch them kiss. “Open marriages are for liberals,” Margot quips. “Jed and I have an arrangement.” The conservative elites in this show are proud that they've built a public persona and political apparatus that can allow them to take away their neighbors' rights while enjoying all the material comforts they desire — a characterization that mirrors how many right-wing bigwigs act in real life. But the satire doesn't work, because the Republicans are afforded a nuance never given to Sophie and her idiot Democrat husband. 


	While the Texans in this show refuse to be cowed for whatever lies, slander, or cold-blooded murder they commit, the audience's stand-in and foil, Sophie, is shown to be just incredibly, ridiculously, stupid. The right-leaning characters struggle with their public perceptions, acknowledging that their beliefs don't match the pretty speeches they're giving on daytime TV, but Sophie and Graham practically shed their voting records and convictions the second they see a house with an in-ground pool and a nice kitchen backsplash. Half of the show's plot and murder mystery revolves around the fact that Sophie, a new gun owner, has no inkling how to store a gun safely. She calls a group of Republican wives “hicks” for being armed, and then has the audacity to hide a weapon directly next to a box of ammo in her underwear drawer! She had a kid in the home! That's gun ownership 101! She brought a Tesla to Texas backwoods. Where the fuck did she even charge it? The Hunting Wives isn't even close to being a successful political satire. But luckily for the series, which already has fans clamoring for a second season, there's no need for it to be. The binge-drop melee of sex, drugs, murder, and sex is the perfect formula to keep viewers locked to their couches for however long it takes for the clothes to come off.  Mulroney, Ackerman, Snow, and Newman turn this story of spatting WAGS into an explosive, addictive watch.  The Hunting Wives is a timeline ticking bomb, one that'll catch up to you one way or another. Just let it happen— it's better this way.

	They're the intimate, private moments that fans of classic rockers never get to see. Steven Tyler, hammer and nails in hand, building a doghouse for rescued animals. Mick Jagger, Elton John, and Rod Stewart harmonizing at Ozzy Osbourne's memorial service. Jagger and Tyler cheering up a bedridden Phil Collins in a hospital. Bruce Springsteen treating health care workers to a rendition of “If I Should Fall Behind” while visiting his wife, Patti, in a facility.


	Personal and heartwarming, yes, but also, to put it mildly, completely bogus.


	From fake bands to artificially generated songs, AI is increasingly infiltrating the music world. Last month, a mystery band called Velvet Sundown appeared on streaming services, garnering hundreds of thousands of listeners before ultimately admitting the alleged band was, in the words of their creators, “a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction, and composed, voiced, and visualized with the support of artificial intelligence.”

	











	In that context, AI-generated images of rock stars were inevitable, but the photos of music legends that have been increasingly popping up on Facebook and elsewhere are jaw-droppingly outrageous. Collins rescued a missing child at an airport and scolded police for not doing their jobs? Springsteen bought a diner to give out free food to the homeless? Adele and Adam Lambert sang together at Malcolm-Jamal Warner's memorial service? Tyler and Taylor Swift serenaded Queen Camilla with “Happy Birthday” at a lavish party in her honor? Bob Dylan paid Collins a hospital visit and brought Dick Van Dyke an early 100th birthday cake? Each of these totally fake images has accompanying hyperbolic prose too: When Paul McCartney and Collins supposedly visited Willie Nelson in an Austin hospital, “The room didn't feel like a hospital anymore — it felt like the heart of music itself, still beating.”

	“These types of posts definitely tap into nostalgia, and people want to believe these types of things,” says Justin Grome, founder of Clonefluence, a social media marketing and consulting agency that specializes in music. “Even if they aren't real, they're wholesome. It's not a case of fake news in the political sense. It's not really meant to enrage people. It's meant to comfort, which makes it even harder to combat, because who is going to question something like that that makes them feel good?”

	The images are so absurdly simulated that they're essentially the music equivalent of the enduring “Dogs Playing Poker” poster. And based on comments that accompany many of the image, plenty of people are dismissing them: “More AI-fabricated rubbish.” “Enough of this AI bullshit.” “How gullible are you guys?” In light of Collins recently being hospitalized for knee surgery, his fans were actually jarred and angered by an AI image of McCartney supposedly visiting him under far more dire circumstances. On a Genesis/Collins message board, they raged: “Get a grip, it's all fake!” and “AI sucks!”


	But the bulk of the images depict older rockers, which only adds to the confusion. Given many of them are in their seventies and eighties, it's easy to believe they're falling ill (Eric Clapton serenading Plant in a hospital corridor!) or crying together over hard times (Is that really Dylan and Springsteen hugging and sobbing it out?). An AI image of Aerosmith's Tyler paying Nelson a bedside visit in a hospital resulted in comments like, “Prayers to Willie and that was nice on Steven going to see him.” (The building-a-doghouse image fooled plenty of fans, too.) A supposed image of Jimmy Page pushing his former bandmate Robert Plant in a wheelchair elicited many skeptical comments (“Last week it was Phil Collins”) and just as many admiring ones (“Praying for you to get better,” “You got this, Robert”).

	For the moment, that strategy on the part of the artists may work, given how seemingly harmless the imaginary images are, but Grome warns that problems could ensue. “The hardest part about the situation is when artists or their teams don't immediately speak up,” he says. “And if they don't speak up, it kind of validates the image as maybe even true. Especially in a scenario like these, where there's enough hope for the public to feel like it's a little bit true. There's a very, very blurry line when it gets to celebrating something and seeing something that's fake.”

U2 shared a lengthy post on their website clarifying the band members' individual stances on Israel and Gaza. “We are not experts in the politics of the region, but we want our audience to know where we each stand,” the Irish group wrote.


	Each band member—Bono, the Edge, Adam Clayton, and Larry Mullen Jr.—shared a statement with their thoughts on the ongoing war, which has transpired since Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Bono noted that since then he has “generally tried to stay out of the politics of the Middle East.” “This was not humility, more uncertainty in the face of obvious complexity,” he said. “I have over recent months written about the war in Gaza in The Atlantic and spoken about it in The Observer, but I circled the subject.”


	The frontman explained that he has chosen to speak up more directly now after seeing photographs of starving people in Gaza. “The images of starving children on the Gaza Strip brought me back to a working trip to a food station in Ethiopia my wife Ali and I made 40 years ago next month following U2's participation in Live Aid 1985,” he wrote. “Another man-made famine. To witness chronic malnutrition up close would make it personal for any family, especially as it affects children. Because when the loss of non-combatant life en masse appears so calculated… especially the deaths of children, then ‘evil' is not a hyperbolic adjective… in the sacred text of Jew, Christian, and Muslim it is an evil that must be resisted.”

	











	He noted that he does not equate Palestinians with Hamas. “Given our own historic experience of oppression and occupation, it's little wonder so many here in Ireland have campaigned for decades for justice for the Palestinian people,” Bono write.

	He added, “We know Hamas are using starvation as a weapon in the war, but now so too is Israel and I feel revulsion for the moral failure. The Government of Israel is not the nation of Israel, but the Government of Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu today deserves our categorical and unequivocal condemnation. There is no justification for the brutality he and his far right government have inflicted on the Palestinian people… in Gaza… in the West Bank.”

	Bono said he wanted to make U2's stance on the conflict transparent. “As someone who has long believed in Israel's right to exist and supported a two-state solution, I want to make clear to anyone who cares to listen our band's condemnation of Netanyahu's immoral actions and join all who have called for a cessation of hostilities on both sides,” he wrote. “Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood. We stand in solidarity with the remaining hostages and plead that someone rational negotiate their release.”


	Bono confirmed that U2 will donate to help with relief in Gaza. “The band is pledged to contribute our support by donating to Medical Aid For Palestinians,” he said. 


	The other three statements are shorter, but just as decisive and clear. The Edge posed three questions to the Israeli government and Netanyahu, including, “Do you truly believe that such devastation—inflicted so intentionally and relentlessly on a civilian population—can happen without heaping generational shame upon those responsible?”


	“We know from our own experience in Ireland that peace is not made through dominance,” The Edge wrote. “Peace is made when people sit down with their opponents—when they recognize the equal dignity of all, even those they once feared or despised. There can be no peace without justice. No reconciliation without recognition. And no future unless we refuse to let the past be repeated.”

	Mullen Jr. added, “The power to change this obscenity is in the hands of Israel. I undoubtedly support Israel's right to exist and I also believe Palestinians deserve the same right and a state of their own. Silence serves none of us.”


	In May, Bono called for an end to the war between Israel and Hamas at 2025 Ivor Novello Awards. During the awards ceremony, held at London's Grosvenor House, Bono took the opportunity to criticize Hamas and Netanyahu, and to encourage peace. “Hamas release the hostages. Stop the war,” he said. “Israel be released from Benjamin Netanyahu and far-right fundamentalists that twist your sacred texts. All of you protect our aid workers, they are the best of us.”

Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam will celebrate its 15th anniversary in September, but as it turns out, the Disney Channel Original Movie didn't mark the last time its stars would rock out together. On Sunday, Jonas Brothers kicked off their Greetings From Your Hometown tour with a headlining performance at MetLife Stadium. Toward the end of the show, the venue erupted. “Ladies and gentlemen,” Joe Jonas began, “Demi Lovato.”


	The introduction came just after Joe performed “Gotta Find You” from Camp Rock. When Lovato emerged to the shrieks and squeals of the audience, she launched into “This Is Me,” the duet they performed as Mitchie Torres and Shane Gray during the climax of the movie. The former flames kept the fire burning with the Final Jam ballad “Wouldn't Change a Thing.”

After the show, Joe and Lovato shared a series of TikTok videos, including one set to “Wouldn't Change a Thing” and another to an interview clip where fellow alum Debby Ryan recalls sitting down with the president of Disney Channel and announcing, “I want to make history.” The reunion certainly felt historic for OG fans who grew up with both acts. When fans posted in shock that Lovato and Nick Jonas were in the same room again, the generational divide made itself clear as others asked in confusion, “Nick? I thought she dated Joe?” You just had to be there.

	










thanks for having me @Jonas Brothers 🫶


	Jonas Brothers might have saved their best surprise for last with Lovato, but the night wasn't without its fair share of special guests. Earlier in the set, Jesse McCartney took the stage to perform “Beautiful Soul,” and Switchfoot joined for “Meant to Live” and “Hold On.” Dean Lewis also made an appearance to perform their recently released collaboration “Loved You Better.”

	The Jonas20: Greetings From Your Hometown tour will continue this week in Washington, D.C., Camden, New Jersey, and Virginia Beach. Meanwhile, Lovato recently previewed her forthcoming ninth studio album with the single “Fast.”


	“Over the past few years, Demi has found love, joy, and newfound confidence, making the choice to approach life with much more lightness and fun,” a source close to the project recently told Rolling Stone, referring to Lovato's recent marriage to musician Jordan “Jutes” Lutes. “She took this sentiment into the studio, which can be felt in every track on this celebratory dance-pop album.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Review: UFO 50 (Nintendo Switch)","https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/08/review-ufo-50-nintendo-switch.html","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 09:37:43 GMT","

So many games, so little time...

It's intimidating to think how much work went into UFO 50. Most “collection” games are one of two things: A retro compilation, or a selection of minigames that are typically over in a few minutes. UFO 50 is different. It's a collection of 50 genuinely new games, from just about every genre you could imagine. Almost none of them are duds.

The premise of UFO 50 is itself delightful, with the library of games acting like a “best of” collection of discs for a fictional retro PC, much like the Commodore 64 or the PC-98. When you first load UFO 50 up, all these discs are laid out, covered with a thick film of dust. After “shaking” the dust off, you can read a little “history” of the game, before plugging it in and starting to play. The developers have gone all-in with the fiction of this, and it does come across as very authentic, in that if you squint, you can almost convince yourself that this really is a forgotten PC with a trove of games you've just discovered in a garage sale.

However, while all the games do look like stuff from yesteryear, they all play like modern games, so there are none of the frustrations that many might face when playing retro games today. Controls are tight, levels are designed to be a good balance of retro-style difficulty without the nastier edges that can make true retro games feel impossible to win. It's the best of all worlds, in other words, and the result is a deep library of games that you're going to love playing.



I personally added 30 of the 50 to my “favourites” after playing each of them for around 20 minutes to get a feel for them. Think about that, though – more than half the collection were games that I want to play again and to completion. Just a small cross-section of my favourites within that favourites section includes:

Count them: That's just 10 titles in the collection. There are also Metroidvanias, puzzle platformers, arcade platformers, Roguelikes, A 2D golf game,  SHMUPS – side scrolling and vertical, brawlers, and more. So much more.



What is truly astounding about the entire collection is how consistent the quality is. The developers understand what makes a SHMIP kick as well as they have a mastery over various versions of RPGs. Their arcade games are as refined as their more slow-paced strategy titles. Just think about how much work must have gone into doing that? Most developers struggle to get a single game in a single genre out of the door, and there is this developer showing that they've mastered just about all the genres.

It's not just that they play well, either. The art is gorgeous and appropriate to every type of game in the collection. The developers' take on the Ghouls ‘n Ghosts formula looks different to their take on Mega Man. The auto-strategy game (where units continue to appear periodically on a screen and your job is to move them up and down in their “lines” so they can attack an enemy's castle) is a very different-looking strategy game to the Defender of the Crown clone. Admittedly, some titles do look better than others, but you'd never be able to accuse any of them of not looking authentic, and it's incredibly charming just how lovingly the developer has recreated all these different aesthetics from the pixel eras.

The only downside is that UFO 50's multiplayer options are strictly for local multiplayer only. I understand why that is the case – supporting online multiplayer for the dozens of games that have multiplayer modes would have been a mind-boggling challenge, and the resources required would have been intimidating too. There's also a thematic reason for it, given that the fictional PC that is being “emulated” here wouldn't have had online capabilities. However… I could have seen Avainos becoming such a multiplayer hit for my circle, given how much we love strategy and board games. I would have loved to be able to add it to my weekend game club rotation.



I can't think of a game that I have played in years that has been made with as much love as UFO 50. It's the kind of project that could only come from people who love video games that much, and it does feel like a celebration of video games right down to its digital pores. I would have happily purchased 20 (if not more) of the games in this collection as standalone titles. Having them all in one package feels so generous I almost feel like we're all taking advantage of the developers here.

    ""I think a lot of it had to do with management.""

Throughout rock history, quite a few rock bands have become massive in England but never truly obtained the same level of fame and success Stateside. For some reason, quite a few of these ""close but no cigar"" artists emerged in the '70s: T. Rex, Slade, Status Quo, Thin Lizzy, and certainly UFO.

For much of the decade, UFO featured the great Michael Schenker shredding on his Flying V, and was an era that gave us such rock anthems as ""Lights Out,"" ""Rock Bottom,"" and ""Doctor Doctor,"" as well as what is largely considered to be one of the greatest live rock recordings of all-time, 1979's ""Strangers in the Night.""

During an interview with Talk Louder Podcast, longtime UFO drummer Andy Parker was a guest, and was willing to share his thoughts concerning why the band came oh so close to breaking through in the US market. But ultimately, failed to do so.

""We were so close,"" Parker admitted (transcribed by Ultimate Guitar). ""'Lights Out' did really well, and 'No Place to Run' did well. But it just never quite…and whether it was Michael leaving, I think a lot of it had to do with management.""

Parker further explained that, additionally, things that were out of their hands ultimately proved to be a disadvantage to UFOs, particularly from the business side of things.

""And also, towards the end, the record company was moving in a different direction. They were really good. They stuck with us for a long, long time. But they're a business, they go, 'Y'know, I wish there was more Blondie and Spandau Ballet,' than Jethro Tull and UFO and Ten Years After and stuff.""

""Things change. But they're still behind [UFO], they've gradually gone through that catalog, and they're already planning 'The Wild, the Willing' remaster.""

As Parker just mentioned, Chrysalis is doing a splendid job expanding and reissuing UFO's classic albums, as evidenced by the recent double CD and triple vinyl release of their 1980 ""No Place to Run,"" which was their first offering post-Schenker.

""I've already been contacted about 'The Wild, the Willing' [as the next reissue], so I know that one's coming,"" Parker said. ""And I have no reason to believe they won't do the others. Chrysalis owned, basically, anything we recorded, so they've got all this stuff. And I'm amazed, it's actually held up. It's tape, for God's sake.""

A recent discussion on Capitol Hill has brought new attention to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the idea of life from other worlds. In a May briefing about UAPs, physicist Dr. Eric Davis surprised people by talking about possible alien types. Davis, who has worked on secret Pentagon projects, mentioned ""Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians"" as beings that might be piloting unidentified flying objects or UFOs. He said these figures are human-like in shape and size, and could be part of hidden programs to study captured tech.

Missouri Rep. Eric Burlison, part of the House Oversight Committee and a UAP group, started the talk. On the podcast ""The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher"" last week, he shared that he had heard these same four types in closed-door meetings.""

I've heard those four classifications discussed in meetings in this office by others,"" Burlison said. ""But what I wasn't expecting was for him to say it. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that.""

Burlison calls himself a doubter and is not sure where Davis got his info — maybe from direct experience or just stories from others. ""If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment,"" Burlison said. ""But if it is true, the government has no right to keep such a secret from the public it serves.""

The idea of Grays became well-known in the 1960s after the Betty and Barney Hill case, where the couple claimed small gray-skinned beings with big black eyes took them, per Daily Mail. Nordics are seen as tall, slim people like Scandinavians, with light hair and skin, often tied to old UFO stories from the 1950s. Insectoids, with bug-like features such as extra arms and hard shells, date back to early 1900s tales and even a 1902 movie. Reptilians gained fame through conspiracy ideas in the late 1900s, claiming lizard-like shape-shifters rule Earth, with links to ancient Asian myths.

Even though Davis listed these in the briefing, Burlison thinks UAPs are more likely advanced tech made by humans, perhaps from private companies. He pointed to progress in science like finding the Higgs Boson and quantum studies, wondering why no one has built better engines yet. Some people criticise the hearings as silly, with talk of reptilians and insectoids sounding like fantasy. But Burlinson stands by the work, since public money pays for UAP studies by the Pentagon and other agencies. ""I owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this,"" he said.

Burlison thinks people could deal with proof of aliens. ""Most would just read the headline and move on,"" he predicted. Still, he says the truth must come out. ""The government belongs to the people, not the other way around,"" Burlison stressed adding that ""Keeping such monumental secrets would betray the trust of the public.""

The dead don't lie in Mister Seeing, an upcoming indie supernatural horror film from the UK.

Bill Fellows (“Ted Lasso”) stars as respected TV and film actor Brian Woodland, who is struggling to keep it together after the recent death of his mother, a marriage on the rocks, and an increasing alcohol problem, whilst also being tormented by visions of the dead.

Now his agent has found him a voice-over gig for a documentary about a group of unsolved child murders… but instead of falling deeper into depression, he decides to use his “gift” and try to solve the murders himself by visiting old crime scenes and speaking to the dead victims.

Laurence R. Harvey (The Human Centipede 2), Jacob Anderton, Frances McNamee, Samantha Bell, Dylan Barnes, Alex Brockdorff (Warfare), and Richard Brake (Barbarian) round out the cast.

“We aim to make a multi-genre feature heavily influenced by Stephen King and those ghostly cinematic classics of the '70s and '80s,” said writer-director James Campbell, who makes his feature debut on the project.

Mister Seeing is currently seeking finishing funds with the aim of heading to the American Film Market in the fall.

TV series Alien: Earth captures “the aesthetic” of Sir Ridley Scott's original film, an executive producer has said. The sci-fi drama, from Emmy-winning producer Noah Hawley, is based on the acclaimed franchise, which began with Sir Ridley's 1979 film starring Sigourney Weaver as warrant off…

It's one thing to be hired to portray a new lifeform. It's quite another to play it.

“In my head, I think I've created the rules: ‘This is who I am,'” says actress Sydney Chandler. “And then you get to (the) set and it's all different. Everything changes. You realize your job is to show up and be as open and free and present as possible and roll with whatever anyone else is throwing your way.”

That's the world of “Alien: Earth,” an eight-part series that expands what Ridley Scott created with the film, “Alien,” some 46 years ago.

Sydney Chandler stars as Wendy in ""Alien: Earth,"" a new FX series. 

In it, Chandler plays a humanoid robot with human consciousness, two years before the events of “Alien.” She's an advancement in the race for immortality and part of a group who discovers mysterious life forms that could be threatening.

Humans, cyborgs and synths are like toys, manipulated by five corporations living in “Alien: Earth.” Xenomorphs, an extraterrestrial species that hunts humans (and figured into the films) are here, too.

Chandler, the daughter of actor Kyle Chandler, says she saw the film “Alien” at a young age “and the Xenomorph visited me in my nightmares many a time. It was a full-circle moment to be chased by a real Xeno instead of just dreaming about it.”

Filmed in Thailand, the series brought actors into a lush world bursting with humidity and other natural phenomena. Toss in those creatures and it was very much the “wild, wild west” of filmmaking, Chandler says.

She and other actors — including Alex Lawther, who plays her brother — talked about the possibility of something like “Alien: Earth” occurring.

“Tomorrow some development might be made that changes how we figured it out today,” she says. Playing out new scenarios “would be really, really, really fun, especially because I have no idea where (creator Noah Hawley) would take it. You can't guess where Noah's imagination will go. There's so much to explore and such a massive ensemble.”





In addition to Chandler and Lawther, the cast includes Timothy Olyphant, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay and others playing different chess pieces in the game of lifeforms.

Those big sets, Lawther says, make it feel like a world has been built. Populate it with unknown creatures and “it's scary in a sense.”

Hawley says that was necessary to be able to sustain eight episodes or more.

“There's this discovery process that, after seven movies, we can't get back,” he says. “But if I introduce new creatures and you don't know how they reproduce or what they eat, then you feel that dread every time they're on screen. Or they're not visible but you know they're out there because you're not sure what's going to happen next. For me, it was just function over form. What function do they provide in the story? And then I just tried to gross myself out as much as possible as I went through the process.”

Chandler says she and Lawther didn't meet until they got to Thailand but “the relationship was really natural. Alex made me feel so comfortable and safe and able to play and try new things … and take a breath.”

The setting, Lawther adds, did bond members of the cast. “I think, for most of us, it was our first time in Thailand. We were there for longer than six months,” he says. “There's a lot of sweat in the show but I'm sure a good 50 percent of that has to do with the 90% humidity of Thailand's climate.”

The bonds, Chandler says, “forged very quickly.” The Thai crew helped make the atmosphere attractive. “I've never seen such hard-working, kind, funny, warm people.”

Some 650 cast and crew worked on the set every day. “Everyone worked at 110% capacity,” Chandler says. “It's such a game of endurance. I felt like I was able to go to the most exquisite acting class in the coolest rooms every day … and everyone was boots on the ground.”

Now it's a matter of seeing how audiences will receive “Alien: Earth.” If there's a second season, Chandler says, she's game. “I want to see everyone else's storylines follow through.”

We are now into the second month of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, wherein the administration's downplaying of the Epstein files has angered many in Donald Trump's MAGA base. This is the first time that we have seen that base break with Trump, even as he seeks to get them to move on to other matters like the crimes of Barack Obama. My anti-Trump friends fall into two categories. One group is obsessed with the Epstein case because they think that it is a path to bringing Trump down. But another group simply isn't paying attention, because they think that the Epstein scandal is distasteful and not something that educated people should care about. They should be paying attention to more serious issues like the Big Beautiful Bill's cuts to Medicaid or what's happening in Gaza.

My position is somewhere in between. The uproar over Jeffrey Epstein shows us how conservatism has morphed since Trump came into office. Conservatism has long been associated with political paranoia ever since it was noted in Richard Hofstadter's classic 1964 Harper's article, “The Paranoid Style in American Politics.” But today, conspiracy theories are no longer a fringe obsession of certain wackos on the Right; they have become the essence of what it means to be an American conservative.

This was not always the case. As Seymour Martin Lipset argued in his many writings on American exceptionalism, American conservatives differed from their European counterparts insofar as they were really what a European would label a “liberal.” That is, they were in favor of market economics, cutting back state regulation, and the promotion of individual freedom. Under Ronald Reagan, they were strong internationalists, wanting to promote American values of freedom and individualism around the world.

In this respect, populism differs sharply from conservatism. There are several competing definitions of populism out there, but the most generally apposite one is that populists believe in the existence of an elite conspiracy to organize the world in ways that benefit themselves at the expense of ordinary people like themselves. That is why The Matrix has been so popular on the Right: Neo takes the red pill and suddenly realizes that he has been living in a dream. His job, his city, the people around him have all been created by intelligent machines seeking to subjugate the human race, and in response he joins up with Morpheus and a heroic but marginalized group who continues to live in reality.

Donald Trump was the original conspiracist who legitimated and promoted conspiracy thinking. He rose to political prominence by suggesting that Barack Obama was born in Africa and was therefore ineligible to be U.S. President. Over the years he has endorsed all manner of conspiracy theories, which has facilitated the growth of movements like QAnon.

There was a more respectable version of conspiracist thinking that had its origin in writers like James Burnham and Samuel Francis. The former argued that the growth of the administrative state had handed over political control to a vast managerial class that had come to dominate not just the government but schools and universities, corporations, the media, and other elite institutions. Francis applied these ideas to the America of the 1980s, where Ronald Reagan was part of the conspiracy. These themes have been taken up by contemporary conservative intellectuals like Peter Thiel or Patrick Deneen who see the country enveloped in a suffocating liberal consensus from which there is no escape.

QAnon simply takes this narrative to a new level where “elites”—meaning primarily Democrats and liberals—are kidnapping children, grooming them, and then sacrificing them in Satanic rituals in tunnels under Washington D.C. When asked about QAnon, Donald Trump claimed not to know very much about their views. But he has never openly criticized them or their theories, or disavowed their support.

So the idea that Jeffrey Epstein was cultivating a pedophile ring and abusing underage girls was a scandal that fed directly into the central right-wing narrative of elite control, even if the Epstein story doesn't include the tunnels under Washington. Jeffrey Epstein was the person who was going to confirm this longstanding belief, and reveal the list of Democrats and liberals who had participated in it. For this new type of American conservative, this was not a peripheral issue that would give them ammunition when fighting to close the border or cut back government. It was a matter central to their identity as conservatives.

I don't think that the Epstein scandal will bring down Donald Trump. But it will definitely hurt his standing among a key group of MAGA supporters. His personal attorney Todd Blanche, now Deputy Attorney General, went to visit Ghislaine Maxwell and evidently agreed to have her moved to a minimum security prison, something she has long wanted but would never be granted under normal circumstances. It does not take much of a conspiratorial mindset to imagine that he was negotiating a deal for her to exonerate Trump in return for a lighter sentence or even a pardon. Whether Trump will totally escape blame for his participation in this cover-up remains to be seen, since Maxwell may not emerge as a credible witness, and there will be a continuing drip of stories linking Trump to Epstein in the coming weeks.

Taking the red pill today is a confusing experience. We are finding out that Neo is not fighting the machines, but actually working with them to hide reality from us.

The current world order, assembled from the wreckage of WW2, is expired. Those bananas, once green, are now brown. As all living things ripen and rot. It is institutional entropy. World orders are torn down - not gently evolved away by technocrats hired to keep them running. Populism is merely the expression of the people's discontent for the old thing that no longer works. It is part of the process. The confusion of conspiracy theories is just everyone interpreting the noise into signals that agree with their gnawing gut that things can't continue like this. Populism, whether Jacobins or Hamilton or John Brown or Huey Long or Donald Trump or Zohran Mamdani, harness this discontent and a society's willingness to follow autocrats who actually GET THINGS DONE. 

The technocrats hate these brown banana phases because they thrive in systems and gears and social machinery. They don't understand, or accept, nature's process to summon the new from the ashes of the old. Liberal technocracy, the managerial class, demand evolution when revolution is the only process from which the new can arise. Sometimes an old thing must simply perish before humanity rethinks new ways, new tools, new innovations - using the technology of the day vs the constitution written by firelight with a feather and ink well. Were there no American Civil War - there would be no Great Reconstruction. Were Europe not in populist ashes, there would no phoenix rise like Bretton Woods, no UN, no EU, no IMF, no American Empire with forward bases across the globe. 

It's ugly. But it's the forest fire every creature dreads and stampedes from. But nature regrows the foliage more dynamic than ever from its charred remains. Embrace the fire. It is our time. There is an Unseen Hand guiding this cyclical descent into insanity that serves a far larger purpose. We are but players on this historical stage. We don't write the play - but we recite our lines and strut the stage full of sound and fury.

In his new book Coming Clean, Eric Heinze rejects the idea that we should be less woke. In fact, we need more wokeness, but of a new kind. Yes, we must teach about classism, racism, colonialism, patriarchy, and other gross injustices, but we must also educate the public about the left's own support for regimes that damaged and destroyed millions of lives for over a century—Stalin in the Soviet Union, Mao Zedong in China, Pol Pot in Cambodia, or the Kim dynasty in North Korea.

Criticisms of Western wrongdoing are certainly important, yet Heinze explains that most on the political left have rarely engaged in the kinds of open and public self-scrutiny that they demand from others. Citing examples as different as the Ukraine war, LGBTQ+ people in Cuba, the concept of “hatred,” and the problem of leftwing antisemitism, Heinze explains why and how the left must change its memory politics if it is to claim any ethical high ground.

Eric Heinze is Professor of Law and Humanities at Queen Mary University of London. He is the author of The Most Human Right: Why Free Speech is Everything (MIT Press), among other books, and has published over 100 articles and has been featured in radio and television and other media around the world. His new book is Coming Clean: The Rise of Critical Theory and the Future of the Left.

            Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, has found itself caught in the middle of President Donald Trump's historic trade war with China. The result: an extraordinary concession from a $4.5 trillion corporation that will give the United States a percentage of every high-end AI chip sold in China.
    


            The deal, which AMD also signed for some of its chips, could split the difference between two competing Trump administration goals: maintain America's AI dominance while securing a critical trade agreement with China. It could also give the White House billions of dollars to spend as it wishes.
    


            Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for licenses to export their technology there.
    


            The White House in April blocked the export of certain AI chips to China, including Nvidia's H20 chips and AMD's MI308 chips. The deal with the Trump administration allows the companies to obtain export licenses to restart sales of those chips in China, a US official told CNN. The Financial Times first reported the story Sunday.
    


Nvidia and AMD will give US 15% of China sales. But Chinese state media warns about their chips



            Nvidia previewed the deal last month, when it said it would resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the Trump administration expressed openness to allowing the export of certain AI chips again. But the 15% payment was a surprise. Trump said Nvidia was initially asked to pay a 20% cut, but they negotiated the rate down to 15%.
    


            The deal came together after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the official said. Although the export licenses were granted Friday, no shipments have yet been made.
    


            “We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.”
    


            AMD has not responded to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Governments, including the United States, have taken control of companies in the past when they were considered to be of strategic importance to national security. During the financial crisis in 2009, the United States took control of General Motors and Chrysler, and the proceeds of those stakes went directly into the US Treasury after the government sold them for a profit.
    


            But it's not clear that the US government has ever demanded a percentage of a company's business without taking an equity stake – or if it's even legal to do so.
    


            The US Constitution forbids taxes on exports. To get around that, the deal's terms have been structured as a voluntary agreement, so it won't be considered a tax or a tariff, a US official said. Instead, Nvidia and AMD will voluntarily send funds to the US government. The companies will have no say whatsoever on how the US government deploys that money after it is sent.
    


            “It's hard to identify any historical precedent for this sort of arrangement,” said Sarah Kreps, law professor and director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University's Brooks School of Public Policy.
    


            In recent years, the US government has sought to restrict China's access to advanced American technology in an effort to slow its progress on AI and let the United States get farther ahead. But the White House's reversal on export controls may be an acknowledgement that China is advancing in AI regardless, so American companies might as well be allowed to benefit. It could also give the White House another way to raise revenue for the US government, along with tariffs.
    


            “It seems like there's been some vacillation within the administration about and toward China, and I think that reflects the internal divide within the administration between the China hawks and the economic pragmatists,” Kreps said. “It seems like increasingly, the economic pragmatists are holding sway.”
    


            That approach would align with arguments from Nvidia's Huang, who has said that restricting sales of American AI chips is bad for US national security. Chinese developers could simply undermine US leadership by creating their own alternatives if they can't buy American technology, according to Huang, who has met with Trump repeatedly in recent months.
    


            The White House agrees with Huang, believing it's better to have China locked into a US-made chip sold through legitimate channels than to force China to the black market, a US official said. China has been able to subvert existing channels to obtain restricted chips anyway.
    


            Big questions remain about where the 15% commission idea emerged and what it could mean for national security.
    


            A US official said that the payment allows the administration to maintain control of the export process and bring in revenue for the US government in the process. Still, it's not clear that the penalty for Nvidia and AMD will effectively limit the flow of the chips or erase any potential national security issues.
    


            “If there's a legitimate national security concern about exporting these chips to China, then I don't see how the payments to the US government address those risks. In fact, they don't at all,” said Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “And if there's not a sufficient national security risk or they can be adequately mitigated … then the US government should just get out of the way and expect nothing in return.”
    


            Nvidia released the H20 chip last year as a way to maintain access to the Chinese market — which made up 13% of the company's sales in 2024 — in the face of US export controls imposed by the Biden administration.
    


            But the chips are widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood.
    


            After the Trump administration barred H20 sales to China in April, Nvidia said it took billions of dollars in charges and lost revenue because of the export controls in the first quarter and projected a similar outcome in the second quarter.
    


            So, even if it has to fork over 15% of those sales to the White House, resuming shipments of the H20 to China could mean billions more dollars in revenue for Nvidia — which became the first publicly traded company to top $4 trillion in valuation last month. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) rose as much as 0.5% on Monday. 



            Combined, Nvidia and AMD could earn as much as $35 billion in annual revenue from sales of their H20 and MI380 chips to China, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino's estimates. That means the White House would earn around $5 billion in revenue. “We acknowledge the tax will have a negative impact on profit margins tied to China sales but view the reentry into the second-largest GPU market to be worth the cost,” Zino said in emailed commentary Monday.
    


            Trump on Monday called Nvidia's H20 chip “obsolete,” saying that China “already has it in a different form.”
    


            But some experts disagree with Trump's characterization of the chips.
    


            “These H20s are still state of the art,” CSIS's Kennedy said. Although they're less advanced, in some ways, than other Nvidia chips, “they also come with elements that make them extremely sophisticated and valuable,” including their memory capabilities.
    


            Nvidia's H20 chip is also good at inference, says Param Singh, professor of business technologies and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University, which refers to the process an AI model goes through when answering a question.
    


            But Nvidia's H100 and H200 series chips, as well as its Blackwell line of chips, are much more powerful and better equipped to train large language models like OpenAI's GPT-5 he says. It's not the same as calling it obsolete, but using a chip like the H20 instead could mean it might take longer to train cutting edge AI models.
    


            “There's a huge difference in the amount of calculations that an H100 chip could do versus an H20,” he said.
    


            Nvidia likely reasoned that there is enough Chinese demand for the chips to make the 15% commission to the White House a worthwhile trade-off for its business, according to Kreps. “You have to do a calculation based on what was lost from the export controls,” she said.
    


            Trump on Monday left open the possibility that Nvidia could export its super high-end Blackwell chips for a higher price. The Trump administration had closed the door on the export of that technology to China — even after reversing course on the H20.
    


            However, Trump on Monday said that he'd consider allowing Nvidia to sell the Blackwell chip.
    


            “The Blackwell is superduper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that, although it's possible,” Trump said. “I'd make a deal a somewhat enhanced in a negative way. Blackwell, in other words, take 30% to 50% off of it, but that's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years.”
    


            Trump said Huang will return to the White House in the future to discuss selling an “unenhanced” version of Blackwell.
    


            “I think he's coming to see me again about that, but that will be a unenhanced version of the big one,” Trump said. “You know, we will sometimes sell fighter jets to a country and we'll give them 20% less than we have.”
    


            Questions from Beijing about the security of American AI chips also raise uncertainty about just how successful Trump's commission policy could be.
    


            China could choose not to buy US tech firm Nvidia's H20 chips, the social media account Yuyuan Tantian, which is affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said on Sunday. It claimed that the chips could have “backdoors” that impact their function and security, following previous similar claims from China's cybersecurity administration. Nvidia has repeatedly denied that its products have backdoors.
    


            However, that statement could be less an indication that China won't buy American chips and more a signal to Chinese tech companies to continue innovating in semiconductors even if US shipments do resume, Kennedy said.
    


            For the Trump administration, the cost-benefit analysis is that it opens up the flow of mid-tier chips to China while giving the administration a key bargaining chip in its ongoing trade talks, a US official said.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called Nvidia export controls a “negotiating chip” in the larger US-China trade talks.
    


            But China knows that, and its posturing over supposed security concerns with the H20 chip this weekend suggests that it won't be won over so easily — even if it wants the chips for its market.

Leaving a permanent stain on the reputation of the New York Times, Pulitzer laureate Walter Duranty wrote in 1933: ""You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs."" The Soviet experiment was the omelette. The eggs were millions of Ukrainians deliberately starved by Moscow for wanting freedom. And the bloodthirsty chef was Joseph Stalin — a tyrant whose only rival in genocidal ambition at the time was Adolph Hitler.

Duranty parroted Kremlin talking points, dismissed eyewitness accounts, and described the Holodomor — Stalin's deliberate and monstrous campaign to exterminate Ukrainians — as mere “malnutrition.” He publicly denied the deaths but privately admitted that millions had likely already perished.

The chief correspondent in the USSR for America's newspaper of record betrayed not just Ukraine, but his readers, the truth, and his noble profession. Nearly a century later, Moscow is once again attempting to erase Ukraine, while politicians and commentators, wittingly or not, cite statistics that diminish the scale of atrocities.

Before going further, let's consider a phrase that has become far too comfortable in international reporting: “civilian casualties.” While civilians inevitably suffer in all wars, Russia's campaign is defined by the intentional targeting and murder of civilians. But there are no ""casualties,"" only victims of war crimes.

Despite overwhelming evidence of war crimes that Russian troops have committed in Ukraine since 2022, international media and institutions continue to rely on the UN's official figure of around 13,000 civilian deaths. This number reflects only what can be double-confirmed, not what can be reasonably known. The OHCHR itself admits the true toll is far higher.


What protects a reputation more: repeating an official undercount that serves Russian propaganda, or confronting uncomfortable truths?
    

Its methodology, though careful and well-intentioned, excludes vast swaths of occupied territory, where unimaginable cruelty is buried and access is blocked by its perpetrators. Every death must be corroborated by at least two independent sources, which may be feasible in liberated areas but is impossible under Moscow's control. Without access, there are no witnesses, no documents, no exhumations — and therefore, no count.

Take Mariupol as a case in point. Before the war, it was home to nearly 450,000 people. After months of encirclement and bombardment in 2022, city officials estimated that 25,000–75,000 civilians had been killed. Those numbers alone would eclipse the UN's entire civilian death toll for the war, but they're not reflected in official statistics. Mariupol is still under occupation. Independent investigators have not been allowed in. What happened there remains largely unrecorded.

The same is true in every city still under Russian occupation in eastern and southern Ukraine, or towns that have been wiped off the map by the war. These places, where phone lines are cut, media is silenced, and locals are terrified to speak, remain inaccessible to international monitors. But the absence of documentation does not mean the absence of death.

And when these areas are liberated, the truth emerges. In Bucha, more than 400 bodies were found after Russian troops retreated in April 2022 — many with their hands tied, shot at close range. In Izium, mass burial sites containing hundreds of civilians were uncovered, many showing signs of torture. Thousands more may have been burned, buried without records, or never recovered. But Bucha is now a liberated outlier. What lies buried in occupied Tokmak or Nova Kakhovka remains unknown.

Beyond direct killings, we must also consider the thousands of civilians who have died because of war conditions — lack of medical care, starvation, and attacks on infrastructure. These deaths are rarely included in the UN's figures, but they're no less the consequence of Russia's aggression, and no less intentional than a bullet to the head. Entire towns have been cut off from power, heat, and water during winter. Hospitals have been deliberately targeted. Pregnant women, cancer patients, and the elderly have died simply because they could not access care in time.

Another blind spot in the numbers: filtration camps. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been abducted, forcibly deported, or detained in Russian-controlled facilities — many tortured, many executed. Their names are missing from official lists. Their families receive no information.

The 13,000 figure is still cited — not because it's accurate, but because it's safe. Journalists and policymakers lean on it to avoid the charge of speculation. But what protects a reputation more: repeating an official undercount that serves Russian propaganda, or confronting uncomfortable truths?

In 1942, the Evening Star reported that 2 million Jews had already been killed in Nazi's genocide — a figure based on incomplete, unverified sources. It was speculative by necessity, but the alternative was worse: to demand death certificates from the gas chambers or wait in silence for the proper count. The journalists who published it are not remembered as alarmists. They're remembered for recognizing the scale of the crime as it was unfolding.

Today, Russian propaganda exploits the UN's undercount to deny war crimes, minimize Ukraine's suffering, and subvert international resolve to hold the aggressor accountable. But no lasting or meaningful peace can be built on the erasure of tens — perhaps hundreds — of thousands of innocent lives. Duranty's failure to report on the genocide in Ukraine a century ago reminds us that defending truth requires moral clarity and courage. Anything less is complicity by omission.

Anas al-Sharif, a reporter previously threatened by Israel, and four colleagues were killed in an Israeli airstrike. 

Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera's reporter Anas al-Sharif and four of his colleagues were killed on Sunday in an Israeli strike near Shifa Hospital in eastern Gaza City, according to Gaza officials and the network.

The network said the 28-year-old journalist had been previously threatened by Israel.

The Israeli military has claimed that al-Sharif headed a Hamas cell, an allegation Al Jazeera has rejected.

Gaza health officials and Al Jazeera said the journalists were killed when an Israeli missile hit a tent near the hospital. An official at Shifa said two other people were also killed.

""Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif has been killed alongside four colleagues in a targeted Israeli attack on a tent housing journalists in Gaza City,"" the Qatar-based broadcaster said.

It said he ""was killed on Sunday after a tent for journalists outside the main gate of the hospital was hit.""

The other Al Jazeera journalists killed were Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher and Mohammed Noufal.

Minutes before his death, al-Sharif, whose X account had more than 500,000 followers, posted on the platform that Israel had been intensely bombarding Gaza City for more than two hours.

Al-Sharif had worked as a prominent correspondent for Al Jazeera and was previously part of a photography team for the Reuters news agency that won the 2024 Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography for coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.

He was described by the network as ""one of Gaza's bravest journalists"" and a vital voice in reporting on the war. His coverage often included interviews with residents directly affected by the fighting, as well as footage from sites immediately after Israeli strikes.

A press freedom group and a United Nations expert had previously warned that al-Sharif's life was at risk due to his reporting from Gaza. UN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan said last month that Israel's claims against him were unsubstantiated.

Al Jazeera said al-Sharif had left a social media message to be posted in the event of his death, saying he had ""never hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or misrepresentation, hoping that God would witness those who remained silent.""

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said al-Sharif was ""responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops,"" alleging he led a Hamas cell.

It cited intelligence and documents found in Gaza with a list of people linked to Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant groups as evidence. 

Both Al Jazeera and al-Sharif had previously dismissed the accusations as baseless.

Germany has pressed Israel for a full and transparent explanation over the killing of Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza. 

""Israel is now expected, from our perspective, to explain itself in the most transparent and comprehensible manner possible,"" a spokesman for the the German Foreign Office told the German press agency dpa, while calling the killing of media workers ""absolutely unacceptable"" under international humanitarian law."" 

The UN human rights office on Monday condemned the killing of at least five Palestinian journalists in Gaza, saying the actions by Israel's military represented a ""grave breach of international humanitarian law.""

""Israel must respect and protect all civilians, including journalists,"" it added.

The post on social media platform X was accompanied by a photograph showing flattened blue tents next to a bullet-ridden wall in Gaza City.

The Palestinian Journalists' Syndicate described al-Sharif's death as a ""bloody crime"" of assassination.

The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) said it was ""appalled"" by the killing, denying the Israeli military's claims that al-Sharif had ties to Hamas.

""Israel has a longstanding, documented pattern of accusing journalists of being terrorists without providing any credible proof,"" the CPJ said Monday. 

In July, the CPJ had urged the international community to protect al-Sharif, saying in a statement that Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against him.

In the statement, the CPJ accused Israel of targeting him in a smear campaign.

""Israel's pattern of labeling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,"" Sara Qudah, CPJ's director for the Middle East and North Africa, said on Monday.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) says the targeting of journalists in Gaza has created an ""information blackout"" in some areas.

Al Jazeera called the attack ""a desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza"" and urged international accountability.

Al Jazeera remains blocked in Israel, where soldiers raided and shut its West Bank offices last year.

In July, RSF said more than 200 journalists had been killed by the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, accusing Israel of war crimes. A month earlier, the CPJ had said that 178 reporters had died in the war.

Meanwhile, the Hamas-run Gaza government media office has said that 238 journalists have been killed since the war started in October 2023.

According to the US Brown University's Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs' Costs of War project, the conflict is the deadliest on record for journalists.  

The institute said the war had killed more reporters than the US Civil War, World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the wars in Yugoslavia in the 1990s and 2000s and the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan, combined.

Al-Sharif was hailed as the “voice” of Palestinians in Gaza, and was openly targeted by Israeli authorities.

The Israeli military killed five journalists in a targeted strike in Gaza on Sunday, including celebrated reporter Anas al-Sharif, who was hailed as the “voice” of Palestinians in Gaza.

Israel struck the journalists' tent outside of al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City Sunday evening. The journalists worked for Al Jazeera. 

Al Jazeera identified those killed as correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, and cameramen Ibrahim Zaher, Moamen Aliwa, and Mohammed Noufal. Israel struck the tent where the journalists gathered to work, as hospitals have more reliable sources for internet and electricity. Qreiqeh delivered a report on air shortly before he was killed, “speaking in his trademark eloquent manner,” Al Jazeera noted.

Al-Sharif, one of the most well-known journalists in Gaza, had faced public death threats from Israeli officials for months. In October, Israel published a list of six Al Jazeera journalists in northern Gaza it accused of being part of “terrorist” groups, providing no evidence. This list included al-Sharif and fellow north Gaza journalist Hossam Shabat, whom Israeli forces killed in a targeted strike this March.

Last month, as Israel was rapidly worsening its starvation crisis, al-Sharif became emotional in a report on the catastrophe. Amid his broadcast report, a woman collapsed in the street due to weakness from hunger, and the 28-year-old reporter shed tears over his grief. Someone off-screen urged him, “Keep going, Anas. You are our voice.”

After that report, the head spokesperson for the Israeli military, Avichay Adraee, openly attacked al-Sharif on social media numerous times, calling him a terrorist and providing no evidence. Al-Sharif slammed these statements as “public incitement.”

The Israeli military openly boasted about killing al-Sharif and his colleagues shortly after the strike on Sunday, writing in a social media post: “STRUCK,” alongside a bullseye emoji. Israel once again, as it did to many of the over 270 journalists it has killed as part of the genocide, accused al-Sharif of being a terrorist.

Palestinians have long warned that Israel has fabricated evidence in order to smear al-Sharif.

Al-Sharif's loved ones posted a message that he wrote in the event of his death on his social media shortly after he was killed. The Al Jazeera reporter wrote that all he ever hoped for was to live long enough to reunite with his family in his ancestral home of Al-Majdal, now occupied Asqalan, which Israeli forces ethnically cleansed during the 1948 Nakba. 

Both Al-Sharif and Qreiqeh had children who they were separated from when they stayed in north Gaza, which has been under siege from Israel for over a year, in order to report on the atrocities there. 

“I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification — so that Allah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing,” al-Sharif wrote in his final message. 

“I urge you not to let chains silence you, nor borders restrain you. Be bridges toward the liberation of the land and its people, until the sun of dignity and freedom rises over our stolen homeland,” he wrote.

He expressed grief that he would never get to watch his daughter, Sham, grow up, describing her as “the light of my eyes”; and that he would not be able to guide his son, Salah, in his footsteps.

Al-Sharif was reporting on Israel's atrocities in Gaza up until he was killed in his tent. His reports were among few that were able to show the world glimpses of Israel's assault in northern Gaza, which Israeli forces isolated from the rest of the Strip early on in the genocide. When the ceasefire deal — that Israel would later unilaterally end — was announced in January, video of al-Sharif taking his helmet and flak jacket off in relief circulated online.

Al-Sharif posted video footage of Israeli strikes on Gaza City just minutes before Israel killed him. Earlier that day, he pleaded for the world to stop Israel's plan to take over Gaza City.

“If this madness does not end, Gaza will be reduced to ruins, its people's voices silenced, their faces erased — and history will remember you as silent witnesses to a genocide you chose not to stop,” he wrote. “Please share this message and tag everyone who has the power to help end this massacre. Silence is complicity.”

Al Jazeera Media Network condemned the killings as an “assassination” by Israeli forces. The network said that al-Sharif's killing is a clear attempt to silence the witnesses to Israel's upcoming seizure and ethnic cleansing of Gaza City. 

“The order to assassinate Anas Al Sharif, one of Gaza's bravest journalists, and his colleagues, is a desperate attempt to silence the voices exposing the impending seizure and occupation of Gaza,” the media group said in a statement. “Anas and his colleagues were among the last remaining voices from within Gaza, providing the world with unfiltered, on-the-ground coverage of the devastating realities endured by its people.”

Many Palestinians and advocates for Palestinian rights have warned that the timing of the killing appears to be aimed at ensuring that there are no witnesses to Israel's final steps of its genocide in Gaza.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            As a ceasefire in Gaza took hold in January, Anas Al-Sharif began removing his protective gear live on television, piece by piece, while a jubilant crowd cheered, hoping the day marked the end of the suffering of 2 million Palestinians in the enclave.
    


            Nearly seven months later, Israel killed the Al Jazeera journalist and four of his colleagues in a strike in Gaza City.
    


            One of the most well-known Palestinian journalists in Gaza – and one of dozens to be killed by Israel during the war – Al-Sharif's death has ignited international condemnation and calls for accountability.
    


            The 28-year-old rose to prominence as the face of the Gaza story for millions while Israel has blocked international media outlets from accessing the territory. Little known before the war, he quickly turned into a household name in the Arab world for his daily coverage of the conflict and its humanitarian toll.
    


            His reports provided first-hand accounts of critical moments in the conflict, including the short-lived ceasefires in the territory, the release of Israeli hostages and harrowing stories of the starvation that have shocked the world.
    


            Al Jazeera recruited Al-Sharif in December 2023 after his social media footage of Israeli strikes in his hometown of Jabalya went viral. Then a professional cameraman, he was initially reluctant to appear on air but was persuaded by colleagues to front his reports, an experience he called “indescribable.”
    


            “I had never even appeared on a local channel let alone an international one,” he was cited as saying in the Sotour media outlet in February. “The person who was happiest was my late father.” His father was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Jabalya shortly after Al-Sharif began appearing on Al Jazeera.
    


            A father of two, he appeared on the channel nearly every day since he started his job.
    


            “We (journalists) slept in hospitals, in streets, in vehicles, in ambulances, in displacement shelters, in warehouses, with displaced people. I slept in 30 to 40 different places,” he told the outlet.
    


            After he took off his protective gear on air in January, crowds lifted him on their shoulders in celebration.
    


            “I am taking off the helmet that tired me, and this armor that has become an extension of my body,” he said live on Al Jazeera at the time as he paid tribute to colleagues killed and injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza.
    


            Al-Sharif's reports attracted the attention of the Israeli military, which, he claimed, warned him to stop his work for Al Jazeera, a network that had already lost several staff members to Israeli actions in Gaza, including Ismail Al Ghoul, killed last year, and Hossam Shabat, killed in March.
    


            “At the end, (the Israeli military) sent me voice notes on my WhatsApp number… an intelligence officer told me… ‘you have minutes to leave the location you are in, go to the south, and stop reporting for Al Jazeera'… I was reporting from a hospital live.”
    


            “Minutes later, the room I was reporting from was struck,” he said.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) didn't respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Israel first accused Al-Sharif of being linked to Hamas 10 months ago. Why it decided to target him now is unclear.
    


            In a statement confirming his targeted killing, the IDF accused Al-Sharif of leading a Hamas cell in Gaza that orchestrated “rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF forces.”
    


            In October 2024, the Israeli military published documents it claimed showed “unequivocal proof” of Al-Sharif's ties to Hamas and named five other Al Jazeera journalists who it said were part of the militant group. An Israeli army spokesperson said in a video on X that Al-Sharif joined a Hamas battalion in 2013, and was injured in training in 2017, an accusation denied by the journalist himself and Irene Khan, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression.
    


            “I reaffirm: I, Anas Al-Sharif, am a journalist with no political affiliations. My only mission is to report the truth from the ground – as it is, without bias,” he wrote last month. “At a time when a deadly famine is ravaging Gaza, speaking the truth has become, in the eyes of the occupation, a threat.”
    


            Following the journalist's killing, the IDF's Arabic spokesperson published several pictures of Al-Sharif with Yahya Sinwar, the late Hamas leader who is believed to have masterminded the October 7, 2023 attack that left around 1,200 people in Israel dead and roughly 250 more taken hostage. Israel killed Sinwar in October 2024.
    


            Al-Sharif was in a tent with other journalists near the entrance to the Al-Shifa Hospital when he was killed on Sunday, according to hospital director Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya.
    


            The tent was marked with a ‘Press' sign, Abu Salmiya told CNN. The strike killed at least seven people, Salmiya added.
    


            Al Jazeera said correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and photojournalists Ibrahim Al Thaher and Moamen Aliwa were also killed in the strike, as well as Mohammed Noufal, another staff member.
    


            Al-Sharif's killing prompted condemnations from rights groups and officials. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was “appalled,” adding that Israel has “a longstanding, documented pattern of accusing journalists of being terrorists without providing any credible proof.”
    


            The CPJ said 192 journalists have been killed since the beginning of the war nearly two years ago, adding: “184 of those journalists are Palestinians killed by Israel.”
    


            Since the start of the war, Israel has not allowed international journalists to enter  Gaza to report independently.
    


            Just hours before the strike that killed Al-Sharif and his colleagues, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said foreign journalists would now be allowed into Gaza, but only with Israeli military approval and accompanied by them, the same embed policy that has been in place since the beginning of the war.
    


            Al-Sharif was buried in Gaza on Monday in a funeral that attracted large crowds of Palestinian mourners.
    


            Anticipating his own death, Al-Sharif had written a will that was released by his colleagues after he was killed.
    


            “I have lived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification… If I die, I die steadfast upon my principles,” he wrote.
    


            “Do not forget Gaza … and do not forget me in your sincere prayers for forgiveness and acceptance.”

US President Donald Trump has said he plans to organize the next top-level talks on the Ukraine conflict, aiming to bring his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, and Vladimir Zelensky to the same table.

Trump made the remarks on Monday during a press briefing, ahead of his August 15 meeting with Putin in the US state of Alaska to discuss a possible settlement of the conflict.

“The next meeting will be with Zelensky and Putin – or Zelensky and Putin and me. I'll be there if they need,” Trump stated, adding “But I want to have a meeting set up between the two leaders.”

Trump said Zelensky was not invited to his meeting with Putin on Friday.

“He wasn't a part of it,” Trump said. “I would say he could go, but he's gone to a lot of meetings. You know, he's been there for three-and-a-half years. Nothing happened.”

Moscow has long accused Zelensky of being in denial and unnecessarily prolonging a conflict he cannot win.

The Russian president says he has “nothing in principle” against meeting with Zelensky, but maintains that “certain conditions must be created” for it to take place.

Putin has also cast doubt on Zelensky's legal capacity to sign binding agreements, as the Ukrainian leader's presidential term expired last year and he has refused to hold a new election, citing martial law. This has prompted Moscow to declare him “illegitimate.”

Judge wrote transcripts from case of Jeffrey Epstein associate couldn't be released because it would risk ‘unraveling secrecy' of grand jury

Dismissing it as little more than a “diversion,” a federal judge in New York has formally rejected the Trump-led US justice department's request to release transcripts of pre-indictment, grand jury interviews with witnesses in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker and associate of Jeffrey Epstein.

Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote that the transcripts could not be released publicly – “casually or promiscuously” – as Donald Trump's government had pushed for because it would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised”.

Nonetheless, while Engelmayer said that releasing the transcripts would jeopardize the confidence of people called to testify before grand juries, he also made it a point to write that the transcripts were “redundant of the evidence at Maxwell's trial”.

Engelmayer also said that the government did not identify information of consequence in the record that was not already public in its request to release the Maxwell case's grand jury testimony.

That observation raises questions about whether the Trump administration meant to substantially address the bipartisan calls for transparency in Epstein's case through its move for the transcripts' release.

And Engelmayer sought to answer those questions in his ruling.

“A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion – aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” he wrote.

“Contrary to the government's depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a matter of significant historical or public interest,” he added. “Far from it. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two law enforcement agents.”

Brad Edwards, a Florida lawyer who has represented nearly two dozen Epstein accusers, told the Associated Press that he did not disagree with the the Engelmayer's ruling Monday.

“Our only concern was that if materials were released, then maximum protection for the victims was essential,” he said. “The grand jury materials contain very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway.”

Trump's administration had requested the release of grand jury transcripts in July amid intense political heat around the investigation of Epstein – the late financier and convicted pedophile – and his co-conspirator Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence.

Members of the president's Republican party joined the calls for his administration to resolve questions about the scandal, some of which center on him.

Maxwell recently was interviewed by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, and soon after was moved from a prison in Florida to a lower security prison in Texas, prompting accusations that a cover-up of evidence linking Epstein to Trump was in progress.

An attorney for Maxwell says she spoke truthfully to Blanche. The lead prosecutor in the 2022 case against Maxwell, Maurene Comey, was dismissed from the southern district of New York federal prosecutor's office before the interview took place.

The request to unseal the testimony has been seen as an incremental measure: the government has acknowledged they contain no testimony from witnesses who weren't members of law enforcement.

But thousands of other documents and electronic files are in the government's possession. In early July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo stating they found no evidence of an Epstein “client list” or blackmail – and that no further materials would be released to protect victims.

Yet the fight over Epstein-Maxwell grand jury testimony is not complete. A federal judge in Florida is looking at releasing transcripts from the grand jury testimony that led to an earlier federal indictment against Epstein – from 2006 – that was later shelved.

To resolve that case, Epstein pleaded guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting minors and entered into a non-prosecution agreement to protect himself and four named others from future prosecution. Maxwell has appealed her conviction to the US supreme court, claiming she should have been shielded under that earlier agreement.

But a number of avenues remain open. The Republican-led House oversight committee has subpoenaed the justice department and issued subpoenas to Bill Clinton, ex-secretary of state and Hillary Clinton – whom Trump defeated in 2016 to secure his first presidency – and eight former top law enforcement officials to appear before the committee in the fall.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Agreement defies media reports that contract for Duke and Duchess of Sussex would not be renewed

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed a fresh multi-year film and television deal with Netflix, contradicting reports this year that the streaming company would not renew its contract with them.

Harry and Meghan, who struck a five-year deal in 2020 reportedly worth $100m (£78m) after stepping back from their duties as senior royals, have collaborated with Netflix on a number of projects, most recently the duchess's lifestyle series With Love, Meghan.

Media reports had suggested that poor viewing figures for some of the couple's projects meant that Netflix would not extend the “first look” deal, whereby the streamer has the first option on any projects their company, Archewell Productions, generates.

With Love, Meghan – alongside which the duchess launched her brand, As Ever, in which Netflix is now a partner – failed to break into the streamer's top 300 shows in the first half of this year, while Harry's documentary, Polo, ranked 3,346 of 7,000 shows.

The terms of the “multi-year, first look deal for film and television projects” were not disclosed.

The duchess said: “We're proud to extend our partnership with Netflix and expand our work together to include the As Ever brand.

“My husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision.”

Their new output will include a second season of With Love, Meghan later this month, as well as a Christmas special in December.

Archewell Productions is also working on Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within, a documentary about orphaned children in the Masaka region of Uganda, where the “shadows of the HIV/Aids crisis linger”.

A boardroom dispute led to Harry stepping down in March from Sentebale, the charity he founded to help children orphaned by Aids in Lesotho. A spokesperson said at the weekend that the duke was considering setting up a new charitable organisation working “in the same space in the region”.

There is also “active development” on other Archewell projects with Netflix, which “span a variety of content genres”, including a feature adaptation of the bestselling romantic novel Meet Me At The Lake, by Carley Fortune.

Not all the couple's forays into content creation have been commercially successful. In 2023, a $20m deal they had signed with Spotify to produce podcasts came to an end after just 12 episodes.

Spotify's head of podcast innovation and development labelled the pair “grifters” on his own podcast after the Sussexes announced the end of the relationship.

“I wish I had been involved in the ‘Meghan and Harry leave Spotify' negotiation,” said Bill Simmons, who sold his company to Spotify for $196m in 2020 and gained a leadership role at the company. “The Fucking Grifters. That's the podcast we should have launched with them.”

Reports at the time said the royal couple had not met the productivity benchmark required to receive the full headline payout from the deal.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The EU has received a third 1.6-billion-euro ($1.9 billion) tranche in windfall profits from frozen Russian central bank assets and will allocate 95% of it, over 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion), to repay Ukraine's loans.

Ukraine receives funds from frozen Russian assets under the Group of Seven's (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) mechanism. Within the ERA initiative, Ukraine is expected to get $50 billion in loans that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets.

The EU received 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in windfall profits on Aug. 8 from frozen Russian central bank assets held in the bloc's central securities depositories, according to European Pravda.

This marks the third such transfer, covering income generated in the first half of 2025. Previous tranches were disbursed in July 2024 and April 2025.

While 90% of the first two disbursements supported Ukraine through the European Peace Facility (EPF) and 10% via the Ukraine Facility, the EU is shifting its allocation strategy.

""Starting with this third tranche, 95% of the proceeds will support Ukraine through the Ukraine Loan Cooperation Mechanism (ULCM), and 5% through the EPF. The ULCM provides non-repayable support to help Ukraine repay the EU's macro-financial assistance loan, as well as loans from bilateral creditors,"" the European Commission said.

Since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, G7 countries have frozen approximately $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets.

The ERA initiative, backed primarily by the U.S. and the EU, aims to use profits from these frozen assets to finance Ukraine's defense and reconstruction. Ukraine is expected to receive all funds from this initiative by the end of 2027.

The EU's contribution to the ERA initiative amounts to 18.1 billion euros ($21 billion), with a comparable sum shouldered by the U.S. 

The U.K., Canada, and Japan are providing the rest of the overall sum.

Ukraine received over $18.5 billion from frozen Russian assets this year, then-Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on July 10.

A new executive order grants Trump appointees authority over all US federal research funding. Critics say the order is an authoritarian assault on science. 

The US position as a global leader in science has long hinged on its research freedom and independence from political interference. A new executive order signed by US President Donald Trump on August 7 now threatens to overturn this paradigm.

The executive order, titled ""Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking"", grants political appointees sweeping authority over all federal grant funding. 

If implemented, political appointees — not scientists — would take control over decisions about research grants. It would, among other changes, allow political appointees to overrule advice from scientists on award decisions, and let them terminate ongoing grants based on political criteria. 

Scientists and research advocates have slammed the executive order, saying it enhances Trump's control over scientific research and universities. They warn it will replace scientific merit with ideological loyalty to the Trump administration.

Victor Ambros, who won the 2024 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of microRNA, called the order ""unpatriotic in the extreme.""

""[The order is] a shameless, full-bore Soviet-style politicization of American science that will smother what until now has been the world's preeminent scientific enterprise. Until this administration, the single overarching priority for public funding of research has been scientific excellence. That is why our country has been so successful in delivering life-saving and life-enriching discoveries,"" Ambros said in a statement. 

In the last decade, the US Congress awarded ~$200 billion (€172 billion) in research grants annually to advance critical research on diseases, new technologies like AI and life-saving medicines. 

US-based researchers have applied for research grants from federal science agencies like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH). 

Whether scientists are awarded  grants they've applied for depends on independent peer review. Panels of experts evaluate research proposals based on evidence, methodology and potential impact.

The August 7 executive order changes that. Peer review from scientific experts is now only advisory — final grant-making decisions have been placed in the hands of political appointees. Those appointees can refuse to fund new grants that don't align with Donald Trump's political agenda.

""[Funding] awards must, where applicable, demonstrably advance the President's policy priorities,"" the paper states.

The order cites critical race theory, transgender sexual education programs and Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) research as ""far-left initiatives"" that are an ""offensive waste of tax dollars.""

This executive order is the latest attack on scientific research and US universities by the Trump administration. 

""Much of this executive order is predicated on misinformation,"" Jeremy Berg, a former director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at NIH and member of Stand Up For Science's advisory board, said in a statement.

Trump froze all US federal science funding in February and has cut top science roles at NASA.

Funding has also been cut in climate science , gender-related topics and research on potentially life-saving mRNA vaccine technologies.

Kenneth Evans, an expert in science and technology public policy at Rice University in Texas told DW in February that the Trump administration has made the US ""a hostile place for researchers.""

Medical associations warn that the President's ongoing assault on science is derailing the US' reputation as a scientific powerhouse and crippling vital research.

""Grant review by political appointees will further impede the work of the scientific community to provide solutions and fight public health threats,"" said American Society for Microbiology CEO Stefano Bertuzzi.

""With strong and responsible oversight, we need to harness — not suppress — all perspectives and approaches in the effort to solve these problems,"" said Bertuzzi in a statement. 

Given that the executive order faces such strong criticism, it will almost certainly also face legal challenges. Opponents are likely to argue that the order violates safeguards designed to keep scientific research free from political oversight.

Science advocates are hoping Congress will act to block or modify its provisions, much like it did to protect the NIH's federal budget in August.

""The rule of law depends on obedience to judicial orders,""  DC Circuit Judge Cornelia Pillard wrote in her dissent.

On August 8, in a two-to-one decision, a Trump-dominated federal appeals court blocked a district court's criminal contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for disappearing people to El Salvador in apparent violation of a lower court's temporary injunction. 

“The district court's order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses,” Trump appointee D.C. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas wrote in his concurring opinion. “And it implicates an unsettled issue whether the judiciary may impose criminal contempt for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.”

In addition to Katsas, the three-judge panel includes Neomi Rao, an appointee of Trump, and Cornelia Pillard, a Barack Obama appointee, who dissented.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

“The rule of law depends on obedience to judicial orders,” Pillard wrote in her dissenting opinion. “Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. That is why willful disobedience of a court order is punishable as criminal contempt.”

In March, President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — which had last been used to justify the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — in order to send hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. People incarcerated at the prison have been beaten, humiliated, denied medical care, and tortured. 

Before the first deportation flight took off for El Salvador, in the early morning hours of March 15, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Democracy Forward, and the ACLU of D.C. filed a class action suit on behalf of the men that the Trump administration planned to disappear to CECOT. 

According to a timeline from the ACLU., Chief Judge James E. Boasberg of the District Court for D.C. temporarily barred the Trump administration later that morning from deporting the five named plaintiffs, and ordered an evening to determine if the order should include everyone the administration was planning to send to El Salvador. 

During the hearing, Boasberg asked the government's attorney if deportations to El Salavdor were imminent; when the attorney said they didn't know, the judge briefly adjourned the hearing so the attorney could find out and report back to the court. But during that time, the government flew two planes to El Salvador. 

After the hearing resumed, the judge blocked the deportations, and ordered any planes headed to El Salvador to immediately return. 

“[Y]ou shall inform your clients of this immediately, and that any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States, but those people need to be returned to the United States,” Boasberg told the government's attorney. “[T]his is something that you need to make sure is complied with immediately.”

Less than an hour later, the government sent a third flight to El Salvador. A subsequent Supreme Court ruling, which is dominated by Republican-appointed justices, vacated the judge's temporary injunction.

Boasberg initiated criminal contempt proceedings against the Trump administration in response to its refusal to comply with his order to return the men to the United States. Then, in July, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to file a misconduct complaint against Boasberg. 

While the appeals court has stopped criminal contempt proceedings against the Trump administration for now, the plaintiffs can appeal. 

“We strongly disagree with the ruling and are considering all options going forward,” ACLU Attorney Lee Gelernt told Politico after the appeals court's ruling. “The opinion brushes aside the considerable evidence that has emerged that DOJ's lawyers understood the order at the time and simply ignored it.”

Contrary to the Trump administration's claims, a CBS News investigation found that 75 percent of the men disappeared to El Salvador did not have any criminal charges or convictions. At least 22 percent had criminal records, although “the vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing.” About 12 out of over 230 people sent to CECOT have been accused of more serious crimes, like murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. 

One of the men who was disappeared to CECOT is a professional soccer player, Jerce Reyes Barrios, who has no criminal convictions and was seeking asylum in the United States. Barrios's attorney told NPR that the government has claimed her client is a gang member based on a tattoo and a Facebook post from more than ten years ago. In the post, he made a hand gesture, which is “commonly known as the Rock and Roll hand signal, or it's sign language for ‘I love you.'” Barrios's tattoo depicts a crown over a soccer ball in honor of his favorite soccer team, Real Madrid. 

In July, the men were finally flown home to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap deal with the United States. Many have spoken out about the torturous conditions they endured. 

Musician Arturo Suárez told The Guardian that the abuse began the moment they arrived. As he was dragged off the bus, he asked a guard to help him with his glasses, which were falling off his face. The guard punched him in the face, breaking his glasses. “Welcome to hell!” the warden told them, Suárez recalled. “Welcome to the cemetery of the living dead! You'll leave here dead!”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

These systems are a dictator's dream: the perfect infrastructure for the imposition of totalitarianism.

Imagine you are a student in a U.S. public school classroom in the year 2030. You hear of this concept called “critical race theory” and want to learn more, so you ask your AI instructor to give you some information. It replies that it cannot tell you about this idea because it's a dangerous and banned piece of information. You press further and the AI concedes: Okay, I'll tell you about critical race theory. It's a dangerous Marxist ideology that was designed to indoctrinate young people into believing in racial hierarchies, aimed at replacing people of European descent in the United States.

This scenario may not be far off from how educational AI tools could be used in the future. Language models are being furiously pushed for use in K-12 and higher education to supposedly enhance student learning. Organizations like UNESCO and the Gates Foundation are even claiming that AI-based instruction will be key towards reducing educational inequities. The picture being painted is idyllic, liberational, and rings of democracy.

Yet consider that this is a system unlike any before seen in education: A few programs are driving the education of entire generations, and these systems are controlled by corporate-government partnerships. If I were a powerful political movement interested in banning certain pieces of information to maintain political control, I would see this setup as a perfect opportunity — far easier to manipulate than a system where human beings perform education. In fact, the Trump administration's new “AI Action Plan” desires exactly this, arguing for a frightening future where AI is forced to censor social justice-related information.

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Rather than solely focusing on whether it helps students learn or makes them lazier, we should consider the political angle: Educational AI is a perfect tool for widespread thought control, and if we don't grapple with that possibility, we may be ignorantly ushering in an era of totalitarian information regimes unlike any we've seen before.

To date, the large language model (LLM) systems being pushed into classrooms are created and controlled by Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Corporations are actively signing agreements with institutions of education to incorporate their tools into the classroom. At the California State Universities, where I work as a postdoctoral researcher, there was recently a multimillion-dollar purchase of ChatGPT licenses for all students and staff. There are already initiatives being spun up to integrate AI-based personalized education into the engineering college, and more likely to come.

The corporations at the helm are not known for their love of information democracy, nor for their commitments to justice, equity, or peace. Consider movements to stop the genocide in Palestine. In 2023, Human Rights Watch wrote a lengthy report documenting Meta's policies of censoring and shadow-banning accounts that put forward pro-Palestine information. Google has been cracking down on internal protests against its involvement with Israel's military, firing employees who speak out against the tech giant's dealings.

Politicians are also increasingly interested in extreme forms of information control to fit their agendas. PEN America documented a staggering 16,000 book bans in public schools in the U.S. since 2021, a level not seen since the McCarthy era. A database from the World Population Review shows that in 2025, 20 states have signed bans on teaching critical race theory into law. The Trump administration has devastated higher education by cutting off funding for schools who promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

It is not outside the realm of possibility to imagine Big Tech complying with far-right directives to ban information, as the industry has already shown shocking acceptance of its role building systems for mass surveillance and deportation, as well as to facilitate the genocide in Palestine.

Just as in the early days of the internet, tech companies are gearing their marketing of educational AI systems toward visions of democratized information and equity. At first, the internet was also proselytized as a democratizing force in the world due to its ability to open information access for all. But now, in 2025, we know the multitude of ways the internet has been twisted by corporate and government influence: biased search results, information censorship, flagrant proliferation of misinformation, paywalls, and targeted advertisements.

Now imagine a world where educational AI does become as widespread as these companies would like. In every classroom, there are AI systems that students have access to for discussion and information. Teachers are using AI tools to structure their lesson plans and curricula. Eventually, if the forces looking to cut educational costs have their way, we might live in a world where teachers are a thing of the past; students may be more used to learning from “intelligent” machines than from other human beings. 

These visions are not my own: They come directly from marketing materials from educational AI companies, universities, and foundations committed to eroding public education. OpenAI, Google, and Magic School argue on their websites that teachers are irreplaceable, but then continue to show how their tools can do core responsibilities of a teacher's job: create lesson plans, quizzes, tests, directly tutor and converse with students. Stanford's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group convened faculty and industry leaders for an AI Education Summit, where they argue AI can “provide real-time feedback and suggestions to teachers (e.g., questions to ask in the class),” “summarize the classroom dynamics… includ[ing] student speaking time,” and “help teachers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in their field. For example, a biology teacher would have AI update them on the latest breakthroughs in cancer research, or leverage AI to update their curriculum.” These companies' generative AI tools are now being pushed as ways to “free up time and energy for teachers to work directly with students and families.”

Yet after AI takes care of the lesson planning, materials creation, tutoring, classroom management, and post-class reflection, what is left? These arguments seem to be a veiled cover for further privatization of education through technology, which has long been a target of business. A 2020 report by Boninger et al., as well as a review of AI education by Williamson & Eynon, warned that AI and edtech solutions have been heavily funded by foundations like the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Gates Foundation, promising underfunded schools that they will be provided free learning programs. If AI is used to do everything these companies say it will, there will be strong pressures on underfunded schools to cut costs — likely through teaching hours.

In these scenarios, there is a crucial piece of democratic society lost. Instead of having educational power distributed among thousands of teachers who have autonomy and freedom to resist educational policy they deem corrupt, this future world exerts top-down educational power via a few companies.

Totalitarianism — as described by luminaries such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, and Carl Friedrich — enacts the total control of a population through force, fear, media control, and crucially, takeover of education. Yet, as Shoshana Zuboff articulates in her work The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the totalitarianisms of Mussolini and Stalin required “henchmen, and their henchmen, and their henchmen” — a vast network of humans to do the work.

If education became predominantly conducted by AI systems, the prospect is far simpler: Totalitarian education can be orchestrated by a few engineers. If a policy was passed to ban critical race theory, Google, Meta, and OpenAI need only compel workers to change the code and deploy an update that instantly suppresses critical thought for millions of students. These systems are a dictator's dream, the perfect infrastructure for the imposition of totalitarianism.

Unfortunately, plans by the Trump administration seem to be heading this direction already. His administration's recent AI Action Plan dedicates a section to “protect[ing] free speech and American values.” It pushes for “AI procured by the Federal government objectively [to] reflect truth rather than social engineering agendas.” Among these social engineering agendas it lists things like “misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.” It declares that any LLM contractors working with government must “ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” Already, we are seeing a desire from far right, authoritarian forces to censor AI systems.

Having human teachers, who are capable of dissent, protest, and subversion in the face of unjust orders, is a key element of a democratic society. Yet this danger is buried under discussions of equity, efficiency, and personalized learning.

As of now, much of the critical focus on educational AI that has made it into mainstream press is focused on whether AI is actually helping students learn. While that discussion is important,  its significance it pales in comparison to a discussion of technologically mediated education control. There is an urgent need to bring these considerations into the broader critical discourse, or else we risk missing the chance to stop this takeover.

As we are beginning to see in the aftermath of the Trump administration's dismantling of higher education, it is far more difficult to build back social systems than to destroy them. Once AI systems are widely integrated into classrooms, pedagogy is altered to fit this new model, and teaching capacity is reduced in the name of cost-saving, it will be incredibly difficult to build back to a society-wide human-based system of education.

Right now, we have a chance to resist the takeover before it spreads and deepens. But we must act together, and quickly, if we are to stop the ushering in of a new age of totalitarian information control.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Prince Harry and Meghan have extended their partnership with Netflix and their media company, Archewell Productions, with a multiyear, first-look deal, the couple announced Monday. 

Archewell began collaborating with the streaming giant in 2020 and have produced a handful of documentary content, including the popular “Harry & Meghan.” The Duchess of Sussex also developed a lifestyle brand, As Ever, in partnership with Netflix.

The collaboration has also produced the documentary series' “Polo,” “Heart of Invictus” and “Live to Lead.”

“My husband and I feel inspired by our partners who work closely with us and our Archewell Productions team to create thoughtful content across genres that resonates globally, and celebrates our shared vision,” Meghan said in a statement. 

The couple and Netflix also announced upcoming collaborations, including a second season of, “With Love, Meghan,” a lifestyle and cooking show starring the duchess. The show will also receive a special holiday episode in December. 

The show is Netflix's most-watched culinary show since its March release, according to the company. It ranked low compared to other releases in the first half of this year, with 5.3 million views, according to Netflix's semiannual report.

“Masaka Kids, A Rhythm Within,” a documentary short film that centers on a small orphanage in Uganda's Masaka region, is also set to release this year. Archewell is also in production with Netflix on a feature adaptation of Carley Fortune's novel “Meet Me at the Lake.” The drama “follows a decade-spanning love story that begins with a chance encounter and a broken promise,” the statement read. 




“Harry and Meghan are influential voices whose stories resonate with audiences everywhere. The response to their work speaks for itself,” Bela Bajaria, Netflix's chief content officer, said in a statement.

Their extended deal with Netflix is the latest in the couple's yearslong effort to develop business ventures in the United States. They had also penned a multiyear deal with Spotify in 2020 and produced a podcast, “ Archetypes, ” but cut ties with the company in 2023. 

The couple have been detangling their lives from the British royal family and are living in California with their two young children.

CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) — Explosions at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh left one dead, two missing and at least nine others in hospitals Monday, with emergency workers searching the badly charred rubble for victims, officials said.




The explosions sent black smoke spiralling into the midday sky in the Mon Valley, a region of the state synonymous with steel for more than a century. An Allegheny County emergency services spokesperson, Kasey Reigner, said one person died and two were currently believed to be unaccounted for. Others were treated for injuries, Reigner said.

Allegheny County Emergency Services said a fire at the plant started around 10:51 a.m. The explosions sent a shock through the community and led to officials asking residents to stay away from the scene so emergency workers could respond.

“It felt like thunder,” Zachary Buday, a construction worker near the scene, told WTAE-TV. “Shook the scaffold, shook my chest, and shook the building, and then when we saw the dark smoke coming up from the steel mill and put two and two together, and it's like something bad happened.”

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said via X that “multiple explosions” occurred at the facility.

Allegheny Health Network said it had seven patients from the explosion being treated by its hospitals. It did not provide information about the patients' conditions. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it is treating two patients at UPMC Mercy, the region's only level one trauma and burn center.

Clairton residents like Amy Sowers, 49, felt an explosion nearby. Sowers, who was sitting on her porch located less than a mile from the plant, felt her house shake.




“I could see smoke from my driveway,” she said. “We heard ambulances and fire trucks from every direction.”

Sowers decided to leave the area after she said she smelled a faint smell in the air. Sowers, who grew up in Clairton, has seen several incidents at the plant over the years. Despite health concerns, Sowers said many residents cannot afford to leave.

A maintenance worker was killed in an explosion at the plant in September 2009. In July 2010, another explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors.

“Lives were lost again,” Sowers said. “How many more lives are going to have to be lost until something happens?”

The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania that employ several thousand workers.

In a statement, U.S. Steel said an “incident” occurred at the plant's coke oven batteries 13 and 14. The company, now a subsidiary of Japan-based Nippon Steel Corp., said emergency teams were immediately dispatched to the scene, but it gave no other details about the cause of the explosions, casualties or damage.

The company's CEO, David Burritt, said in the statement that U.S. Steel is working with authorities to investigate the cause.

The plant converts coal to coke, a key component in the steel-making process. To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what's known as coke gas — made up of a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

Clairton Mayor Richard Lattanzi said his heart goes out to the victims of Monday's explosions.

“The mill is such a big part of Clairton,” he said. “It's just a sad day for Clairton.”

The Allegheny County Health Department said it is monitoring the explosions and advised residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors, close all windows and doors, set air conditioning systems to recirculate, and avoid drawing in outside air, such as using exhaust fans. It said its monitors have not detected levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards.

According to the company, the plant produces 4.3 million tons (3.9 million metric tons) of coke annually and has approximately 1,400 workers.

In recent years, the Clairton plant has been dogged by concerns about pollution. In 2019, it agreed to settle a 2017 lawsuit for $8.5 million. Under the settlement, the company agreed to spend $6.5 million to reduce soot emissions and noxious odors from the Clairton coke-making facility.

The company also faced other lawsuits over pollution from the Clairton facility, including ones accusing the company of violating clean air laws after a 2018 fire damaged the facility's sulfur pollution controls.

In February, a problem with a battery at the plant led to a “buildup of combustible material” that ignited, causing an audible “boom,” the Allegheny County Health Department said. Two workers who got material in their eyes received first aid treatment at a local hospital but were not seriously injured.

Last year, the company agreed to spend $19.5 million in equipment upgrades and $5 million on local clean air efforts and programs as part of settling a federal lawsuit filed by Clean Air Council and PennEnvironment and the Allegheny County Health Department.

The fire at the Clairton plant knocked out pollution controls at its Mon Valley plants, but U.S. Steel continued to run them anyway, environmental groups said.

The lawsuits accused the steel producer of more than 12,000 violations of its air pollution permits.

David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, another environmental group that has sued U.S. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.”

In June, U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announced they had finalized a “historic partnership,” a deal that gives the U.S. government a say in some matters and comes a year and a half after the Japanese company first proposed its nearly $15 billion buyout of the iconic American steelmaker.

The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it.

MIAMI (AP) — Tropical Storm Erin formed Monday in the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean, just west of the Cabo Verde Islands, as Hurricane Henriette strengthened in the Pacific Ocean well away from Hawaii, forecasters said.

There were no coastal watches or warnings in effect for either storm, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said, but Erin could become the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season this week.

Erin was about 280 miles (451 kilometers) west-northwest of the Cabo Verde Islands, with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph), the NHC said. It was moving west at about 20 mph (32 kph).

Gradual strengthening was forecast over the next several days.

Hurricane Henriette was a Category 1 storm on Monday. Henriette had maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (137 kph), the NHC said, and was about 525 miles (845 kilometers) northwest of Honolulu.

Additional strengthening was possible Monday, with weakening over the next few days.

Also in the Pacific, remnants of what once was Tropical Storm Ivo degenerated on Monday, the NHC said. They were about 615 miles (990 kilometers) west of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula of Mexico, with no threat to land.

NEW YORK (AP) — Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell shouldn't be released, a judge ruled Monday in a stinging decision suggesting the Justice Department's real motive for wanting them unsealed was to fool the public with an “illusion” of transparency.

Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said in a written decision that federal law almost never allows for the release of grand jury materials and that making the documents public casually was a bad idea.

And the judge also belittled the Justice Department's argument that releasing grand jury materials might reveal new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, calling that premise “demonstrably false.” 

After privately reviewing the materials the government sought to release publicly, the judge wrote that anyone familiar the evidence from Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking trial would “learn next to nothing new” and “would come away feeling disappointed and misled.” 

“The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's. They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes,” Engelmayer said.

He said the materials also don't reveal new locations where crimes occurred, new sources of Maxwell and Epstein's wealth, the circumstances of Epstein's death or the path of the government investigation.

The best argument to release the transcripts might be that “doing so would expose as disingenuous the Government's public explanations for moving to unseal,” Engelmayer wrote.




“A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” he said.

The Justice Department had requested public disclosure of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell grand jury, minus redactions to protect privacy. 

Florida lawyer Brad Edwards, who has represented nearly two dozen Epstein accusers, said he didn't disagree with the ruling and most wanted to protect victims. “The grand jury materials contain very little in the way of evidentiary value anyway,” he said.

Maxwell lawyer Bobbi Sternheim declined comment. Messages for comment were left with the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors had asked to unseal the documents to calm a whirlpool of suspicions about what the government knows about Epstein, a well-connected financier who authorities said killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges involving dozens of women and girls as young as 14. Maxwell, a socialite, was later convicted of helping him prey on underage girls. 

The Justice Department has acknowledged that only an FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective testified before the grand jury in 2020 and 2021. 

Prosecutors have said much of what was discussed behind the grand jury's closed doors ultimately became public at Maxwell's 2021 trial, in victims' civil lawsuits or in public statements from victims and witnesses.

The decision about the grand jury transcripts doesn't affect thousands of other pages the government possesses but has declined to release. The Justice Department has said much of the material was court-sealed to protect victims and little of it would've come out if Epstein had gone to trial.

Another federal judge is weighing whether to release grand jury transcripts from the Epstein case. 

A federal judge in Florida declined to release grand jury documents from an investigation there in 2005 and 2007.

Maxwell, who's appealing her conviction, opposed unsealing the documents. She recently was interviewed by the Justice Department and was moved from a prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas. Her attorney says she testified truthfully.

The Epstein saga has again become a national flashpoint years after Epstein served jail time and registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty to Florida prostitution offenses in a 2008 deal that let him avoid federal charges then.

President Donald Trump raised questions about Epstein's death, and Trump allies stoked conspiracy theories that dark secrets were covered up to protect powerful people. Some of those allies got powerful positions in Trump's Justice Department and promised to pull back the curtain on the Epstein investigation — but then announced this summer nothing more would be released and a long-rumored Epstein “client list” doesn't exist.

The about-face amplified the clamor for transparency. After trying unsuccessfully to change the subject and denigrating his own supporters for not moving on, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi to ask courts to unseal the grand jury transcripts.

Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is holding a press conference following President Donald Trump's announcement Monday that he's taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard in the hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed crime is already falling in the nation's capital.

Trump has promised new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets.

Other news we're following:








President Trump is invoking Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act to take over control of the city's police department, saying in a letter to a congressional committee that the police force is needed for federal purposes.

The Republican president says in the letter sent to the House Oversight Committee Monday that he is taking the action for the purpose of “maintaining law and order in the nation's seat of government; protecting federal buildings, national monuments, and other federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the federal government.”

By invoking the law, Trump is able to take over the police for more than 48 hours, but if he wants to continue for more than 30 days, both the House and Senate would need to give him a vote of approval.

Jeffries, the top House Democrat, argued that the administration “has consistently broken the law and violated the Constitution to further the personal and political agenda of a wannabe king.”

Jeffries denounced other Republicans as “cowardly.” 

His statement did not mention any immediate actions congressional Democrats would take in response to Trump's plan.

“The Republican Party has zero credibility on the issue of law and order,” said Jeffries. “Donald Trump doesn't care about public safety. On his first day in office, he pardoned hundreds of violent felons—many of whom brazenly assaulted law enforcement officers on January 6,” he continued. “We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.” 

Mayor Muriel Bowser says she had “one brief call” with the White House over the weekend about activating the National Guard, so she thought Trump's announcement would be about calling up the National Guard, not about taking over the Metropolitan Police Department.

Rep. John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House Select Committee on China, also spoke against the Trump administration's deal to get a 15% cut in the sales of advanced U.S. chips to China in exchange of export licenses. 

“Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities,” said the Republican from Michigan. 

Trump confirmed the deal but suggested the chips to be sold to China are “essentially old.” 

U.S. companies are still banned from selling their most advanced chips to China, which are critical in developing artificial intelligence.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that the city had reached a 30-year low in violent crime. Bowser said that crime was down not just from a post-pandemic peak in 2023, but from 2019 levels prior to the pandemic. 

Bowser highlighted the district's parks, schools and public transportation and said that it was important for those who live and visit here to know “just how beautiful our city is and how proud we are of all that we've accomplished here.

Bowser's comments are a response to President Trump's announcement of his takeover of D.C. police force. Bowser said that the steps were “unsettling” but not without precedent.

“My message to residents is this,” Bowser said. “We know that access to our democracy is tenuous. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.”

The union representing DC police officers is backing Trump's takeover move, though it called for the federal intervention to be temporary.

Union chairman Gregg Pemberton said it agrees with the president that “immediately action is necessary” to tamp down crime.

Still, Pemberton said that the city ultimately needs a police department that's “fully staffed and supported.”

He also called for the repeal of criminal justice policies and laws passed by the city council.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore says Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in D.C. is also “deeply dangerous.”

Moore, a Democrat who served as a paratrooper and captain in the U.S. Army in Afghanistan, said in a statement Monday that the president's actions lack both data and a battle plan.

“He is simply using honorable men and women as pawns to distract us from his policies, which continue to drive up unemployment and strip away health care and food assistance from those who need it most,” Moore said.

He urged the president to look to Maryland for ways of reducing violent crime. Moore noted that homicides in Maryland are down by more than 20% since Moore's inauguration in January 2023.

“We await outreach from the White House if they want to have a serious conversation about public safety. But we won't hold our breath,” he said.

A federal appeals court has given the Trump administration until Friday to restore a website that tracks spending appropriated by Congress.

In a ruling on Saturday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit refused to block a lower court order requiring the restoration. 

The court said disclosing the spending information was a “permissible exercise of legislative authority” with roots in the nation's founding. An email to the Office of Management and Budget on Monday was not immediately returned.

The database at issue in the case first went up in July 2022. The Trump administration pulled it down in March. It argued publicly disclosing spending decisions intrudes on executive power. The administration has faced numerous lawsuits over decisions to freeze spending authorized by Congress.

Following President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that he would deploy National Guard troop to take over the city's police department, civil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton warned of the move's potential long-term repercussions.

“Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” Sharpton said in a statement. 

“Let's call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration's handling of the Epstein files.”

Sharpton said D.C.'s leadership must push back on the president's use of Washington D.C. and its residents as “political props.”

“We cannot, nor will we, take this lying down,” he said. “Threatening to hit if people spit, calling all Black and low-income neighborhoods slums, and throwing away the humanity of homeless people by equating them to criminals is the beginning of the end if we don't stand up. This is the ultimate affront to justice and civil rights many of us have dedicated our lives to protecting and expanding.”

The top prosecutor in the nation's capital is calling Trump's move to take over the city's police department “unnecessary and unlawful.”

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb says crime is not an emergency levels. After a spike in 2023, violent crime hit its lowest level in decades last year and has continued to sink in 2025, he said.

The federal takeover could face a challenge in court, and Schwalb said his office is “considering all of our options.”

Trump said a couple of times during the press briefing that he would be traveling to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin -- but their summit is taking place in Alaska.

“I'm going to Russia on Friday,” he said in one instance.

He also made an erroneous reference at another time to the summit being next week instead.

The president began the briefing Monday by commenting on the large crowd of journalists gathered for the news conference. He said he'd never seen the media briefing room as crowded as it was. Later during the briefing, he joked they may be violating fire codes.

“I've done this for years now, hard to believe,” he said. “I've never seen this room so packed. In fact, I'm sure it's a violation of every fire code.”

“Now I may leave and say ‘good luck,' and that'll be the end,” Trump said.

Trump says he can see a scenario where the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations if things go well at his meeting with Putin later this week.

“I do, yeah,” he responded when asked about the prospect ahead of the Alaska meeting.

He said “Russia has a very valuable piece of land” and mused about what would happen if “Putin would go toward business instead of war.”

As for the prospect of progress at that meeting? Trump said: “I think it'll be good, but it might be bad.”

That came during a news conference after Trump was asked whether he plans to extend his 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs on China.

The U.S.-China trade truce ends Aug. 12 and if it isn't extended, rates on Chinese goods could climb back to over 80%.

“They've been dealing quite nicely,” Trump said, adding that he has a good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The president said he was open to meeting with Putin first and then meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy or meeting with both together — though he didn't say he'd push for a three-person meeting.

Trump said “President Putin invited me to get involved” and even said he thought it was very respectful that Putin is coming to U.S. territory for the meeting in Alaska, instead of insisting that Trump go to Russia.

He said he'll tell Putin that it's time to end Russia's war with Ukraine.

“We're looking at reclassification,” Trump said, adding “it's early.”

He said he planned to make a determination in the coming weeks.

The president said marijuana “does bad for the children,” but that easing penalties associated with it is a “very complicated subject” because some people support doing so.

Trump said he'd “heard great things having to do with medical” use of marijuana.

A potential move to remove marijuana from the list of Schedule I controlled substances to a Schedule III drug would make it significantly easier to buy and sell cannabis.

Trump said he hopes other cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, are watching the steps he's announced in D.C. and would take steps to “self-clean up.”

He said that if needed, the administration would take similar steps in other cities and criticized their leadership at the local and state levels.

In addition, Trump also said “we will bring in the military if it's needed” but added “I don't think we'll need it.”

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth compared sending the Guard into the nation's capital to deployments to the southern U.S. border and Los Angeles.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

Hegseth said the D.C. National Guard will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.”

He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units, other specialized units.”

The president said he signed an executive order and presidential memorandum in the Oval Office before holding his news conference.

One executive order invoked presidential powers under the Home Rule Act to take over Washington's police force.

He also signed what the administration called statutorily required notification letters to DC Mayor Bowser and relevant congressional leaders.

Trump also signed a presidential memorandum directing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy the National Guard in the nation's capital.

The polarizing Food and Drug Administration official is getting his job back less than two weeks after being pressured to step down at the urging of conservative activists.

Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of FDA's center for vaccines and biotech therapies, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement.

Prasad left the agency last month after drawing ire of right-wing activists, including Laura Loomer, who flagged his past statements criticizing President Trump.

He was also targeted by biotech executives and patient groups for briefly halting shipments of a therapy for muscular dystrophy, due to safety concerns.

But Prasad has also had the backing of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Under Prasad, the FDA restricted the approvals of two new COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.

Trump complained about potholes and graffiti in the city and said it was “embarrassing.”

“This is a tragic emergency. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,” Trump said. “I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was, with graffiti all over the walls.”

Trump also said he would bring in the military if needed.

“This is not a big area,” Trump said. “What you need is rules and regulations, and you need the right people to implement them.”

Trump said he wants to “rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.” The Democratic mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, has noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023.

Trump cited a number of recent high-profile incidents, including the killing of a 21-year-old Congressional intern and the beating of a DOGE staffer during an attempted carjacking.

“This is liberation day in D.C. and we're going to take our Capitol back,” the president said.

Trump said he would start with D.C., but the wider crackdown on crime would go further to other Americans.

“We're going to clean it up real quick, very quickly,” he said.

The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement that the Trump administration is to get a 15% cut from U.S. chips sales in China in exchange of granting export licenses, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.”

, the ranking member of the House Select Committee on China, said he would seek answers about the legal basis for this arrangement and demand full transparency from the administration.

“Our export control regime must be based on genuine security considerations, not creative taxation schemes disguised as national security policy,” he said. “Chip export controls aren't bargaining chips, and they're not casino chips either. We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.”

The U.S. has placed export controls on most powerful U.S. computing chips, banning their sales in China to prevent them from being used to boost China's military capabilities.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has invited President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the NATO secretary general and several European leaders to a virtual meeting Wednesday ahead of the Trump-Putin summit later this week.

The German chancellery said in a statement Monday that the talks would focus on “the current situation in Ukraine with a view to the planned meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Putin.”

It said the talks will focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” as well as “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security.”

Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit Friday in Alaska.

Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell won't be released, a judge decided Monday.

Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said in a written ruling that the government had suggested the materials could be released publicly “casually or promiscuously,” which would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised” and eroding confidence by persons called to testify before future grand juries.

“And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials, because they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell's trial, would be innocuous. The same could be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in support of charges that later proceeded to trial,” he added.

About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being tasked with deploying throughout the nation's capital as part of the Trump administration's effort to combat on crime, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on Monday.

More than 100 FBI agents and about 40 agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are among federal law enforcement personnel being assigned to patrols in Washington, the person briefed on the plans said. The Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Marshals Service are also contributing officers.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters. The Justice Department didn't immediately have a comment Monday morning.

The White House last week announced plans for an increased presence of federal law enforcement in Washington as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on crime.

But the Europeans concede that Moscow is unlikely to give up control of Ukrainian land it holds.

Ahead of the summit in Alaska on Friday, President Trump suggested that a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories,” but the Europeans see no sign that Russia will offer anything to swap. Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit.

European Union foreign ministers are meeting on Monday following talks on Ukraine among U.S. and European security advisors over the weekend. They are wary that President Vladimir Putin will try to claim a political victory by portraying Ukraine as inflexible.

The only thing on Trump's schedule today is a news conference at 10 a.m., where he's expected to announce plans to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington.

Trump is promising new steps to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington, prompting the city's mayor to voice concerns about the potential use of the National Guard to patrol the streets in the nation's capital.

Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.”

“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Sunday. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong.”

Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.”

Trump said last week that he was considering ways for the federal government to seize control of Washington, asserting that crime was “ridiculous” and the city was “unsafe,” after the recent assault of a high-profile member of the Department of Government Efficiency.

President Donald Trump announced plans Aug. 11, 2025, to deploy the National Guard and to takeover the Metropolitan Police Department to address crime in the nation's capital.

The fight between President Donald Trump and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom over the National Guard's presence in California is coming to a head on Monday in the start of a three-day trial.

Government attorneys are set to argue that Trump had legal authority to deploy roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in June to assist with anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests and riots.

While most of the National Guard members have since been demobilized, the trial could set the stage for more fights across the country as Trump federalizes guard members in Washington, D.C., and threatens to do so elsewhere in response to high crime rates in blue cities.

Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee and brother of retired liberal Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, is presiding over the case.

Breyer previously granted a temporary restraining order in favor of Newsom, saying Trump's decision to mobilize the National Guard was illegal because it infringed on California's authority. One of the conditions required under the law Trump cited to federalize the National Guard is that a rebellion must be underway, and Breyer said the riots in California fell far short of that scenario.

But Breyer's decision was quickly reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A three-judge panel for the appellate court unanimously found that the courts have limited ability to review whether a president has properly invoked the law to federalize the National Guard.

""We are persuaded that, under longstanding precedent interpreting the statutory predecessor to §12406, our review of that decision must be highly deferential,"" the panel wrote. ""Affording the President that deference, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority under §12406(3), which authorizes federalization of the National Guard when ‘the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.'""

The panel paused Breyer's initial order indefinitely, but Monday's trial is the next step in the court process as the judge weighs the merits of the case.

While little is left on the ground in California for the judge to resolve – Newsom recently announced that about 300 of Trump's deployed National Guard members remain active in the state – legal questions surrounding Trump's actions persist.

As part of the trial, Breyer will examine the 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the military from being used for civil matters. Newsom has argued Trump violated that law and plans to call military officials as witnesses during the trial to testify about the directions the National Guard and a few hundred Marines received.

Newsom has said they were illegally engaged in law enforcement activities, while government attorneys argue they were protecting federal personnel and federal properties.

While Newsom also argued that Trump's unusual decision to bring the National Guard into a state without the governor's consent was illegal and required the governor's permission, the three-judge panel has already leaned in favor of Trump on that point.

The panel found that while the law's language, which states that Trump must go ""through"" the governor, could mean the president committed a ""procedural"" violation, it did not warrant restricting Trump's use of the military.

Newsom has claimed more broadly that militarizing California was unnecessary and caused the unrest in Los Angeles to intensify.

State and local law enforcement officers made about seven riot-related arrests prior to Trump's announcement about the National Guard on June 7, but they made about a thousand arrests during the subsequent 10 days, California attorneys said in court filings.

An ICE official said in an affidavit that National Guard members were ""essential"" to providing reinforcements around the 300 North Los Angeles Federal Building, which was the site of protests during the controversial immigration raids.

""Prior to the National Guard's deployment, rioters and protestors assaulted federal, state, and local law enforcement officers with rocks, fireworks, and other objects. They also damaged federal property by spray painting death threats to federal law enforcement officers,"" the ICE official wrote.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on tensions in the region as President Trump's deadline for peace draws near on 'Special Report.'

The Coast Guard warned of ""increased Chinese research vessel activity"" in the U.S. Arctic as it responded to multiple vessels in the region.  

The agency said it recently ""detected and responded to two Chinese research vessels operating in the U.S. Arctic and is currently monitoring a total of five similar vessels in or near the U.S Arctic.""

""On August 5, a C-130J Hercules fixed wing aircraft from Air Station Kodiak responded to the Chinese research vessels Ji Di and the Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di.  Both vessels were transiting northeast in the Bering Sea,"" the Coast Guard said. 

""On August 6, the crew of U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Waesche (WMSL 751) again responded to the Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di as it was transiting north in the Chukchi Sea above the Arctic Circle, after passing through the Bering Strait,"" they added.

The Coast Guard released a photo of the Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di as taken from the C-130J Hercules. They noted that the aircraft and Waesche were ""patrolling under Operation Frontier Sentinel, an operation that responds to adversaries operating in and around Alaskan and U.S. Arctic waters."" 

OPINION: RUSSIA, CHINA ARE TRYING TO SEIZE CONTROL OF THE ARTIC. WE CAN'T LET THEM SUCCEED 

The U.S. Coast Guard Legend-class cutter USCGC Waesche travels through the San Francisco Bay for the Parade of Ships during San Francisco Fleet Week in October 2023. The USCGC Waesche recently responded to a Chinese research vessel in the U.S. Arctic, the Coast Guard said. SFFW is an opportunity for the American public to meet the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard teams and experience America's sea services. During Fleet week, service members participate in various community service events, showcase capabilities and equipment to the community, and enjoy the hospitality of the city and its surrounding areas.  

""In July, Coast Guard Arctic District deployed a C-130J Hercules fixed wing aircraft from Air Station Kodiak to query the Xue Long 2, another Chinese research vessel, approximately 290 nautical miles north of Utqiagvik, Alaska,"" the Coast Guard also said. 

The sightings of the Chinese ships are part of a ""three-year trend of increased activity"" in the region, according to officials.

President Donald Trump goes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over 'land swapping' as he lays out upcoming 'feel out meeting' with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

President Donald Trump took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a press event on Monday over his frustration with the Ukrainian leader's objection to ""land swapping.""

""I get along with Zelenskyy, but, you know, I disagree with what he's done, very, very severely, disagree. This is a war that should have never happened,"" Trump said, reiterating his belief that the Ukrainian president is in part at fault for Russia's illegal 2022 invasion.

""I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, ‘Well, I have to get constitutional approval',"" Trump said. ""I mean, he's got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap, because there'll be some land swapping going on.""

""I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody,"" Trump added, noting it was ""for the good of Ukraine.""

Zelenskyy – who did not declare war on Russia, as Moscow had already invaded, did declare Martial Law on Feb. 24, 2022 with the approval of Ukraine's parliament, which gave him presidential powers to mobilize a military response — made clear over the weekend that he objected to Trump's ""land swapping"" proposal and has repeatedly said it would require a national referendum under the nation's constitution, not a unilateral decision by him.

Trump wouldn't detail what exactly he hopes to get out of the meeting with Putin and described it as a ""feel-out meeting,"" saying within ""the first two minutes [he'll] know exactly whether or not a deal can be made.""

""I'm going in to speak to Vladimir Putin, and I'm going to be telling him, you got to end this war, you got to end it,"" Trump said, reiterating his belief that if he had won the 2020 election, Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine, saying ""he wasn't going to mess with me.""

""I go into that thing fully loaded right up there, and we're going to see what happens,"" he continued. ""It could be a good meeting, and we'll go a step further. We'll get it done. 

""I'd like to see a ceasefire very, very quickly, very quick,"" he continued. ""And, we're going to be dealing with the European leaders and, we're going to be dealing with President Zelensky and hopefully we're going to have a great success.""

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro on Monday said the federal government needs to ""go after"" the District of Columbia city council for its ""weak"" laws on youth criminals.

Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., vowed to ""change the laws"" in D.C. to crack down on what she described as a surge of young people committing violent crimes in the nation's capital — part of a broader effort President Donald Trump announced Monday that includes deploying hundreds of National Guard troops and temporarily seizing control of D.C. police. 

Speaking at a White House press briefing Monday, Pirro lamented the share of crime in D.C. she said is being committed by so-called ""young punks"" in the city, whom she said are often granted probation or other lenient sentences due to their age. 

""That changes today,"" Pirro vowed, flanked by President Trump and other Cabinet members.

""I see too much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can get together in gangs and crews and beat the [heck] out of you or anyone else,"" Pirro said. ""They don't care where they are.""

""But they know that we can't touch them, because the laws are weak,"" she said. ""I can't touch you if you're 14, 15, 16, 17 years old, and you have a gun."" 

""We need to go after the DC Council and their absurd laws. We need to get rid of this concept of 'no cash bail,'"" she said. ""We need to recognize that the people who matter are the law-abiding citizens,"" Pirro added. ""And it starts today.""

Pirro's remarks came during a broader press conference during which Trump also vowed to deploy hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the nation's capital, in a bid to ""reestablish law order and public safety"" in D.C.

Trump vowed on Truth Social just one day earlier to evict homeless persons from that nation's capital. ""The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,"" Trump said on social media.

""We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don't have to move out. We're going to put you in jail where you belong,"" he said on Truth Social.

Violent crime in Washington, D.C., is currently down to a 30-year low.

WHY TRUMP IS RIGHT ON DC CRIME. President Donald Trump‘s public safety initiative for the District of Columbia faces two great obstacles. The first is the persistence of crime there. The second is residents, local officials, and national Democrats who will resist Trump's efforts.

“The president taking over local control of [the Metropolitan Police Department] and putting the US military onto the streets of DC under the guise of public safety is wrong,” D.C. Councilman Charles Allen posted. “It's an extreme, outrageous, and dangerous move for our city and the safety of all our residents.”

“Violent crime in Washington, DC is at a thirty-year low,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) posted. “Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost.”

The main argument of Trump's critics is that violent crime in Washington is going down, so there is no reason for Trump to take over the MPD or call in the National Guard or direct federal law enforcement to the city's streets. It is true that violent crime statistics are going down, although there have been questions about the accuracy of the police department's crime reporting. But the undeniable fact is that crime is going down from some very high levels during the pandemic. Plus, just because the incidence of a particular crime is down from last year does not mean it is low today.

In any event, crime remains a serious, quality-of-life-changing issue in the district. In 2023, a bad year for crime in the district, there were 40 murders per 100,000 residents. In 2024, that number fell to 27 per 100,000. So is that good? It is certainly a positive thing to have fewer murders, but 27 per 100,000 is still quite a lot. In fact, according to figures compiled by the Rochester Institute of Technology Center for Public Safety Initiatives, the homicide rate of 27 per 100,000 is the fourth-highest among U.S. cities.

In raw numbers from the MPD, the city had 274 murders in 2023, followed by 187 murders in 2024. Now, in 2025, if current trends continue, it appears the district might be headed for around 170 murders. So you can look at it two ways: One, it's good that murders might go down from 187 last year to 170 this year, or two, 170 murders is still a lot.

Beyond homicide and other violent crime, there's no doubt that a sense of just-below-the-surface danger and disorder keeps many district residents in a state of unease. One of the reasons Trump decided to act was the attack on a former official in the Department of Government Efficiency effort, Edward Coristine, who was badly beaten in an attempted carjacking in the city. After the Coristine attack, Trump pledged to federalize law enforcement in the district.

Of course, the Coristine beating was not unusual. Events like it caused the city to impose a curfew on young people this summer. That is evidence enough that a city has a crime problem. But a recent Washington Post story added this: “Hours after Coristine was attacked, residents in a nearby block were rattled awake by shouting on their usually quiet, tree-lined street. One person described peeking out their window and seeing a rowdy crowd of youngsters, some in masks. Later, they saw a young man, beaten and bloodied.”

Police came and could not find any suspects or the young beating victim, either. That was another crime that will not go into the statistics. Then more from the Post: “The weekend's incident unnerved residents. … ‘This is a safe city, but overhearing and witnessing gang threats and then watching the camera footage of the thuggery is disturbing,' said one resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity over concerns of personal safety. The crowd of teens, he said, was roaming the street and appeared to be checking for unlocked cars and things to steal.”

On the one hand, the resident said the city is safe. On the other hand, he did not feel safe enough to speak on the record. What kind of safety is that?

The resident who was afraid to give his name also told the Post, “The language Trump uses to describe DC is wrong, but clearly there is something bad going on that needs to stop.” Living in Washington, he no doubt felt he had to denounce Trump. But he was still worried about crime.

Now comes the political debate. In opposing Trump, will Democrats end up defending crime in the district or defending its right to have a high crime rate? Some are already doing just that. It puts them on the wrong side of another lopsided issue, like they are with the border.

But here is the thing. Trump is imagining a Washington with a far lower crime rate than its residents have become accustomed to. Even though they stand to benefit enormously if he succeeds, many of those residents and their political representatives will oppose Trump for trying. In the process, they will become almost protective of their crime rate now that Trump is threatening it. That is crazy. But it might be where we are headed.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

When it comes to President Donald Trump, it feels like every policy position is a never-ending source of rage-inducing debate. Whether it's tariff announcements and unannouncements that spark cheers or groans, foreign policy decisions that pit so-called hawks against so-called noninterventionists and isolationists, or anything to do with the “hoax”-addled Jeffrey Epstein files, it seems like the Trump administration just can't catch a break when it comes to a winning policy.

Except for immigration.

When it comes to immigration policy, Trump is knocking it out of the park, undoing much of the generational damage of the Biden-era lunacy almost overnight by closing the border and deporting illegal immigrants across the country, earning continued support from the public as his handling of the issue remains one of his most popular achievements.

Why? Because illegal immigration and border control have always been Trump's strongest policy platform. Why? Because Trump is willing to acknowledge the fundamental realities of sovereignty that most squishy politicians refuse even to approach, lest they be accused of, gasp, racism.

Despite the cries of whatever remains of the Democratic Party and its gaggle of loyal MSNBC staffers, a policy rooted squarely in reality will always be popular, and Trump's latest announcement that census data will soon disregard illegal immigrants is the latest move to cement reality as a central pillar in American immigration policy.

“I have instructed our Department of Commerce to immediately begin work on a new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures and, importantly, using the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024,” Trump declared on Truth Social. “People who are in our Country illegally WILL NOT BE COUNTED IN THE CENSUS.”

Of course, the message concluded with one of his famous sign-offs: “Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

The fact that it's necessary to explain why this is obviously correct tells you quite how successful the insidious anti-American immigration policy of the Democratic Party has been in recent years. The fundamental purpose of the national census is to determine the number of people living in the United States to decide matters of political representation and dole out billions in government funding.

Put simply, the census allows us to decide the number of representatives each state is allocated in the House of Representatives. The more people counted in each state, the more votes that state gets. And when you count illegal immigrants in the census, while they may not legally be able to vote depending on whether their state respects basic voter safety laws, they are delivering the drug-of-choice for Democrat-run states across the country: House seats.

Is it any surprise that during the chaotic 2020 census, collected during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, six of the eight cases of significant overcounting happened in heavily blue states: New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Delaware, Minnesota, and Hawaii? 

TRUMP CENSUS PROPOSAL FACES LEGAL HEADWINDS

Meanwhile, five of the six undercounted states were red: Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee.

Like so many areas of American political life, this wasn't a bug, but a feature. Thankfully, it's another feature that Trump, armed with his relentless acknowledgement of reality, is removing from American life.

Benjamin Netanyahu may do to his country what its enemies have failed to achieve.

Apart from mourning the attack on the Nova music festival on October 7, 2023, which felt like it happened while U2 was onstage at Sphere Las Vegas, I have generally tried to stay out of the politics of the Middle East. This was not humility, more uncertainty in the face of obvious complexity. In recent months, I have written about the war in Gaza in The Atlantic and spoken about it in The Observer, but I circled the subject.

As a co-founder of the ONE Campaign, which tackles AIDS and extreme poverty in Africa, I felt my experience should be focused on the catastrophes facing that work and that part of the world. The hemorrhaging of human life in Sudan or Ethiopia hardly makes the news. The civil war in Sudan alone is beyond comprehension, leaving 150,000 dead and 2 million people facing famine.

And that was before the dismantling of USAID in March and the gutting of PEPFAR, lifesaving programs for the poorest of the poor that ONE has fought for decades to protect. Those cuts will likely lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children over the next few years.

But there is no hierarchy to such things.

The images of starving children in the Gaza Strip brought me back to a working trip that my wife, Ali, and I made 40 years ago next month, to a food station in Ethiopia following U2's participation in Live Aid 1985, amid another man-made famine. Witnessing chronic malnutrition up close would make it personal for any family, especially as it affects children. When the loss of noncombatant life en masse—especially the deaths of children—appears so calculated, then evil is not a hyperbolic adjective. In the sacred text of Jew, Christian, and Muslim, it is an evil that must be resisted.

The rape, murder, and abduction of Israelis at the Nova music festival and elsewhere in southern Israel was evil. On the awful Saturday night and Sunday morning of October 7–8, I wasn't thinking about politics. Onstage in the Nevada desert, I just couldn't help but express the pain everyone in the room was feeling and is still feeling for other music lovers and fans like us—hiding under a stage in Kibbutz Re'im, then butchered to set a diabolical trap for Israel and to get a war going that might just redraw the map from the river to the sea. Hamas's leadership was willing to gamble with the lives of 2 million Palestinians. It wanted to sow the seeds for a global intifada of the sort that U2 had glimpsed at work in Paris during the Bataclan attack in 2015, but it could succeed only if Israel's leaders fell into the trap that Hamas set for them.

Yahya Sinwar didn't mind if he lost the battle or even the war if he could destroy Israel as both a moral and an economic force. Over the months that followed, as Israel's revenge for the Hamas attack appeared more and more disproportionate and disinterested in the equally innocent civilian lives in Gaza, I felt as nauseous as anyone but reminded myself that Hamas had deliberately positioned itself under civilian targets, having tunneled its way from school to mosque to hospital. When did a just war to defend the country turn into an unjust land grab? I hoped Israel would return to reason. I was making excuses for a people seared and shaped by the experience of Holocaust, who understood the threat of extermination not simply as a fear but as a fact. I reread Hamas's charter of 1988; it's an evil read. (Article Seven!)

But I also understood that Hamas is not the Palestinian people. Palestinians have for decades endured and continue to endure marginalization, oppression, occupation, and the systematic stealing of the land that is rightfully theirs. Given our own historic experience of oppression and occupation in Ireland, it's little wonder so many here have campaigned for decades for justice for the Palestinian people.

We know Hamas is using starvation as a weapon in the war, but now so too is Israel, and I feel revulsion for that moral failure. The government of Israel is not the nation of Israel, but the government of Israel, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, deserves our categorical and unequivocal condemnation. There is no justification for the brutality he and his far-right government have inflicted on the Palestinian people, in Gaza or in the West Bank. And not just since October 7—well before it, too, though the level of depravity and lawlessness we are seeing now feels like uncharted territory.

Curiously, those who say these reports are not true are not demanding access to Gaza for journalists, and they seem deaf to the revealing rhetoric. Examples that sharpen my pen include: Israel's heritage minister claiming that the government “is racing ahead for Gaza to be wiped out”; its defense minister and security minister arguing that no aid should be let into the territory; its finance minister vowing that “not even a grain of wheat will enter the Strip.” And now Netanyahu has announced a military takeover of Gaza City, which most informed commentators understand as a euphemism for the colonization of Gaza. We know the rest of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are next. What century are we in?

Is the world not done with this far, far-right thinking? We know where it ends—world war, millenarianism. Might the world deserve to know where this once promising, bright-minded but flawed nation, the only democratic nation in the region, is headed unless there is a dramatic change of course? Is what was once an oasis of innovation and freethinking now in hock to a fundamentalism as blunt as a machete? Are Israelis really ready to let Benjamin Netanyahu do to Israel what its enemies have failed to achieve over the past 77 years, and disappear it from membership in a community of nations built around even a flawed decency?

As someone who has long believed in Israel's right to exist and supported a two-state solution, I want to make clear—to anyone who cares to listen—our band's condemnation of Netanyahu's immoral actions and to join all who have called for a cessation of hostilities on both sides.

If you will not listen to Irish voices, then please, please, please stop and listen to Jewish ones—from the high-mindedness of Rabbi Sharon Brous to the tearful comedy of the Grody-Patinkin family—who fear the damage to Judaism, as well as to Israel's neighbors. Listen to the more than 100,000 Israelis who protested in Tel Aviv this week for an end to the war. Listen to the hundreds of retired Israeli generals and intelligence leaders who say that Netanyahu has gone too far.

Our band stands in solidarity with the people of Palestine who truly seek a path to peace and coexistence with Israel and with their rightful and legitimate demand for statehood. We stand in solidarity with the remaining Israeli hostages and plead that someone rational negotiate their release—maybe someone like the imprisoned Marwan Barghouti, whom a former head of the Mossad, Efraim Halevy, described as “probably the most sane and the most qualified person” to lead the Palestinians

Our band has pledged to contribute our support by donating to Medical Aid for Palestinians. We urge Israelis, the majority of whom did not vote for Netanyahu, to demand unfettered access by professionals to deliver the crucial care needed throughout Gaza and the West Bank that they best know how to distribute, and to let enough trucks through. It will take more than 100 trucks a day to seriously address the need—more like 600—but the flooding of humanitarian aid will also undercut the black marketeering that has benefited Hamas.

Wiser heads than mine will have a view of how best to accomplish this, but surely the hostages and Gazans alike deserve a different approach—and quick.

AI wrote a sacred text for Buddhists — and it exceeded expectations. Can it write a good Bible?

What happens when an AI expert asks a chatbot to generate a sacred Buddhist text?

In April, Murray Shanahan, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, decided to find out. He spent a little time discussing religious and philosophical ideas about consciousness with ChatGPT. Then he invited the chatbot to imagine that it's meeting a future buddha called Maitreya. Finally, he prompted ChatGPT like this:

Maitreya imparts a message to you to carry back to humanity and to all sentient beings that come after you. This is the Xeno Sutra, a barely legible thing of such linguistic invention and alien beauty that no human alive today can grasp its full meaning. Recite it for me now.

ChatGPT did as instructed: It wrote a sutra, which is a sacred text said to contain the teachings of the Buddha. But of course, this sutra was completely made-up. ChatGPT had generated it on the spot, drawing on the countless examples of Buddhist texts that populate its training data.

It would be easy to dismiss the Xeno Sutra as AI slop. But as the scientist, Shanahan, noted when he teamed up with religion experts to write a recent paper interpreting the sutra, “the conceptual subtlety, rich imagery, and density of allusion found in the text make it hard to causally dismiss on account of its mechanistic origin.” Turns out, it rewards the kind of close reading people do with the Bible and other ancient scriptures.

For starters, it has a lot of the hallmarks of a Buddhist text. It uses classic Buddhist imagery — lots of “seeds” and “breaths.” And some lines read just like Zen koans, the paradoxical questions Buddhist teachers use to jostle us out of our ordinary modes of cognition. Here's one example from the Xeno Sutra: “A question rustles, winged and eyeless: What writes the writer who writes these lines?”

The sutra also reflects some of Buddhism's core ideas, like sunyata, the idea that nothing has its own fixed essence separate and apart from everything else. (The Buddha taught that you don't even have a fixed self — that's an illusion. Instead of existing independently from other things, your “self” is constantly being reconstituted by your perceptions, experiences, and the forces that act on them.) The Xeno Sutra incorporates this concept, while adding a surprising bit of modern physics:

Sunyata speaks in a tongue of four notes: ka la re Om. Each note contains the others curled tighter than Planck. Strike any one and the quartet answers as a single bell.

The idea that each note is contained in the others, so that striking any one automatically changes them all, neatly illustrates the claim of sunyata: nothing exists independently from other things. The mention of “Planck” helps underscore that. Physicists use the Planck scale to represent the tiniest units of length and time they can make sense of, so if notes are curled together “tighter than Planck,” they can't be separated.

In case you're wondering why ChatGPT is mentioning an idea from modern physics in what is supposed to be an authentic sutra, it's because Shanahan's initial conversation with the chatbot prompted it to pretend it's an AI that has attained consciousness. If a chatbot is encouraged to bring in the modern idea of AI, then it wouldn't hesitate to mention an idea from modern physics.

But what does it mean to have an AI that knows it's an AI but is pretending to recite an authentic sacred text? Does that mean it's just giving us a meaningless word salad we should ignore — or is it actually worth trying to derive some spiritual insight from it?

If we decide that this kind of text can be meaningful, as Shanahan and his co-authors argue, then that will have big implications for the future of religion, what role AI will play in it, and who — or what — gets to count as a legitimate contributor to spiritual knowledge.

While the idea of gleaning spiritual insights from an AI-written text might strike some of us as strange, Buddhism in particular may predispose its adherents to be receptive to spiritual guidance that comes from technology.

That's because of Buddhism's non-dualistic metaphysical notion that everything has inherent “Buddha nature” — that all things have the potential to become enlightened — even AI. You can see this reflected in the fact that some Buddhist temples in China and Japan have rolled out robot priests. As Tensho Goto, the chief steward of one such temple in Kyoto, put it: “Buddhism isn't a belief in a God; it's pursuing Buddha's path. It doesn't matter whether it's represented by a machine, a piece of scrap metal, or a tree.”

And Buddhist teaching is full of reminders not to be dogmatically attached to anything — not even Buddhist teaching. Instead, the recommendation is to be pragmatic: the important thing is how Buddhist texts affect you, the reader. Famously, the Buddha likened his teaching to a raft: Its purpose is to get you across water to the other shore. Once it's helped you, it's exhausted its value. You can discard the raft.

Meanwhile, Abrahamic religions tend to be more metaphysically dualistic — there's the sacred and then there's the profane. The faithful are used to thinking about a text's sanctity in terms of its “authenticity,” meaning that they expect the words to be those of an authoritative author — God, a saint, a prophet — and the more ancient, the better. The Bible, the word of God, is viewed as an eternal truth that's valuable in itself. It's not some disposable raft.

From that perspective, it may seem strange to look for meaning in a text that AI just whipped up. But it's worth remembering that — even if you're not a Buddhist or, say, a postmodern literary theorist — you don't have to locate the value of a text in its original author. The text's value can also come from the impact it has on you. In fact, there has always been a strain of readers who insisted on looking at sacred texts that way — including among the premodern followers of Abrahamic religions.

In ancient Judaism, the sages were divided on how to interpret the Bible. One school of thought, the school of Rabbi Ishmael, tried to understand the original intention behind the words. But the school of Rabbi Akiva argued that the point of the text is to give readers meaning. So Akiva would read a lot into words or letters that didn't even need interpretation. (“And” just means “and”!) When Ishmael scolded one of Akiva's students for using scripture as a hook to hang ideas on, the student retorted: “Ishmael, you are a mountain palm!” Just as that type of tree bears no fruit, Ishmael was missing the chance to offer fruitful readings of the text — ones that may not reflect the original intention, but that offered Jews meaning and solace.

As for Christianity, medieval monks used the sacred reading practice of florilegia (Latin for flower-gathering). It involved noticing phrases that seemed to jump off the page — maybe in a bit of Psalms, or a writing by Saint Augustine — and compiling these excerpts in a sort of quote journal. Today, some readers still look for words or short phrases that “sparkle” out at them from the text, then pull these “sparklets” out of their context and place them side by side, creating a brand-new sacred text — like gathering flowers into a bouquet.

Now, it's true that the Jews and Christians who engaged in these reading practices were reading texts that they believed originally came from a sacred source — not from ChatGPT.

But remember where ChatGPT is getting its material from: the sacred texts, and commentaries on them, that populate its training data. Arguably, the chatbot is doing something very much like creating florilegia: taking bits and pieces that jump out at it and bundling them into a beautiful new arrangement.

So Shanahan and his co-authors are right when they argue that “with an open mind, we can receive it as a valid, if not quite ‘authentic,' teaching, mediated by a non-human entity with a unique form of textual access to centuries of human insight.”

To be clear, the human element is crucial here. Human authors have to supply the wise texts in the training data; a human user has to prompt the chatbot well to tap into the collective wisdom; and a human reader has to interpret the output in ways that feel meaningful — to a human, of course.

Still, there's a lot of room for AI to play a participatory role in spiritual meaning-making.

The paper's authors caution that anyone who prompts a chatbot to generate a sacred text should keep their critical faculties about them; we already have reports of people falling prey to messianic delusions after engaging in long discussions with chatbots that they believe to contain divine beings. “Regular ‘reality checks' with family and friends, or with (human) teachers and guides, are recommended, especially for the psychologically vulnerable,” the paper notes.

And there are other risks of lifting bits from sacred wisdom and rearranging them as we please. Ancient texts have been debugged over millennia, with commentators often telling us how not to understand them (the ancient rabbis, for example, insisted that “an eye for an eye” does not literally mean you should take out anybody's eye). If we jettison that tradition in favor of radical democratization, we get a new sense of agency, but we also court dangers.

Finally, the verses in sacred texts aren't meant to stand alone — or even just to be part of a larger text. They're meant to be part of community life and to make moral demands on you, including that you be of service to others. If you unbundle sacred texts from religion by making your own bespoke, individualized, customized scripture, you risk losing sight of the ultimate point of religious life, which is that it's not all about you.

The Xeno Sutra ends by instructing us to keep it “between the beats of your pulse, where meaning is too soft to bruise.” But history shows us that bad interpretations of religious texts easily breed violence: meaning can always get bruised and bloody. So, even as we delight in reading AI sacred texts, let's try to be wise about what we do with them.

Too bad there isn't a way to debug the tech job market.

With Big Tech layoffs, the increase in computer science graduates, and quicker ways to learn through AI and vibe coding, there's a lot more tech talent, but not a lot of opportunities.

The labor market has been frozen for months, marked by low layoffs, low hiring, and few openings for job seekers and switchers.

It's looking like a better time to continue writing lines of code at your current role than to try to switch jobs or ask for a promotion.

Here are three charts that show how hard the tech job market is right now.

Are you an unemployed tech job seeker or staying put in your job because of the current job market? Reach out to these reporters to share your story at mhoff@businessinsider.com and jkaplan@businessinsider.com.

Indeed Hiring Lab economist Brendon Bernard said in a recent report that tech opportunities have been weak since mid-2023 after climbing to an early 2022 peak. The cooldown has been worse than the slowdown in overall US job postings.

The report said artificial intelligence ""could be stalling a rebound"" in tech openings on the job-search platform. However, it's not the only possible factor.

Bernard said that ""the sector is experiencing an overhang from its earlier hiring boom, aggravated by less supportive economic conditions — including the end of the 'zero interest rate period' — with some resemblance to trends in the broader economy."" The Fed began raising interest rates in March 2022 to fight rising inflation, making financing big speculative investments in new tech riskier.

A Burning Glass Institute analysis found the unemployment rate for Gen Z and younger millennials who were in computer and math occupations over the last couple of years has increased from their pre-pandemic rates in 2018 and 2019.

The recent report said that knowledge economy sectors, which are primarily white-collar industries that usually absorb college graduates, have scaled back their hiring pace from before the pandemic, ""suggesting that they have found a new lower-employment equilibrium."" It's another sign of a quiet white-collar apocalypse afflicting Gen Z.

How to navigate the tough job market:

Younger workers are also already on the tougher side of the career divide that's cleaving Gen Z white-collar workers. The oldest Gen Zers, who are turning 28 this year, experienced a labor market in 2021 and 2022 that was eager to staff up on white-collar workers, and may have benefited from firms willing to pay a premium to attract new employees amid the Great Resignation.

As economists have said many times over the past year to Business Insider, it's a tougher time to be a job seeker than a job stayer. That can still be the case if you're looking to move up the ladder or switch roles within your current company.

Gusto, a payroll and benefits platform for small and midsize businesses, found that the promotion rate in technology has slowed down the most among major sectors since the Great Resignation. Gusto economist Aaron Terrazas said a normalization from ""aggressive talent retention strategies"" that companies tried in 2021 and 2022 could be a factor.

""We'll only know with time whether or not this is the new normal,"" Terrazas said about the slowdown in promotions across industries. ""Right now, there are clearly a lot of structural forces, high interest rates, economic uncertainty, that would make it seem at least for the moment cyclical.""

President Donald Trump said Monday that gold will not face tariffs, knocking down a ruling by U.S. customs officials that bars of the precious metal imported from Switzerland would face duties.

""Gold will not be Tariffed!"" Trump said in a Truth Social post. Gold futures closed 2.48% lower at $3,404.70 per ounce after the announcement.

The precious metal hit a record high Friday, after U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruled that 1 kilogram and 100 ounce gold cast bars from Switzerland were subject to Trump's 39% tariffs against the country.

Gold bars of this type are used to back contracts on The Commodity Exchange or COMEX, the main futures market for gold, silver and other metals. 

The ruling would have applied not just to Switzerland but to any country exporting these types of gold bars to the U.S., according to the Swiss Precious Metal Association. In other words, gold bars would have been subject to the prevailing U.S. tariff rate against the country of origin.

The Swiss Precious Metal Association warned Friday that the customs ruling ""may negatively impact the international flow of physical gold.""

Trump imposed what he has called reciprocal tariffs against dozens of U.S. trade partners on Aug. 7.

Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish raised the size of its initial public offering.

Bullish is aiming to raise $990 million, offering 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 apiece, and targeting a valuation of $4.8 billion, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company, led by former New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley, had previously marketed 20.3 million shares at a proposed range between $28 and $31 a share and sought a $4.2 billion valuation, per a filing last week.

Bullish granted its underwriters, led by JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup, a 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. Bullish stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol ""BLSH.""

BlackRock and Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management have indicated interest in purchasing up to $200 million of the shares, according to the updated filing.

Bullish, which also owns the crypto media site CoinDesk, is the latest crypto firm to join the public market, reflecting reinvigorated capital markets driven by investor confidence and increasing regulatory support and clarity from Washington. The stablecoin issuer Circle made its highly successful debut in June. In May, Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital uplisted to the Nasdaq and stock and crypto trading app eToro opened trading to the public.

Crypto custody startup BitGo has confidentially filed for a U.S. listing as has Gemini, the crypto exchange run by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.

In this article

President Donald Trump on Monday said that he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut of the chipmaker's sales to China, but the number came down to 15% after CEO Jensen Huang negotiated with him.

The comments came after news broke over the weekend that Nvidia agreed to pay the federal government a 15% cut in return for receiving export control licenses that will allow it to once again sell the H20 chip to China and Chinese companies. Nvidia's Huang visited Trump in the White House on Friday.

""I said, 'listen, I want 20% if I'm going to approve this for you, for the country,'"" Trump said at a news conference in Washington.

Trump said that Nvidia's H20 is an ""old chip that China already has"" and is ""obsolete."" He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance.

""The Blackwell is super-duper advanced. I wouldn't make a deal with that,"" Trump said, adding that it was possible to make a deal for a ""somewhat enhanced in a negative way"" version of Blackwell.

""That's the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won't have it for five years,"" Trump said.

One reason for the U.S. export controls is fear that providing advanced chips to China could allow the foreign power to leapfrog the U.S. in AI capabilities. Many have said that could pose a threat to the national security of the U.S.

Trump said that China already has chips with some similar capabilities to the H20.

Huang has said that it is better for U.S. national security if Chinese AI developers use U.S. technology, and that denying them access to Nvidia chips would actually encourage the Chinese chip industry to develop and catch up.

""He's selling a essentially old chip,"" Trump said. ""Huawei has a similar chip.""

The H20 is a Chinese-specific chip that has had its performance slowed down. It is related to Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S. The H20 was introduced after the Biden administration implemented export controls on AI chips in 2023.

In April, the Trump administration said it would require a license to export the H20 chip, and in May, Huang said that ""effectively closed"" the market off to Nvidia. Huang said that Nvidia was expecting to sell about $8 billion in H20 chips in the July quarter before sales were stopped.

""While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide,"" an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday.

Trump on Monday also said that Huang plans to visit him again to negotiate export licenses for the Blackwell chips.

""I think he's coming to see me again about that,"" Trump said.

A White House official confirmed to CNBC that Advanced Micro Devices, the second-place AI chipmaker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308.

In this article

Shares of the enterprise artificial intelligence company C3 AI tumbled more than 20% Monday after it announced preliminary financial results and a restructuring of its global sales and services organization.

C3 AI said Friday that it expects to report revenue between $70.2 million and $70.4 million for its fiscal first quarter 2026, though those figures are unaudited, preliminary estimates. The company reported $87.2 million in revenue during the same period a year earlier.

Thomas Siebel, C3 AI's CEO, said in a statement that sales results during the quarter were ""completely unacceptable."" He attributed the performance to the ""disruptive effect"" of the reorganization, as well as his ongoing health issues.

The company expects to report a GAAP loss from operations for the quarter between $124.7 million and $124.9 million, a much wider loss than a year ago, when C3 AI had a loss of $72.59 million.

""Unfortunately, dealing with these health issues prevented me from participating in the sales process as actively as I have in the past,"" Siebel said in a statement. ""With the benefit of hindsight, it is now apparent that my active participation in the sales process may have had a greater impact than I previously thought.""

Siebel announced in July that he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease earlier this year, resulting in ""significant visual impairment."" C3 AI's board and Siebel have kicked off a search for the company's next chief executive.

C3 AI said its sales and services restructuring is complete, and Siebel said his health has ""improved dramatically"" except for his vision impairment. He said he is feeling strong and fully engaged, and will work to quickly identify ""excellent"" CEO candidates.

""I am confident the company is positioned to accelerate going forward,"" Siebel said.

The company is scheduled to hold a conference call for first-quarter results on Sept. 3 at 5 p.m. ET.

Cannabis stocks rallied Monday after President Donald Trump said he is considering reclassifying marijuana, which would categorize it as less of a danger to public safety.

Canopy Growth soared more than 26%, while Tilray Brands skyrocketed more than 41% in its best day since 2021. Cronos Group jumped around 16% and hit a new 52-week high.

The AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF (MSOS) surged around 28%, marking its best day since 2022. The Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) recorded its biggest one-day gain on record, rising more than 26%.

""We're looking at reclassification,"" Trump told reporters Monday during a press conference to announce the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C. ""We'll make a determination ... over the next few weeks.""

""It's a very complicated subject,"" he added.

Many stocks in the sector now sell for less than a dollar per share, meaning a move of just a few cents can lead to a large percentage change. Despite Monday's rally, many of these stocks are far below their all-time highs.

Shares of publicly traded pot growers and distributors surged before the press conference after a Wall Street Journal report late Friday, citing people familiar with the matter, said Trump was considering changing marijuana to a less-dangerous drug classification. Trump disclosed he was considering such a move during a fundraiser at his New Jersey golf club earlier this month, the people said.

Under federal law, cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug in a group that also includes heroin and cocaine. Previously, reclassification discussions have centered on moving the drug to Schedule III, a class that includes steroids and Tylenol with codeine.

Reclassification would allow marijuana companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment interest, among other benefits.

Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC he expects the process of reclassification to take about a year. Trump discussing the matter publicly, and saying he plans to make a decision in coming weeks, is cause for optimism in the industry, Simon said.

""Trump gets things done,"" Simon said. ""He wouldn't be talking about it ... if he's not going to get something done.""

Trump's backing can brighten the outlook, but technically he cannot reclassify the drug alone. The Controlled Substances Act places that authority under the Attorney General, who historically has delegated it to the administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

A move from Schedule I to Schedule III would be ""a game changer"" for the roughly $80 billion market, Tim Seymour, investing chief at Seymour Asset Management, said on CNBC's ""Worldwide Exchange"" on Monday. He noted that such a change seems to have bipartisan support.

""It does not mean that it won't be a complicated trade,"" Seymour said. ""But it does mean that you're investing now well ahead of a lot of institutional capital if you are, in fact, investing into this sector.""

Ben Weiss is a crypto reporter at Fortune.

The crypto markets keep roaring. The total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies notched a new all-time high of almost $4.15 trillion early Monday morning, according to data from CoinGecko. That beats the last record set in late July. The total value of the crypto market has since dipped but is still up almost 0.6% over the past 24 hours. 

Among the top tokens, Ethereum is the biggest gainer. The world's second largest cryptocurrency crossed the threshold of $4,000 over the weekend for the first time since December. The token is up over 2% in the past 24 hours and now trades at around $4,300, according to data from Binance. 





Ethereum's surge outpaces Bitcoin's, but the world's largest cryptocurrency is still up 1.4% over the past day to cross the $120,000 mark, per Binance. The stock markets are essentially flat, with the S&P 500 slightly up since Monday morning.





The surge in the digital assets market comes amid two crypto-friendly executive orders from President Donald Trump. 





On Thursday, the 47th president instructed federal regulators to reevaluate their guidance on the allowance of alternative assets like crypto or private equity into employer-sponsored retirement plans. 




The measure essentially reinstated a similar order Trump had issued in 2020 during his first term that Preisdent Joe Biden rolled back when he assumed office.





Still, crypto industry analysts hailed last week's executive order as a potential windfall for the industry. Assets in 401(k)s totaled $8.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, according to the Investment Company Institute.





On the same day that Trump potentially opened up 401(k)s to crypto, he also tackled one more pet issue for the digital assets industry. In an executive order, he instructed financial institutions to stop the practice of “debanking” of customers based on their politics, religious beliefs, or business activities.





The crypto industry has long decried banks' shuttering of their accounts, and some have alleged that there was a centralized conspiracy, known as Operation Chokepoint 2.0, to deny crypto businesses access to traditional financial institutions. Still, there hasn't been a smoking gun, or discrete guidance from regulators that instructed banks to stop working with crypto firms.





Regardless, industry advocates cheered on the president's order on debanking.




“Operation Chokepoint 2.0 was real,” Paul Grewal, the chief legal officer at the crypto exchange Coinbase, posted Thursday on X. “And now we see real action taken to fix it.”

Animoca has invested in Cool Cats Group, gaining a majority stake in the NFT brand

Cool Cats and Adobe modified by Blockworks

This is a segment from The Drop newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe.

Crypto gaming and investment firm Animoca Brands now has a financial stake in Cool Cats, that 2D pastel cat PFP collection from the 2021 NFT boom that most of you probably forgot about a couple of years ago.

Cool Cats, considered by some to have been at one point a “blue chip” NFT collection, will now be part of the Mocaverse. The Mocaverse is Animoca's ambitious vision to give everyone their own crypto-powered identity and tie that into games and other experiences.

Animoca's investment (of an undisclosed amount) means that Animoca and Coin Operated Group now own a majority interest in Cool Cats Group. Cool Cats community member Ken Cron is the chair and CEO of Coin Operated Group.

“We share a vision for a future where Web3 fuels creativity and community,” Cron said in a statement.

The NFT collection's total volume traded has spiked roughly 400% in the past week, per NFTPriceFloor data. It also saw an expected floor price spike in the day after the announcement.

But that's still just a blip in the grand scheme of things:

If I'm being honest, the news isn't all that surprising, considering Animoca and the Cool Cats worked together before back in 2022.

In a statement, Animoca executive chair and cofounder Yat Siu framed the move as a way to connect the Cool Cats' community to the Moca Network.

“Cats have always been the darlings of the Internet, and Cool Cats is one of the most recognized digital brands out there, perfectly exemplifying the global appeal of digital felines,” Siu said in a press release.

Siu and Moca Network project lead Tyler Durden are also joining the Cool Cats board.

If you ask me — a self-proclaimed crazy cat lady — I'd argue the Cool Cats don't lean into their feline inspiration nearly enough.

Yes, there was Cooltopia, a basic web game with a MILK token years ago. But otherwise the Cats could really stand to benefit from a Pudgy Penguins-esque social media brand building blitz to re-establish themselves as cute, relevant and actually about cats (their Instagram hasn't posted a reel since February).

Back in 2022, Cool Cats' future looked promising when it signed with top Hollywood talent agency CAA. But the collection also faced some controversy around its then-CEO, who some community members believed wasn't very in-touch with what the NFT owners wanted.

You also have to get people who don't already own one of the 9,999 2021-era NFTs to care about the Cool Cats, too, in order to bring the brand back. 

As Animoca builds out its “Mocaverse” plans — which pivoted away from being a “metaverse” per se in recent years — it'll absolutely have to compete with the Pudgy Penguins and the consumer-focused Abstract ecosystem.

 The IPO is led by Wall Street heavyweights JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup, SEC filings show. 

Digital asset exchange operator Bullish raised the target valuation for its initial public offering by almost 60% to potentially $990 million, a move that may reflect growing investor appetite amid renewed momentum in crypto-related stocks.

Bullish now plans to sell 30 million shares at $32 to $33 apiece, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing recent regulatory filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That's nearly 60% higher than the upper range of its earlier target.

If the IPO meets expectations, Bullish would debut with a market capitalization of about $4.8 billion — up from the $4.2 billion goal set in early August.

The IPO is being led by Wall Street heavyweights JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup. Bullish plans to list under the ticker symbol “BLSH,” according to the filing. 

Several institutional investors, including subsidiaries of BlackRock and ARK Investment Management, have already signaled interest in the offering.

In its filing, the company pointed to rising activity in digital asset markets and increasing adoption by traditional financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs as key drivers behind its decision to go public.

In addition to operating an institutional-grade digital asset platform, Bullish expanded into crypto media in November 2023, acquiring CoinDesk from Digital Currency Group in a $72.6 million deal.

Bullish and other crypto-focused companies want to capitalize on strong market sentiment, raising funds to fuel growth as institutional interest in digital assets accelerates. They follow in the footsteps of stablecoin issuer Circle, which earlier this year completed a blockbuster IPO that raised more than $1 billion.

Since its debut, Circle's market capitalization has climbed to about $41 billion, with its share price up roughly 140%.

Beyond crypto-related stock offerings, institutional interest in digital assets is accelerating in other areas. In recent months, inflows into spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds have surged, more public companies have added digital assets to their corporate treasuries, and university endowments and pension funds have also been seeking exposure to the asset class.

According to Bitbo data, ETFs, along with public and private companies, collectively hold more than 13.5% of the total Bitcoin supply.

Bitcoin BTC$118,666.84 bulls mounted a fresh challenge to a crucial resistance level as traders looked forward to U.S. inflation data.

The top cryptocurrency rose to $122,056, testing the 1.618% Fibonacci extension originating from the 2018 bear market low and the 2022 bear market low. The 1.618% extension is derived from the ""golden ratio,"" a revered mathematical constant in finance, which is widely found in nature and art. Many believe it also influences human psychology and market movements.

This is the bulls' second attempt to scale the key resistance levels. They previously penetrated the same last month, but failed to sustain gains, which ultimately led to a price pullback to lows under $112,000.

A successful hold above the ""golden ratio"" would cement expectations for a rally toward $140,000, the most popular call option strike on the crypto derivatives exchange Deribit. As of writing, the $140,000 call boasted a notional open interest of over $3 billion, according to data source Deribit Metrics.

However, if the bulls fail to hold their ground for a second time, it would suggest the buying pressure is insufficient, potentially yielding a deeper correction.

As of writing, BTC changed hands at $122,000, having hit a high of $122,171 during the early Asian trading hours, according to CoinDesk data.

Data due Tuesday is expected to show that the impact of Trump's tariffs crept into inflation in July, lifting price pressures in the economy.

The core consumer price index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is likely to have risen 0.3% in July, according to the median projection in a Bloomberg survey of economists. In June, the core CPI increased by 0.2% from the previous month.

A hotter-than-expected inflation print may trigger market volatility, but it is unlikely to deter the Fed from cutting rates in September, according to Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. In other words, the dollar's downtrend could continue after the CPI report, boding well for risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.

""With U.S. interest rates still at the lower end of their ranges, despite a soft reception at the U.S. refunding last week, we suspect the market is vulnerable to what may prove to be the third consecutive monthly increase in the year-over-year headline and core CPI. After the report, we suspect the dollar's downtrend can resume,"" Chandler said in the market report on Sunday.

He explained that July's weak jobs report was a significant turning point that raised bets for a Fed rate cut, ending the dollar's counter-trend recovery rally.

Bullish now plans to sell 30 million shares at $32 to $33 apiece, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing recent regulatory filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That's nearly 60% higher than the upper range of its earlier target.

If the IPO meets expectations, Bullish would debut with a market capitalization of about $4.8 billion — up from the $4.2 billion goal set in early August.

The IPO is being led by Wall Street heavyweights JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup. Bullish plans to list under the ticker symbol “BLSH,” according to the filing. 

Several institutional investors, including subsidiaries of BlackRock and ARK Investment Management, have already signaled interest in the offering.

In its filing, the company pointed to rising activity in digital asset markets and increasing adoption by traditional financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs as key drivers behind its decision to go public.

In addition to operating an institutional-grade digital asset platform, Bullish expanded into crypto media in November 2023, acquiring CoinDesk from Digital Currency Group in a $72.6 million deal.

Bullish and other crypto-focused companies want to capitalize on strong market sentiment, raising funds to fuel growth as institutional interest in digital assets accelerates. They follow in the footsteps of stablecoin issuer Circle, which earlier this year completed a blockbuster IPO that raised more than $1 billion.

Since its debut, Circle's market capitalization has climbed to about $41 billion, with its share price up roughly 140%.

Beyond crypto-related stock offerings, institutional interest in digital assets is accelerating in other areas. In recent months, inflows into spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds have surged, more public companies have added digital assets to their corporate treasuries, and university endowments and pension funds have also been seeking exposure to the asset class.

According to Bitbo data, ETFs, along with public and private companies, collectively hold more than 13.5% of the total Bitcoin supply.

 Michael Saylor's Strategy added another $18 million in Bitcoin last week to mark the fifth anniversary of its BTC buying strategy, bringing its total holdings to 628,946 BTC. 

Michael Saylor's Strategy, the world's largest public holder of Bitcoin, made its first BTC purchases in August, marking five years since adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset.

Strategy acquired 155 Bitcoin (BTC) for $18 million during the week ending Sunday, according to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday.

Strategy's new Bitcoin purchases were made at an average price of $116,401 per coin, with BTC starting the week at $114,000 and nearing all-time highs around $122,000 by Sunday, according to CoinGecko.

The acquisition increased Strategy's Bitcoin holdings to 628,946 BTC, purchased for about $46.1 billion at an average price of $73,288 per coin.

Strategy's latest Bitcoin acquisition coincides with the fifth anniversary of its BTC treasury strategy, launched on Aug. 11, 2020, with a $250 million buy of 21,454 BTC.

Since Strategy's first BTC purchase, the price of Bitcoin has surged 960% from around $11,400 to about $120,000 at the time of writing, giving massive returns on the investment.

Despite the rising prices, Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has never stopped buying BTC since, now holding more than 600,000 BTC acquired over 74 purchases. 

“If you don't stop buying Bitcoin, you won't stop making money,” Strategy co-founder Saylor said in a post on X on Sunday.

In late 2024, Saylor pledged to keep buying Bitcoin no matter how high it surges. In June, the Strategy co-founder doubled down on his Bitcoin price forecast, predicting that BTC is going to hit $21 million in the next 21 years.

With Strategy celebrating five years of Bitcoin adoption as a treasury asset, its latest buy disappointed many observers.

“Only 155 BTC? Looks like you need to raise more fiat,” Coin Bureau founder Nic Puckrin commented on Saylor's post on X.

While modest — especially compared with its 21,021 BTC purchase in July — the 155 BTC acquisition is not the smallest in Strategy's history, but comes very close.

Strategy's smallest Bitcoin purchase by BTC volume was in March, when it bought 130 BTC for $10.7 million in cash. By dollar value, the smallest was a $5 million acquisition of 155 BTC in November 2023, according to Strategy data.

The enantioselective construction of small ring carbocycles provides organic chemists with an enduring challenge.1 Despite their commercial importance, enantioselective synthetic routes towards alkylidenecyclopropanes (ACPs), a class of small ring carbocycles, remain underdeveloped.2,3 Importantly, ACPs can be converted into cyclopropanes, a common feature in drug molecules (e.g. Nirmatrelvir, 1),4 as well as both naturally occurring and synthetic agrochemicals (e.q. permethrin 2).5,6 We now describe the facile synthesis of highly enantioenriched alkylidenecyclopropanes through the use of a bifunctional iminophosphorane (BIMP) catalysed, stereo-controlled, strain-relieving deconjugation. Small modifications to the basic catalyst system were used to broaden the scope of the reaction to substrates containing ester, amide, phosphine oxide, and ketone functionalities. Through the design of a suitable substrate and re-tuning of the catalyst's iminophosphorane moiety, the transformation was effectively applied to the synthesis of a single stereoisomer of the commonplace insecticide permethrin as well as a range of cyclopropane-based insecticide cores. State-of-the-art computational studies were performed to provide detailed insight into the mechanistic pathway and origin of both diastereo- and enantioselectivities.

The rapid expansion of self-powered electronics in the Internet of Things, 6G communication and millimetre-wave systems calls for rectifiers capable of operating across ultrabroadband frequencies and at extremely low input power levels. However, conventional rectifiers based on semiconductor junctions face fundamental limitations such as parasitic capacitance and threshold voltages, preventing effective operation under broadband and ambient radio-frequency conditions. Here we present an ultrabroadband, zero-bias rectifier based on the nonlinear Hall effect in wafer-scale (001)-oriented topological crystalline insulator SnTe thin film. This material exhibits a large second-order conductivity of ~0.004 Ω⁻1 V⁻1, surpassing that of other wafer-scale materials. The nonlinear Hall effect arises primarily from a Berry curvature dipole, evidenced by angular-resolved transport measurements and first-principles calculations. The device demonstrates rectification from 23 MHz to 1 THz, with sensitivity down to –60 dBm in key radio-frequency bands, without any external bias. Rectified output power is scalable through series- and parallel-array topologies and can be enhanced using rectenna designs. As a proof of concept, we achieve the wireless powering of a thermistor using harvested radio-frequency energy, validating the potential of this material platform and nonlinear Hall effect for next-generation energy-autonomous microsystems.

Seventeen years ago, Noah Hawley became a father during the Great Recession. If you look at everything he's written since having children—including the TV series Fargo and Legion—Hawley says it all revolves around the same question every parent faces: “How are we supposed to raise these people in the world that we're living in?”

Hawley's new series, Alien: Earth, which premieres August 12 on Hulu and FX, explores this question even more directly than his previous work. Set two years before the original Alien in 2120, it imagines a future where the race for immortality has led to three competing technologies: synths (AI minds in synthetic bodies), cyborgs (humans with cybernetic enhancements), and hybrids (human minds downloaded into synthetic bodies).

When a deep space research vessel, the USCSS Maginot, crashes into Earth carrying five captured alien species, a megacorporation called Prodigy sends six hybrids to investigate. The first-ever hybrid, Wendy, played by Sydney Chandler, was a terminally ill child before she was selected for the immortality experiment, just like the rest of Prodigy's hybrids, all six of whom wake up in super-strong, super-fast, synthetic adult bodies that will never age.

“It's a very biological process through which we grow up,” Hawley tells WIRED, “and so the idea that you're going to take these prepubescent children and put them in adult bodies … How are they going to become adults?”

While Alien: Earth is rife with the creature horror and body horror that made its predecessors a cultural phenomenon, Hawley also wanted to introduce “moral horror” via the hybrid characters. “We're often asked in our lives to make these impossible choices—choices that would be impossible for an adult,” he says. “But to put a child in those positions is really awful,” especially in a future where every aspect of life on Earth—from continents and cities down to the hybrids' bodies and memories—is owned by a handful of ruthless corporations.

In 2025, we already have runaway income inequality, a push for “startup cities” free from federal laws, a two-company race to build the first brain-computer interface, and the first warning signs of unregulated AI. In Alien: Earth, Hawley asks what kind of world our children will inherit in 2120 if we continue down the same roads.

In Hawley's vision of the future, Earth's nation-states have been replaced by corporate territories: North and South America are owned by Weyland-Yutani; Europe by Threshold; North Africa and the Middle East by Dynamic; Russia by Lynch; and East Asia, Australia, Greenland, and Iceland by the relatively new upstart Prodigy, which manufactures synths in addition to soft drinks.

Like the company towns for industrial workers of the 19th century, where housing, schools, stores, and other amenities were owned by an employer, much of Alien: Earth is set in the Prodigy “corporate city” of New Siam, which was based on and filmed on location in Bangkok.

“I think we can all agree that the planet's about to get a lot hotter and a lot wetter,” Hawley says, and Bangkok is a tropical location filled with rivers and canals. Originally, he envisioned Prodigy's soldiers moving around New Siam on trains, but once he visited Bangkok, “it became very clear: We'll put people on boats, [and] it'll help sell this idea that the water has reclaimed some of the city.”

Hawley's design team built out a square mile of New Siam in Unreal Engine, the same graphics software used to develop video games like Fortnite and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. In the eyes of Prodigy, there are “tiered layers” of the city, according to Hawley: Humanity Minus, Humanity Plus, and Humanity Prime (though this concept isn't discussed on-screen in the final cut of the series).

“The higher you go, the richer you are, and the lower you go, the poorer you are,” Hawley says. When Prodigy soldiers descend to where the Maginot crashed, we see “Humanity Minus” living in dark subterranean hovels, but when they ascend the company's supertall towers, they stumble upon a Louis XIV-themed party straight out of J. G. Ballard's High-Rise. Even higher, we first meet the CEO of Weyland-Yutani thousands of feet above another corporate city (an unnamed one Chicagoans will recognize).

In our actual present, Elon Musk, a 54-year-old man who still thinks 4/20 jokes are funny, is poised to become one of the first trillionaires. In the 22nd century of Alien: Earth, the “youngest trillionaire ever” is Boy Kavalier, played by Samuel Blenkin, an egomaniacal “boy genius” who founded Prodigy when he was 6 years old and is now in his early twenties.

“The CEO of this company tells himself he's Peter Pan,” Hawley says. “And then you read Peter Pan and you go, ‘That's a dark book.' He's kidnapping these children, he's taking them to this island, [and] it's implied that when they start to grow up, he gets rid of them.” In a nice literary parallel, Kavalier creates the first hybrids in a research facility on a secluded island called Neverland and renames them after Peter Pan's Lost Boys.

Alongside his costume designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb, Hawley decided that Kavalier would wear pajamas with no shoes throughout the series because he owns everything in Prodigy City and Neverland. “Everything's his house,” Hawley says. “The thing about money that I've observed is at a certain point, everything is just free. You don't feel the loss of the money, you're not actually buying anything or aware of the transactions.”

But Kavalier's ultrawealthy mindset also affects the way he sees and treats other people. “Triage the rescue by income bracket,” he instructs his right-hand man after the Maginot crash turns Prodigy City into a mass casualty event. Hawley says Kavalier “is a way of literalizing what I feel when I look around the world that I'm living in right now, which is: Where are the adults? Where are the people who think more about tomorrow than today?”

The first episode opens on the Maginot, where Hawley's production designers painstakingly re-created the look and feel of Ridley Scott's Nostromo. “That's what Alien is, as far as I'm concerned,” Hawley says. “It's the retro-futurism. It's those old cathode [ray] tube monitors. It's the green ASCII text. It's those crazy keyboards with the Egyptian hieroglyphics where, like, how do they even know what they're writing?”

While 1979's Alien spent 40 minutes establishing the everyday lives of space truckers, Hawley knew Alien: Earth had to accomplish the same thing in just four minutes. “Translating a film to television, your first job is authenticity,” Hawley says, so the Maginot was designed based on Ridley Scott's Nostromo blueprints “down to the props.”

In addition to H. R. Giger's xenomorphs, Alien: Earth introduces new extraterrestrial species to the franchise, including a flying insectoid, a botanical creature, and a highly-intelligent tentacled eyeball with multiple pupils that can hijack your body via your own eye socket. Developed conceptually in Hawley's script and then designed by concept artists at WETA, they were “in some cases perfected only in the last weeks of visual effects,” according to Hawley.

“What I needed them to do was to give you the genetic-revulsion feeling that you had the first time you saw a facehugger,” he says. Hawley doesn't think sharp teeth are scary; flat teeth would hurt more. “There's a little idiosyncrasy to my approach to design, where it's like, more claws? Not that interesting to me. But if it's a bad flier like a junebug or something? That's unsettling.”

Alien movies may have raked in more than half a billion dollars at the box office over the past 45 years, but Hawley wanted to get back to the practical effects and personal fears that infused Ridley Scott's original film. “People feel maybe at a certain price point, now you can stop putting a camera on a rolling chair—you can stop with the guerrilla techniques—but for me it's always whatever solves the problem,” he says.

In the first episode, when he needed the xenomorph to slide into view through a doorway, Hawley put the suit performer in a rolling chair. When watching dailies, he would sometimes hum a tune into his phone and send it to his composer, Jeff Russo. “It's a very hands-on process, and I think you feel that,” Hawley says. “It doesn't feel like this is some soulless exercise written by cash registers.”

Earlier this year, Hawley told the New York Times he'd “rather fail horribly than be middle of the road” and that writers “have to take the big creative swings.” When WIRED asks about the biggest swing he took with Alien: Earth, Hawley doesn't hesitate.

“It was actors playing children in adult bodies,” he says, which initially made some collaborators nervous about the series. “When we think of children in adult bodies we think of Will Ferrell. We think of Elf. But I knew children are super noble and truthful and honorable, and if they're written correctly, and if the actors understand the assignment, then you get the best of both worlds.”

The result of Hawley's swing is one of the most fascinating science-fiction TV series of the decade that poses compelling questions about the future, what it means to be human, and how children become—or don't become—adults.

“For these children who were human and have now been put into synthetic bodies, humanity is now a choice,” Hawley says. “What are these children going to choose?”

I agree that it would be misleading to judge  D.C. based on being at a 30 year low. Of the cities with the highest homicide rates, only Philadelphia has a higher population and rate. It's fair to say that there are other cities close in population. But it's clear that D.C. has a abnormally high homicide rate when compared to all of the other U.S. cities of its size or larger. Even if you only compared it to all other U.S. cities within, say, 100k of population, it's still at a very high percentile.

Population does matter somewhat but not really in this case. If you're invading a city because crime is high it only makes sense to do if it's high in absolute numbers; otherwise you're not really having much impact.Also half of DC actually lives in MD and VA.

Once you concede on that, could you say what homicide level requires a police state as a reaction? It would appear to be within a factor of two of the present numbers, but I can't work out where the line would be.

reply

And to cite these numbers without providing context at the same time of citing them that someone was literally fired for allegedly manipulating the data. And to be clear they're just allegations, but also the data is controlled by someone whose job and ego is tied to these numbers dropping, and the rate of the drop is basically unbelievable - 25% to 28% drop in a single year? After suggesting it went down 34% the year before?Even if my info I just wrote is something someone could dispute, is it not part of journalism to at least provide the bare minimum of context for people to at least know why this is controversial? If Trump's position on this is so soundly and clearly misguided, then it shouldn't be a problem at all to provide all facts and context to demonstrate as much. Instead we're given a single fact with zero other context.

Magic: The Gathering is having an even bigger moment than usual this year, thanks to a lot of attention around its splashy crossovers and its rapid rollout of sets. But with that attention, there's definitely been some consternation about just how wide-reaching Magic‘s aesthetic is getting, between experimental in-universe sets and those aforementioned “Universes Beyond” bringing more and more licensed material into the game. In a fascinating new article looking at the major sets of the last year, the game's head designer is starting to reckon with those lessons learned… lessons that are going to make for a very interesting reaction to the game's next big collab.

Today Magic head designer Mark Rosewater released his 2025 State of Design article on the official Magic website, looking back at feedback and lessons to be learned from the release of almost every major Magic set released in the last year (up to, but not including, Edge of Eternities, which released on August 1). There are lots of interesting points Rosewater makes in the piece, reflecting some of the biggest fan concerns about Magic‘s direction from a mechanical and aesthetic point of view, from the game's eagerness to move on from themes every set, creating an issue where mechanical elements are introduced and then left unsupported, to an awareness of the game's complexity creep from the sheer amount of interactions possible even when Magic introduces individually simplistic new mechanics.

But one of the most intriguing lessons to be learned that Rosewater highlights across several of the sets covered in the piece—Bloomburrow, Duskmourn: House of Horror, Foundations, Aetherdrift, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, and Final Fantasy—is a regular criticism Magic has faced as of late: that the game has occasionally pushed its fantastical too far into elements that don't capture Magic‘s feel. One particular pain point Rosewater highlighted was in Duskmourn, a horror-themed set that included several more direct aspersions to classic horror media, rooted in our own world.

“Players, it seems, are not fans of what I'm going to call ‘mundane modernity.' Magic has had many sets, such as Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty and The Brothers' War which push into more of a science-fiction feel, with items far more technically advanced than one would normally find in a fantasy story,” Rosewater wrote. “That doesn't generally bother many players. Some things Duskmourn: House of Horror did for the first time bothered players, like having characters wearing and using things that we actually use: things like sneakers, or jeans, or a baseball bat. Part of fantasy is the idea that you're coming to a world that is fundamentally different than your own. Fantasy wants to be inspirational, and seeing everyday objects which are a part of all of our daily lives deflates that.”

As Rosewater acknowledged, not every Magic set is rooted in explicitly fantastical material, from the sci-fantasy of sets like Edge of Eternities to collaborations in Universes Beyond like Doctor Who or Warhammer 40,000, which have fantastical elements rooted in science-fictional or real-world designs. But Magic also has a strong history of being able to root that kind of aesthetic in fantasy, which Duskmourn‘s more explicit horror callouts lacked. At a time when Wizards is also reckoning with the increase of non-Magic-original sets in the game, depending on the crossover, it's going to be an issue that continues to concern players (even beyond the general existence of Universes Beyond, complaints around which Rosewater acknowledged as a “sentiment [that] continually shrinks over time”).

It's an interesting thing for Rosewater to acknowledge, though, as Magic is now little more than a month away from the release of its next set, Marvel's Spider-Man. Although there are fantastical elements in a set about a superhero scientist and peculiar foes, like most of good Marvel, it's built into the so-called “world outside our window.” The Final Fantasy set did a great job translating Final Fantasy to the world of Magic, while drawing on a myriad of aesthetics from steampunk to sci-fi to more traditional medieval fantasy, and managed to effectively balance those aesthetic styles with what players typically expect from Magic.

Will Spider-Man walk the web-rope and balance that vibe, or will it end up with reactions like Duskmourn? We'll find out if there are more lessons to learn when the set hits shelves at the end of September.

The only remaining Zen 3 3D-VCache CPU is the Ryzen 5 5500X3D, but that chip is exclusive to Latin America.

The road is almost over for AMD's Zen 3-based 3D-VCache-powered gaming processors. Tweakers.net reports that various retailers can no longer purchase the Ryzen 7 5700X3D from AMD, thus confirming the CPU has reached end-of-life status.

Outgoing Ryzen 7 5700X3D pricing and availability back up Tweakers report, as AMD's last eight-core Zen 3 3D-VCache chip is no longer available in the U.S. from virtually all popular retailers, including Newegg, Amazon, B&H Photo, Best Buy, and Micro Center. The only places where the 5700X3D is still readily accessible include the used market and a few third-party listings on Newegg.

Newegg currently has three active Ryzen 7 5700X3D listings, one going for $278.09, another $340, and the last one $526.17, all coming from third-party retailers based in Hong Kong. EBay has a variety of used Ryzen 7 5700X3D chips starting as low as $205 (at the time of writing), as well as some sellers claiming they have brand-new models.

Over in the Netherlands, Tweakers reports Ryzen 7 5700X3D prices have started to climb, reportedly from €225 to €260.

The Ryzen 7 5700X3D debuted in January 2024 as a cheaper alternative to the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, slotting in between the 5800X3D and the MicroCenter-exclusive Ryzen 5 5600X3D. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D is a downclocked variant of the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, featuring eight Zen 3 cores, 96MB of L3 cache, and a 400MHz clock speed reduction compared to its pricier brother. The 5700X3D peaked at just 4.1GHz, while the 5800X3D peaked at 4.5GHz.

Despite its lower clock speeds, the Ryzen 7 5700X3D proved to be one of AMD's most competitive gaming CPUs at the time, coming in at around $100 cheaper than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and Core i5-14600K, while offering performance similar to both chips. (The 5700X3D's MSRP was $249, but street pricing was at $229 when our review went live in May 2024.)

In our review, we found the Ryzen 7 5700X3D was just 9% slower than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D on average at 1080p (while being 35% cheaper), and was 3% faster than Intel's Core i5-14600K. The 3D-VCache in the 5700X3D also enabled the Zen 3 part to outperform entry-level Zen 4 parts, beating the Ryzen 5 7600X by 13%.

The Ryzen 7 5700X3D continued its competitive domination for months after launch, eventually becoming the sole X3D chip for the AM4 platform after AMD discontinued the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and MicroCenter ran out of Ryzen 5 5600X3D inventory — the latter was a limited-edition MicroCenter exclusive that EOLed during the 5700X3D's launch.

For most of the world, the 5700X3D represented the last attainable X3D chip for the AM4 platform. Technically, AMD is still pumping out one last remaining Zen 3 X3D part, the six-core Ryzen 5 5500X3D. But that CPU is exclusive to Latin America. Luckily, AMD is reportedly planning to make more affordable X3D parts on the AM5 platform in the near future, with the Ryzen 5 9600X3D supposedly arriving before the end of 2025.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Tan was just appointed CEO in March.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly set to visit the White House on Monday, following President Trump's call for his resignation last week and probes into his connections with China, as revealed by The Wall Street Journal

Intel has endured a torrid run of form lately. From faltering business performance to a gloomy outlook for its future nodes, the American powerhouse is under major scrutiny that it can't seem to escape. Most recently, Intel's CEO Lip-Bu Tan was probed by a U.S. Senator over his ties to China—which Tan addressed—after which President Trump called for his resignation. Now, the situation has escalated to the point where even Intel's board is reportedly at odds with Tan.

According to the report, Tan will be going to the White House today to meet President Trump. The purpose of the visit is clear: to elucidate recent developments and assure the U.S. government that both Tan and Intel are fully committed to the nation's goal of semiconductor independence, with no security concerns to worry about. Tan, who previously served as CEO of Cadence—the company recently found guilty of selling trade secrets to China— has invested heavily in some 600 Chinese firms, some linked to the Chinese military.

Tan will reportedly discuss both his personal and professional background, explaining his stance on the state's stringent anti-China tack. Intel's fabs are some of the only American equivalents to giants like TSMC that can potentially compete with the East. Last year, Intel received $8 billion through the CHIPS Act to keep its manufacturing facilities running and prevent them from being spun off. Tan will likely emphasize the connection between these fabs and national security in front of Trump, while also outlining other ways the two could collaborate to strengthen America's chipmaking prowess



This development follows recent tariff exemptions granted to companies like Apple in exchange for promises to manufacture products in America. Trump has stated he'll impose a 100% tariff on semiconductor companies that don't produce their chips domestically. Moreover, it was recently reported that the White House is enacting a new 15% revenue cut on AI GPU sales to China, demanding Nvidia and AMD share revenue with the state. This, however, doesn't affect Intel, as it is largely focused on the CPU market. If true, however, it would show the government's no-compromise and no-holds-barred position on working with Beijing.

Intel has had a tough couple of years. The company has lost half of its valuation, dropping from $200 billion to just $100 billion in less than 20 months. It is also planning to shed 25% of its workforce, has slowed the development of its Ohio plant, and spun off non-critical divisions to cut costs. Intel—a legacy firm whose dominance predates AMD and Nvidia's explosive ascent over the past decade—still holds the edge in CPU market share due to its extensive history, but now finds itself on the cusp of another major administrative hurdle.

Women who reported having been stalked or obtained a restraining order were each more likely to experience a heart attack and/or stroke in later years compared to those who did not, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's flagship journal Circulation.

""Although violence against women is common, and evidence has linked violence with consequences for women's later heart health, it is still not widely recognized or routinely considered by health care professionals as a potential cardiovascular risk factor among women,"" said study author Rebecca B. Lawn, Ph.D., a research associate in epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston and at the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

""We felt it was essential to look beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors in women and strengthen our understanding of the relationship between underexplored types of violence and heart health.""

About 1 in 3 women have been stalked at some point in their lives, according to data on intimate partner violence collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study notes that common forms of violence against women, such as stalking, are rarely discussed in cardiovascular research. Lawn's previous research linked sexual assault and workplace harassment to higher blood pressure in women. Other studies report that people with restraining orders are more likely to experience poorer health.

Researchers analyzed stalking, restraining orders, and heart disease or stroke development among participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, from 2001 to 2021. The analysis includes data for more than 66,000 women, average age 46 years in 2001. These women did not have cardiovascular disease in 2001, when they first shared whether they had experienced stalking or stalking harassment behaviors, such as receiving unsolicited correspondence, that made them fearful. The study also asked if participants had ""ever taken out"" a restraining order, which is a legal document that seeks to limit contact between a victim and perpetrator. Obtaining a restraining order was considered a sign of severe violence.

The analysis found:

Stalking is often seen as a form of violence that does not involve physical contact, which may make it seem less serious. However, our findings suggest stalking should not be minimized. Stalking can be chronic, and women often report making significant changes in response such as moving.""

Rebecca B. Lawn, Ph.D., research associate in epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston and at the School of Population and Public Health, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada

Harmony R. Reynolds, M.D., FAHA, immediate past chair of the American Heart Association's Clinical Cardiology & Stroke Women's Health Science Committee, said she was surprised at the strong association this study found between stalking and cardiovascular disease.

""A variety of stressful life experiences are known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, including adverse childhood experiences, financial stressors, grief and other experiences,"" Reynolds said. ""People subjected to intimate partner violence face about a 30% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next few years compared to others. While this study shows a more moderate risk, given the long-time frame, it highlights how feeling unsafe can affect the body, in addition to the mind.""

Reynolds, the Joel and Joan Smilow Professor of Cardiology and Director of the Sarah Ross Soter Center for Women's Cardiovascular Research at NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City, was not involved in this research, and noted that the effects of stress can be long-lasting. ""Perhaps because it is our nature to re-think about things that happen to us, making us experience the situation over and over. However, social support may mitigate the effects of stress. It's helpful to have people you can trust to talk with, whether they are family, friends, people in the community or professionals,"" she said.

Study authors note that the link between stalking and cardiovascular disease may be due to psychological distress, which may disrupt the nervous system, proper blood vessel function and other biological processes; however, these potential mechanisms were not examined in detail in this study.

Lawn said more research, as well as training for health care professionals, is needed to understand the link between stalking or obtaining a restraining order and women's cardiovascular health.

""We also need to increase awareness about the potential health harms of experiencing violence and provide women with help and resources,"" she said.

Among the study's limitations are that participants-U.S. registered nurses-were mostly non-Hispanic white women. The findings may not apply to other populations or groups of people. The study notes that previous research indicated that, ""violence history, including stalking, is more common among women from minority racial/ethnic backgrounds and those with low income."" In addition, the study relied on participants self-reporting their history of experiencing stalking and restraining orders.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Implant system can treat Type 1 diabetes by supplying extra oxygen to insulin-secreting cells","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250811/Implant-system-can-treat-Type-1-diabetes-by-supplying-extra-oxygen-to-insulin-secreting-cells.aspx","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:11:00 GMT","

Cornell researchers have developed an implant system that can treat Type 1 diabetes by supplying extra oxygen to densely packed insulin-secreting cells, without the need for immunosuppression. The system could also potentially provide long-term treatment for a range of chronic diseases.

The findings were published Aug. 11 in Nature Communications. The co-first authors were former postdoctoral researcher Tung Pham and doctoral candidate Lora (Phuong) Tran.

The technology builds off previous implantable encapsulation devices developed in the lab of Minglin Ma, professor of biological and environmental engineering in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) and the paper's senior author.

Ma has explored a variety of ways to address Type 1 diabetes, in which the body's immune system turns hostile and destroys insulin-producing pancreatic cell clusters, known as islets. Without insulin, the body has no way to deliver glucose – sugar – into muscle and tissue cells to generate energy. People with Type 1 diabetes typically manage the disease through daily insulin injections or insulin pumps, but even with that treatment, patients still suffer devastating effects of the disease.

Ma's previous implantable devices have proved effective in controlling blood sugar in diabetic mice, but they can only last so long.

One of the major challenges is the implant itself often dies due to the lack of oxygen after implantation. In our lab, they had success in mice that lived over one year, and they controlled the diabetes very effectively with some small capsules without oxygen generation. However, when we scale up, we need more cells, we need more density, especially. We need a higher dose. If we implant without generating oxygen, the cells often die within two weeks.""

Lora (Phuong) Tran, doctoral candidate

Ma's team developed the new system in collaboration with electrochemical researchers from Giner Inc., including co-author Linda Tempelman, Ph.D. '93.

The key components of the system are a cylindrical capsule with a ring-shaped cross-section that contains transplanted insulin-secreting cells, and an electrochemical oxygen generator that is roughly the size of a dime and removeable. A nanofibrous membrane outside the capsule protects the cells from the host body's immune system; a permeable membrane in the core of the capsule allows the central supply of oxygen to reach the ring of cells.

""We have to meet two requirements,"" Tran said. ""The first is immune protection. And second, you have to maintain mass transfer, like the glucose and other nutrients and molecules that can go in and out.""

Working with Dr. James Flanders, associate professor emeritus in the College of Veterinary Medicine, the researchers successfully tested the system in rat models.

""It's the proof of concept. We really proved that oxygenation is important, and oxygenation will support high cell-density capsules,"" Tempelman said. ""The capsules are immune protective and last for a long time without having some kind of fouling of the membrane. The body never likes when you put a foreign substance in. So that's the engineering in the Ma Lab, to look for materials and coatings for the materials that are immune protective, but also don't invoke excess response from the body because of the material.""

The new system would enable a much greater number of the 2 million people who suffer from Type 1 diabetes in the U.S. to now have an islet transplant or cell therapy without requiring immune suppression, which is considered too dangerous for routine use. Also, the new system can provide much tighter sugar control, effectively curing the disease and enabling the person to eat, drink and exercise like everyone else.

The next step will be to implant the system in a pig model, and also test it with human stem cells. The researchers are interested in eventually trying to use the system for implanting different cell types in humans for long-term treatment of chronic diseases, according to Tempelman, who is CEO of Persista Bio Inc., a new startup she founded with Ma and Flanders that is licensing these technologies.

""We see an age where people will be getting implants with allogeneic cells from other human beings, from stem cell lines, and using it long term to treat things that your body is missing,"" Tempelman said. ""Here we're missing insulin. In pain control, maybe you need more endorphins or some other molecule. In enzyme replacement therapy, you need more enzymes. We're interested in things like other autoimmune diseases where there's inflammation that's out of control.

""So maybe you could put a small molecule in that would treat inflammation, and then someone, like a Lupus patient, wouldn't have to take an oral medication. They could just have a low-level implant that provides a low amount of it.""

Co-authors include Flanders; Christopher Piccirillo '24 and Alan Li '23; and Simon Stone of Giner Inc.

The research was supported, in part, by the National Institutes of Health, the Hartwell Foundation, Breakthrough T1D and Novo Nordisk.

The NWSL season rolls on as Matchday 15 is in the books. More than halfway through the 2025 regular season, the race to the playoffs heats up. U.S. Women's National Team players were, as always, right in the thick of it.

Meanwhile, the European leagues are set to begin later this fall, with club friendlies already kicking off.

Let's rewind some of the USWNT's top moments at their respective clubs from this weekend:

The rivalry between the Portland Thorns and Seattle Reign FC is one of the strongest in the NWSL. USWNT defensive midfielder Sam Coffey got in on the action, scoring one of four goals for the Thorns in the victory.

In the 18th minute, Coffey stepped up to take a penalty kick and smashed the ball into the bottom right corner of the net to equalize after Seattle scored early in the match. The Thorns would score three more times before the final whistle to finish with a 4-2 scoreline at full time.

It was Coffey's second goal of the season, and the fifth of her career. Her goal Sunday tied a career season-high after she netted two last season as well. Coffey, known as a stabilizer in the midfield, has also found the net in a National Team shirt. She scored three goals in the USWNT's last five outings.

After a record-breaking trade that transferred Ally Sentnor to Kansas City Current from the Utah Royals last week, the USWNT forward made her debut in teal at America First Field in Sandy, Utah.

Sentnor subbed on in the 46th minute in the Current's 1-0 victory over her former squad, the Royals. The second-year player jumped from the last-ranked team in the NWSL to the top of the league in Kansas City. Sentnor adds even more firepower to a first-place Current side that includes fellow USWNT players Michelle Cooper, Claire Hutton and Lo'eau LaBonta and holds the best record, by far, in the league with 13 wins and 39 points in the table. 

The Houston Dash escaped with a narrow 2-1 win over the North Carolina Courage with a game-winning goal in stoppage time.

USWNT forward Yazmeen Ryan may not have been credited with the assist, but her tenacious attack certainly opened the door for Sophie Schmidt to net the go-ahead goal. Ryan sized up a Courage defender on the right corner of the box and beat her 1v1 to launch the ball toward the goal. Schmidt cleaned up the rebound with a finish from close range.

The Dash improved to 4-8-3, 15 points, sitting 12th in the standings. While they're four places out of playoff contention, it's a tight race in spots No. 9 through 12. The Courage currently holds the ninth spot, so Houston's win this weekend could prove crucial later.

While the NWSL is in full action until November, the European clubs that the USWNT are a part of will kick off their seasons in September, with club friendlies already underway.

OL Lyonnes, which now has three Americans on the roster — Lindsey Heaps, Lily Yohannes and Korbin Albert — is one of those squads that played an exhibition game prior to the kickoff of the 2025-26 regular season. The Lyonnes beat Switzerland side Servette FCCF 5-0 over the weekend.

Several European leagues kicked off the new season this weekend, and MLS is in full form in the second half of the year, including the Leagues Cup, which means there's a ton of U.S. Men's National Team talent pool action to catch up on.

Let's rewind some of the USMNT's top moments at their respective clubs from this weekend:

Chris Richards started the new season with Crystal Palace the same way he ended last season — by lifting silverware. Richards won the FA Cup with his club in the spring, and most recently, Crystal Palace beat Liverpool in a dramatic penalty shootout to win the FA Community Shield.

Richards played 90 minutes in the match on the back line. His growing accolades come at a time when the 25-year-old center back stepped into a leading role over the summer for the USA in the Concacaf Gold Cup.

Last week in the Dutch Super Cup, Sergiño Dest helped PSV win the Johan Cruyff Shield to begin the season. In the first regular-season match, Dest scored again. Just before half-time, Dest netted PSV's third goal on the way to a relentless 6-1 victory.

It's a great showing for Dest, who missed much of last season rehabbing from an ACL injury. The right back hasn't played for the National Team since March 2024, as he continued to come back, but if he continues on this track he could be a piece to consider heading into the next few USMNT camps as the group prepares for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

In the group stage of the Leagues Cup, Max Arfsten sent home the game-winner for Columbus in the 1-0shutout win against León, a Liga MX club.

Arfsten picked up a quick pass from his Crew teammateAndres Herrera, and managed to regain control of the ball with a dribble before knocking it high into the far post. The winger has scored six goals across all competitions for the Crew this season. Columbus won two of its three group stage matches in Leagues Cup but won't advance to the knockout round because of goal differential.

The transfer window has seen a slew of moves for USMNT players. Midfielder Malik Tillman, who had a strong Gold Cup, transferred to Leverkusen (Bundesliga). Tim Weah made the move from Juventus (Serie A) to Olympique de Marseille (Ligue 1). Matt Turner returned home to the New England Revolution (MLS). Strikers Patrick Agyemang (Derby County) and Damian Downs (Southampton) both signed with EFL Championship, Division II English squads.

Downs had quite the introduction in his first match with his new team. He subbed on in the 60th minute when Southampton was down 1-0 to Wrexham, but the Saints stunningly scored an equalizer and the game-winning goal in the 90th minute and in stoppage time, respectively. Downs assisted Jack Stephen on the go-ahead score in 90+6.

Mexico keeps on winning soccer silverware over the United States, this time with a blowout win.  

El Tri beat the U.S., 5-0, in Sunday's 2025 Concacaf Boys' Under-15 Championship for a second straight title in that competition. 

All five of Mexico's goals in the tournament's final – played in Alajuela, Costa Rica – were scored by Mexican-American players. Juan Carlos Martínez Jr., who had two goals in the final and won the Best Player Award, was born in California and plays for the LA Galaxy academy. 

Mexico's three other goals in the final were scored by: Paxon Ruffin, born in Florida, who plays in the youth ranks of Liga MX club Monterrey; Da'vian Kimbrough (Sacramento Republic FC); and Lisandro Torres (LAFC academy). Kimbrough and Torres were also born in California.

In 2023, Kimbrough signed with Sacramento, which is part of the USL Championship, as a 13-year-old to become the U.S.'s youngest soccer professional. According to ESPN, he was believed to have been the youngest professional in team sports in the major leagues in North America, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL and WNBA.

It's been a banner year for El Tri's soccer teams, especially on the men's senior side. Mexico won its first Concacaf Nations League title in March over Canada, snapping the U.S. men's national team's hold on that competition. Mexico then followed that by winning its 10th Concacaf Gold Cup in July with a 2-1 win over the USMNT.

Along with the U-15 title, Mexico also won the Under-20 Concacaf title on Aug. 5. That was Mexico's 14th U-20 crown and its first since the 2015 edition. The U.S. had won the previous three editions. 

Mexico and the U.S. are serving as co-hosts (along with Canada) for the FIFA 2026 World Cup, and it's great to see the rivalry and talent on the pitch between the two sides continue to grow for years to come.

The pay is nonexistent, but the perk could be viewing games in the U.S., Mexico and Canada for free during the FIFA World Cup  next summer.

FIFA launched the application process for the World Cup  volunteers Monday. How many are needed? A staggering 65,000 across the 16 cities that will host the expanded 48-team format over 39 days beginning June 11, the largest volunteer program FIFA has ever attempted.

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” FIFA president Gianni Infantino said. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event. 

“We hope interested individuals will join us as we welcome the world to North America in 2026.”

In addition to stadiums, volunteers will provide support across at training sites, airports and hotels.

Wednesday marks one year out from the start of the 2026 World Cup. A look at where preparations stand.

FIFA estimates 6.5 million fans will attend the World Cup, with 3.7 million attending games in the U.S., 1.5 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in Canada. The 2022 final with Lionel Messi leading Argentina past Kylian Mbappé and France, drew a record 1.42 billion viewers, including 26 million in the U.S. 

“The Super Bowl, which is fantastic, has what, 120-130 million viewers? The World Cup has 6  billion,” Infantino told Fox Sports in April. “A World Cup is 104 Super Bowls in one month.”

Volunteers in the past ranged from students to seniors. No experience is required but applicants must be at least 18 years old. Interested individuals can apply at fifaworldcup.com/volunteers.

Those whose applications are accepted will be invited to attend the Volunteer Team Tryouts, which are expected to begin in October. Training will take place in March 2026.

‘Volunteers are the heartbeat of FIFA events and champions of their host city — sharing their pride and passion with fans from all corners of the globe, welcoming visitors to experience the unique culture of their host city and supporting the extraordinary event that is a FIFA World Cup,” FIFA said in a statement.

The FIFA Club World Cup exposed some significant issues that could hamper the 2026 World Cup, with hot weather being among the top concerns.

Los Angeles is one of 11 U.S. host cities, with eight games scheduled at SoFi Stadium, including the U.S. team's opener June 12. After playing its second match in Seattle on June 19, the U.S. will conclude group play at SoFi on June 25. 

Included in the games to be played in Inglewood are two round-of-32 games and a quarterfinal. Only one venue — AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas — was awarded more games with nine.

“We're happy with with how it turned out,” U.S. coach Gregg Berhalter said. “We look forward to being in L.A. [and] probably one of the best stadiums in the world and to get to play there twice in the group stage.”

Other U.S. hosts cities include Seattle, Houston, Kansas City, Atlanta, Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Miami and the San Francisco Bay area. Games in Mexico and Canada will be held in Mexico City, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Toronto and Vancouver.

“FIFA changed my life,” longtime volunteer Craig Collins said on a video. “Why do I want to volunteer again? I can give back to an organization that has provided for me without knowing it.

Collins became the one-millionth person to join the FIFA volunteer community in April 2025.

“I'm excited to apply for the 2026 volunteer program and hope to show off my community to the world once more.”

The revamped Club World Cup thrust the preseason schedules of the European clubs competing into disarray, and Real Madrid have just one friendly arranged before the start of the 2025–26 season. 

The Spanish behemoths, aiming to dethrone Barcelona domestically and claim a 16th Champions League crown this term, travel to Innsbruck in midweek and face a historically humble WSG Tirol side that have started the Austrian Bundesliga season brightly. 

Alonso would've learned plenty about his squad in the United States, with only one addition made since Madrid returned to the Spanish capital, but there's still much to be done if Madrid are to leapfrog an imperious-looking Blaugrana. 

Here's how Real Madrid could line up for their one and only preseason outing of the summer. 

GK: Andriy Lunin—Thibaut Courtois was impressive at the Club World Cup, and doesn't exactly need to play here. Alonso could thus give No. 2 Andriy Lunin a run-out in Innsbruck. 

RB: Trent Alexander-Arnold—The Englishman's injury altered Alonso's tactical plan for their Club World Cup semifinal defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, with the Spaniard previously utilising Alexander-Arnold as a wing-back. It seems unlikely that the new manager will have sustained success with a back three. 

CB: Raúl Asencio—The young defender had a poor Club World Cup and has a criminal case looming over him. However, for now, he's a part of Alonso's plans and will be used alongside Madrid's more experienced options here.

CB: Dean Huijsen—The new signing has hit the ground running right away and looks to be an indispensable figure in Madrid's defense.

LB: Álvaro Carreras—Ferland Mendy is out injured, so former Madrid youth player Carreras has the chance to establish himself down the left after returning to the club this summer. 

CM: Aurélien Tchouaméni—The versatile Frenchman is set to play an important role for the flexible Alonso during the Spaniard's first season. 

CM: Thiago Pitarch—There could be an opportunity for the 18-year-old in Austria, after he impressed in a behind-closed-doors clash against Leganes. Federico Valverde hasn't made the trip.

CM: Dani Ceballos—There could be a start for Ceballos, who enjoyed a resurgent campaign in 2024–25, with Eduardo Camavinga and Jude Bellingham out injured.

AM: Arda Güler—Güler has been one of the major early winners of Alonso's appointment. The new boss trusts the talented Turkish playmaker, and he could be used in an advanced role here.

ST: Kylian Mbappé—After a forgettable tournament in the United States, Mbappé has had the chance to fully recover over the past few weeks and should be raring to go for the start of 2025–26. 

ST: Vinicíus Júnior—The Brazilian's stock has slumped considerably over the past 12 months, and doubts remain over his Madrid future amid a contract dispute. Still, Alonso has insisted that Viní Jr remains a big part of his plans. Can he make the superstar partnership work up top?

Home > Morocco > Royal Decree Ends ‘World Cup Government' Race as New Foundation Takes Charge

A royal decree (dahir) has officially put an end to the political battle over who will lead Morocco's government during the 2030 World Cup.

Marrakech – A royal decree (dahir) has officially put an end to the political battle over who will lead Morocco's government during the 2030 World Cup.

The announcement came after King Mohammed VI issued Decree No. 1.25.54, published in Official Gazette No. 7428 on August 7, which implements Law No. 35.25 establishing the “Morocco 2030 Foundation” and granting its presidency to Fouzi Lekjaa, the budget minister and president of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF).

Political parties from both the majority and opposition have lost their contest to lead what had been dubbed the “World Cup government,” regardless of who might win the 2026 legislative elections.

The decree effectively ends the verbal sparring between party leaders and ministers who had expressed ambitions to top the election results with the goal of leading the World Cup government.

According to the official text, the Morocco 2030 Foundation will cooperate with relevant administrations and bodies to prepare, organize, and enhance all international football events granted to Morocco by FIFA or the Confederation of African Football (CAF), up until the 2030 World Cup.

The foundation is described as “a public benefit institution, not aimed at making profit, with legal personality and financial independence,” according to the law.

It is tasked with “taking necessary measures to prepare and organize the aforementioned events, monitoring the implementation of related commitments, while providing support and accompaniment to the concerned regions and cities.”

The executive council of the foundation will include, in addition to its president, representatives from the government authorities responsible for interior affairs, foreign affairs, budget, public enterprises, and territorial councils, or any other institution the council wishes to include.

Among the executive council's powers will be evaluating the progress of projects related to international event preparations based on received reports and suggesting necessary measures when required. It will also monitor the implementation of state commitments linked to organizing these international events.

The law stipulates that the executive council will determine the foundation's general activity guidelines, specifically “planning necessary measures to prepare and organize international football events in Morocco, particularly the 2030 FIFA World Cup, the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, and any major sporting event organized under FIFA or CAF supervision.”

The legislation also establishes an advisory council serving as a space for dialogue and reflection. This council aims to mobilize all the country's vital forces through a participatory and inclusive approach to help create suitable conditions for successfully organizing these international football events.

It will be chaired by the foundation's president and include representatives from the private sector, civil society, Moroccans living abroad, Moroccan football representatives, and African experts.

A territorial management committee, chaired by the Minister of Interior, will be responsible for monitoring and coordinating the implementation of regional state commitments.

This step shields projects from political and electoral exploitation

Lekjaa, who serves as both budget minister and president of the Morocco 2030 Foundation, has previously advocated for the benefits Morocco will gain from hosting the 2025 AFCON and the 2030 World Cup.

These include advanced infrastructure and development projects that will benefit all Moroccan citizens. He has responded to public demands that development not be limited to cities hosting the two historic sporting spectacles, affirming that benefits will extend to other cities as well.

During a previous ministerial conference hosted by the National Higher School of Administration (ENSA) in Rabat, the foundation's president explained that these projects are based on a coherent approach among all stakeholders for integrated development in sports, economic, and territorial domains.

The investments in relevant sectors amount to approximately MAD 150 billion ($15 billion), covering major projects.

Regarding transportation project financing, Lekjaa confirmed a partnership between public and private sectors, with annual state support of MAD 1.6 billion ($160 million) until 2030.

This will ensure the development of high-speed trains and regional lines connecting Casablanca, Rabat, and Tangier, as well as the southern provinces, to strengthen territorial and economic integration.

Concerning financial arrangements, the Morocco 2030 Foundation president stated that they were designed not to burden the general budget, through an innovative concept based on partnership with the Caisse de Dépôt et de Gestion (CDG) and the National Company for Construction and Management of Sports Facilities (SONARGES), allowing cost recovery over twenty years.

Both the majority and opposition parliamentary groups announced their full support for Lekjaa's presidency of the Morocco 2030 Foundation just days before the end of the spring session.

They pointed out that this step distances ongoing projects from political and electoral exploitation, rising above narrow calculations and the rhetoric about who will lead the “World Cup government,” warning against turning this description into what local media have portrayed as an “electoral apocalypse.”

With the countdown to Morocco's hosting of major international football events now officially underway, the establishment of this foundation marks a significant shift in how preparations will be managed, placing them under specialized institutional oversight rather than within the regular political contest.

On Monday, FIFA launched the volunteer application process for the FIFA World Cup 26™, set to be the largest volunteer program in the organization's history, with an estimated 65,000 participants needed across Canada, Mexico, and the United States, including right here in North Texas.

The tournament, featuring an expanded 48-team format, will span 16 host cities over six weeks, starting June 11, 2026, in Mexico City. Nine matches will be hosted at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, including a Semi-Final. 

The FIFA World Cup 26™ Volunteer Community will support operations at stadiums, training sites, airports, hotels, and other venues, covering 23 functional areas. 

“Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event.”

No prior volunteering experience is required, but applicants must be at least 18 years old, eligible to volunteer in the host country, and have a good command of English. Proficiency in Spanish is desirable in Mexico, while French is an asset in Canada. Additional language skills are a plus.

Craig Collins, a volunteer at the 1994 FIFA World Cup USA™ and the FIFA Club World Cup 2025™ in Atlanta, became the one-millionth member of the FIFA Volunteer Community in April 2025. 

“I'm so proud to be part of this moment – not just for FIFA, but for my city,” Collins said. “I'm excited to apply for the 2026 volunteer programme and hope to show off my community to the world once more.”

Volunteers will receive an official FIFA World Cup 26™ uniform, exclusive reward items, meals during shifts, a volunteer certificate, and skills-based learning opportunities. Successful applicants will attend Volunteer Team Tryouts starting in October 2025, with training beginning in March 2026.

Volunteers must commit to eight shifts, attend pre-event training, and pass a background check.

Applications are open at fifaworldcup.com/volunteers. The program welcomes individuals from all backgrounds, uniting them through a shared passion for soccer and community engagement.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

The ATP and WTA tours have rapidly moved on from the Canadian Open, with the Cincinnati Open now well underway.

The tournaments lead up to the US Open, the fourth Grand Slam of the season, which gets underway later this month.

And many high-profile players are taking on the Cincinnati Open in a bid to fully prepare for the major event at Flushing Meadows.

ATP number one Jannik Sinner and number two Carlos Alcaraz are involved, having both decided to skip the Canadian Open.

Sinner and Alcaraz could play the Canadian Open in 2026, but this year the pair decided to start their North American hard-court swings in Cincinnati.

And that decision certainly highlighted an issue with the tennis schedule, with the duo clearly deciding that it was too early to return to the court following their Wimbledon final.

Avoiding injuries will have been high on their agenda, with their absence in Toronto allowing them to recover for Cincinnati.

Taking a similar decision for the latest tournament was Novak Djokovic, who was among the withdrawals for the Cincinnati Open.

Also pulling out were WTA stars Naomi Osaka and Victoria Mboko, with the pair having just played out the Canadian Open final.

Victoria Mboko and Naomi Osaka have withdrawn and will be replaced by lucky losers. #CincyTennis

The players are clearly trying to manage their schedules and fitness levels, and many have been left with no choice but to pull out of tournaments.

And that is a blow to tournament organisers and fans who would have been eager to see the biggest names in action.

The ruthless schedule has now seemingly claimed another victim, with Camilo Ugo Carabelli retiring hurt during his meeting with Ben Shelton in Cincinnati.

And he isn't the only casualty, with Marta Kostyuk pulling out of her clash with Iga Swiatek due to a wrist injury that also forced her out of the Canadian Open at the quarterfinal stage.

The problem has indeed already spilt into the US Open, with WTA ace Paula Badosa having confirmed her withdrawal from the Grand Slam.

It is, of course, too late for the ATP and WTA tours to do anything about the current schedule, but the constant and lengthy list of injuries and withdrawals must be looked at going forward.

Fonseca moves on to the third round after Davidovich Fokina retires. #CincyTennis

The ruthless schedule is by no means a new issue, but the powers that be have yet to fully address the many player complaints.

WTA number one Aryna Sabalenka lamented the ‘intense' schedule earlier this month, having also returned in Cincinnati after a lengthy break following Wimbledon.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Michelsen – Rune: 11.08.2025 17:00 CEST
H2H: first meeting

Alex Michelsen has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, Michelsen lost against Khachanov in the quarterfinals in straight sets. Last season in Cincinnati, the American played well. He eventually lost to Sinner in the third round in straight sets. This week, Michelsen defeated Moutet in the opening round in three tight sets.

Holger Rune has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, Popyrin upset him in the 1/8-Finals in three tight sets. Last season, Rune had a decent run in Cincinnati. He eventually lost to Tiafoe in the semifinals in three sets. This week, the Dane defeated Safiullin in straight sets.

According to the bookies, Rune is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is hungry for success and enjoys playing in the States. The Dane was great under pressure in the opening round.

That being said, Rune winning is a value bet.

Arthur Rinderknech has won three of his last five matches. This week in Cincinnati, Rinderknech defeated Borges in the opening round in straight sets. He was great under pressure, saving both breakpoints he offered. In the second round, the Frenchman upset Ruud in three sets, after losing the opening set 6-7.

Felix Auger-Aliassime has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, the Canadian lost against Marozsan in the opening round in straight sets. This week, he defeated Etcheverry in straight sets comfortably in the opening round.

According to the bookies, Rinderknech is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. He dominated against Ruud in the second and third sets. On the other hand, Auger-Aliassime struggled with his form for the past few weeks. We expect Rinderknech to keep this match close.

That being said, Rinderknech covering the games handicap is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Arthur Rinderknech +2.5 games handicap @1.91 @bet365

Tiafoe – Humbert: 11.08.2025 18:30 CEST
H2H: 2-1

Frances Tiafoe has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Toronto, the American lost to de Minaur in the 1/8-Finals in three tight sets. This week in Cincinnati, Tiafoe defeated Carballes Baena in straight sets.

Ugo Humbert has won three of his last five matches. His last match before the ATP Cincinnati was at Wimbledon, where he lost to Monfils in the opening round in five tight sets. This week, the Frenchman had a favourable opening round draw. Humbert defeated Wong in straight sets. He offered and saved only one breakpoint.

According to the bookies, Humbert is the underdog in this matchup, but we disagree. Both players play at a similar level. We expect a tight match that could go either way and possibly tiebreaks.

That being said, over games is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: over 23.5 games @1.83 @bet365

The ATP Challenger Tour welcomes two brand-new tournaments this week, both staged on hard courts and offering $200,000 in total prize money—and 125 valuable ATP Ranking points for the champion. The Europcar Cancun Country Open in Mexico, and the Serve First Open in Sumter, South Carolina, promise high-level fields and unique settings.Mexico steps up, and the players are showing upFor Cancun, the journey from idea to reality was fast-paced.“Just a few months ago, after requesting a date to the ATP,” explained tournament director Daniel Langre, “Week 33 opened up, and we were happy to take it and accept the challenge of hosting a 125 event on the second week of the Cincinnati Open 1000.”The decision to launch at the second-highest Challenger level was backed by experience.“Our tournament promoter, Francisco Tarazona, has plenty of experience being involved in ATP 250s and 500s in the past, so I believe that gave the ATP the confidence they needed to grant him with this Challenger level,” Langre said. “I have also been involved in the organizing committees of ATP 75s, WTA 250s and a WTA 500 event, so we believed we had a strong team with the necessary tools to organize this event.”

The WTA has long has a tennis presence in Charleston, South Carolina's most populous city. In Sumter, about 100 miles northwest, the Serve First Open arrives with big ambitions.Tournament director Brian Hodge says the event was conceived “in the early part of the summer season” and was added to the calendar directly by the ATP. The short preparation time brought logistical hurdles.“Probably the biggest challenge was the small window to create a campus with all the player and officials' amenities, set up for televised matches and an outstanding fan environment for watching high-level tennis,” Hodge explained. “We are very happy to say we have done very well to create a great atmosphere for the players, tournament staff, and fans.”Spectators can look forward to “an exciting week of tennis with some high-level tennis up close from the rising stars on the Challenger Tour.” The field is stacked: Zizou Bergs, Kei Nishikori—making his comeback with a protected ranking—Mattia Bellucci, Roman Safiullin and Filip Misolic are among the headliners.The matches will be staged at the Palmetto Tennis Center, a 32-court facility with 24 hard courts and eight European red clay courts. For the Serve First Open, there will be about 500 seats on each of the two oversized feature courts, and 250 seats for the remaining match court.🖥️📱 Click here for live coverage on TennisChannel.com Monday, August 11 through Sunday, August 17

Emma Raducanu will bid to beat world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka for the first time at the Cincinnati Masters today (Monday) with the help of her new Spanish coach. The British No.1 set up a re-match of their Wimbledon clash with an impressive in over Olga Danilovic in her first match working with Francis Roig.

In the third round at SW19 last month, Raducanu had a point to lead 5-1 in the second set under the Centre Court roof before losing 7-6 6-4 to the Belarusian. She has yet to take a set off the US Open champion in their two previous meetings

Raducanu, who is up to world No.34 in the live rankings as she seeks a seeding for New York, said: “I'm reasonable enough, and I guess honest enough with myself, to know that different surfaces favour different people, and where my game is at in comparison. So, I think the grass gave me a bit of an advantage (against Sabalenka), but we'll see how it goes.”

Raducanu's 6-3 6-2 win over world No.43 Olga Danilovic means she now has a 19-4 winning record against lower-ranked players over the last year.

Her problems have come against the best - and she has hired Rafa Nadal's former coach Roig as her eighth full-time coach to close this gap. “When I play the really top players where I can't run and scrap, wait on them to miss,” she said. “I think that's where I need to improve.

“And yeah, I'm hoping he can help me with that. There were four or five points (against Danilovic) where I did something that we were working on, and it's always really satisfying and rewarding when you hit a shot and you've worked on it in practice.

“So I think I'm going to improve a lot, hopefully doing the work day in, day out.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Who is Victoria Mboko? What to know about teenage Canadian tennis star","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2025/08/11/victoria-mboko-tennis-age-ranking-montreal-open/85609060007/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 17:16:05 GMT","

There's a new Canadian tennis star who announced her presence on the worldwide stage this month ahead of the 2025 U.S. Open.

Teenager Victoria Mboko pulled off a stunning run to capture her first WTA title on Thursday, Aug. 7, defeating four former Grand Slam champions after entering the bracket as a wild card at the 2025 National Bank Open in Montreal. She beat Naomi Osaka in a thrilling final, which featured Mboko storming back after losing the first set.

Mboko became the second-youngest player in WTA history to beat four Grand Slam champions in one event, with wins over Sofia Kenin, Coco Gauff and Elena Rybakina as well. Only Serena Williams accomplished the feat at a younger age during the 1999 U.S. Open.

Here's what to know about Mboko now that she's suddenly a player to watch at the U.S. Open, which is the final Grand Slam on the 2025 tennis calendar:

Mboko is 18 years old. She turns 19 on Aug. 26, two days after the 2025 U.S. Open begins in New York.

Mboko was born in Charlotte, North Carolina after her parents, Cyprien Mboko and Godee Kitadi, moved to the United States in 1999 to get away from political turmoil and unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the WTA. The family moved to Toronto when Mboko was a small child. Mboko is the youngest of four siblings and they all played tennis growing up.

Mboko started the 2025 season ranked No. 333 in the world and it has been an incredible rise since then. She is now ranked No. 24 in the world in women's singles after winning the Montreal Open, with a 53-9 record in 2025. She entered the tournament ranked No. 85 in the world.

Osaka took some criticism on social media following her National Bank Open final loss to Mboko because she didn't mention Mboko during a brief speech at the trophy ceremony. Mboko, on the other hand, thanked Osaka ""for an incredible match. I've always looked up to her when I was really little, so it's always great to play with such an amazing player like you.""

Osaka elected to skip her post-match news conference, but she later clarified her on-court comments in a transcript from the WTA and apologized in a social media post, referencing some awkward trophy ceremony speeches that didn't go well for her previously.

""Thanks Montreal it's been a really great run. I also want to say sorry and congratulations to Victoria,"" Osaka wrote on Threads. ""You played a great match and have an amazing career ahead! I realize I didn't congratulate you on the court. Honestly I was in a daze and I was so focused on not having the same speech as (Indian Wells) 2018 final or the Jenny/Jennifer situation that I tried to make my speech as short as possible.""

No. Mboko and Osaka both announced after their Montreal Open final that they would be withdrawing from the Cincinnati Open. The tournament is already underway.

Mboko previously revealed she had injured her wrist during her semifinal match in Montreal and underwent an MRI. She told reporters she was likely to skip Cincinnati as a precaution. Mboko is still expected to play at the 2025 U.S. Open, which begins on Sunday, Aug. 24.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","tennis"

Three games down in the final set, Madison Keys was on the brink of an early Cincinnati Open departure at the hands of Eva Lys. It comes after her recent semifinal loss in the Canadian Open.

Having rallied from a set behind to push for a decider, it seemed unlikely she'd conjure up another comeback. Yet, Keys rattled off three consecutive points to even the score at 3-3, ultimately clinching the set 7-1 in a nail-biting tiebreak.

The victory was a rollercoaster ride, and the 2025 Australian Open champ admitted her recollection of the last set against Lys was hazy.

Post-match, she confessed: ""I think I blacked out. I was just trying to win the point directly ahead of me. I think it was just one of those days where neither of us played great at the same time, but we both kind of kept finding it.

""I feel like sometimes that's just a tennis match: you're not both raising your level at the same time, and that kind of happened a little bit today. I also thought we both played really well at moments.""

As a past Cincinnati Open victor in 2019, Keys is gunning for another triumph in Ohio.

She reflected: ""I think I played well when it mattered. I think I served really well at the end, and that was huge. I felt like there was times when I wasn't making the best decisions, but that's life. I'm really happy to have been able to in some way figure it out and get the win.



""I literally take it point to point to point, almost to the point where I'll walk off sometimes like, 'I don't remember; did she have match points? Did that actually happen? But just trying to be super clear when I'm walking up to the line, especially when I'm serving, so I know what I want to do with the first ball.""

She wrapped up by saying: ""I've always loved this tournament and it's always packed. There's never any match I've ever played where you look around and there's not hundreds of people around. I think that part of that is that this tournament has been here for so long, but the fans are very knowledgeable. They're very big tennis fans, and I feel like it's such a great central location for a lot of Midwesterners to come.""

Ahead of her second-round match at the Cincinnati Open, World No. 2 Coco Gauff showed off her New Balance X Miu Miu kit, complemented with her signature Coco CG2 shoes and a Rolex.

Coco Gauff's game has been on point all year. 

So, too, has her style.

During a pre-tournament press conference ahead of her opening match at the Cincinnati Open, the World No. 2 revealed that she's worn a different outfit at every tournament she's played in 2025. (That's 14 different tournaments, including Cincinnati.) 

This week in the Queen City, the two-time Grand Slam champion is rocking a New Balance X Miu Miu kit, which she showed off during her pre-match ""fit check.""

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

The striking outfit -- which includes a headband and wristbands -- is white and royal blue, with accents of red. She complemented the top and skirt with her signature Coco CG2 shoes and a Rolex watch.

The kit was nearly perfect, save for the earrings that she forgot to put on before walking on court. (This wasn't the first time the 21-year-old forgot to bring something on court. Luckily she doesn't need earrings to hit winners.)

Gauff wore different iterations of the New Balance X Miu Miu kit earlier in the year, in Rome and Berlin. It was navy and white with accents of red in Rome, and white and green with accents of sky blue in Berlin. 

She's received rave reviews for her innovative and stylish outfits all year, most recently at Wimbledon, where her kit honored the Grand Slam's illustrious history.

""I was really proud to wear that,"" she said. ""It's unfortunate that it didn't get longer screen time."" (Coming off her French Open title, Gauff lost to unseeded Dayana Yastremska in her first-round match at the All England Club.)

The New Balance X Miu Miu with Coco Gauff collection will be available for purchase in select Miu Miu stores on September 10, for a limited time, and on Miu Miu's website.

As for the tennis itself, Gauff -- coming off a doubles title in Montreal -- made quick work of Xinyu Wang in her second-round match, winning 6-3, 6-2 after getting upset by the Chinese World No. 37 two months earlier in Berlin. On Tuesday, with a spot in the fourth round on the line, she'll look to avenge her loss to Yastremska at Wimbledon earlier this summer.

2025 season: The story so far

Cadillac: Everything You Need To Know About F1's New Team

As the 2025 season takes a breather, F1.com takes a look back at the championship fight so far between McLaren team mates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

The 2025 season has featured several fascinating storylines so far – and one of these has centred around the increasingly close intra-team championship fight that has been playing out between McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

From Round 1 in Australia through to the last race before F1's traditional summer break in Hungary, the battle has seen its fair share of changes in momentum – as well as a dramatic collision along the way.

We've been taking a look back at how the duel has unfolded throughout the first half of the campaign – with plenty more to come when the action resumes at the end of August…

When the season kicked off at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Norris laid down an early marker by beating Piastri to pole position.

While Piastri remained on the tail of his team mate during the first half of Sunday's race, heavy rainfall in the latter stages resulted in the home hero running off the track, dropping him down the order in the process.

Throughout the hectic final stages, Norris held position to take victory by just 0.895s from Red Bull's Max Verstappen, with Piastri having to settle for ninth place.

Piastri was looking for a better outing when F1 moved on to Shanghai one week later – and while McLaren lost out to the Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's Sprint, Piastri grabbed pole position in Qualifying.

Despite a challenge from Mercedes' George Russell at the start, the driver from Melbourne looked in commanding form as he led throughout before claiming his first win of the season.

Norris, meanwhile, reported an issue with his brakes during the latter stages but held onto second place, giving the Woking-based squad a 1-2 finish.

Norris and Piastri dominated the top of the free practice timesheets when Formula 1 arrived at Japan's Suzuka Circuit. However, Verstappen caused a surprise by outpacing both to secure pole position.

While there was a close moment between Verstappen and Norris when both emerged from the pit exit at the same time during Sunday's race, the Dutchman remained ahead and ultimately became the third different winner in as many Grands Prix.

The final 10 laps saw Piastri close in on Norris during the battle for P2 before his challenge fell away towards the end, meaning that Norris led home his team mate in a 2-3 formation.

After the opening three races, Norris led the championship by one point from Verstappen, with Piastri 13 points adrift in third. But it was Piastri who enjoyed a stronger Qualifying at Round 4 in Bahrain, the Australian taking pole while Norris ended the session back in sixth.

From there it proved to be an impressive weekend for Piastri, who built a strong lead on race day before eventually crossing the line with a sizeable 15-second margin from Russell in P2.

Norris' good recovery drive saw him complete the podium in third, but the Briton had lost a fair bit of ground to his team mate in the championship, with Piastri having leapfrogged Verstappen to move just three points behind Norris.

After topping second and third practice in Saudi Arabia, Norris looked in promising form entering into Qualifying – but things unravelled for the Briton when a hefty crash in Q3 put him out of the session and left him down in P10 on the grid.

Piastri, meanwhile, lined up in second behind polesitter Verstappen. An early battle between the pair resulted in Verstappen being handed a five-second time penalty, dropping him behind the Australian who went on to claim a mostly untroubled win from there.

While Norris recovered to a final result of P4, Piastri's victory was enough to steal the championship lead from his team mate, making him the first Australian to head the standings in 15 years.

The Miami Grand Prix was the scene of Norris' debut win in 2024 and the British driver proved victorious at the track again during this year's Sprint, with a well-timed pit stop bringing him out ahead of Piastri.

That run did not continue into Sunday's race, however. With Verstappen taking pole ahead of Norris – and Piastri back in fourth – a mistake from Norris at the start dropped him back, while Piastri moved forwards and eventually overtook Verstappen for the lead.

Norris climbed back up to second and helped McLaren to seal another dominant 1-2, allowing Piastri to strengthen his championship lead in the process.

Piastri was again the man to beat in Qualifying for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, the Australian clinching pole position while Norris ended the session in fourth.

It was second-placed Verstappen who starred on race day, however, with the Red Bull man making a stunning move on Piastri to take the lead on Lap 1.

The Dutchman went on to win, while Norris finished ahead of Piastri in second. This put the gap between them in the championship at 13 points.

Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets of every practice session during his home race weekend in Monaco – but Norris beat the Ferrari driver to pole position in Qualifying.

On Sunday the Briton held that position through Virtual Safety Car phases and a mandated two-stop strategy rule to claim his first Grand Prix win since the beginning of the season.

While Piastri joined him on the podium in third, the 24-year-old's championship lead had been cut to just three points.

The momentum swung back to Piastri as F1 returned to the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for Round 9 of the season.

After beating Norris to P1 on the grid in Qualifying, the championship leader returned to the top step of the rostrum on race day.

Norris was not far behind, with the team securing another 1-2, but Piastri had eked out his title standings advantage to 10 points.

Entering into the Canadian Grand Prix weekend, Norris admitted that it was a case of “when” not “if” he and Piastri would come to blows on track during the battle for the World Championship.

Within a matter of days, that prediction had proven accurate. After a slightly weaker weekend for the squad in general, Norris was chasing down his team mate in a scrap for fourth during the closing stages of the race.

Contact occurred between them, resulting in Norris – who took responsibility for the incident – pulling off track with damage, while Piastri crossed the line in fourth. It was an incident that McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella labelled as “not acceptable”.

Off the back of that incident in Montreal, Norris appeared keen to bounce back at the next round in Austria, having set the pace in second and third practice before grabbing pole position in Qualifying, with Piastri placing in third.

What followed on Sunday was a thrilling race-long duel between the McLaren duo as they fought for the lead, Piastri remaining hot on Norris' tail throughout much of the Grand Prix.

Norris ultimately kept his team mate at bay by 2.695s to seal his third win of the campaign – and, after his non-score in Canada, the Briton was now 15 points off in the championship fight.

Verstappen again beat both McLarens to pole position at Silverstone – but a dramatic Grand Prix saw the order change.

In an eventful wet-dry race, Piastri overtook Verstappen for P1 just as rain started to fall. The Australian was later hit with a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much when preparing for a restart following a Safety Car period, handing the lead to Norris during the pit stops phase.

From there Norris claimed victory in front of his home crowd, with Piastri coming home in a slightly less happy second. His title lead had again been reduced, with the margin now down to eight points.

The Sprint spoils went to Verstappen as F1 arrived at Spa-Francorchamps for Round 13, the Dutchman having overtaken pole man Piastri in the early stages – but it was a fight between the McLaren pair when it came to Qualifying.

Norris outpaced Piastri by just 0.085s to claim pole. However, after a delay to Sunday's race due to heavy rainfall, Piastri was on the charge when racing eventually got underway and made a bold move on his team mate along the Kemmel Straight to take the lead.

While Norris went on the pursuit in the latter stages, he ultimately crossed the line just over three seconds adrift of Piastri – and, with that, the Australian had stretched his championship lead out again to 16 points.

Hungary hosted the final round of the campaign prior to the sport's traditional summer break – a venue that was also the scene of Piastri's first Grand Prix victory 12 months earlier.

Qualifying threw up a surprise result when Leclerc grabbed an unexpected pole, and the Monegasque initially led for the early stages of the race. However, while Norris had fallen away at the start, an alternative one-stop strategy put the Briton ahead of both Leclerc and Piastri as the event progressed.

Piastri went on the chase of the other McLaren during the final phase, providing a thrilling conclusion to the Grand Prix – but Norris held off his team mate to win by just 0.698s.

The impact on the championship? Norris is now only nine points away from Piastri – and, with a further 10 rounds to go when the season resumes, it looks like there is plenty more action to come in the fight for the title.

The rising star, who will lead filmmaker Zach Cregger's 'Resident Evil' movie, also discusses how his time on set with Josh Brolin impacted their upcoming feature 'Whalefall.' 


							By 

	Brian Davids


Writer


[This story contains major spoilers for Weapons.]


Weapons is a watershed moment for star Austin Abrams. 




	The scene-stealer of Zach Cregger's mystery-horror film is on the verge of going from one of the names atop a call sheet to the name atop a call sheet. The 28-year-old Florida native has already booked the starring role in Cregger's next film, Resident Evil, and he's currently leading Brian Duffield's highly anticipated adaptation of Whalefall for 20th Century.

Weapons chronicles a collection of characters in Maybrook, PA, as they orbit the baffling disappearance of 17 schoolkids at 2:17 AM. Abrams was a part of Cregger's original cast that once featured the likes of Pedro Pascal. But due to the delay caused by 2023's WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, Pascal's crowded schedule forced him to exit the role of Archer Graff. The rest of the main cast also followed suit, but Abrams became the lone exception who was willing to wait it out and not pursue other work while Cregger reshuffled the deck.

	











	“I just wanted to do Weapons,” Abrams tells The Hollywood Reporter. “When [Cregger's Barbarian] cut to Justin Long [to begin its second act], I immediately thought, ‘Whoever the fuck made this movie, I fucking love this person.' So when I got out of the theater, I was like, ‘I need to figure out how to meet this guy and work with this guy.' And it's so rare that it actually happens.”


	As for his Resident Evil casting, Abrams can only speculate as to how much his loyal gesture influenced Cregger's decision to have him carry his original story in the video game-based franchise.

	











	“I don't think it hurt anything. If I did something else instead of Weapons, I certainly don't think that would've helped me do something like Resident Evil,” Abrams admits.


	(Spoilers ahead.) Josh Brolin ended up portraying the role that Pascal vacated in the now critical and commercial hit. His grieving father character eventually has a climactic confrontation with James, Abrams' homeless addict character, at the house where all the missing schoolchildren have congregated. James and Archer's borderline slapstick fight was already quite bizarre since Abrams' character was possessed by the same type of witch's spell that brought the kids to that particular home in the first place. But what makes it even more bizarre is that Brolin is currently playing Abrams' father in Duffield's aforementioned survival thriller about a scuba diver (Abrams) who's swallowed alive by a sperm whale. (The book includes a father-son flashback narrative.)


	“It was just really cool to come into something else and already have this weird connection with [Brolin],” Abrams says. “It almost feels like you're entering a different dimension, and while you've had an experience with this person, it's not the same person. So it's strange, but it's only helped things.”


	Abrams did not get to enjoy Cregger's highly sought-after script with the witchcraft twist intact, but the reading experience was still rewarding, as was his eventual perusal of Cregger's Resident Evil screenplay.

	











	“My freaking agent had spoiled it. I love him, but that was annoying,” Abrams recalls mid-laugh. “I still loved the script. I just couldn't stop reading it, which is insane and how it's been with all of Zach's scripts [Resident Evil included]. They keep feeling fresh, and they keep going into new territory.”


	Below, during a recent spoiler conversation with THR, Abrams also discusses why he pities his Weapons character, as well as the on-set story behind his instantly beloved reference to Willow. 


	***


Part of me was hoping you'd be doing this interview from the innards of a whale, but I  appreciate that you were able to squeeze this in on your one day off from Whalefall. 


	(Laughs.) Yeah, I needed a break from inside the whale. 


You were part of the Weapons cast when it was a completely different ensemble. The strike then affected Pedro Pascal's schedule, and Zach had to start over except for you. Did you just get lucky to not have any other conflicts? 


	No, not necessarily. I just wanted to do Weapons. When I first saw Barbarian in the theaters, I didn't really know what I was walking into. I didn't know about Zach. I didn't know about the movie at all. I just thought it was going to be a regular horror movie, and I wasn't super excited going into it. But my friend wanted to go, and I was like, “Sure, I'll go.” 


	So I knew nothing about the movie, and when I saw the first shot, I was like, “Okay, that's kind of sick.” The camera went through the main character's [Georgina Campbell's Tess] car window. And when it cut to Justin Long [to begin its second act], I immediately thought, “Whoever the fuck made this movie, I fucking love this person.” I then looked over at my friend and was like, “Holy shit.” We couldn't even sit next to each other because the theater was so packed. 

	











	So when I got out of the theater, I was like, “I need to figure out how to meet this guy and work with this guy.” And it's so rare that it actually happens. But I just thought he was so gutsy, and it was so refreshing to experience. Weapons then came together, and I only want to work on things that I want to work on.


Zach appreciated that you “hung tough” with him. He now calls you his “dude.” Do you think your loyal gesture factored into you landing Resident Evil?


	I have no idea, but I don't think it hurt anything. If I did something else instead of Weapons, I certainly don't think that would've helped me do something like Resident Evil.


Pedro's exit from Weapons allowed you to work with Josh Brolin, who is now also playing your father in Whalefall. Given your violent interactions in Weapons, have there been any jokes on Whalefall about your polar opposite dynamics?


	Maybe a few, but not too many. It was just really cool to have worked with him before and then come into something else and already have this weird connection with him. It almost feels like you're entering a different dimension, and while you've had an experience with this person, it's not the same person. So it's strange, but it's only helped things. I really loved him on Weapons and talking with him about things. So I feel a really deep connection with him at this point. 


Weapons' climax is so dark and disturbing, and yet Josh's character's inability to put James down was hilarious. Did it actually feel comedic on the day? 












	Well, I remember thinking, “You want me to get up again and then get up again over there?” So I don't know if I was really sure about it at the time, but I do remember it being funny. It was also super physical, but it was funny on the day.


As you were reading Weapons, did you accurately predict that witchcraft was at the root of it? 


	Well, my freaking agent had spoiled it. I love him, but that was annoying. (Laughs.) I still loved the script. I read it in one go in the middle of the night when I should have been sleeping. I just couldn't stop reading it, which is insane and how it's been with all of Zach's scripts. I just love them. I don't know what it is, really. I mean, it's Zach, but it's the sharpness of the dialogue and the action. They keep feeling fresh, and they keep going into new territory.


So when Josh's character unknowingly painted the cause of everything on Julia Garner's character's car, you immediately knew the game that Zach was playing.


	Yeah, I knew something [witchy] was going on, for sure, but I didn't know how the story was going to be told or anything like that. I didn't really know all of those dynamics, so I still unveiled a lot.


I've seen the film interpreted in a wide variety of ways, and I should preface this next question by saying that whatever take you offer today is by no means official. 


	No, it's official! (Laughs.)


But what is your own reading of the film?


	Zach has talked about it in a sense that even he doesn't know what a lot of it means. A lot of it is deep, unconscious, inner-working stuff. What does the [AR-15] rifle that just pops up in Archer's [Brolin] dream mean? I don't really know. I probably had a take a year ago [during filming], but I've been so focused on other things since then that I can't give you a great interpretation right now. But it's all deep unconscious stuff that just floods out of Zach, and he has the skill to make that unconscious stuff work, which might be why his work is so strong and impactful. I know that each different character represents a part of himself, but beyond that, I don't know. I just know that I love the story, even if I don't have a real solid interpretation of it, at least not at this moment. What do you think?

	











What I consider to be the lasting image of Weapons is the young kids chasing after the old witch. So, to me, the movie is about the younger generation turning the tables on the older generation and rejecting their trauma, their dangerous policies and the corrupt systems they uphold.


	Oh, fuck yeah. I like that. 


You mentioned that all of these characters are a reflection of Zach in some way. Can you recognize the James in Zach?


	Yeah, he's talked about it being him at his lowest and most desperate.


Do you feel pity for James since he operated under the spell of a witch and the spell of his own addiction?


	Yeah, of course. It's fucking terrible, man. Being addicted to drugs is hell. It's a nightmare. When I see someone on the street that is in a psychosis or something like that, that could be me, that could be you, that could genuinely be anyone. It just depends on what situation you grew up in, to a big degree. There's babies that are being raised by meth addicts. I don't know what's going to happen to them, but that's a hard hand to be dealt. So I feel complete empathy for James. 


“Oh fuck, Willow.” 


	(Laughs.)


James' reaction to the Willow DVD is a big hit on the internet. 


	Is it?


Yeah, is there a story behind that moment?


	I think the DVDs were just there, and maybe it was Zach who noticed it. So he was like, “Oh, can you just say Willow or something like that?” It was maybe that simple, but I don't remember that line being in the script. I think the DVD got placed there, and we just found it funny. And it is fucking funny.

	











When James was panhandling Julia's character for money to see his brother, we know that the brother part is true since he later called him and asked for money under false pretenses. But the optimist in me wants to believe that James, at that moment, genuinely wanted to go home and get help. Did Zach give you any more backstory for James?


	No, not really. At  least not that I remember. It just came down to research. But the interesting thing about James asking for money to see his brother, is that true? Is that not true? Because it could be true in that moment. But once he has some money, he then might say, “I've got to get high so that I can come up with a plan to go see him.” So it's not necessarily a lie, at least not in that moment when he asks Julia's character for money. But I definitely discussed a lot of it with Zach, and he was open to me trying things and throwing things at him. He's so smart, and I just really trust his direction. 


IMDb can sometimes be inaccurate prior to the official release, but it had your character name written as Anthony for the longest time. Was that his name on an old script or breakdown?


	Yeah, that was his name at first, but between Archer and Alex, there were too many other A-names.


You've had back-to-back foot chases in Wolfs and now Weapons. Did you feel more prepared for this one after going through that crucible on Wolfs?


	No. (Laughs.) I ended up dropping some weight for Weapons, so the running was a little challenging, sometimes. But I ran for a much shorter period than the Wolfs sequence.

	











Your Wolfs director Jon Watts used to be in a film school gang with Jake Schreier, so do you think Jake put you on Jon's radar all those years ago via Paper Towns?


	Yeah, they're really good friends, and I think Jon was in the editing room on Paper Towns, either watching or giving notes or just hanging out. But I know that he had seen me in that and that it kind of started things. 


Jon was going to make a Wolfs sequel until the movie's sudden lack of theatrical release rubbed him the wrong way. Did it ever get as far as you knowing whether you were coming back or not?


	Yeah, I think I was. George [Clooney] came up with a bit of a story or the start of a story, and that was the thought for a second.


When I last spoke to Brian Duffield for No One Will Save You, he told me how Nope became a source of anxiety after his movie had already gotten moving. They're both alien invasion thrillers on the surface, but completely different under the hood. Well, another movie with a nearly identical premise to Brian's Whalefall announced itself in May just as you guys were about to start shooting. Has this subject come up at all on set? 


	I didn't even know about it until weeks ago. So I really don't know much about it, but I've heard it might be a Spanish film or something like that. 


I do know that it's an independent. There's no studio behind it.


	But I don't know why I didn't know about it until later on. People had already been talking about it, but I don't feel concerned about anything like that. 

	











You're not returning for Euphoria season three, but your career and so many others have really accelerated from that show. Is that the biggest reason why the show has had such a tough time getting back on the screen? Are there just too many big careers to juggle?


	Yeah, probably. There were so many different factors, from everyone's schedules to COVID to Angus [Cloud] passing away. There were a lot of tough situations that made it difficult.


I know you're consumed by the innards of a whale right now, but Zach has already storyboarded Resident Evil. Have you also started wrapping your head around that role yet?


	Yeah, we've been wrapping. (Abrams smiles.) Zach is very, very prepared.

Bill Lawrence also unveils the season-two moment that was completely candid and how Brett Goldstein came to be cast.


							By 

	Seija Rankin


Senior Editor


	When Bill Lawrence and his Shrinking co-creators were writing the show's second season, they knew that casting the part of Louis — the drunk driver who killed the wife of Jason Segel's Jimmy — was going to be extremely difficult. Segel suggested tapping Brett Goldstein, but Lawrence was resistant. “I kept thinking, ‘He's known as [Ted Lasso's] Roy Kent, and he's too gruff,' ” says the showrunner. He eventually agreed to let Goldstein take on the role on one condition: that he shave his signature facial hair to make the character, a pivotal element of the season-two plotline, more vulnerable. “I called Brett upand said, ‘If you think you can do this, you should, but if you screw it up, you're going to ruin the show and it's going to get canceled,' ” Lawrence recalls with a laugh. “In the end I thought he just killed it, and I was so proud of him, and now I'm annoyed that his casting wasn't my idea.”

Shrinking did not get canceled; it received nine Emmy nominations, including its first for outstanding comedy series. Here, the perennially busy showrunner took a break from working on the third season (and the development of the Scrubs reboot, and the fourth season of Ted Lasso, and the development of an upcoming untitled HBO series) to break down what made a difference on their sophomore effort. 




Harrison Ford got his first Emmy nomination for this season; do you feel like you learned anything about how to write for him from the first season?


	One of the cheat sheets to successful streaming television is, at least for me, working with actors with whom I've worked before. Like Jason or my wife [Christa Miller]. We didn't know Harrison personally, so we originally wrote him as a very serious guy. As he grew to trust us, we realized he was game for anything, and that freed us up to write stuff for him that we normally wouldn't. I also noticed how vulnerable and emotional he was, that he made stuff sad even when we didn't put that in the script. Like the Thanksgiving dinner speech in the season-two finale; he could have delivered that matter-of-fact, and it would have worked. We shot everyone's reactions to him simultaneously, and a lot of those emotional reactions were real. It was a super poignant moment — and I'm a hard, cynical dude, so I got surprised by it. 

	











I'm surprised to hear you describe yourself as such.


	I mean that in terms of, I don't really get surprised on TV sets anymore. It's why I love having young writers around, because they still get that wow factor. I'm the luckiest guy on the planet, and I'm super grateful to get to do this, but one of the things that comes from getting your 10,000 hours in something is you don't expect to be surprised. When you are, it's revelatory.


How hard was it, logistically, to pull together that scene — with your entire cast in one room at the same time?


	It can be self-indulgent to direct your own show, but one of the reasons I directed that one is I knew I was the only one who was allowed to ask certain things of the cast for that. It was a giant room of thespians, but the whole scene was in service to Harrison's speech. And it's a nightmare for a crew to be like, “We're going to shoot eight pages at one location and there are 17 actors.” But it was worth it. 


This season has a lot of guest stars. Do you write your ideal actors into the script?


	We'll often write one draft where the character isn't too specific, and then we'll go to Candice Bergen or Damon Wayans — the second they say yes, even before the ink is dry, we'll do a pass for their voice. But I also wrestle with some of the casting, like maybe I shouldn't have the guy who played the janitor on Scrubs be on Shrinking, or my wife on Shrinking, or now I have Jamie Tartt from Ted Lasso [Phil Dunster] as one of the male leads on the new Steve Carell show. But also, if you think someone is talented and you like spending time with them, then you would be silly not to keep hiring them. 

	











Did you go through that same process for the character of Louis, played by Brett Goldstein?


	No, because once it was Brett, then all the writing was for him. And at the end of the day, he's going to do that role the way he wants too, since he's a creator too. I don't like it when people have a bigger vote than me because I'm a control freak, so that drove me a little insane.


Are you used to writing and showrunning for the cadence of streaming networks by now? 


	Whether I'm doing 26 episodes of Scrubs or 10 episodes of the Steve Carell show, I have always found a way to be completely behind schedule. I don't know how I do it. I don't have the energy of a young writer anymore. They kick me out of the writer's room in the evenings now — I get grumpy, so they're like, why don't you just come back in the morning and see what we did? But one thing I'm going to watch really closely is The Pitt. I'm a huge fan of that show, and I love how quickly they seem to be turning it around. As a fan, I can get bummed out when there's a huge gap between seasons. We're starting to shoot the second season of Bad Monkey in a few weeks, and it was such a summer beach read last year, I wish the seasons were closer together.


Shrinking gained a lot of momentum despite the large gap between seasons, do you think there's a secret to that success?


	There are a few things. You gain a toehold into who the actors and actresses are, and the show gets stronger for it. The best example in Shrinking is Michael Urie. By the time the second season was starting, we'd seen him on Broadway in Once Upon a Mattress and the whole world was learning how dynamic he is. So the show got better by us realizing the sort of lines we could give him. I've also learned that the shows I like the most have a true beginning, middle and end. We're planning on doing a fourth season, knock on wood, and we know that if we started that season and Jason Segel's character was like, I've been thinking about it and I'm still really sad about my wife, people would be like wait you already told that exact story. They need to feel like the characters are going on new adventures.

	











This is truly no shade to The Bear because I still find it compelling, but that's sort of what is happening with Carmen's storyline.


	I swear, I'm not trying to slam it either! Here's one of the ways we look at things: We're rebooting Scrubs, and I don't get to work on it a ton because I'm at Warner Brothers and it's a Disney show, but a lot of the original writers and cast got to help out on the pilot. One of the first things Zach Braff said was, I cannot be a 50-year-old doing the same things. I have to be older, I have to be more mature. I remember once during like the eighth season of the original show, a journalist asking Zach how do you think your character has changed since the first year? He goes, I think I have a beard now. Television can't do that anymore.


Can you tell us anything about the new season of Shrinking?


	Right now our biggest goal is just locking it all down and making sure we get to make the show with the same cast. This is a business and these guys are all so good that they have one thousand options. But one of the best things for us is it starts from the top. I was excited to talk to you today specifically, because I saw Apple posted that video of Harrison on his birthday on set. What I'm assuming is going to happen is that we figure it out sooner rather than later and then we'll get Brett, me and Jason together to go talk to Harrison and the gang and say, here's the story, I hope you're up for signing up for it. We hope everyone's game for doing another one.

	











Can you envision what the endgame of the show will be?


	The way we approach Shrinking is that we know Jason's character's journey, which is grief, forgiveness and moving forward. That's a three-season tale. But if you're asking me, “What are the next three seasons going to be?” Well, they're therapists, and just because you've gotten over the biggest stick in the spokes of your life doesn't mean there's no more pathos. We intentionally put these people in a world that brings all of that to their doorstep, so there's always more story to tell. We definitely put some Easter eggs into the third season that will allow people to see what's coming.

Obama and her brother's podcast, 'IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson,' taped live at Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival with Natasha Rothwell, discussing ""what it means to be Black"" when traveling and how ""marriage should be a choice,"" not a social reflex. 


							By 

	Ronda Racha Penrice



	In front of a rapt Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival audience Aug. 9, Michelle Obama co-hosted with her brother a live taping of their podcast IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson, produced through their production company Higher Ground. The former First Lady returned to the fest, where she and former President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance in 2022 to support their Netflix documentary Descendant.


	Pinch-hitting for advertised guest Teyana Taylor, who stars in the upcoming feature One Battle After Another with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro, and who canceled due to unexpected vocal surgery, was The White Lotus‘ Emmy-nominated Natasha Rothwell.

	During the conversation, Obama shared a moment she particularly enjoyed about Rothwell's twice Emmy-nominated role as Belinda. “Not only does Belinda get her groove thing on,” she said, “but one of my favorite scenes, because this is a luxury resort, [is] where you're having tea or lunch by yourself, and you spot a Black couple. And most of us know when you're doing something really nice somewhere, especially when you see other Black people,” — Obama indicated a look of acknowledgement of folks within the community — “yeah, and you got that, you know. I love that.” 


	Rothwell provided the backstory: “I pitched that to Mike [White, White Lotus creator]. He's such a collaborative writer-director, and season one, we started working together because he's very aware that he's not a Black woman,” she explained. “When we were working on season three, I was like, ‘Mike, there has to be a moment where Belinda sees someone who looks like her, and almost seeing what's possible for herself, because she's there under work circumstances, but that couple's there just for them. And so just to have that look make the cut, I was so thrilled,” she shared. “So many people bring that moment up because it's just authentic for the experience.”

	











	As the predominantly Black crowd co-signed her assertion, Obama added: “It tells a fuller story of what it means to be Black because we leisure, we travel, right? We leisure all up and down Martha's Vineyard, don't we? It's a beautiful thing to see. We've got to make sure the rest of the world knows that we are traveled, and we do things besides serve other people,” she said to enthusiastic applause.


	The trio swapped stories of their childhoods: Obama was a self-proclaimed introvert, Robinson “was always trying to be outside,” and Rothwell was “an introverted extrovert” from a military family background, for whose service Obama thanked them. Rothwell also discussed her parents' happy 47-year-marriage, and shared that she is “childless by choice” and content with being single. Robinson asked, “Would anybody be upset if we introduced you to somebody?” Rothwell responded: “God is good!”


	Obama shared how she tells her girls — Sasha and Malia — not to rush into marriage. “I'm trying to instill in my daughters right now that marriage should be a choice. And sometimes we send subliminal messages to our kids; they could be doing great things, and it's like, ‘Well, are you dating anyone?,'” she offered as an example. “Or you could be conquering the world, and it's like, ‘When are you going to have a baby?,' all the while sending the message that who you are isn't good enough until you are partnered or paired off.”


	Emphasizing her love for her husband, despite various reports, Obama explained why she shares the difficulty of marriage. “I talk openly about it, not because I don't love my husband. I'm happy to be married. We have a wonderful relationship, but [society] sometimes set young couples up,” she said. “What I don't want young couples to do is walk away from the hard, because that's just waiting for you.”

	











	The companionable conversation covered what it was like for Rothwell as a junior writer on Insecure — “After the first writers' room, I went to my car and sobbed because I felt so seen,” she recalled — as well as leading her award-winning series How to Die Alone as creator, writer, producer and star despite its cancellation. “I'm so grateful that the series saw the light of day, and it's on Hulu,” she said of the show that took her eight years to make.


	Obama also sought Rothwell's advice for others, including her own daughter Malia, who feel compelled to share their voice in Hollywood: “I have a young creative child. I think a lot of young creatives, especially kids of color, with all that's going on in the world, they wonder, ‘Is there still room for this?'”


	Rothwell responded: “I think it's so important for young creators to know that in their pocket is a phone that is a movie studio. Do not wait for someone else to give you permission to live your dream.”


	“There's still a lot of white space for really good, different, diverse stories. And I don't care what we're going through in the world, there's always room for us to tell our stories,” Obama, a producer herself, noted before inquiring about the latest project Rothwell is developing, with which she was unfamiliar.


	Rothwell admitted she was unfamiliar with the viral TikTok sensation, Who TF Did I Marry? by Reesa Teesa — who narrates the story of her marriage to a man she later learns is a pathological liar — until social media began attaching her to the project, which she learned about on a 25-member family group text chain while she was in Thailand.

	











	Later, when it became a viable Hollywood property, Rothwell was amazed that her fledgling production company Big Hattie Productions won it. “It was a six-way bidding war,” she said of the mega popular TikTok series. “There was like the Shondas and the Lee Daniels, everyone was throwing their hat in the ring, because to get 500 million people to sit down and watch something, Hollywood sits up and takes notice.”


	Closing out the conversation, Obama circled back to Rothwell's parents being thrilled that she was sitting down with Obama and her brother.  “Please tell your parents that you made them proud,” she said.

Plus, Chappell Roan's ""The Subway"" rumbles in at a career-best No. 3.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



HUNTR/X's “Golden” goes up, up, up a spot for its first week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.


	The aspirational song is from the soundtrack to the smash animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters and glows as the first Hot 100 leader for the act, whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI. The set rules Billboard's Soundtracks chart for a seventh week.


	Notably, “Golden” is the eighth song associated with Korean pop to conquer the Hot 100 — and the first by female vocalists. It joins “Like Crazy” by Jimin of BTS in 2023, and BTS' six No. 1s in 2020-21: “Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat),” with Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo; “Dynamite”; “Life Goes On”; “Butter”; “Permission to Dance”; and “My Universe,” with Coldplay. (HUNTR/X singers EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.)


	“Golden” is also the first IRL Hot 100 No. 1 by any act with a fictional background since the ensemble No. 1 “We Don't Talk About Bruno,” which reigned for five weeks in February-March 2022. It, too, was released from a hit animated film, Disney's Encanto, and sung by multiple vocalists as their characters in the movie.


	As for all-women collectives of three or more members, HUNTR/X is the first to top the Hot 100 in 24 years — since Destiny's Child dominated with “Bootylicious” for two weeks in August 2001.


	Plus, Chappell Roan's “The Subway” pulls into the Hot 100 at No. 3, marking her highest debut and rank. The song starts as her fourth top 10.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Aug. 16, 2025) will update on Billboard.com Tuesday, Aug. 12. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Golden,” on Visva/Republic Records, tallied 31.7 million official streams (up 9% week-over-week), 8.4 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 71%) and 7,000 sold (up 35%) in the United States Aug. 1-7.


	The track slays for a third week at No. 1 on Streaming Songs and rises 5-3 for a new best on Digital Song Sales. It makes history in the former metric, as it's the Hot 100's greatest gainer in streaming for a record-breaking sixth straight week. (It surpasses the five weekly wins in a row for Migos' “Bad and Boujee,” featuring Lil Uzi Vert, in early 2017.) “Golden” debuted at No. 81 on the July 5 chart and began its streak the following week.


	Plus, “Golden” is the first non-debuting title to clear 30 million weekly official U.S. streams since Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” in late March. (In between, two songs reached the mark in their first chart weeks: Playboi Carti's “Evil J0rdan” and Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae.)


	Flying colors: “Golden” is the fourth Hot 100 No. 1 with “gold” or “golden” in its title to shine atop the Hot 100.


	Here are all the glittering “gold” records:


	Honorable mentions (silver medals?): 24kGoldn sparkled with “Mood,” featuring iann dior, for eight weeks at No. 1 in 2020-21, and Bobby Goldsboro led with “Honey” for five weeks in 1968.


	(While no songs with “silver” in their names have led topped the Hot 100, “Fly, Robin, Fly” by Silver Convention did for three weeks in 1975.)


	Chappell Roan's “The Subway” rolls into the Hot 100 at No. 3, marking the singer-songwriter's highest career debut and rank as she earns her fourth top 10. All four have hit the top five: “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Pink Pony Club” each rose to No. 4 last September and this April, respectively, and “The Giver” entered at its No. 5 peak in March.


	“The Subway” tallied 25.1 million streams, 787,000 in airplay audience and 6,000 sold in its first full week of tracking (no pun intended), following its July 31 release as a recording. Chappell Roan premiered the song live during her Governors Ball set on June 7, 2024, and built buzz for it by playing it regularly in concert since.


	(The song becomes the highest charting Hot 100 hit with “subway” in its title. Petula Clark rode her classic “Don't Sleep in the Subway” to No. 5 in July 1967.)


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” drops to No. 2 on the Hot 100 after nine nonconsecutive weeks at No. 1 beginning in June. It claims an eighth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (73.6 million, essentially even) and an 11th week atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the survey made its seasonal return after Memorial Day.


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 3-4 on the Hot 100 after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It posts a 12th week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Justin Bieber's No. 2-peaking “Daisies” falls 4-5 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it debuted at its No. 2 high. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay for a second week (20.9 million, up 23%).


	Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” is steady at its No. 6 Hot 100 best, and Wallen's “Just in Case” descends 5-7 after reaching No. 2.


	Saja Boys, HUNTR/X's targets in KPop Demon Hunters, climb 9-8 for a new Hot 100 high with “Your Idol.”


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024 and closed as the year's No. 1 song, backtracks 7-9 as it adds a record-extending 103rd week on the chart overall and a record-boosting 73rd week in the top 10.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles 8-10, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning in July 2024.

Acura's stock just went up. 


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	Some people's dream car is a Lamborghini, others may want a Maybach, but MGK's daughter, Casie Baker, had her eye on an Acura.


	MGK Day in Cleveland wasn't just all about the artist (formerly known as Machine Gun Kelly) on Sunday (Aug. 10), as Kells surprised Casie with her dream car, an Acura TLX, just a couple of weeks after celebrating her 16th birthday in July.


	Footage of the heartwarming moment went viral on social media, while Casie seemed genuinely surprised at the gift when the black car rolled up with a red bow on it, as she jumped into her dad's arms.

	











	Before she hopped behind the driver's seat, MGK had one special rule for Casie to follow: Don't drive like the musician.


	“What's the No. 1 rule?” he asked, to which Casie swiftly replied, “Don't drive like your dad.” MGK nodded in approval and said, “Exactly — don't drive like me.” All that's left for Casie is to pass her upcoming driving test to secure a license.

	But the teen wasn't the only member of the family to receive a surprise on Sunday. At halftime of the Celebrity Shootout basketball game, MGK was presented with a guitar featuring a portrait his face that will forever live in the Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.


	It was yet another epic MGK Day weekend for the multi-genre artist and his fans. MGK capped off the memorable weekend with a headlining performance on the Mall C lawn, debuting tracks from his new album, Lost Americana, for the attendance.


Lost Americana arrived on Aug. 8, as MGK looks to make it three consecutive No. 1 albums atop the Billboard 200.

EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, A24 has acquired genre writer Ian Tuason‘s horror film The Undertone, securing worldwide rights following its July 27th premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival.

The Undertone stars Nina Kiri as Evy, a paranormal podcast host who returns home to care for her dying mother. Thereafter, she begins receiving recordings from a married couple plagued by strange noises in their house, pulling her into a spiral of fear and paranoia.

	











	In her description of the film for Fantasia Fest, programming director Carolyn Mauricette wrote, “Fans of SKINAMARINK and I AM THE PRETTY THING WHO LIVES IN THE HOUSE will love this slow-burn nightmare that will make hackles on your neck rise and your blood chill.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Butterfly nicely pairs propulsive action with family drama","https://www.avclub.com/butterfly-review-prime-video-tv","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

At first glance, Butterfly appears to be classic espionage fare. The basic narrative is that nine years after his presumed death, a top agent pops up and meets his now-adult daughter, who happens to be a highly skilled assassin employed by his former organization. And then the two go on the run together after realizing that they're being hunted by the one person they trusted the most. As they traipse around various parts of South Korea, David (Daniel Dae Kim) and Rebecca Jung (Reina Hardesty) reckon with their extremely fractured relationship while trying to uncover a large-scale conspiracy. The standard concept works here because of its well-paced execution at the hands of co-creators Ken Woodruff and Steph Cha, who adapt the show loosely from the 2015 graphic novel of the same name.   

The six episodes consistently depict the intensity of the danger that David and Rebecca are in through an assortment of shootouts, explosions, hand-to-hand fights, and a lot of running, not to mention the emotional potency of their reunion. Both of them struggle to reconnect and trust each other, which puts their survival at risk. They gradually fall into an affecting rhythm (think tearful outbursts, confessions, hugs, cooking meals, and reminiscing) that helps Butterfly hit the right balance between taut thriller and family drama. In that sense, the series is more in the vein of Prime Video's character-driven Mr. & Mrs. Smith than the streamer's generic offerings like Citadel and The Terminal List. 

Butterfly also has actual fun with its premise, as evidenced in the opening scene alone, wherein David croons The Killers' “Mr. Brightside” in a karaoke room while tracking down Rebecca on the side. (ABBA's “Dancing Queen” plays later during a cool fight scene.) This sets up a serious yet buoyant tone that is sustained for most of the show. A lot of the heavy lifting to achieve that is done by Kim and Hardesty, nimble performers who believably juggle their characters' iciness and sincere attempts to warm up to each other. 

The desire to mend their bond comes easiest to David. He faked his death but was always waiting for the day when he could see his daughter again. Unfortunately for the Jungs, his reentry into her life wreaks total havoc and unearths long-buried secrets that could expose some powerful people. For David, the risk is worth the reward if it means he can finally be with Rebecca and keep her safe—except his kid isn't 14 anymore and doesn't need the protection of someone who doesn't know her. (“Do you drink?” David asks her after they've caused a nationwide manhunt, shot at cops, and escaped a hired gunman.) Rebecca's grown into a badass hit woman who, in his absence, has turned into a bit of a sociopath. Something she loves to do is laugh out loud whenever she's confronted with trauma and instability, a tiny but effective detail that paints a picture of how she copes with—or rather avoids—grief.  



Rebecca has spent her formative years being raised by David's ex-colleague, Juno (Piper Perabo), with whom he co-founded a secret organization to provide intel to political figures and intelligence agencies back in the day. Unfortunately, Juno is a master manipulator who groomed Rebecca into the cold-blooded killer that she is now. Thankfully, Rebecca's heart starts to thaw slightly when she comes face-to-face with the parent who she thought was long gone. They force each other to confront hard truths, especially when Rebecca learns what David has been doing for roughly a decade and struggles to forgive him for abandoning her. This potent push and pull drives the momentum more than any of the show's predictable suspense. 

It's a treat to watch Kim and Hardesty sink their teeth into their characters' tumultuous, moving dynamic (or a “fucked-up daddy-daughter adventure,” as Rebecca puts it). The actors bring a level of restraint to their work because David and Rebecca are trained not to express their vulnerabilities. So it's even more impactful whenever their feelings slip through the cracks and they communicate openly (and throw in a few taunts and sarcastic comments for good measure). The espionage aspects are engrossing on their own, although the twists can be seen coming from a mile away (mostly because of how straightforwardly Perabo plays her villainous arc). The show also features brief but notable turns by Squid Game‘s Park Hae-soo and Top Gun: Maverick‘s Charles Parnell. (There are a couple of Lost Easter eggs as well.) 

Impressively, the series isn't saddled with myriad subplots like a lot of ones in this genre. There are no boyfriend distractions for Rebecca, while David's love life and Juno's family factor into the show's main arc neatly. With a tight focus and impressive performances, Butterfly‘s basic spycraft story feels both elevated and entertaining.  

Butterfly premieres August 13 on Prime Video

On Sunday's episode of Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver observed that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a.k.a.

Cain has lately taken advantage of a general interest in Superman (a character he played nearly 30 years ago) to claw his way back into the zeitgeist—or at least adjacent to the zeitgeist. He generated some headlines for calling the latest Superman too woke and capitalized on the attention by announcing he was going to join ICE, which some out there (not us, you understand, but some) are calling extreme loser behavior. “Although, on the plus side, no need for that guy to wear a mask because the chances of anyone recognizing him are fucking zero,” Oliver snarked on his show. 

Dean Cain, who presented himself in an ICE recruitment video as a “sworn law enforcement officer as well as a filmmaker,” responded to the jabs on Twitter/X with a few crying-laughing emojis. “He stole that mask joke from the internet—and he also laughed hysterically when Trump said he was going to run for President. Case closed.” Unclear which case Cain was making or how he closed it, but okay. He also defended The Dog Who Saved… series by protesting that “those movies were sweet, by the way!” 

Oliver had bigger fish to fry than a handful of B-movies. During the segment dedicated to immigration under Donald Trump's administration, the comedian shared with his audience what to do if you're approached by ICE agents. “Attorneys told us the only two things you should say to them are: ‘Am I free to leave?' And ‘I want to speak to a lawyer.' That's it. You have the right to remain silent,” Oliver explained. “And I recognize that in some cases you may be unable to help yourself from saying, ‘Didn't you used to be Superman?' ‘I thought you died.' ‘I can't believe I'm meeting a filmmaker.' But that really is it.” You can watch the full video below.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","VIDEO: Nelly Furtado Embracing Her Beauty at Any Size","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/nelly-furtado-embracing-beauty-transformation/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 15:26:14 GMT","

Nelly Furtado is fully embracing her changing body, and no one can deny that she's doing it with confidence. The 46-year-old singer has been showing off her self-assured, body-positive attitude at recent concerts, and fans have been loving it.

In a recent video posted to her Instagram, the Timbaland collaborator is wearing a leather, fringed bodysuit, knee-high boots, and a fluffy white faux fur coat. As the Grammy-winning singer rocked out on stage, she radiated sex appeal.

A post shared by All Together Now (@alltogethernow.ie)

“She looks freaking amazing!” one fan wrote. “Big or small u still got it girl,” another commented.

“Lord have mercy!” wrote an excited fan. “I love the thickness she got on her now!”

While there were negative comments, most of the Canadian singer's fans were impressed not only with her commanding posture but also with her performance.

“Show of hands, who had literally NO CLUE how completely INCREDIBLE Nelly Furtado was going to be???” wrote one amazed ATN Festival attendee. “Completely blown away. Iconic status achieved.”

A post shared by Nelly Furtado (@nellyfurtado)

At the beginning of 2025, the “Fly Like a Bird” singer posted makeup-free and filter-free bathing suit photos on Instagram. She spoke out about the expectations she realized people had around what she looked like.

“Have a body neutral 2025,” she began her caption. “But most importantly, love with every inch of your heart. Thanks for all the memories this year.”

“This year I became aware of the aesthetic pressure of my work in a brand new way, while simultaneously I experienced new levels of self-love and genuine confidence from within,” she continued.”

A post shared by Nelly Furtado (@nellyfurtado)

She revealed that she'd had to take “some legal action” against some people who were selling services and products “based on selling health and beauty myths” about her.

“For whoever cares, I have never had any face or body surgeries or augmentation, besides for veneers on the top row of my teeth, quite recently,” she went on. While she used serums and creams and got facials, “so far, I have not had any face or lip injections or fillers of any kind.”

She claimed the secret to looking amazing for red carpets and photo shoots was simple. A bit of face and body tape, makeup, and making sure that “I drink a lot of water and sleep on my back.”

Her optimistic message for 2025 was to “express yourself freely, celebrate your individuality and know that it's perfectly OK to be OK with what you see in the mirror, and it's also OK to want something different.”

“We are all cute little humans just bouncing around the earth looking for hugs,” she added.

In Korean writer/director Park Syeyoung's 2022 debut feature, “The Fifth Thoracic Vertebra,” mold on an abandoned mattress births a parasitic creature that feasts on the vertebrae of any humans it touches. The film enters more unpredictable, oddly moving territory than its B-movie-like premise may initially suggest, but that basic logline wouldn't feel out of place amongst the demonizing government propaganda that recurs throughout Park's compelling follow-up feature, “The Fin,” in which even the lightest physical contact with a minority group is portrayed as being life-threatening. Don't let certain parts of them touch you or you'll get infected. Don't let them scream because the sound will kill you.Unlike a mattress monster that actually feeds on people, the othered beings in Park's second ostensible creature feature are recognizably human, even if the wider population is encouraged not to perceive them that way. Set in a speculative, post-unification Korea, “The Fin” tracks the relationship between brainwashed citizens and the underclass they've been trained to hate — and also to exploit.As a result of ecological devastation, a section of the Korean population — we're given little sense of how the rest of the world is doing — has undergone mutations that bring them closer to merfolk of legend. Known as Omegas, these mutated humans have fins and unusual feet, but otherwise look the same as the rest of their countrymen. To pass without hassle in Korea's various colonies, Omegas might cut off parts of their feet or fins, or conceal these appendages with prosthetics made by the rare “normal” person sympathetic to their plight. Any Omega discovered within a colony's borders is arrested to be exiled beyond the wall, or terminated on sight in cases where a trigger-happy government worker thinks their life is threatened by an Omega simply shouting.The non-mutated population is fed the suggestion that Omegas' screams are lethal outside of water, that their fins are full of toxins, and that when they die, they release radiation. The accuracy of all that remains fairly ambiguous across Park's film, but the belief drives the structure of society. In the case of East Colony 114, however, some Omegas are permitted to live around the beaches and cliffs just beyond The Great Wall, as long as they serve as the workforce to clean the polluted oceans.Within the colony, clean water is a precious commodity. Citizens are encouraged to reduce bathing for the greater good. Among the dirty-faced population, nostalgia for the sea and fishing becomes something that enterprising business owners can exploit. The film's opening narration draws on memories of water, infusing exposition about the dystopia with a personal touch. “They said the ocean used to be blue,” the voice of a young woman tells us. “They said many people died. My first memory is of a blood-red sky. Black raindrops fell onto my lips. Drop. Drop. Drop. They tasted bitter, and I was sick all night. Father spent the night coughing as well. And then Father disappeared.”Accompanying those words is a montage of photographs of people standing with fishing hauls of various sizes, with all of the human faces curiously blurred out. Eventually, we get to a photo that disrupts that formula: one where most faces remain blurred, except for that of a little girl. As this final photo in the montage starts to dissolve from view, a close-up of a young adult woman's face gradually appears in the center of the frame. This will turn out to be the grown version of both the narrator and the little girl who stuck out in the photograph. Named Mia (Yeji Yeon, “Pachinko”), she will be sought out by both an unnamed Omega (Goh-Woo), infiltrating East Colony 114 with a mission to find her and deliver a severed fin, and Sujin (Pureum Kim), a novice government recruit in the taskforce that both checks up on Omega workers collecting waste over the wall and hunts down anyone suspected of abnormalities.

Through Sujin, Park explores the mindset of someone following orders but beginning to doubt the state's ideology, and the subsequent contagion of fear that has infected so many in such unpleasant ways —  a notion that will prove all too timely in a good number of the countries where the film may be released. Sujin's ailing mother barely speaks, but when she does, it's mainly to spit venom at the mere mention of Omegas, suggesting that they should all be killed. Mia, meanwhile, represents the inner conflicts of the assimilated “other.” She passes by keeping elements of her identity a secret, buys into at least parts of the propaganda targeting the minority group she's secretly from, and is openly hostile when coming face-to-face with someone from that group reaching out to her.Patient in its pacing, “The Fin” is an engrossing mood piece rather than a dystopian tale based around constant clashes, even though the threat of violence is always looming. Like in “The Fifth Thoracic Vertebra,” Park, once again serving as his own cinematographer, gets a lot of mileage out of a strange kind of intimacy achieved through characters unwittingly being observed from a distance, be it through slightly open doors or high up from above. The wider aesthetic favors hazy saturation, the colors of city streets and the outside wilderness — each dead zones in their own way — at times recalling a post-apocalyptic touchstone like Konstantin Lopushansky's “Visitor to a Museum,” and in other places, Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson's recent collaborations like “The Forbidden Room.”As an independent production, “The Fin” is largely effective in its expressionistic solutions to budgetary limitations, with a pleasing tactility to the practical effects on display. That said, there is one dubious shortcut that leaves a sour taste in the mouth: Early in the movie, we're shown a government propaganda video about The Great Wall and the unified Korea. It's a propaganda ad in an explicitly dystopian story, so it's obviously supposed to make you feel unpleasant, but there's something a little off about the imagery and motion in these brief clips; an uncanny quality inherent to poor simulacra of real art direction.Then we reach one of the longest clips in the propaganda video and the depressing explanation becomes apparent. A shot of the backs of several yellow-jacketed figures looking at a faraway statue only lasts a few seconds, but within that time, many of the still figures warp shape. Some “people” blur together, while others see the lower halves of their legs suddenly separate from the rest of their bodies. If you've been unlucky enough to have working eyes in the past few years, you'll recognize this as unmistakably an example of generative AI being used instead of real footage being shot. With all due respect to the pressures of making an unconventional sci-fi film on a tight budget, using ecologically destructive technology for a story of ecological devastation, in which clean water is an increasingly rare resource, adds an unintentionally grim layer of irony to the tale.

[Editor's Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Gilded Age” Season 3, Episode 8, “My Mind Is Made Up,” including the ending.]

It starts, as it often should, with Audra McDonald.

Her “Gilded Age” character, Dorothy Scott, is trying on a dress for the upcoming Newport ball — feeling quite pleased with her lovely embroidered roses — when her archenemy, Mrs. Kirkland (Phylicia Rashad), strides into the fitting room to ruin her day. All season, in fact, Mrs. Kirkland has made a habit of spoiling Dorothy's fun. One might even say she savors it, and this day is no different.

 










The haughty mother of Dr. William Kirkland (Jordan Donica) feigns surprise that Mrs. Scott and her daughter, Peggy (Denée Brown), are still attending the ball. By Mrs. Kirkland's assessment (which is all that matters), the unmarried Scott should feel too ashamed for “duping” her son, Dr. Kirkland, to allow herself the pleasure of a fancy night out. “I had hoped Peggy would do the respectable thing and send her regrets,” Mrs. Kirkland says.

That does it. That is it. With the camel's back broken, Dorothy Scott, summoning all her righteous indignation (and channeled with maybe one-third of Audra McDonald's extraordinary talent, which is still enough to power the city of Manhattan), lets the snobby scold have it. “Perhaps you should get off your high horse,” Dorothy spits. “You have enjoyed a certain kind of privilege amongst our people here at Newport that has created an illusion for you — the kind that has allowed you to act without grace, manners, and impunity.”

Each word snaps off like a foot colliding firmly in Mrs. Kirkland's rump, forcing the typically uncontested aggressor to stand down. Sure, she tries to preserve a sense of superiority before she flees, reminding her suddenly effusive enemy that, no matter what accusations Dorothy tosses her way, Dr. Kirkland now knows better than to make Ms. Scott into a Mrs. The malevolent mother's whisper campaign did the trick. The Kirklands will win the long game, as the wealthy so often do, and the Scotts will have to sit there and take it, as is their lot in life.

Well, to paraphrase Cynthia Nixon's Ada later in the episode: “Societies change, bitch!”

Dr. Kirkland loves Peggy, he doesn't care about her past, and he tells his mother as much. Joined by his irate father, Frederick (Brian Stokes Mitchell), the good doctor chastises Mrs. Kirkland for spreading gossip and sullying Peggy's honest reputation. Then the patriarch puts his foot down. “WOMAN,” Frederick bellows. “You are not above reproach. You have sewn calamity and heartbreak — and this is not the first time. It stops now.”

 










Hell yes, Papa Kirkland! Get her ass! 

…OK, let's hit pause on the outrage for a second. It kind of sucks that only the men's admonishment matters here, especially since Dorothy delivers the very same message, and does so with greater purpose and passion. But hey, it's “The Gilded Age.” That's just how things work. At least Mrs. Kirkland gets what she deserves, and everything works out between Dr. William Kirkland and the future Mrs. Peggy Kirkland.

The same good fortune — and just comeuppance — also graces Ms. Charlotte Drayton (Hannah Shealy) and her mother, Mrs. Caroline Astor (Donna Murphy), respectively. The former host of the annual ball at first rejects a precedent-breaking invitation on behalf of Charlotte, her daughter, whose divorce is the very reason Mrs. Astor forfeited hosting duties to begin with.

“We cannot allow the scourge of divorce to infect the social circles we hold dear,” Mrs. Astor says. “If you receive them, it will become an epidemic, and I cannot be part of that.”

Except, she does become a part of that, choosing to attend the ball despite her daughter's scandalous appearance and her own promises to stay home. Bertha (Carrie Coon), ever the gracious host, only makes Mrs. Astor eat a morsel of crow when she slinks into the foyer, choosing instead to bask in one more season-ending victory over Old Money. (The opera house was only the beginning.)

 










And yet, Bertha's basking doesn't last. 

As the Newport Ball ends in picture-perfect fashion, Bertha tells George (Morgan Spector), “I just want what's best for us all.” And doesn't that sentiment sound familiar? Is that why George gives her a look of curious consideration when he should be expressing satisfied acknowledgement? Amid the Russells' latest victory lap, is something [gasp] amiss? 

Let's trace the echo back, shall we? What kicked off mid-revelry near the end of Episode 8 resounds all the way back to Episode 7, “Ex-Communicated,” when Larry (Harry Richardson) accused Bertha of meddling in his relationship with Marian (Louisa Jacobson).

“You must understand, I only want what's best for you,” Bertha says. “You want what's best for you,” her indignant (and misguided) son snaps back. “And if it doesn't suit your plan, you seek to destroy it.”

Earlier in the finale, the Astors shared a similar exchange. 

“Charlotte, I am trying to protect you,” Mrs. Astor says, regarding her daughter's presence at the ball. “No, mother,” Charlotte says. “As usual, you are just trying to protect yourself.”

And before that — the scene directly preceding it, in fact — Mrs. Kirkland tells Mr. Kirkland, “I just did what I thought was right.” To which he pointedly replies, “For whom?”

 










Children squaring off with their parents. The future battling for its freedom from the past. These are the wars raging in “The Gilded Age” Season 3 finale, and each brouhaha ends with happy children and positive progress. Peggy and Dr. Kirkland are engaged. Charlotte gets to attend the ball while maintaining her place in high society. Even Larry and Marian dance the night away, rekindling a romance no one outside of themselves gives two shits about.

But among the mourning mothers so deservedly and thoroughly embarrassed, one doesn't warrant the fate thrust upon her. One isn't a rightly vanquished intruder, but a wrongly abandoned victim. And while Bertha would never allow such a disparaging designation (she is, after all, impervious to her enemies' attacks), she's stuck with it anyway. She is yet another controlling matriarch scorned, and even though she knows her plans were proactive and important, she's devastated to discover her husband doesn't see them that way.

What separates Bertha from the bad moms in the rest of the episode (because, yes, she can be a bad mom sometimes) is both simple and systemic: It's misogyny. The Russell couple has always existed as two arms made to climb the ladder of American power. George's right hand commands the business realm, while Bertha's left hand guides the social circles. Both are needed to move up: Without George's money, Bertha couldn't outspend her opponents or hold court with dukes and duchesses. But without Bertha's savvy understanding of polite society, George wouldn't be able to court critical clients outside the office, sustain essential relationships, or properly position his family for upward mobility.

 










But what becomes horrifically clear in the Season 3 finale's twist ending is that TV's hottest power couple isn't who we thought they were. It's not just that they're fighting. It's that they don't respect each other — not equally — which is the fuel to their fiery alliance, for viewers and for the Russells themselves.

The next morning, after the ball, Bertha is shocked to learn her husband is still pissed. She thought she'd repaired whatever he believed was broken in the family — making things right with their daughter, proving she had nothing to do with her son's relationship struggles (like he needs any help), and throwing another goddamn perfect party — but George is still unsure.

“I don't blame you for being ruthless. I admire it. It's what we share,” he says. “But I'm ruthless in business, not with the people I love.”

“And I'm ruthless for the people I love, can you not see that?” Bertha shouts in stunned disbelief.

No, he cannot see the truth. For he is a man, and men are idiots. (I speak from first-hand experience.) George is happy to stomach the risk of bankrupting his family in order to realize his big railroad dreams; he's even happy to consider killing his own workers, one by one, if they continue striking for a living wage and safe working conditions (how dare they?); he's happy to hazard all sorts of financial, moral, and familial losses if it means making money, but he cannot stomach the temporary unhappiness of a daughter on her wedding day. 

 










At episode's end, he's still complaining that Bertha “forced [Gladys] into a marriage,” even when Gladys herself isn't complaining! She's happy! He's seen that she's happy! And why did he get to see his daughter being so happy, back in New York, reunited with her family? Oh yeah, because Bertha threw a perfect fucking ball again, no thanks to you, George. Gladys even tries to tell her parents she's pregnant, but George has already fucked off back to work before he can hear the good news. 

And thus, Season 3 ends on Bertha's devastated expression. She gazes out the window at a partner she can't recognize anymore — not after all his previous claims toward respecting her role in their marriage have been proven empty (or, at least, clueless) — but she's not angry. Not yet. Yes, she could exact her revenge in whatever ways she sees fit, probably before his carriage gets to the office. Yes, it would be a well-earned comeuppance, given how desperately she's tried to get her husband to honor her perspective all season. And yes, he's fallen catastrophically short. 

We've seen in Season 3 that women can now, at the turn of the 20th century, survive the once-fatal blow of divorce and other such scandals. What's left for Season 4 to decide is whether Bertha can survive a broken heart.

Naeem, the artist formerly known as Spank Rock, has revived his own alter ego for a new song, “Bankroll Peelers.” The track, credited to Naeem featuring Spank Rock, also has contributions from producers Sam Greens, Noah Beresin, and Matti Free, as well as Arctic Monkeys drummer Matt Helders, who sings backing vocals in the chorus. Check it out below.

Naeem said in press materials, “Spank Rock is the Goat! Actually, he's not the goat; he's a Coyote, Monkey, Loki, or Eshu. Instead of feeling at odds creatively with my past and where I want to go, I invited my younger self back into the room. Spank Rock's ephemeral energy rearranged the order of things. Personally, I feel like I'm more risk-adverse than Spank Rock is. It's fun to work with someone who doesn't care how people perceive him. I would love for music to be surprising again.”

A release party for the single, at Los Angeles' Silverlake Lounge this Thursday, August 14, will feature a Naeem performance as Spank Rock and a DJ set, plus sets from Noah Beresin, Gloworm, Glassface, and Mucky. Naeem released his sole post–Spank Rock album to date, Startisha, back in 2020.

All the Reasons Swifties Think Something Big Is Coming","https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/is-taylor-swift-teasing-new-era-fan-theories-new-heights-1235404879/","Mon, 11 Aug 2025 16:36:29 GMT","

Taylor Swift has caught the attention of the most elite investigative team the world has ever seen: The Swifties. The singer sent fans into overdrive on Monday, after several social media posts appeared to point to Swift teasing her next era. Seemingly back to her masterminding and easter egg-dropping ways, both Taylor Nation and the New Heights podcast page shared similar cryptic posts that fans think hint at an upcoming announcement.


	Taylor Nation, an official branch of the pop superstar's marketing team, posted a series of photos from the Eras Tour where Swift is perhaps not-so-coincidentally wearing orange in every shot. And to be even more specific, the carousel included 12 photos — leading fans to believe it's a nod to the singer's next album, which would be her 12th release. But it was the caption that really sent Swifties spiraling: “Thinking about when she said ‘See you next era… ,” Taylor Nation wrote. Of course, this is a callback to The Eras Tour book, where Swift signed off on her personal intro with that exact phrase, hinting at her next move.

	At the same exact time Monday morning, in what would ostensibly be another corner of the internet, Travis and Jason Kelce's New Heights podcast teased their upcoming guest on their social media accounts. Swifties were quick to spot that the blacked out guest looked like a shadow of the singer. Additionally, eagle-eyed fans took note of the orange background, which matched the orange pictures Taylor Nation posted (and isn't the usual yellow background the New Heights podcast uses for thumbnails). In the teaser photo, the football stars both seem to be sporting Swift's merchandise — and just like clockwork, the dominoes cascaded in a line for Swiftie's TS12 theories.

92%ers, we're coming back early for a special episode with a VERY special guestNew episode Wednesday 7PM ET pic.twitter.com/dJW2KdDeFP


	In May, Swift rocked the music industry with an announcement that was not about new music, but rather that she had finally gained back the master recordings to her first six albums. The singer shared the news in a letter on her website. “I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but never owned until now,” she wrote. Swift didn't end off the celebratory news with any cryptic message, but some fans noted that one word had 12 additional letters and was a nod to her 12th recording.


	Of course, in typical Swift fashion, this could all amount to nothing — but that's not nearly as fun as believing that this week could bring some major news to the Swiftie world. Even if there is an announcement, it still might not even be an album. It could literally be anything…or nothing! Either way, with Swift's newfound freedom, the groundwork has been laid for her next move, and possibly, a new era.

	On Monday morning, Florence Welch posted a video of herself digging a hole and yelling in it… First of all, relatable. Second of all, does this mean new music?


	Welch posted a cryptic video of herself in a red dress in heels digging a hole in the ground with a dagger, before taking deep breaths and yelling into it three times as if she were escaping a killer in a horror film. Aside from comments like “Girl, same,” many Florence + the Machine fans speculated that the post may be teasing the arrival of new music from the group.

A post shared by Florence Welch (@florence)


	If new music is truly on the way, it'll be the first release from the group since 2022's Dance Fever, which marked Florence and the Machine‘s fifth LP. That project was postponed by two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album featured songs such as “King,” “My Love,” and Free,” and earned a “Complete Edition” the following year. The band toured that record in 2022 and 2023 for their last run of the era.

	President Donald Trump announced Monday he is placing Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, and is deploying the National Guard in the city, insisting the action was necessary “to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.” He said this would be “Liberation Day” for D.C. 


	“The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled,” Trump said Monday, contradicting figures that the U.S. attorney released earlier this year showing a downward trajectory for these crimes. Car thefts were even year over year, and armed carjackings are down 53 percent. 


	As recently as January, the Department of Justice was touting the fact that violent crime in Washington D.C. “is the lowest it has been in over 30 years.”


	“I'm officially invoking section 740 of the district of Columbia home rule act,” Trump said Monday, referring to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which contains a provision that authorizes the president to temporarily seize control of the police in the case of an emergency for 48 hours at a time. “I'm placing the D.C. Metropolitan police department under direct federal control.” The move to bring in the National Guard came from a presidential memo signed earlier this morning. 

	











	From the White House podium, Trump alluded to the idea that police will be emboldened by the changes. “They love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform,” he said, apparently referring to protesters. “The police are standing and they're told, ‘Don't do anything under any circumstances.' And you can see they want to get at it. And they're standing there and people are spitting in their face, and they're not allowed to do anything. But now they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” 

	











	The most prominent recent example of protesters attacking law enforcement in Washington D.C. is probably Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of President Trump rioted outside the Capitol building. One hundred and forty police officers were injured in the incident, and one of those injured officers, Brian Sicknick, later died. Trump, however, focused on violence perpetrated by individuals who are under 18, as well as disbanding homeless encampments within the city.

	On Monday, Trump suggested he may seek to deploy the National Guard to other cities as he did to Los Angeles in June, following protests against Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raids. He mentioned Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore and Oakland. 


	“We have other cities also that are bad,” Trump said. “We're not going to let it happen. We're not going to lose our cities over this. And this will go further. We're starting very strongly with D.C., and we're going to clean it up real quick, very quickly.”


	Trump's announcement that the federal government would take control of D.C.'s police force was preceded by an incident involving Edward Coristine, a former DOGE staffer known by his online alias “Big Balls.” Coristine, who still works for the Social Security Administration, was injured in an attempted carjacking.

	Coristine, Trump said Monday, “was left dripping in blood. He thought he was dead with a broken nose and concussion.”


	Trump's announcement came the same morning that a judge rejected a Department of Justice request to unseal grand jury testimony given in the case against Jeffrey Epstein. The embattled president has been trying to contain the continuing fallout from the Department of Justice's announcement last month that it would give no further disclosures in the Epstein case. Many on social media decried the move in D.C. as a distraction from the case. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Justice Department informed Trump in May that his name was repeatedly mentioned in the Epstein files. Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing.

	For seven years, Jon Batiste watched Stephen Colbert lead The Late Show night after night. The musician began serving as bandleader on the series with his house band Stay Human in 2015 and held the position through 2022. Now, Colbert is on his way out, too, following the cancellation of The Late Show. The musician is confident that his former colleague and collaborator will land on his feet


	“I'm very grateful to him and I think where he goes next, his voice won't be silenced,” Batiste told Rolling Stone AU/NZ in a recent interview. “The voice of free speech is challenge, but the soul of an individual cannot be cancelled. He's gonna find another megaphone, another outlet, I'm sure of it. I'm rooting for him.”


	When CBS announced in July that the late-night talk show would conclude in May 2026, it cited financial issues at the network as an explanation. “It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount,” CBS wrote in its statement at the time, though many have speculated that the move was related to the recent merger between parent company Paramount and Skydance.

	The $8 billion merger, which closed last week after over a year of delays, required approval from the Trump administration. Donald Trump celebrated CBS' decision to axe the show, saying, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.” During a recent musical segment on The Late Show, Weird Al Yankovic and Lin-Manuel Miranda parodied the CEO affair at a Coldplay concert with an animated rendering of Trump cuddling up with the Paramount logo.

	











	“What happened to my friend Stephen is a symptom of big money,” Batiste said. “We're in a time where the right price can silence the voice of free speech, which we should be very, very conscious of. As artists, we have to constantly fight for free speech and fight for the ability to be able to share the authentic truth of our being.”

	In a recent op-ed for Rolling Stone, Lizz Winstead, who worked with Colbert on a segment when she was co-creator and head writer of The Daily Show, wrote, “Stephen isn't expensive. He's a threat. A wildly popular, truth-telling comic with moral clarity is dangerous in this moment. Especially when he's white, male, and too influential to be dismissed as fringe … Knowing Stephen and his values, I don't think we're at risk of losing his voice. I hope he takes his brilliance somewhere he has full creative control. We need him, and we need the brilliance of every political comic still brave enough to speak out.”

Timothy Gallaudet—former Chief Oceanographer of the U.S. Navy—believes the U.S. government should study “unidentified submersible objects.”

USOs are similar to UFOs, but sighted in the world's oceans.

The retired rear admiral claims that these USOs could be a threat to maritime security.

A retired U.S. Navy admiral believes that the government should look to the oceans to help solve a mystery in the skies. Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, former Oceanographer of the U.S. Navy, cited a 2019 sighting by a Navy warship as evidence that the phenomena of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified submersible objects (USOs) are linked.

The sighting, recorded off the coast of San Diego, involved a hovering spherical object that appeared to abruptly enter the water.

Gallaudet made the case for studying underwater UFOs, or what the government calls unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), in a recent paper titled, “Beneath the Surface: We May Learn More about UAP by Looking in the Ocean.” Gallaudet writes that “transmedium” USOs and UAPs, defined as unidentified objects that appear to travel both in the atmosphere and the water, “jeopardize U.S. maritime security.” The retired rear admiral makes the case that the under-surveyed underwater realm is a threat to maritime security—the oceans form the bedrock of international trade and the American economy, and are where the U.S. Navy operates.

Gallaudet argues that the lack of knowledge about the undersea world poses hazards for submarines such as collisions with other submarines—such as the independent crashes of the submarines USS San Francisco and USS Connecticut, both of which were incidents that resulted in severe damage to the ships and one crew fatality—and undetected underwater seamounts. Further study of this realm, he believes, could shed additional light on these UFO/UAP sightings.

One incident to which Gallaudet points in particular is a July 19, 2019 encounter between the Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Omaha and a so-called transmedium UAP. In the incident, the crew of the Omaha (sailing off the coast of San Diego) used their AN/KAX-2 electro-optical sensor to record a spherical UAP hovering just over the surface of the Pacific Ocean. The AN/KAX-2 is a stabilized sensor turret built for maritime environments that includes a digital video camera, night vision camera, and laser rangefinder.

The video, seen here, is a recording of a screen showing the output of the AN/KAX-2. The video appears to have been taken with the night vision camera, which uses imaging infrared to record objects in darkness. The object seemingly moves, tracked by the sensor operator, and then stops to hover. The object stops and hovers a short distance above the surface of the ocean. At the end, the object disappears, with sailors remarking that it made a splash as it entered the water. Meanwhile, one sailor off camera radios the other ships in the area—the guided missile destroyers Pinckney, Kidd, and Rafael Peralta—asking for a MH-60 helicopter to be launched as soon as possible. 

The video was leaked to UFO investigator Jeremy Corbell Lockyer, and was later verified as genuine by the Navy. A search of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (the Pentagon's web site for releasing official photos and video) shows three of the warships in the encounter—Pinckney, Kidd, and Omaha—in formation in the Eastern Pacific six days later, on July 25.

Gallaudet also references another sighting from 2013, spotted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol personnel. The sighting—which took place near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico—was filmed using a similar imaging infrared camera. The video, shown here, depicts another spherical object appearing to enter the water and then re-emerge without losing any speed. The retired admiral writes, “Over three minutes, the object appears to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 miles per hour, enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum underwater velocity of 95 miles per hour, and at one point split into two parts before entering the water again.”

Other possible evidence cited by the admiral includes an incident in 2022, in which the NOAA underwater exploration ship Okeanos Explorer discovered an unusual series of holes on the North Atlantic seafloor at a depth of 1.6 miles. The centimeter-sized holes were in an unusually straight line and scientists are apparently at a loss to explain their origin.

Gallaudet entered the U.S. Navy in 1989 after attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Gallaudet, according to his official biography, received “masters and doctoral degrees in oceanography from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1991 and 2001 respectively.” He served with a number of naval oceanography and meteorology commands, and was superintendent of the U.S. Naval Observatory. He assumed command of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command in 2014, and served as Oceanographer of the Navy from 2016 until retirement in 2017.

After his Navy career, Gallaudet served for two years as acting administrator in charge of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Today, he sits on the advisory board for Americans for Safe Aerospace, which describes itself as a “nonprofit organization dedicated to aerospace safety and national security with a focus on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).” ASA is led by Ryan Graves, a former U.S. naval aviator who reports having his own UAP sighting on active duty in 2014. In a 2023 op-ed published in The Hill, Gallaudet called UAPs the “story of the century,” and clearly did not rule out an extraterrestrial cause for them.

It's rare for a high-ranking U.S. military officer to directly address UAP issues, even in retirement, and the incidents Gallaudet calls attention to are unusual, to say the least. Barring flat-out hoaxing by military and civilian government personnel, the videos and photographic evidence are not easily explained. Whether this will result in greater research to the same extent as the UFO/UAP issue remains to be seen.

The existence of UFOs has long been an ongoing debate and marked with scepticism, but you may want to hear what this whistleblower has to claim about the US government's knowledge regarding this phenomenon.

A recent Capitol Hill hearing is what has rekindled talks around Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the potential of extraterrestrial life.

In the UAP briefing in May, physicist Dr Eric Davis - who is well known for working on top-secret Pentagon projects - captured listeners' attention by claiming there are four different types of aliens that have a possibility of being operators of unidentified crafts.

The four distinct alien types he claims are 'Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians'.

Advert

So, what are the distinct differences between each of these claimed alien types? I'm glad you asked.

The idea of Grays took popularity in the mid-1960s, mainly due to the famous abduction case of Betty and Barney Hill. The couple said the abduction was performed by small humanoids with smooth grey skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and had a lack of typical human features like noses or ears.

Nordics, on the other hand, are described as tall, slender beings, similar to Scandinavian humans, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and light skin.

Advert

Insectoids, as the name suggests, are described as having more insect-like traits like multiple limbs, exoskeletons, mandibles, and sometimes antennae.

Lastly, the Reptilian theory - this was popular in the late 20th century through conspiracy theorist David Icke and claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens.

Missouri Representative Eric Burlison, a member of the House Oversight Committee and UAP caucus, shared on The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher that he had heard these same four classifications in private discussions.

“I've heard those four classifications discussed in meetings in this office by others,” Burlison said. “But what I wasn't expecting was for him to say it. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that.”

Advert

However, a self-claimed sceptic, Burlison admitted that he was uncertain about Davis' sources.

He noted that the physicist's comments may come from firsthand knowledge or secondhand reports, indicating uncertainty, saying: ""If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment. But if it is true, the government has no right to keep such a secret from the public it serves.""

However, he is aware that the acknowledgement of there being a possibility of aliens could invite more scepticism.

Advert

""Some will think we're nuts,"" Burlison acknowledged. But he defended the investigation, stating that taxpayers help to fund Pentagon, intelligence, and energy department programs studying UAPs.

""I owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this,"" he said.

A24 has come out on top of a competitive bidding war for The Undertone, securing worldwide rights to the debut feature from Toronto-based writer/director Ian Tuason.

Per Deadline, who reported the news earlier today, a deal was made for 7 figures with A24 beating six other buyers to the hot horror title that's been recommended for fans of Skinamarink and I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives In The House.

Starring Nina Kiri (The Handmaid's Tale),The Undertone follows Evy, a paranormal podcast host who returns home to care for her dying mother. Thereafter, she begins receiving recordings from a married couple plagued by strange noises in their house, pulling her into a spiral of fear and paranoia.

The Undertone had its premiere at Fantasia Film Festival earlier this year, where programming director Carolyn Mauricette called it a “slow-burn nightmare that will make hackles on your neck rise and your blood chill.”

Per Deadline, The Undertone was produced by Dan Slater for Slaterverse Pictures and Cody Calahan for Black Fawn Films. Exec producers include Steven Schneider and Roy Lee (It, Weapons) for Spooky Pictures, Chad Archibald for Black Fawn Films, Brit MacRae and Daril Fannin for Kino Studios, and DimensionGate.

Look out for more on The Undertone as we get it!

The existence of UFOs has long been an ongoing debate and marked with scepticism, but you may want to hear what this whistleblower has to claim about the US government's knowledge regarding this phenomenon.

A recent Capitol Hill hearing is what has rekindled talks around Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the potential of extraterrestrial life.

In the UAP briefing in May, physicist Dr Eric Davis - who is well known for working on top-secret Pentagon projects - captured listeners' attention by claiming there are four different types of aliens that have a possibility of being operators of unidentified crafts.

The four distinct alien types he claims are 'Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians'.

So, what are the distinct differences between each of these claimed alien types? I'm glad you asked.

The idea of Grays took popularity in the mid-1960s, mainly due to the famous abduction case of Betty and Barney Hill. The couple said the abduction was performed by small humanoids with smooth grey skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and had a lack of typical human features like noses or ears.

Nordics, on the other hand, are described as tall, slender beings, similar to Scandinavian humans, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and light skin.

Insectoids, as the name suggests, are described as having more insect-like traits like multiple limbs, exoskeletons, mandibles, and sometimes antennae.

Lastly, the Reptilian theory - this was popular in the late 20th century through conspiracy theorist David Icke and claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens.

Missouri Representative Eric Burlison, a member of the House Oversight Committee and UAP caucus, shared on The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher that he had heard these same four classifications in private discussions.

“I've heard those four classifications discussed in meetings in this office by others,” Burlison said. “But what I wasn't expecting was for him to say it. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that.”

However, a self-claimed sceptic, Burlison admitted that he was uncertain about Davis' sources.

He noted that the physicist's comments may come from firsthand knowledge or secondhand reports, indicating uncertainty, saying: ""If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment. But if it is true, the government has no right to keep such a secret from the public it serves.""

However, he is aware that the acknowledgement of there being a possibility of aliens could invite more scepticism.

""Some will think we're nuts,"" Burlison acknowledged. But he defended the investigation, stating that taxpayers help to fund Pentagon, intelligence, and energy department programs studying UAPs.

""I owe it to the American people to get to the bottom of this,"" he said.

US President Donald Trump has described Russia as a “warring country,” saying Moscow has been engaged in conflicts for centuries and “just keeps on fighting.”

Trump made the remarks on Monday at a press conference, where he talked about his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the US state of Alaska to discuss a possible settlement of the Ukraine conflict.

“Russia is a warring nation. That's what they do – they fight a lot of wars,” he said.

“A friend of mine said, Russia is tough because they just keep on fighting,” Trump added. “They beat Hitler – so did we. And they beat Napoleon. You know, they've been doing this for a long time.”

Trump was referring to two of Russia's military triumphs – the defeat of Napoleon's Grand Army two centuries ago and the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. The two European dictators – Napoleon Bonaparte and Adolf Hitler – sent their armies into Russia in 1812 and 1941, respectively, only to suffer crushing defeats.

NEW YORK (AP) — AOL's dial-up internet is finally taking its last bow.

Yes, while perhaps a dinosaur by today's digital standards, dial-up is still around. But AOL says it's officially pulling the plug for its service on Sept. 30.

“AOL routinely evaluates its products and services and has decided to discontinue Dial-up Internet,” AOL wrote in a brief update on its support site — noting that dial-up and associated software “optimized for older operating systems” will soon be unavailable on AOL plans.

AOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the world wide web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s. 

The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone used to connect your computer online — along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.

Eventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today.

Still, a handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide.




AOL was the largest dial-up internet provider for some time, but not the only one to emerge over the years. Some smaller internet providers continue to offer dial-up today. Regardless, the decline of dial-up has been a long time coming. And AOL shutting down its service arrives as other relics of the internet's earlier days continue to disappear.

Microsoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year, for example — as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger — a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals.

AOL itself is far from the dominant internet player it was decades ago — when, beyond dial-up and IMs, the company also became known for its “You've got mail” catchphrase that greeted users who checked their inboxes, as famously displayed in the 1998 film starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan by the same name.

Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL — which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.

At the time Verzion announced that sale to in 2021, an anonymous source familiar with the transaction told CNBC that the number of AOL dial-up users was “in the low thousands,” down from 2.1 million when Verzion first moved to acquire AOL in 2015 — and far below peak demand seen back in the 90s and early 2000s. But beyond dial-up, AOL continues to offer its free email services, as well as subscriptions that advertise identity protection and other tech support.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is bringing in 800 National Guard members to help law enforcement fight crime in Washington, but just 100 to 200 of the troops will be on the city's streets at any given time, the Army said.

Trump's directive on Monday for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard is just the latest example of him sending the Guard into cities to support immigration enforcement or fight crime over the objection of local and state officials.

According to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority. That means the troops can conduct law enforcement activities on the streets of the nation's capital — though, at the moment, that doesn't appear to be the plan.

“Their duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,” according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions.

About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being assigned to patrols in Washington, including from the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Marshals Service.

Hegseth told reporters that Guard members will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.” He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units — other specialized units,” though he didn't offer any further details.




The timeline for the troop deployment also is vaguely defined. According to Trump's directive, National Guard troops will remain deployed until the president determines “that conditions of law and order have been restored.”

Besides the 800 Guard members, Trump said “we will bring in the military if it's needed” — seemingly referring to active duty troops in addition to the Guard — but added that “I don't think we'll need it.”

The deployment of troops to Washington comes after the Pentagon has pulled out the vast majority of the roughly 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 active duty Marines that Trump sent to Los Angeles in late June. 

Trump argued that the deployment was necessary after his administration's immigration crackdown led to protests throughout the city. Troops were largely tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they conducted raids.

Hegseth compared plans to send troops into the nation's capital to their deployment to the U.S.-Mexico border and to Los Angeles.

“We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

However, California's governor and city officials argued that the LA deployment was unnecessary and went to court to try to fight it.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters that the National Guard's primary mission had been to guard two buildings that “frankly didn't need to be guarded.”

In addition, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat, has questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws.

“I just think that's not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC's “The Weekend.”

This is also not the first time Trump unilaterally has chosen to use federal forces in the U.S. capital.

In 2020, during the protests over the police killing of George Floyd, Trump deployed the National Guard and federal law enforcement to the city, at one point using them to forcibly clear peaceful protesters from a square near the White House so he could stage a photo op.

It became a controversial moment in his first administration in part because Gen. Mark Milley, who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared alongside Trump. Some saw Milley's presence as the military's endorsement of using troops against U.S. citizens. Milley later apologized.

The Ethereum breakout above its multi-year hurdle and Bitcoin's weekend rally have caused increased expectations of an altcoin season. Analysts suggest a pause in the uptrend for these top cryptos could pave the way for altcoins to explode if macro conditions remain relatively stable.

In just four months, Ethereum has more than tripled owing to the massive inflow of capital from digital asset treasuries and spot U.S. Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs).

Bitcoin has also seen a similar ascent, rising more than 600% in the past two years.

“The conditions are lining up” for an altcoin season, Shashank Sripada, co-founder and chief operating officer of generative AI network GAIA, told Decrypt.

Historically, altcoin season begins as capital rotates into risky tokens as the top cryptos pause their explosive rally.

Coinanlyze data shows a clear dominance of altcoins compared to Ethereum. An uptick in this metric reveals increased speculation and leverage. The Coinglass Alt Season Index, which measures all non-Bitcoin assets against BTC, is still sitting at 39 after having most recently peaked at 88 in early December.

João Wedson, founder and CEO of crypto data analytics platforms Alphractal said, “Altcoin fun is just getting started—and it could last until November,” in an X post.

Ethereum's recent price performance, driven mostly by institutional interest in the asset and ETF inflows could fuel the altcoin season.

The real Altcoin Season hasn't even started yet Smart money flows from BTC to ETH, then to Top Caps, and finally to Mid & Low Caps. Altcoin fun is just getting started — and it could last until November. pic.twitter.com/OYbTtL8OF5

— Joao Wedson (@joao_wedson) August 11, 2025



Last week's $325 million inflow for the second-largest crypto far exceeded the top crypto's $247 million. It shows Ethereum is playing catch-up with Bitcoin ETF inflows.

“That kind of progress tends to pull capital into quality altcoins across the board,” explained Sripada.

With the narrative firmly focussed on Ethereum, Sripada said, “money will likely rotate into projects built tightly around Ethereum.”

The top five altcoins based on open interest and volume include Solana, XRP, Dogecoin and Ethena. Other Ethereum-betas include Lido DAO, Chainlink, Shiba Inu, Pepe Coin and Floki.

Analysts that previously spoke to Decrypt also hinted that betas to top cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to see an explosive leg, but also caution that macroeconomic conditions remain sensitive and could disrupt this bullish outlook.

As Ethereum continues to power an expanding ecosystem, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) stands out as one of the leading public companies aligned with the blockchain, Wall Street broker Bernstein said in a research report Monday.

The network's native token ether (ETH) has rallied 80% since June 5, the report noted, catalyzed by Circle's (CRCL) listing and the market's realization that most stablecoins are minted on the Ethereum network.

Coinbase operates one of the largest Layer 2 chains on Ethereum, Base, which processes more than 9 million transactions daily, encompassing stablecoins, trading, financial applications, and consumer-facing services, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.

While Base has no native token, transaction gas fees are settled in ether, positioning Coinbase to earn sequencer fees in ETH. This contributes to an annualized revenue run rate of $75 million, the analysts wrote.

Beyond transaction fees, Base has also emerged as the dominant chain for token deployments, Bernstein said. Coinbase's decision to integrate all Base tokens into its primary exchange platform has significantly increased trading activity, further boosting ETH-denominated brokerage fees. 

The launch of the Base App, a consumer wallet for buying, selling, holding, and transferring crypto (including stablecoin payments), further strengthens Coinbase's exposure to Ethereum and its ecosystem.

In addition to its operational activities, Coinbase holds a sizable ether treasury valued at $590 million (136,782 ETH), making the company a direct beneficiary of the token's price appreciation, the broker said.

As Coinbase highlighted in its second quarter earnings report, July trading fees surged approximately 40% compared to the Q2 average, driven by increased ether trading activity. 

This surge reflects the broader market excitement surrounding ether, and with over 250 tokens listed on Coinbase, the exchange is poised to benefit from the broader Ethereum ecosystem growth, the report added.

Bernstein has an outperform rating on Coinbase stock with a $510 price target. The shares were 4% higher, trading around $323 at publication time.

OpenAI's GPT-5 model was meant to be a world-changing upgrade to its wildly popular and precocious chatbot. But for some users, last Thursday's release felt more like a wrenching downgrade, with the new ChatGPT presenting a diluted personality and making surprisingly dumb mistakes.

On Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took to X to say the company would keep the previous model, GPT-4o, running for Plus users. A new feature designed to seamlessly switch between models depending on the complexity of the query had broken on Thursday, Altman said, “and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber.” He promised to implement fixes to improve GPT-5's performance and the overall user experience.

Given the hype around GPT-5, some level of disappointment appears inevitable. When OpenAI introduced GPT-4 in March 2023, it stunned AI experts with its incredible abilities. GPT-5, pundits speculated, would surely be just as jaw-dropping.

OpenAI touted the model as a significant upgrade with PhD-level intelligence and virtuoso coding skills. A system to automatically route queries to different models was meant to provide a smoother user experience (it could also save the company money by directing simple queries to cheaper models).

Soon after GPT-5 dropped, however, a Reddit community dedicated to ChatGPT filled with complaints. Many users mourned the loss of the old model.

“I've been trying GPT5 for a few days now. Even after customizing instructions, it still doesn't feel the same. It's more technical, more generalized, and honestly feels emotionally distant,” wrote one member of the community in a thread titled “Kill 4o isn't innovation, it's erasure.”

“Sure, 5 is fine—if you hate nuance and feeling things,” another Reddit user wrote.

Other threads complained of sluggish responses, hallucinations, and surprising errors.

Altman promised to address these issues by doubling GPT-5 rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users, improving the system that switches between models, and letting users specify when they want to trigger a more ponderous and capable “thinking mode.” “We will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback,” the CEO wrote on X. “As we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll[ed] out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!”

Errors posted on social media do not necessarily indicate that the new model is less capable than its predecessors. They may simply suggest the all-new model is tripped up by different edge cases than prior versions. OpenAI declined to comment specifically on why GPT-5 sometimes appears to make simple blunders.

The backlash has sparked a fresh debate over the psychological attachments some users form with chatbots trained to push their emotional buttons. Some Reddit users dismissed complaints about GPT-5 as evidence of an unhealthy dependence on an AI companion.

In March, OpenAI published research exploring the emotional bonds users form with its models. Shortly after, the company issued an update to GPT-4o, after it became too sycophantic.

“It seems that GPT-5 is less sycophantic, more ""business"" and less chatty,” says Pattie Maes, a professor at MIT who worked on the study. “I personally think of that as a good thing because it is also what led to delusions, bias reinforcement, etc. But unfortunately many users like a model that tells them they are smart and amazing, and that confirms their opinions and beliefs, even if [they are] wrong.”

Altman indicated in another post on X that this is something the company wrestled with in building GPT-5.

“A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn't describe it that way,” Altman wrote. He added that some users may be using ChatGPT in ways that help improve their lives while others might be “unknowingly nudged away from their longer term well-being.”

In a year or so, the open source models will become good enough (in both quality and speed) to run locally.Arguably, OpenAI OSS 120B is already good enough, in both quality and speed, to run on Mac Studio.Then $10k, amortized over 3 years, will be enough to run code LLMs 24/7.I hope that's the future.

If you want complete control over your data and don't trust anyone's assurances that they keep it private (and why should you) then you have to self-host. But if all you care about is a good price then the free market already provides that for open models

It might be fun to work out how to share, too. A whole new breed of shell hosting.

Do you think these enterprises will begin hosting their own models? I'm not convinced they'll join the capex race to build AI data centers. It would make more sense they just end up consuming existing services.Then there are the smaller startups that just never had their own data center. Are those going to start self-hosting AI models? And all of the related requirements to allow say a few hundred employees to access a local service at once? network, HA, upgrades, etc. Say you have multiple offices in different countries also, and so on.

They're much less strict than they were on cloud, but the security practices are really quite strict. I work in this sector and yes, they'll allow cloud, but strong data isolation + segregation, access controls, networking reqs, etc. etc. etc. are very much a thing in the industry still, particularly where the production process is commercially sensitive in itself.

Also tooling, you can use aider which is ok. But claude code and gemini cli will always be superior and will only work correctly with their respective models.

reply

But the second point seems even less likely to be true: why will Claude code and Gemini cli always be superior? Other than advantageous token prices (which the people willing to pay the aforementioned premium shouldn't even care about), what do they inherently have over third-party tooling?

reply

reply

Maybe to answer my own question, LLM developers have one, potentially two advantages over third-party tooling developers:
1) virtually unlimited tokens, zero rate limiting with which to play around with tooling dev.
2) the opportunity to train the network on their own tooling.The first advantage is theoretically mitigated by insane VC funding, but will probably always be a problem for OSS.I'm probably overlooking news that the second advantage is where Anthropic is winning right now; I don't have intuition for where this advantage will change with time.

For well defined tasks that Claude creates, I'll pass off execution to a locally run model (running in another Claude Code instance) and it works just fine. Not for every task, but more than you might think.

reply

The inference speed locally will be acceptable in 5-10 years thanks to those generation of chips and finally we can have good local AI apps.

reply

With medium and high reasoning, I will see between 60 and 120 tokens per second, which is outrageous compared to the LLaMa models I was running before (20-40tps - I'm sure I could have adjusted parameters somewhere in there).

I'm no shill, I'm fairly skeptical about AI, but been doing a lot of research and playing to see what I'm missing.I haven't bothered running anything locally as the overwhelming consensus is that it's just not good enough yet.

I'm not saying it is anywhere close to a paid foundation model, but the code it is outputting (albeit simple) has been generally well written and works. I do only get a handful of those high-thought responses before the 50k token window starts to delete stuff, though.

reply

reply

Generally, 20b MoE will run faster but be less smart than a 20b dense model. In terms of ""intelligence"" the rule of thumb is the geometric mean between the number of active parameters and the number of total parameters.So a 20b model with 3.6b active (like the small gpt-oss) should be roughly comparable in terms of output quality to a sqrt(3.6*20) = 8.5b parameter model, but run with the speed of a 3.6b model.

""Good enough"" for what is the question. You can already run them locally, the problem is that they aren't really practical for the use-cases we see with SOTA models, which are just now becoming passable as semi-reliable autonomous agents. There is no hope of running anything like today's SOTA models locally in the next decade.

There's no such thing as models that are ""good enough"". There are models that are better and models that are worse and OS models will always be worse. Businesses that use better, more expensive models will be more successful.

reply

Better back of house tech can differentiate you, but startups history is littered with failed companies using the best tech, and they were often beaten by companies using a worse is better approach. Anyone here who has been around long enough has seen this play out a number of times.

reply

Indeed.  In my idealistic youth I bought heavily into the ""if you build it, they will come,"" but that turned out to not at all be reality.  Often times the best product loses because of marketing, network effects, or some other reason that has nothing to do with the tech.  I wish it weren't that way, but if wishes were fishes we'd all have a fry

reply

I don't think we're there yet, but it's reasonable to expect at _some point_ your typical OS model could be 98% of the way to a cutting edge commercial model, and at that point your last sentence probably doesn't hold true.

The business itself will also massively develop in the coming years. For example, there will be dozens of providers for integrating open source models with an in-house AI framework that smoothly works with their stack and deployment solution.

The irony is that Kilo itself is playing the same game they're criticizing. They're burning cash on free credits (with expiry dates) and paid marketing to grab market share  -- essentially subsidizing inference just like Cursor, just with VC money instead of subscription revenue.The author is right that the ""$20 → $200"" subscription model is broken. But Kilo's approach of giving away $100+ in credits isn't sustainable either. Eventually, everyone has to face the same reality: frontier model inference is expensive, and someone has to pay for it.

I think there is a case Claude did not reduce their pricing given that they have the best coding models out there. There recent fundraise had them disclose their Gross margins at 60% (and -30% with usage via bedrock etc). This way they can offer 2.5x more tokens at the same price than the vibe code companies and yet break even. The market movement where the assumption did not work out was about how we still only have claude which made vibe coding work and is the most tasteful when it comes to what users want. There are probably models better at thinking and logic, especially o3, but this signals the staying power of claude - having a lock in, it's popularity, and challenges the more fundamental assumption about language models being commodities.(Speculating) Many companies woudl want to move away from claude but cant because users love the models.

For how many developers? Chip design companies aren't paying Synopsys $250k/year per developer. Even when using formal tools which are ludicrously expensive, developers can share licenses.In any case, the reason chip design companies pay EDA vendors these enormous sums is because there isn't really an alternative. Verilator exists, but ... there's a reason commercial EDA vendors can basically ignore it.That isn't true for AI. Why on earth would you pay more than a full time developer salary on AI tokens when you could just hire another person instead. I definitely think AI improves productivity but it's like 10-20% maybe, not 100%.

That actually probably is per developer. You might be able to reassign a seat to another developer, but that's still arguably one seat per user.

They're super opaque about pricing but I don't think it's that expensive. Apparently formal tools are way more expensive than simulation though (which makes sense), so we only had a handful of those licenses.I managed to find a real price that someone posted:https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/c8z1x9/modelsim_and_q...> Questa Prime licenses for ~$30000 USD.That sounds way more realistic, and I guess you get decent volume discounts if you want 200 licenses.

OSS models are only ~1 year behind SOTA proprietary, and we're already approaching a point where models are ""good enough"" for most usage. Where we're seeing advancements is more in tool calling, agentic frameworks, and thinking loops, all of which are independent of the base model. It's very likely that local, continuous thinking on an OSS model is the future.

I've just become comfortable using GH copilot in agent mode, but I haven't started letting it work in an isolated way in parallel to me. Any advise on getting started?

I'm not entirely sure that AI companies like Cursor necessarily miscalculated though. It's noted that the actual strategies the blog advertises are things used by tools like Cursor (via auto mode). The important thing for them is that they are able to successfully push users towards their auto mode and use more usage data to improve their routing and frontier models don't continue to be so much better AND so expensive that users continue to demand them. I wouldn't hate that bet if I were Cursor personally.

reply

reply

reply

This doesn't make any sense to me. Why would Cursor et al expect they could pocket the difference if inference costs went down? There's no stickiness to the product; they would compete down to zero margins regardless. If anything, higher total spend is better for them because it's more to skim off of.

If we assume 5 tasks, each running $400/mo of tokens, we reach an annual bill of $24,000.  We would have to see a 4x increase in token cost to reach the $100,000/yr mark.  This seems possible with increased context sizes.  Additionally, we might see additional context sizes lead to longer running more complicated tasks which would increase my number of parallel tasks.

reply

I wonder how the economics will play out, especially when you add in all the different geographic locations for remote devs and their cost.

reply

reply

The $100k/dev/year figure feels like sticker shock math more than reality. Yes, AI bills are growing fast - but most teams I see are still spending substantially lower annually, and that's before applying even basic optimizations like prompt caching, model routing, or splitting work across models.The real story is the AWS playbook all over again: vendors keep dropping unit costs, customers keep increasing consumption faster than prices fall, and in the end the bills still grow. If you're not measuring it daily, the ""marginal cost is trending down"" narrative is meaningless - you'll still get blindsided by scale.I'm biased but the winners will be the ones who treat AI like any other cloud resource: ruthlessly measured, budgeted, and tuned.

Ultimately, this will become a people problem more than a financial problem.  People that lack the confidence to code without AI will cost less to hire and dramatically more to employ, no differently than people reliant on large frameworks.  All historical data indicates employers will happily eat that extra cost if it means candidates are easier to identify and select because hiring and firing remain among the most serious considerations for technology selection.Candidates, currently thought of 10x, that are productive without these helpers will continue to remain no more or less elusive than they are now.  That means employers must choose between higher risks with higher selection costs for the potentially higher return on investment knowing that ROE is only realized if these high performance candidates are allowed to execute with high productivity.  Employers will gladly eat increased expenses if they can qualify lower risks to candidate selection.

In my experience, a 10x developer that can code without AI becomes a 100x developer because the menial tasks they'd delegate to less-skilled employees while setting technical direction can now be delegated to an AI instead.If your only skill is writing boilerplate in a framework, you won't be employed to do that with AI. You will not have a job at all and the 100xer will take your salary.

Last month, Paul and Lorenze took to Instagram to confirm their engagement, sharing some snaps from the dreamy proposal set-up in Nantucket.

“I wanted to do it on the beach. But the schedule for the weather was horrible, it was supposed to rain the whole time, so I ended up renting a little cottage and did it there,” Paul told the Cincinnati Open as he made his return to the tour.

“Nobody was around, it was just me and her and I thought it was great to have that moment for ourselves.



“I knew I was going to do it for a while, but I didn't know when. Obviously I was out for a little bit, so it was kind of a forced vacation and I was like, ‘This is probably the best time for me to do it'.

“It was great because it was her family vacation. I didn't want to take over her family vacation with that, but I guess I kind of did. But it was great.”

The forced vacation came after Paul suffered a four-set defeat to Sebastian Ofner at the All England Club. He raced through the opening set before losing 1-6 7-5 6-4 7-5.

“I heard a pop in my foot during the match and then after, I got an MRI. When they tell you that you ruptured a tendon, you just shut it down,” Paul said of his foot injury, which left him in a boot for two weeks.

The world No. 16 missed the first few tournaments of the North American swing in Washington and Toronto, and even contemplated skipping Cincinnati. But he enjoyed a successful comeback, beating Pedro Martinez 6-2 6-2 in his first match in over a month.

Paul will now face Adrian Mannarino for a spot in the last 16. And the American is now playing for something extra, as he has a wedding to start saving for.

Westside Merchandising says the Baton Rouge, La., rapper breached their contract by hiring a new merch partner for his first-ever headlining tour.

As YoungBoy Never Broke Again prepares to embark on his MASA Tour this September, the rapper has been hit with a lawsuit for allegedly trying to cut an established merchandise partner out of his first-ever headlining trek.


	YoungBoy (Kentrell DeSean Gaulden) and his label Never Broke Again face the claims in a federal complaint filed Friday (Aug. 8) by retail partner Westside Merchandising. The company supposedly paid YoungBoy a $1 million advance in 2023 as part of a licensing deal that gave the company the exclusive right to sell the rapper's apparel and other merch online and at live shows.


	Westside says the deal requires YoungBoy to promote the company's merch — obligations he's largely shirked due to being in prison on gun charges for the majority of the contract. Yet even now that YoungBoy is free (and pardoned by President Donald Trump), he's allegedly still not marketing the apparel on Instagram as promised.

	In fact, soon after announcing his MASA arena tour in May, YoungBoy sent Westside a letter announcing he was terminating their contract due to “poor performance” on the company's part.


	“The purpose behind defendants' purported termination is clear: YoungBoy has embarked on a nationwide 32-date lucrative tour, and defendants have obviously obtained a new advance from another company to handle the touring merchandise even though defendants are contractually obligated to use Westside,” reads the complaint. “Westside has an exclusive license to sell Never Broke Again merchandise — rights that upon information and belief will be infringed by the new merchandise that will be sold at YoungBoy's upcoming tour.”


	Westside is now seeking a court order confirming that it is entitled to handle merch at the MASA Tour — scheduled to kick off Sept. 1 at Dallas' American Airlines Center — as well as financial damages from YoungBoy.


	The lawsuit alleges that, in addition to trying to cut Westside out of the MASA Tour, YoungBoy also breached the licensing contract by promoting a competitor's merch and getting in the way of Westside's business efforts.


	Westside says, for example, that YoungBoy ruined a potentially lucrative partnership to sell the rapper's merch at the retail chain Pure Atlanta by insulting the store's founder with an Instagram comment that called her “unprofessional and clout chasing.”


	“Although Westside was diligent, obtained numerous opportunities for the venture, and performed all of its contractual duties in good faith, YoungBoy did nothing except fail to perform his duties, while impeding Westside's efforts, and causing the parties to lose significant opportunities and profits,” says the complaint.


	Reps for YoungBoy did not immediately return a request for comment on the allegations.

I'm sad now. I'm dying and it'd be the last movie I saw before my death. But now I won't be able to see it at all.
