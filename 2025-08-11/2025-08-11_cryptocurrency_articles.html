                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the original Ethereum ICO investors has sent 2,000 ETH (around $8.55 million) to the crypto exchange Kraken. The decision is made when ETH is trading at a price of $4,250 after the asset showed a bullish momentum that has seen up to a 22% price increase within the past weeks. This initial investment has given a more than 1.3 million percent increase to date. The recent 2,000 ETH transfer to Kraken is just a fraction of the total asset possession of the whale, and most of their long-standing holdings are not yet touched upon. Analysts and traders closely monitor these movements, because transfers to exchanges in large amounts may (but not always) hint that the asset is about to be sold or that a portfolio is being rebalanced. At its current levels, which are within striking distance of yearly highs, with current momentum being very strong, early investors are positioned to cash in while still leaving plenty on the table on the upside. Whale activity shall also be in the spotlight of traders as Ethereum inches closer to all-time highs of holding high value at 4,800. The actions of early ICO participants, who hold large amounts of Ethereum at very low cost bases, are particularly significant in influencing market sentiment and liquidity.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, Asia is leading a reinvention—building a blockchain ecosystem that doesn't just trade coins, but tokenizes roads, solar farms, and financial instruments. Yet the next wave of financial innovators are trying to make blockchain work in the “real” world by tokenizing real-world assets like artwork, real estate—and, if two small Asia-based financial startups have their way, clean energy. Amber Premium, a Thailand-based institutional crypto services provider, and Evolve, a tokenized infrastructure company specializing in renewable energy, are tiny by global standards: Amber's market capitalization hovers around $600 million, while Evolve manages a relatively small asset base. Unlike crypto giants like Binance or Coinbase, Amber and Evolve are niche, but their focus on tokenizing real-world infrastructure are examples of how Asia is transforming the realm of digital finance. In principle, this offers institutions a compelling alternative to legacy investment structures. These tokens represent tangible physical or financial assets—solar arrays, government bonds, EV fleets—bringing real yield, lower volatility, and legal transparency to crypto markets. Amber Premium allows clients to hold tokenized clean energy debt, money market stablecoins, and more—all within a single digital wallet. Meanwhile, Evolve's tokens are linked to solar farms and battery networks, seamlessly bridging the gap between industrial infrastructure and digital finance. Amber Premium, led by CEO Wayne Huo—a former Morgan Stanley trader—recently merged with iClick, securing a Nasdaq listing and establishing itself as a fully regulated institutional crypto player. Amber's regulatory framework spans multiple jurisdictions: its Singapore arm (formerly Sparrow Tech) operates under the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), while other subsidiaries hold licenses adapted to local Asian markets. Amber's Nasdaq listing established the company as a U.S.-listed institutional gateway into “Web3”—shorthand for an internet built on decentralized blockchain technologies. Huo took over as CEO, giving the company a bridge to traditional finance. A significant share of Amber's clients are based in Greater China who are looking for exposure to digital assets amid uncertainty around mainland China's treatment of cryptocurrency. Amber is still a tiny company, generating just $14.94 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, up from $1 million a year prior. Amber Premium has yet to turn a profit, instead prioritizing infrastructure, licensing and regulatory compliance over short-term earnings. Analysts blame low awareness, thin trading volume and skepticism about the viability of crypto-finance hybrids after FTX's spectacular collapse in 2022. Evolve, founded by Maverick Hui, a pioneer of Canadian crypto ETFs and early digital asset regulation, is turning renewable energy infrastructure like battery-swapping stations, solar farms, and EV charging networks into digital tokens that deliver proportional returns to investors. Several of its ETF offerings, including those tied to Bitcoin and Solana, have received approval from the Ontario Securities Commission. The company partners with U.S.-licensed custodians like Coinbase Custody Trust for cross-border holdings. Hui, from Evolve, is focusing on yield-generating clear energy assets, particularly through e-scooter and battery station manufacturer Mile Green. In early 2025, Mile Green secured $50 million from CMAG Funds, a Singapore-based private investment firm, to expand battery-swapping and EV charging infrastructure across Southeast Asia and parts of Africa. (Fortune's parent company holds a minority stake in CMAG Funds. Chatchaval Jiravananon, Fortune's owner, is also an investor in Amber, Mile Green, and Evolve. Mile Green is Evolve's infrastructure partner: Mile Green develops the clean energy assets, which Evolve converts into investment-grade digital tokens. Investors can now track performance through these tokens rather than company filings. Asia is taking the lead in tokenized finance, thanks to clearer regulatory frameworks, innovation sandboxes and startups that are eager to experiment. Even mainland China, which bans most cryptocurrency trading and mining, is experimenting with enterprise blockchain through its state-backed Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN) and central bank digital currency, the e-CNY. The financial hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore are among Asia's most crypto-friendly jurisdictions. Yet regulators in both cities are still cautious about cryptocurrency. Tokenized products still face strict limitations, retail access is tightly controlled, and approval processes can be unpredictable. One major constraint is the difficulty of transferring tokenized assets between wallets. As a result, wallet-to-wallet transfers are often restricted or require complex approvals, limiting broader adoption. Changing winds in Washington are also buoying Asia-based crypto platforms. The second Trump administration is taking a decidedly more pro-crypto stance. In January, U.S. president Donald Trump signed an executive order promoting responsible blockchain growth. He paused enforcement actions against crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance, and Trump's SEC then launched a “Crypto 2.0” task force to clarify rules on crypto, moving away from the preceding Biden administration's more skeptical stance. In March, the White House announced a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and Digital Asset Stockpile, naming Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Cardano as national digital assets. Together, these moves are ushering in what the crypto industry hopes will be a more friendly, legally-stable foundation for growth. Amber, as a Nasdaq-listed company, gains regulatory legitimacy and improved U.S. market access. Evolve's yield-bearing, tokenized infrastructure may soon appeal to pension funds and fiduciary investors seeking new types of assets. Tokenized finance may still be in its early innings—but the infrastructure is maturing. FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin (BTC-USD) surged on Monday to trade near record highs as investor enthusiasm and momentum around crypto grew amid Trump's recent Fed nomination and executive order allowing crypto investment in 401(k) retirement plans. The digital token reached $122,000 on Monday before easing to around $120,000. The gains come as inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have grown and public companies have been adding bitcoin to their balance sheets. Bitcoin wasn't the only cryptocurrency getting a bid. Ethereum (ETH-USD) touched 2021 levels on Monday, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has surged roughly 190% since the April market lows. The move higher in crypto also comes as stocks hover near record highs on expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut rates in September and that President Trump's next Fed chair pick will likely bring looser monetary policy. "If the Fed is cutting into an economy that is still growing, with unemployment in check and inflation elevated, that is a macro cocktail that should favor allocation to crypto," Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote on Friday. Farrell also noted that Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran to serve on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors is also bullish for crypto assets, given that he has called for weaker dollar policy in the past, which typically drives up asset prices. Last week Trump issued an executive order asking the Labor Department to look into allowing 401(k) plans to hold cryptocurrencies, among other alternative assets. Even Trump's son Eric Trump has noted crypto's surge, writing recently, "Stop betting against BTC and ETH — you will be run over." Bitcoin is the lead dog in the crypto market," Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, told Yahoo Finance on Monday morning. "But longer term, there are some fundamental changes here that I think are bullish for it and we'll send it much higher in the future." Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The IPO is led by Wall Street heavyweights JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup, SEC filings show. Digital asset exchange operator Bullish raised the target valuation for its initial public offering by almost 60% to potentially $990 million, a move that may reflect growing investor appetite amid renewed momentum in crypto-related stocks. Bullish now plans to sell 30 million shares at $32 to $33 apiece, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing recent regulatory filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That's nearly 60% higher than the upper range of its earlier target. If the IPO meets expectations, Bullish would debut with a market capitalization of about $4.8 billion — up from the $4.2 billion goal set in early August. The IPO is being led by Wall Street heavyweights JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup. Several institutional investors, including subsidiaries of BlackRock and ARK Investment Management, have already signaled interest in the offering. In its filing, the company pointed to rising activity in digital asset markets and increasing adoption by traditional financial institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs as key drivers behind its decision to go public. Related: Citigroup, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs lead TradFi's blockchain charge: Ripple Bullish and other crypto-focused companies want to capitalize on strong market sentiment, raising funds to fuel growth as institutional interest in digital assets accelerates. They follow in the footsteps of stablecoin issuer Circle, which earlier this year completed a blockbuster IPO that raised more than $1 billion. In recent months, inflows into spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded funds have surged, more public companies have added digital assets to their corporate treasuries, and university endowments and pension funds have also been seeking exposure to the asset class. According to Bitbo data, ETFs, along with public and private companies, collectively hold more than 13.5% of the total Bitcoin supply.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week during a presentation at the Blockchain Rio event, Brazil's central bank Governor Gabriel Gallipolo spoke about the bank's innovation agenda. Nor was there much mention of CBDC for that matter. DREX was always part of an open finance push by the Banco Central do Brasil, and it will remain so. So it's now a lien reconciliation project that will use neither blockchain nor decentralization technologies, but will integrate with PIX, Brazil's successful retail instant payment system. But some work using blockchain technologies will continue in the background. There appear to be two issues driving the change of direction. The technical challenge of combining novel privacy solutions with Ethereum-based Hyperledger Besu was flagged during the first phase, resulting in delays.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Ethereum continues to power an expanding ecosystem, crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) stands out as one of the leading public companies aligned with the blockchain, Wall Street broker Bernstein said in a research report Monday. Coinbase operates one of the largest Layer 2 chains on Ethereum, Base, which processes more than 9 million transactions daily, encompassing stablecoins, trading, financial applications, and consumer-facing services, analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. While Base has no native token, transaction gas fees are settled in ether, positioning Coinbase to earn sequencer fees in ETH. This contributes to an annualized revenue run rate of $75 million, the analysts wrote. Beyond transaction fees, Base has also emerged as the dominant chain for token deployments, Bernstein said. Coinbase's decision to integrate all Base tokens into its primary exchange platform has significantly increased trading activity, further boosting ETH-denominated brokerage fees. The launch of the Base App, a consumer wallet for buying, selling, holding, and transferring crypto (including stablecoin payments), further strengthens Coinbase's exposure to Ethereum and its ecosystem. As Coinbase highlighted in its second quarter earnings report, July trading fees surged approximately 40% compared to the Q2 average, driven by increased ether trading activity. Bernstein has an outperform rating on Coinbase stock with a $510 price target. The shares were 4% higher, trading around $323 at publication time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beeple caused Nakamigos NFTs to soar — and later plummet — in price this weekend after an AI-based stunt at the artist's CryptoPunks meetup depicted Larva Labs' founders launching an earlier iteration of the collection. At “CryptoPunks meetup 2.0,” a video showed an AI rendition of Matt Hall and John Watkinson supposedly launching the “V-ZERO CryptoPunks.” Breaking: Matt Hall and @beeple signed a statement that claims @Nakamigos is the V.0 Cryptopunks that was developed by Larva Labs in 2015Over 1k Nagamigos swept, and floor doubled in an hour pic.twitter.com/HGF8ZGLUC3 Read more: While crypto burns, Madonna gives birth to robot centipedes in NFT series Both Hall and Beeple also signed flyers, however, these used pictures from the Nakamigos collection, a separate NFT project based on CryptoPunks. However, when news spread that it was a joke, the price tumbled by 57% and returned to a roughly pre-pump 0.189 ETH. Beeple then doubled down on the joke by releasing an apology video that ridiculed anyone who previously fell for the stunt.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hiring in crypto is hard – Campus makes it easy. Ethereum treasury firm BitMine Immersion (BMNR) said Monday its ether holdings have surpassed 1.15 million tokens, valued at about $4.9 billion, a level the company says makes it the largest corporate ETH treasury globally. The disclosure extends BitMine's rapid accumulation this summer and makes it the first digital asset treasury company to surpass 1 million ETH. Previously, The Block reported the company at 625,000 ETH alongside a $1 billion stock repurchase program, and then 833,000 ETH worth $2.9 billion on Aug.4 as buys accelerated. Monday's announcement suggests the NYSE-listed firm added 317,000, or $1.3 billion worth of tokens, to its holdings since last week. The firm did not detail new financing in today's statement. BitMine has positioned itself as an Ethereum-denominated treasury and staking company at a time when corporate ETH balance sheets are growing and institutional adoption is maturing. The Block's data shows Ethereum treasuries have climbed past $10 billion across tracked entities like SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital. BitMine chairman Tom Lee, also co-founder of Fundstrat, said on CNBC that Ethereum could be entering a “2017 Bitcoin” moment fueled by three key drivers: a regulatory green light for stablecoins, signs of SEC openness to moving finance onchain, and major firms such as JPMorgan and Robinhood building on Ethereum. Lee floated the prospect of an “Ethereum MicroStrategy” era and said prices could move from roughly $3,700 to $30,000 or more if those trends compound. ETH traded for $4,189, 14% away from its previous all-time high, The Block's price page shows. BMNR surged 9% after the latest treasury announcement, while BitMine shares are up 634% since January, according to Yahoo Finance data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One investment firm is down hundreds of millions of dollars after attempting to short Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins, according to on-chain analysis. In a post on the social media platform X, Lookonchain says that crypto asset manager Abraxas Capital – a firm with around $3 billion in assets under its management – tried to short BTC, ETH, Solana (SOL), SUI Network (SUI), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) as a hedge on its other positions “Abraxas Capital's two accounts are shorting ETH, BTC, SOL, HYPE, and SUI as a hedge against spot holdings, with total unrealized losses exceeding $190 million! The market analytics firm goes on to highlight another failed attempt to short Ethereum by an unknown whale, resulting in $20 million worth of losses. “To avoid liquidation, whale 0x8c58 deposited another 8.6 million USDC into Hyperliquid over the past 24 hours. Looking at Solana, Lookonchain says that crypto asset management giant Galaxy Digital appears to be selling its stash of SOL as it has been moving the token into prominent crypto exchanges. Galaxy Digital deposited another 224,000 SOL ($41.12 million) into Binance and Coinbase.” Solana is trading for $184 at time of writing, a marginal decrease on the day, while BTC and ETH are worth $122,187 and $4,302, respectively.

DeXRP, a next-generation decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), has raised over $4.3 million in its ongoing initial coin offering (ICO), according to recent reports [3]. The DXP token is currently priced at $0.05285, with an expected listing price of $0.35 [3]. Investors can purchase the token using Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, XRP Ledger, Bitcoin, or USDT on supported networks, as well as through bank card transactions. The project is also introducing a dynamic fee mechanism that allows liquidity providers to bid for lower trading fees, an innovative approach aimed at enhancing user incentives and platform efficiency [3]. DeXRP aims to serve as a go-to trading hub for the XRPL community, offering advanced features such as real-time analytics, smart order routing, and a transparent governance model for token holders [3]. The project has also drawn attention from major industry players, including Messari and Big Brain Holdings, which are anticipated to contribute to its early-stage growth [3]. DeXRP's planned cross-chain capabilities and integration with major analytics platforms could further broaden its appeal to a global user base. As the project moves toward its official listing, it remains focused on transparency, compliance, and institutional-grade security, positioning itself as a key player in the evolving DeFi landscape.</p>
