                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cadillac: Everything You Need To Know About F1's New Team As the 2025 season takes a breather, F1.com takes a look back at the championship fight so far between McLaren team mates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. The 2025 season has featured several fascinating storylines so far – and one of these has centred around the increasingly close intra-team championship fight that has been playing out between McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. From Round 1 in Australia through to the last race before F1's traditional summer break in Hungary, the battle has seen its fair share of changes in momentum – as well as a dramatic collision along the way. When the season kicked off at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Norris laid down an early marker by beating Piastri to pole position. Throughout the hectic final stages, Norris held position to take victory by just 0.895s from Red Bull's Max Verstappen, with Piastri having to settle for ninth place. Piastri was looking for a better outing when F1 moved on to Shanghai one week later – and while McLaren lost out to the Ferrari of Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's Sprint, Piastri grabbed pole position in Qualifying. Norris, meanwhile, reported an issue with his brakes during the latter stages but held onto second place, giving the Woking-based squad a 1-2 finish. However, Verstappen caused a surprise by outpacing both to secure pole position. The final 10 laps saw Piastri close in on Norris during the battle for P2 before his challenge fell away towards the end, meaning that Norris led home his team mate in a 2-3 formation. After the opening three races, Norris led the championship by one point from Verstappen, with Piastri 13 points adrift in third. But it was Piastri who enjoyed a stronger Qualifying at Round 4 in Bahrain, the Australian taking pole while Norris ended the session back in sixth. From there it proved to be an impressive weekend for Piastri, who built a strong lead on race day before eventually crossing the line with a sizeable 15-second margin from Russell in P2. Norris' good recovery drive saw him complete the podium in third, but the Briton had lost a fair bit of ground to his team mate in the championship, with Piastri having leapfrogged Verstappen to move just three points behind Norris. Piastri, meanwhile, lined up in second behind polesitter Verstappen. An early battle between the pair resulted in Verstappen being handed a five-second time penalty, dropping him behind the Australian who went on to claim a mostly untroubled win from there. While Norris recovered to a final result of P4, Piastri's victory was enough to steal the championship lead from his team mate, making him the first Australian to head the standings in 15 years. That run did not continue into Sunday's race, however. With Verstappen taking pole ahead of Norris – and Piastri back in fourth – a mistake from Norris at the start dropped him back, while Piastri moved forwards and eventually overtook Verstappen for the lead. The Dutchman went on to win, while Norris finished ahead of Piastri in second. Charles Leclerc topped the timesheets of every practice session during his home race weekend in Monaco – but Norris beat the Ferrari driver to pole position in Qualifying. Norris was not far behind, with the team securing another 1-2, but Piastri had eked out his title standings advantage to 10 points. Entering into the Canadian Grand Prix weekend, Norris admitted that it was a case of “when” not “if” he and Piastri would come to blows on track during the battle for the World Championship. Within a matter of days, that prediction had proven accurate. Contact occurred between them, resulting in Norris – who took responsibility for the incident – pulling off track with damage, while Piastri crossed the line in fourth. It was an incident that McLaren Team Principal Andrea Stella labelled as “not acceptable”. Norris ultimately kept his team mate at bay by 2.695s to seal his third win of the campaign – and, after his non-score in Canada, the Briton was now 15 points off in the championship fight. Verstappen again beat both McLarens to pole position at Silverstone – but a dramatic Grand Prix saw the order change. In an eventful wet-dry race, Piastri overtook Verstappen for P1 just as rain started to fall. The Australian was later hit with a 10-second time penalty for slowing too much when preparing for a restart following a Safety Car period, handing the lead to Norris during the pit stops phase. From there Norris claimed victory in front of his home crowd, with Piastri coming home in a slightly less happy second. His title lead had again been reduced, with the margin now down to eight points. Norris outpaced Piastri by just 0.085s to claim pole. However, after a delay to Sunday's race due to heavy rainfall, Piastri was on the charge when racing eventually got underway and made a bold move on his team mate along the Kemmel Straight to take the lead. Norris is now only nine points away from Piastri – and, with a further 10 rounds to go when the season resumes, it looks like there is plenty more action to come in the fight for the title.</p>

Cadillac: Everything You Need To Know About F1's New Team

IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe picks out five drivers Cadillac could bring to the F1 grid in 2026.

One of the biggest questions that still remains about Cadillac's nascent F1 program is who will be tapped to drive for them. While some established F1 veterans have been touted as front runners for the ride, it is no secret that one day they would love to have a US driver in their stable.

So if one of the seats had to be earmarked for an American, who would the best options be? We asked IndyCar star and F1 TV pundit James Hinchcliffe to pick out five drivers Caddilac could bring to the F1 grid…
