                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Magic: The Gathering is having an even bigger moment than usual this year, thanks to a lot of attention around its splashy crossovers and its rapid rollout of sets. But with that attention, there's definitely been some consternation about just how wide-reaching Magic‘s aesthetic is getting, between experimental in-universe sets and those aforementioned “Universes Beyond” bringing more and more licensed material into the game. Today Magic head designer Mark Rosewater released his 2025 State of Design article on the official Magic website, looking back at feedback and lessons to be learned from the release of almost every major Magic set released in the last year (up to, but not including, Edge of Eternities, which released on August 1). There are lots of interesting points Rosewater makes in the piece, reflecting some of the biggest fan concerns about Magic‘s direction from a mechanical and aesthetic point of view, from the game's eagerness to move on from themes every set, creating an issue where mechanical elements are introduced and then left unsupported, to an awareness of the game's complexity creep from the sheer amount of interactions possible even when Magic introduces individually simplistic new mechanics. But one of the most intriguing lessons to be learned that Rosewater highlights across several of the sets covered in the piece—Bloomburrow, Duskmourn: House of Horror, Foundations, Aetherdrift, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, and Final Fantasy—is a regular criticism Magic has faced as of late: that the game has occasionally pushed its fantastical too far into elements that don't capture Magic‘s feel. One particular pain point Rosewater highlighted was in Duskmourn, a horror-themed set that included several more direct aspersions to classic horror media, rooted in our own world. “Players, it seems, are not fans of what I'm going to call ‘mundane modernity.' Magic has had many sets, such as Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty and The Brothers' War which push into more of a science-fiction feel, with items far more technically advanced than one would normally find in a fantasy story,” Rosewater wrote. Some things Duskmourn: House of Horror did for the first time bothered players, like having characters wearing and using things that we actually use: things like sneakers, or jeans, or a baseball bat. Part of fantasy is the idea that you're coming to a world that is fundamentally different than your own. Fantasy wants to be inspirational, and seeing everyday objects which are a part of all of our daily lives deflates that.” As Rosewater acknowledged, not every Magic set is rooted in explicitly fantastical material, from the sci-fantasy of sets like Edge of Eternities to collaborations in Universes Beyond like Doctor Who or Warhammer 40,000, which have fantastical elements rooted in science-fictional or real-world designs. But Magic also has a strong history of being able to root that kind of aesthetic in fantasy, which Duskmourn‘s more explicit horror callouts lacked. At a time when Wizards is also reckoning with the increase of non-Magic-original sets in the game, depending on the crossover, it's going to be an issue that continues to concern players (even beyond the general existence of Universes Beyond, complaints around which Rosewater acknowledged as a “sentiment [that] continually shrinks over time”). It's an interesting thing for Rosewater to acknowledge, though, as Magic is now little more than a month away from the release of its next set, Marvel's Spider-Man. Although there are fantastical elements in a set about a superhero scientist and peculiar foes, like most of good Marvel, it's built into the so-called “world outside our window.” The Final Fantasy set did a great job translating Final Fantasy to the world of Magic, while drawing on a myriad of aesthetics from steampunk to sci-fi to more traditional medieval fantasy, and managed to effectively balance those aesthetic styles with what players typically expect from Magic. We'll find out if there are more lessons to learn when the set hits shelves at the end of September.

However Newsweek helpfully points out that (giant) Texas has more violent crimes total (raw occurrences) per year than (comparatively tiny) DC. Want to adjust your position on that "disinfo campaign?" I agree that it would be misleading to judge  D.C. based on being at a 30 year low. It's fair to say that there are other cities close in population. But it's clear that D.C. has a abnormally high homicide rate when compared to all of the other U.S. cities of its size or larger. The wikipedia article about then-US Attorney for DC includes this note:"Under Graves, the US Attorney's Office declined to prosecute 67% of those arrested for crimes in DC in 2022, including 72% of misdemeanor arrests and 53% of felony arrests. You can't lie with numbers that are easily provable. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_b...And you'll see that Washington D.C. doesn't make the top ten for rates of any of the major violent crimes (murder, rape, etc.) And you'll see that Washington D.C. doesn't make the top ten for rates of any of the major violent crimes (murder, rape, etc.) Population does matter somewhat but not really in this case. If you're invading a city because crime is high it only makes sense to do if it's high in absolute numbers; otherwise you're not really having much impact.Also half of DC actually lives in MD and VA. Also half of DC actually lives in MD and VA. It would appear to be within a factor of two of the present numbers, but I can't work out where the line would be. And to cite these numbers without providing context at the same time of citing them that someone was literally fired for allegedly manipulating the data. And to be clear they're just allegations, but also the data is controlled by someone whose job and ego is tied to these numbers dropping, and the rate of the drop is basically unbelievable - 25% to 28% drop in a single year? After suggesting it went down 34% the year before?Even if my info I just wrote is something someone could dispute, is it not part of journalism to at least provide the bare minimum of context for people to at least know why this is controversial? If Trump's position on this is so soundly and clearly misguided, then it shouldn't be a problem at all to provide all facts and context to demonstrate as much. Instead we're given a single fact with zero other context.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The road is almost over for AMD's Zen 3-based 3D-VCache-powered gaming processors. Tweakers.net reports that various retailers can no longer purchase the Ryzen 7 5700X3D from AMD, thus confirming the CPU has reached end-of-life status. Outgoing Ryzen 7 5700X3D pricing and availability back up Tweakers report, as AMD's last eight-core Zen 3 3D-VCache chip is no longer available in the U.S. from virtually all popular retailers, including Newegg, Amazon, B&H Photo, Best Buy, and Micro Center. Newegg currently has three active Ryzen 7 5700X3D listings, one going for $278.09, another $340, and the last one $526.17, all coming from third-party retailers based in Hong Kong. The Ryzen 7 5700X3D is a downclocked variant of the Ryzen 7 5800X3D, featuring eight Zen 3 cores, 96MB of L3 cache, and a 400MHz clock speed reduction compared to its pricier brother. Despite its lower clock speeds, the Ryzen 7 5700X3D proved to be one of AMD's most competitive gaming CPUs at the time, coming in at around $100 cheaper than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D and Core i5-14600K, while offering performance similar to both chips. In our review, we found the Ryzen 7 5700X3D was just 9% slower than the Ryzen 7 5800X3D on average at 1080p (while being 35% cheaper), and was 3% faster than Intel's Core i5-14600K.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire's startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. From a two-car Seattle garage crammed with machinery that would make any gearhead swoon, Gurski has developed technology that can transform fossil fuel vehicles into plug-in electric hybrids — cars that can run on battery power for daily driving but switch to gas for longer trips — for a few thousand dollars and about a day of installation work. “I'm fully convinced it's a solution the world needs,” he said. Gurski launched Blue Dot Motorworks five years ago to commercialize the technology, and his effort is kicking into gear: The initial prototype, a product dubbed Narwhal, is designed to pair with pickup trucks. Its second version, called Humpback, will target cars and SUVs. Gurski has held mechanical engineering leadership roles at multiple companies and worked on sanitation technology for Gates Foundation-funded projects before starting his own engineering consultancy, which led into Blue Dot. Redwood Stephens, former chief product officer for Rad Power Bikes and a past president of engineering company Synapse Product Development, recently joined the startup as a part-time CPO. The team includes Suzanne Ellis Wernevi, head of business development, communications and policy. The Blue Dot conversion is a variation on traditional plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The vehicles operate entirely electrically until their batteries run out and they switch over to internal combustion engines. The hybrids have a much shorter battery range than 100% EVs, but given that most drivers make daily trips of 35-40 miles, they're running fossil fuel-free most of the time. “If you look at any existing car on the road, it's already 80% of a plug-in hybrid. Entrepreneurs have tried, and largely failed, to create retrofit solutions for converting gas-powered vehicles. But Jay Donnaway, past president of the Seattle Electric Vehicle Association (SEVA) and long-time EV enthusiast, is “cautiously optimistic” that Blue Dot has landed on a winning strategy. Most other technologies added battery power to boost a gas vehicle's efficiency, he said, but didn't include the ability to drive purely as an EV. Blue Dot's team is prepping to build about 10-12 prototype kits for pilot tests on light-duty vehicles at Royal Roads University on Vancouver Island and the Richmond School District in British Columbia. But there are plenty of challenges for Blue Dot to navigate. Building hardware is expensive, particularly for initial, limited-run production. Trump administration policies are undermining EV adoption by cutting tax rebates for vehicle purchases and eliminating funding for charging infrastructure — though the loss of rebates could make Blue Dot's proposition more cost competitive. It will give audible and visual warnings if the battery power gets low. The technology includes regenerative braking and enables one-pedal driving. The conversion kit targets a price of $6,000-$9,000 based on vehicle type, plus roughly $500-$1,000 in labor costs for installation. The system is designed so any mechanic can install it. The upfront costs are significant, but vehicles with poor fuel efficiency can make up the investment in three or four years given that electricity is cheaper than filling up with gasoline. There are additional maintenance savings as the combustion engine will see less wear and tear. After 10 years chasing a plug-in hybrid solution, Gurski thinks he's there. And I think this kind of falls into that category,” he said. “It's like, yeah, obviously that'll work — but I had to come up with this.” Have a scoop that you'd like GeekWire to cover?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>These GPUs are meant for smaller workstations, but they still pack a punch. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Nvidia has just launched two more Blackwell GPUs designed for professionals. These GPUs round out the company's workstation lineup, slotting in under the top-of-the-line RTX Pro 6000 that was released earlier this year. Aside from their increased performance over prior-gen products, Nvidia says that these GPUs are also tailored for AI acceleration that works across varying workflows in different industries. Those characteristics make it especially useful for workstations with limited space or tight power and thermal budgets. There's also a new RTX Pro 2000 card with 16GB of ECC GDDR7 memory and 545 AI TOPS of power in the same 70W TGP. Nvidia says this card is built for mainstream design and AI workflows. This GPU is claimed to be around 1.5 times faster than the Nvidia RTX A2000 in 3D modeling, computer-aided design, and rendering. The company also says it's useful for AI image and text generation, boosting its AI performance to make AI-powered workflows faster and more seamless. Unfortunately, we don't have detailed pricing for these GPUs yet — we expect that information to come from its authorized resellers and system integrators. These GPUs are expected to become available later this year, with the RTX Pro 2000 available through PNY and TD Synnex for those looking for individual cards to upgrade their existing units, and from system integrators including Boxx, Dell, HP, and Lenovo, for those looking for complete workstation solutions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia on Monday unveiled a set of new world AI models, libraries, and other infrastructure for robotics developers, most notable of which is Cosmos Reason, a 7-billion-parameter “reasoning” vision language model for physical AI applications and robots. During its announcement at the SIGGRAPH conference on Monday, Nvidia noted that these models are meant to be used to create synthetic text, image, and video datasets for training robots and AI agents. Cosmos Reason, per Nvidia, allows robots and AI agents to “reason” thanks to its memory and physics understanding, which lets it “serve as a planning model to reason what steps an embodied agent might take next.” The company says it can be used for data curation, robot planning, and video analytics. This rendering capability is also being integrated into open source simulator CARLA, a popular developer platform. These announcements come as the semiconductor giant is pushing further into robotics as it looks toward the next big use case for its AI GPUs beyond AI data centers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk confirmed over the weekend reports that Tesla has disbanded the team working on its Dojo AI training supercomputer, just weeks after announcing he expected to have Tesla's second cluster operating “at scale” in 2026. “Once it became clear that all paths converged to AI6, I had to shut down Dojo and make some tough personnel choices, as Dojo 2 was now an evolutionary dead end,” Musk posted on X, the social media platform he owns, on Sunday. After bringing its first Dojo supercomputer to life and powering it with a mix of Nvidia GPUs and in-house-made D1 chips, Tesla had planned to build a second Dojo factory — referred to by Musk as “Dojo 2” — that would have been powered by a second-generation D2 chip. It appears the D2 chip under development has been shelved along with the broader Dojo project as Tesla shifts its focus to its AI5 and AI6 chips, which are being manufactured by TSMC and Samsung, respectively. The AI5 chip is primarily built to power FSD, Tesla's driver assistance system, while AI6 is designed for both onboard inference — meaning, it promises to power self-driving in cars and autonomous capabilities in humanoid robots — and large-scale AI training. “It doesn't make sense for Tesla to divide its resources and scale two quite different AI chip designs,” Musk posted late Friday evening. Talk of Dojo halted around August 2024 when Musk began touting Cortex instead, a “giant new AI training supercluster being built at Tesla HQ in Austin to solve real-world AI.” The shift in strategy comes at a time when Tesla is experiencing falling EV sales and significant brand damage after Musk's forays into politics.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Learning to code and working hard hasn't been quite enough to land the coveted tech jobs and six-figure starting salaries that computer science graduates were promised, according to a new report in The New York Times this weekend. As the industry grapples with layoffs and the rise of artificial intelligence tools that can perform jobs faster, recent grads paint a picture in which they're applying for hundreds if not thousands of tech positions only to be ghosted and left feeling “gaslit” about their career prospects. Other firms are using AI to automatically scan resumes and reject candidates. Some graduates described feeling caught in an AI “doom loop,” The Times reported. Seattle-based Humanly unveiled “AI interviewers” last month in which job candidates interact with an AI-generated video interviewer. “It's hard to stay motivated when you feel like an algorithm determines whether you get to pay your bills,” the grad told the Times. In that story, Amazon was said to have hired more than 100 engineers from the latest graduating class at UW's Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering — an all-time high, according to university data shared with GeekWire. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that while the U.S. labor market is cooling, AI can be ruled out — so far — as a culprit in any hiring slowdown. U.S. workers whose jobs involve tasks that AI can do are actually much less likely than other workers to be unemployed, according to an analysis by the Economic Innovation Group.

SafeBreach researchers have revealed how a malicious Google Calendar invite could be used to exploit Gemini—the AI assistant that Google has built into its Workplace software suite, Android operating system, and search engine—as part of their ongoing efforts to determine the dangers posed by the rapid integration of AI in tech products. The researchers dubbed an exploit like this "promptware" because it "utilizes a prompt—a piece of input via text, images, or audio samples—that is engineered to exploit an LLM interface at inference time to trigger malicious activity, like spreading spam or extracting confidential information." The broader security community has underestimated the risks associated with promptware, SafeBreach said, and this report is meant to demonstrate just how much havoc these exploits can wreak. At a high level, this particular exploit took advantage of Gemini's integration with the broader Google ecosystem, the ability to clutter up Google Calendar's user interface with invitations, and their intended victim's habit of thanking an automaton for... automaton-ing. The researchers said they disclosed the flaws to Google in February and that Google "published a blog that provided an overview of its multi-layer mitigation approach to secure Gemini against prompt injection techniques" in June. Companies introduce new technologies, people find ways to exploit them, companies occasionally come up with defenses against those exploits, and then people find something else to take advantage of. But a number of factors combine to make this report more alarming than it might be otherwise. Those include SafeBreach's point about security pros not taking promptware seriously, the "move fast and break things" approach companies are taking with their "AI" deployments, and the incorporation of these chatbots into seemingly every product a company offers. "According to our analysis, 73% of the threats posed to end users by an LLM personal assistant present a High-Critical risk," SafeBreach said. "We believe this is significant enough to require swift and dedicated mitigation actions to secure end users and decrease this risk."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of their revenue from their specialized chip sales in China, in a deal so unconventional the business world is still reeling. The arrangement, effectively a new kind of “export tax,” is an unprecedented move that ends a months-long blockade and reopens one of the world's largest markets for America's two most valuable chipmakers. Nvidia and AMD chips are highly sought after by companies and governments to train their AI tools in the current AI race. For Nvidia and AMD, agreeing to pay the government a portion of their profits was the lesser of two evils. Being completely locked out of the Chinese market was a financial catastrophe. After the administration blocked its China-specific chips in April, the company was forced to take a $4.5 billion charge for excess inventory it could no longer sell. Faced with losing billions, handing over 15% of future sales was a price they were willing to pay. That move triggered months of intense, high-stakes lobbying, marked by several White House visits from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, which ultimately led to this new arrangement. “We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” it reads. “While we haven't shipped H2O to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.” The spokesperson added: “America cannot repeat 5G and lose telecommunications leadership. America's AI tech stack can be the world's standard if we race.” This new deal is a radical departure from traditional trade policy. Governments typically encourage and subsidize exports from their national champions to boost trade balances. This new model, however, forces America's most successful companies to pay for the privilege of competing abroad. It's a pragmatic compromise that gives Nvidia a path to reclaim its dominant market position and potentially push its market value past the unprecedented $5 trillion threshold. But it also sets a startling precedent for how the U.S. government could exert control over its most strategic industries in the future. AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earcups are plush, and the headband is padded, so having these on for extended periods won't leave you with red, sore ears. Noise cancelling is the big feature here, but Bose makes it flexible. Quiet mode blocks out the world when you want to be completely immersed in whatever's playing. Aware mode lets you stay connected to the background voices and laughter while still enjoying quality audio. Working in a cafe and want to hear when the barista calls your name? It lets you fine-tune the bass, mid-range, and treble for a personalized experience. They're also versatile, so you can connect to multiple devices at once and switch between them without constant re-pairing. Long commutes and work hours will be covered, too. Bose packs these with up to 24 hours of battery life on a single charge – enough for one full day of listening. Even better, a quick 15-minute top-up gives you about 2.5 hours of playback. They are essentially wireless, but Bose does include an audio cable so you can keep listening even when the battery levels are running low or you just don't have a stable Bluetooth connection. Overall, this is a solid chance to pick up a pair of premium over-ear headphones at one of the best prices we've seen. You're getting excellent comfort, two audio modes that let you customize your experience, a solid battery life, and more. At $229, it is still a bit of an investment, but you're paying for gear that's made to last. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. The laptop you bring to college is important. Not only is it the device you'll be using through some of the most formative years of your life, but it's also often the one that you'll take to your first job, too. I've tested each of the following laptops and can wholeheartedly recommend them. You can even find some deals on laptop accessories. If there is a quintessential college laptop, it's the MacBook Air M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). And even as Apple Silicon has transformed the MacBook Air into something far more capable, Apple has kept prices low enough to still make it the go-to choice. That's even cheaper than the student discount offered by Apple. What makes the MacBook Air such a perfect college laptop is its long battery life and portability. It's the kind of device that can go with you across campus and last well into the evening of studying all on a single charge. You can choose between the 13- ad 15-inch models, both of which are nearly identical, except the latter has more screen real estate and better speakers. When I initially tested the Dell 14 Plus (6/10, WIRED Review), I gave it a hard time because of the $1,100 MSRP. But over the past month or so, Dell has kept a pretty generous discount intact. Right now, the starting configuration costs $750, which might not sound that cheap at face value, but when you consider what you're getting, you realize just how good a deal this is. First off, that $750 gets you a whopping 1 terabyte of storage and a higher-resolution display (2560 x 1600), matching the MacBook Air in sharpness. It can even match the MacBook Air's battery life claims. And no, while it's not as thin or sleek as the MacBook Air, in exchange you get extra storage and more ports, making this my go-to pick for back-to-school season this year. The Asus Vivobook 14 (6/10, WIRED Review) has been my favorite budget laptop to come out this year, namely because it solves one of the main problems with laptops in this price range: battery life. I also wish the touchpad were a bit more precise. But at this price, you won't find a better Windows laptop, especially since it comes with 512 GB of storage. 2-in-1 laptops (otherwise known as detachables) are a great option for college. They're the lightest devices you can carry around that still give you access to a full version of Windows. When it came out, it was too expensive compared to the larger 13-inch model, but on sale, it makes for an ideal college companion for note-taking in class and studying on the go. Just remember: You'll need to buy the keyboard, as it doesn't come bundled in. The Razer Blade 16 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite gaming laptop, and it'd be a fantastic pick for college students if only it weren't so incredibly expensive. Normally, it starts at $2,400 for the RTX 5060 model, but Razer has a $400 back-to-school discount, meaning you can pick one up for as low as $2,000. I know that's not cheap, especially for this graphics card, but for a Razer Blade it's a rare discount. While you could buy just about any gaming laptop and pretend it's a school device, lugging that thing to class will be a nuisance, and once you get there, the design might be a distraction. The latest Razer Blade 16 is just 0.58 inches thick, making it surprisingly portable for a 16-inch gaming laptop. Despite its low price, the Asus Chromebook CX14 (6/10, WIRED Review) isn't half bad. It has a 1080p screen, even if it's not the best one I've tested, and there are lots of ports. It's reasonably portable with a solid keyboard to type on, too. As usual with cheap laptops, the touchpad isn't the best, and battery life won't get you through a full day. If your budget is under $300, look no further. But as the price of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends) proves, there are plenty of great deals to be found. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus has a superb OLED screen, something that's not common in Chromebooks, even those with the “Chromebook Plus” designation. The Galaxy Chromebook Plus not only has a bright, 15.6-inch OLED display, but also the kind of high-end specs you'll most likely need for college. Alternatively, you can also pick up a slightly older Intel model that comes with a more powerful RTX 4070 for the same price. Either way, what you're getting is an extremely capable laptop with some extra performance behind it for those who need it. And yeah, it's also a killer gaming laptop in your downtime. This was my favorite new laptop of 2024, and almost a year later it's still without a doubt one of the best laptops you could bring to school. My favorite feature is the 3:2 aspect ratio display, which means it has a taller shape, giving you more vertical screen space to work with than most other laptops. It's $999 right now, and it will get you great performance with the Snapdragon X Elite chipset and all-day battery life. But trust me, your future self will thank you if you start using proper ergonomics earlier on in life, such as a laptop stand. This simple, cheap laptop stand is perfect for your dorm room and can fold down when you don't need it. You'll need to pair it with a good mouse and keyboard once you've raised the laptop to proper eye level. There are tons of great laptop bags for lugging your new laptop around campus with you, and it's a great time to upgrade from whatever you were using in high school. This backpack is a common sight in schools for good reason. Many of the laptops above don't include a full selection of ports, which you may need from time to time as a student. That's why everyone likely needs some kind of USB-C hub. I like this 9-port hub from Plugable because it supports USB-C power delivery, despite being relatively cheap. If you need something more powerful, consider the Satechi 8-in-1 Multiport Adapter or this 5-in-1 option from Anker, which is a more budget-friendly and basic alternative. You can't go off to college without a decent pair of earbuds, especially since you'll be needing to focus in public places many times. Sure, a pair of AirPods works just fine, but if you're looking for a cheaper alternative, our audiophiles have tested dozens of pairs of budget earbuds to recommend the SoundPEATS Capsule3 Pro+ (10/10, WIRED Recommends) as the way to go.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study by researchers at Northwestern University has set off alarm bells about the future of academic research, warning that the publication of fraudulent science is growing at a faster rate than that of legitimate research. This model, similar to that of a commercial enterprise, has proven to be efficient and has been replicated in most regions of the world. The authors argue that due to the large scale and specialization of contemporary science, the contribution of each actor is no longer evaluated by the intrinsic merit of their work, but by quantitative indicators, such as the number of research papers published, how often articles are cited by other research, university rankings, or by awards and other recognitions obtained. “These indicators have rapidly become targets for measuring institutional and personal impact, which has generated unbridled competition and growing inequality in the distribution of resources, incentives, and rewards,” the authors warn. “The use of numerical metrics to evaluate projects and professionals … encourages the search for shortcuts,” says Pere Puigdomènech, president of the Committee for Research Integrity in Catalonia (CIR-CAT) in Spain. The research team behind this paper, led by Luis A. N. Amaral, professor of Engineering Science and Applied Mathematics at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering, reached this conclusion after analyzing large volumes of data on retracted publications, editorial records, and image duplication. This analysis highlighted the work of “papermills”—unscrupulous organizations that mass-produce low-quality manuscripts and sell these, sometimes through intermediaries, to academics looking to publish material quickly. “These networks are essentially criminal organizations, acting together to fake the process of science,” Amaral said in a statement published by Northwestern University. The researchers warn that more and more scientists are engaging with these networks, where they are not only acquiring articles, but also citations and authorship positions in papers, allowing them to appear prestigious without having conducted their own research. To delve deeper into the phenomenon, the team developed a parallel project aimed at detecting articles coming from these papermills. An automatic analysis system was used on a large body of materials-engineering research and related sciences to identify authors who incorrectly reported the instruments used in their studies, a potential giveaway of a piece of research being fraudulent. The experiment uncovered fraudulent articles even in prestigious journals such as PLOS ONE. It also detected a strategy in which these papermills seek out defunct journals to usurp their names or websites, giving the appearance of legitimacy to fake publications they then release under those titles. “Millions of dollars are invested in this process.” To curb this threat, the Northwestern researchers propose a number of measures: strengthening the scrutiny of editorial processes, implementing more effective methods to detect false research, developing better understanding of the networks that facilitate these practices, and radically restructuring the incentive system in science. “If we're not prepared to deal with the fraud that's already occurring, then we're certainly not prepared to deal with what generative AI can do to scientific literature,” warned Reese Richardson, a postdoctoral researcher at the McCormick School of Engineering and first author of the Northwestern study, in a statement.
