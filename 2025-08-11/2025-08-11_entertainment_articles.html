                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Universal Pictures said Monday it is moving DreamWorks Animation's Shrek 5 from December 23, 2026 to Wednesday, June 30, 2027. In addition, Universal said today that an untitled Illumination event movie is going earlier in 2027, from June 30 to April 16. It takes the place of an untitled Universal event film that had been on the release date calendar. Shrek repertoire members Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz are coming back to voice their signature roles of Shrek, Donkey and Fiona, respectively, As previously announced, Zendaya is joining the cast. Shrek 5 will be directed by franchise veterans Conrad Vernon and Walt Dohrn. Vernon's directing credits include Shrek 2 and Madagascar 2, and is the voice of Gingerbread Man (aka Gingy) in the Shrek films. Dohrn also voiced the character of Rumpelstilskin in Shrek Forever After. The film is produced by returning producer Gina Shay (Trolls franchise), who produced Shrek Forever After, and by Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri. The four Shrek movies have amassed $2.9 billion at the global box office in addition to a global live-touring show; an award-winning Broadway musical that earned eight Tony nominations and 12 Drama Desk nominations; plus an immersive, top tourist destination in London; and popular events and attractions across Universal Studios Parks worldwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Westside Merchandising says the Baton Rouge, La., rapper breached their contract by hiring a new merch partner for his first-ever headlining tour. As YoungBoy Never Broke Again prepares to embark on his MASA Tour this September, the rapper has been hit with a lawsuit for allegedly trying to cut an established merchandise partner out of his first-ever headlining trek. YoungBoy (Kentrell DeSean Gaulden) and his label Never Broke Again face the claims in a federal complaint filed Friday (Aug. 8) by retail partner Westside Merchandising. Yet even now that YoungBoy is free (and pardoned by President Donald Trump), he's allegedly still not marketing the apparel on Instagram as promised. In fact, soon after announcing his MASA arena tour in May, YoungBoy sent Westside a letter announcing he was terminating their contract due to “poor performance” on the company's part. “The purpose behind defendants' purported termination is clear: YoungBoy has embarked on a nationwide 32-date lucrative tour, and defendants have obviously obtained a new advance from another company to handle the touring merchandise even though defendants are contractually obligated to use Westside,” reads the complaint. “Westside has an exclusive license to sell Never Broke Again merchandise — rights that upon information and belief will be infringed by the new merchandise that will be sold at YoungBoy's upcoming tour.” Westside is now seeking a court order confirming that it is entitled to handle merch at the MASA Tour — scheduled to kick off Sept. 1 at Dallas' American Airlines Center — as well as financial damages from YoungBoy. “Although Westside was diligent, obtained numerous opportunities for the venture, and performed all of its contractual duties in good faith, YoungBoy did nothing except fail to perform his duties, while impeding Westside's efforts, and causing the parties to lose significant opportunities and profits,” says the complaint.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: In a competitive situation, A24 has acquired genre writer Ian Tuason‘s horror film The Undertone, securing worldwide rights following its July 27th premiere at the Fantasia Film Festival. While unconfirmed, we're told that there were six buyers in the mix, and that the deal was for mid-7 figures — a momentous one for a young filmmaker unveiling his debut feature. The Undertone stars Nina Kiri as Evy, a paranormal podcast host who returns home to care for her dying mother. Thereafter, she begins receiving recordings from a married couple plagued by strange noises in their house, pulling her into a spiral of fear and paranoia. In her description of the film for Fantasia Fest, programming director Carolyn Mauricette wrote, “Fans of SKINAMARINK and I AM THE PRETTY THING WHO LIVES IN THE HOUSE will love this slow-burn nightmare that will make hackles on your neck rise and your blood chill.” Exec producers include Steven Schneider and Roy Lee for Spooky Pictures, Chad Archibald for Black Fawn Films, Brit MacRae and Daril Fannin for Kino Studios, and DimensionGate. A Toronto-based writer-director active in the genre space, who won a Watty Award in 2016, Tuason's live-action virtual reality horror shorts have garnered over 14M organic views on YouTube, showcasing at SXSW, Fantasia Film Festival, and the Marché du Film NEXT Pavilion in Cannes. The deal was negotiated by Black Fawn Distro and 3 Arts Entertainment, whose Will Rowbotham and Luke Maxwell rep the filmmaker. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus, Chappell Roan's "The Subway" rumbles in at a career-best No. The set rules Billboard's Soundtracks chart for a seventh week. 1s in 2020-21: “Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat),” with Jawsh 685 and Jason Derulo; “Dynamite”; “Life Goes On”; “Butter”; “Permission to Dance”; and “My Universe,” with Coldplay. (HUNTR/X singers EJAE and REI AMI were born in Seoul, South Korea; Nuna is from New Jersey.) “Golden” is also the first IRL Hot 100 No. 1 by any act with a fictional background since the ensemble No. 1 “We Don't Talk About Bruno,” which reigned for five weeks in February-March 2022. It, too, was released from a hit animated film, Disney's Encanto, and sung by multiple vocalists as their characters in the movie. As for all-women collectives of three or more members, HUNTR/X is the first to top the Hot 100 in 24 years — since Destiny's Child dominated with “Bootylicious” for two weeks in August 2001. The song starts as her fourth top 10. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. The track slays for a third week at No. It makes history in the former metric, as it's the Hot 100's greatest gainer in streaming for a record-breaking sixth straight week. (It surpasses the five weekly wins in a row for Migos' “Bad and Boujee,” featuring Lil Uzi Vert, in early 2017.) Plus, “Golden” is the first non-debuting title to clear 30 million weekly official U.S. streams since Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” in late March. (In between, two songs reached the mark in their first chart weeks: Playboi Carti's “Evil J0rdan” and Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae.) Flying colors: “Golden” is the fourth Hot 100 No. 1 with “gold” or “golden” in its title to shine atop the Hot 100. ): 24kGoldn sparkled with “Mood,” featuring iann dior, for eight weeks at No. (While no songs with “silver” in their names have led topped the Hot 100, “Fly, Robin, Fly” by Silver Convention did for three weeks in 1975.) 3, marking the singer-songwriter's highest career debut and rank as she earns her fourth top 10. All four have hit the top five: “Good Luck, Babe!” and “Pink Pony Club” each rose to No. “The Subway” tallied 25.1 million streams, 787,000 in airplay audience and 6,000 sold in its first full week of tracking (no pun intended), following its July 31 release as a recording. Chappell Roan premiered the song live during her Governors Ball set on June 7, 2024, and built buzz for it by playing it regularly in concert since. Petula Clark rode her classic “Don't Sleep in the Subway” to No. 2 on the Hot 100 after nine nonconsecutive weeks at No. It claims an eighth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs (73.6 million, essentially even) and an 11th week atop the Songs of the Summer chart, having led each week since the survey made its seasonal return after Memorial Day. Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, dips 3-4 on the Hot 100 after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 2-peaking “Daisies” falls 4-5 on the Hot 100, two weeks after it debuted at its No. It's the chart's top gainer in airplay for a second week (20.9 million, up 23%). Ravyn Lenae's “Love Me Not” is steady at its No. 6 Hot 100 best, and Wallen's “Just in Case” descends 5-7 after reaching No. Saja Boys, HUNTR/X's targets in KPop Demon Hunters, climb 9-8 for a new Hot 100 high with “Your Idol.” Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024 and closed as the year's No. 1 song, backtracks 7-9 as it adds a record-extending 103rd week on the chart overall and a record-boosting 73rd week in the top 10. Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stumbles 8-10, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump announced Monday he is placing Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, and is deploying the National Guard in the city, insisting the action was necessary “to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse.” He said this would be “Liberation Day” for D.C. “I'm officially invoking section 740 of the district of Columbia home rule act,” Trump said Monday, referring to the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, which contains a provision that authorizes the president to temporarily seize control of the police in the case of an emergency for 48 hours at a time. And you can see they want to get at it. The most prominent recent example of protesters attacking law enforcement in Washington D.C. is probably Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of President Trump rioted outside the Capitol building. One hundred and forty police officers were injured in the incident, and one of those injured officers, Brian Sicknick, later died. Trump, however, focused on violence perpetrated by individuals who are under 18, as well as disbanding homeless encampments within the city. On Monday, Trump suggested he may seek to deploy the National Guard to other cities as he did to Los Angeles in June, following protests against Immigrations and Customs Enforcement raids. He mentioned Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore and Oakland. “We have other cities also that are bad,” Trump said. We're not going to lose our cities over this. Trump's announcement that the federal government would take control of D.C.'s police force was preceded by an incident involving Edward Coristine, a former DOGE staffer known by his online alias “Big Balls.” Coristine, who still works for the Social Security Administration, was injured in an attempted carjacking.

Segel suggested tapping Brett Goldstein, but Lawrence was resistant. He eventually agreed to let Goldstein take on the role on one condition: that he shave his signature facial hair to make the character, a pivotal element of the season-two plotline, more vulnerable. Shrinking did not get canceled; it received nine Emmy nominations, including its first for outstanding comedy series. Harrison Ford got his first Emmy nomination for this season; do you feel like you learned anything about how to write for him from the first season? One of the cheat sheets to successful streaming television is, at least for me, working with actors with whom I've worked before. As he grew to trust us, we realized he was game for anything, and that freed us up to write stuff for him that we normally wouldn't. I also noticed how vulnerable and emotional he was, that he made stuff sad even when we didn't put that in the script. Like the Thanksgiving dinner speech in the season-two finale; he could have delivered that matter-of-fact, and it would have worked. I'm surprised to hear you describe yourself as such. It's why I love having young writers around, because they still get that wow factor. I'm the luckiest guy on the planet, and I'm super grateful to get to do this, but one of the things that comes from getting your 10,000 hours in something is you don't expect to be surprised. How hard was it, logistically, to pull together that scene — with your entire cast in one room at the same time? It can be self-indulgent to direct your own show, but one of the reasons I directed that one is I knew I was the only one who was allowed to ask certain things of the cast for that. This season has a lot of guest stars. Do you write your ideal actors into the script? We'll often write one draft where the character isn't too specific, and then we'll go to Candice Bergen or Damon Wayans — the second they say yes, even before the ink is dry, we'll do a pass for their voice. Did you go through that same process for the character of Louis, played by Brett Goldstein? Are you used to writing and showrunning for the cadence of streaming networks by now? Whether I'm doing 26 episodes of Scrubs or 10 episodes of the Steve Carell show, I have always found a way to be completely behind schedule. I don't have the energy of a young writer anymore. They kick me out of the writer's room in the evenings now — I get grumpy, so they're like, why don't you just come back in the morning and see what we did? But one thing I'm going to watch really closely is The Pitt. We're starting to shoot the second season of Bad Monkey in a few weeks, and it was such a summer beach read last year, I wish the seasons were closer together. Shrinking gained a lot of momentum despite the large gap between seasons, do you think there's a secret to that success? The best example in Shrinking is Michael Urie. We're planning on doing a fourth season, knock on wood, and we know that if we started that season and Jason Segel's character was like, I've been thinking about it and I'm still really sad about my wife, people would be like wait you already told that exact story. They need to feel like the characters are going on new adventures. This is truly no shade to The Bear because I still find it compelling, but that's sort of what is happening with Carmen's storyline. Here's one of the ways we look at things: We're rebooting Scrubs, and I don't get to work on it a ton because I'm at Warner Brothers and it's a Disney show, but a lot of the original writers and cast got to help out on the pilot. Can you tell us anything about the new season of Shrinking? Right now our biggest goal is just locking it all down and making sure we get to make the show with the same cast. This is a business and these guys are all so good that they have one thousand options. I was excited to talk to you today specifically, because I saw Apple posted that video of Harrison on his birthday on set. What I'm assuming is going to happen is that we figure it out sooner rather than later and then we'll get Brett, me and Jason together to go talk to Harrison and the gang and say, here's the story, I hope you're up for signing up for it. We hope everyone's game for doing another one. But if you're asking me, “What are the next three seasons going to be?” Well, they're therapists, and just because you've gotten over the biggest stick in the spokes of your life doesn't mean there's no more pathos. We intentionally put these people in a world that brings all of that to their doorstep, so there's always more story to tell. We definitely put some Easter eggs into the third season that will allow people to see what's coming. This story first appeared in an August stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The rising star, who will lead filmmaker Zach Cregger's 'Resident Evil' movie, also discusses how his time on set with Josh Brolin impacted their upcoming feature 'Whalefall.' [This story contains major spoilers for Weapons.] Weapons is a watershed moment for star Austin Abrams. The 28-year-old Florida native has already booked the starring role in Cregger's next film, Resident Evil, and he's currently leading Brian Duffield's highly anticipated adaptation of Whalefall for 20th Century. Box Office: 'Weapons' Blazes to $42.5M Opening, 'Freakier Friday' Smiles Wide With $29M Bow Weapons chronicles a collection of characters in Maybrook, PA, as they orbit the baffling disappearance of 17 schoolkids at 2:17 AM. But due to the delay caused by 2023's WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes, Pascal's crowded schedule forced him to exit the role of Archer Graff. “I just wanted to do Weapons,” Abrams tells The Hollywood Reporter. “When [Cregger's Barbarian] cut to Justin Long [to begin its second act], I immediately thought, ‘Whoever the fuck made this movie, I fucking love this person.' As for his Resident Evil casting, Abrams can only speculate as to how much his loyal gesture influenced Cregger's decision to have him carry his original story in the video game-based franchise. If I did something else instead of Weapons, I certainly don't think that would've helped me do something like Resident Evil,” Abrams admits. His grieving father character eventually has a climactic confrontation with James, Abrams' homeless addict character, at the house where all the missing schoolchildren have congregated. James and Archer's borderline slapstick fight was already quite bizarre since Abrams' character was possessed by the same type of witch's spell that brought the kids to that particular home in the first place. But what makes it even more bizarre is that Brolin is currently playing Abrams' father in Duffield's aforementioned survival thriller about a scuba diver (Abrams) who's swallowed alive by a sperm whale. (The book includes a father-son flashback narrative.) “It was just really cool to come into something else and already have this weird connection with [Brolin],” Abrams says. “It almost feels like you're entering a different dimension, and while you've had an experience with this person, it's not the same person. Abrams did not get to enjoy Cregger's highly sought-after script with the witchcraft twist intact, but the reading experience was still rewarding, as was his eventual perusal of Cregger's Resident Evil screenplay. I love him, but that was annoying,” Abrams recalls mid-laugh. I just couldn't stop reading it, which is insane and how it's been with all of Zach's scripts [Resident Evil included]. Below, during a recent spoiler conversation with THR, Abrams also discusses why he pities his Weapons character, as well as the on-set story behind his instantly beloved reference to Willow. Part of me was hoping you'd be doing this interview from the innards of a whale, but I  appreciate that you were able to squeeze this in on your one day off from Whalefall. Yeah, I needed a break from inside the whale. You were part of the Weapons cast when it was a completely different ensemble. The strike then affected Pedro Pascal's schedule, and Zach had to start over except for you. Did you just get lucky to not have any other conflicts? I didn't know about the movie at all. I just thought it was going to be a regular horror movie, and I wasn't super excited going into it. And when it cut to Justin Long [to begin its second act], I immediately thought, “Whoever the fuck made this movie, I fucking love this person.” I then looked over at my friend and was like, “Holy shit.” We couldn't even sit next to each other because the theater was so packed. So when I got out of the theater, I was like, “I need to figure out how to meet this guy and work with this guy.” And it's so rare that it actually happens. Weapons then came together, and I only want to work on things that I want to work on. Zach appreciated that you “hung tough” with him. If I did something else instead of Weapons, I certainly don't think that would've helped me do something like Resident Evil. Pedro's exit from Weapons allowed you to work with Josh Brolin, who is now also playing your father in Whalefall. Given your violent interactions in Weapons, have there been any jokes on Whalefall about your polar opposite dynamics? Maybe a few, but not too many. It was just really cool to have worked with him before and then come into something else and already have this weird connection with him. It almost feels like you're entering a different dimension, and while you've had an experience with this person, it's not the same person. So I feel a really deep connection with him at this point. Weapons' climax is so dark and disturbing, and yet Josh's character's inability to put James down was hilarious. Did it actually feel comedic on the day? Well, I remember thinking, “You want me to get up again and then get up again over there?” So I don't know if I was really sure about it at the time, but I do remember it being funny. Well, my freaking agent had spoiled it. I love him, but that was annoying. I read it in one go in the middle of the night when I should have been sleeping. I just couldn't stop reading it, which is insane and how it's been with all of Zach's scripts. I don't know what it is, really. So when Josh's character unknowingly painted the cause of everything on Julia Garner's character's car, you immediately knew the game that Zach was playing. Yeah, I knew something [witchy] was going on, for sure, but I didn't know how the story was going to be told or anything like that. I've seen the film interpreted in a wide variety of ways, and I should preface this next question by saying that whatever take you offer today is by no means official. But what is your own reading of the film? Zach has talked about it in a sense that even he doesn't know what a lot of it means. A lot of it is deep, unconscious, inner-working stuff. What does the [AR-15] rifle that just pops up in Archer's [Brolin] dream mean? I probably had a take a year ago [during filming], but I've been so focused on other things since then that I can't give you a great interpretation right now. But it's all deep unconscious stuff that just floods out of Zach, and he has the skill to make that unconscious stuff work, which might be why his work is so strong and impactful. I know that each different character represents a part of himself, but beyond that, I don't know. Can you recognize the James in Zach? Yeah, he's talked about it being him at his lowest and most desperate. Do you feel pity for James since he operated under the spell of a witch and the spell of his own addiction? It just depends on what situation you grew up in, to a big degree. There's babies that are being raised by meth addicts. So I feel complete empathy for James. Yeah, is there a story behind that moment? So he was like, “Oh, can you just say Willow or something like that?” It was maybe that simple, but I don't remember that line being in the script. I think the DVD got placed there, and we just found it funny. When James was panhandling Julia's character for money to see his brother, we know that the brother part is true since he later called him and asked for money under false pretenses. But the optimist in me wants to believe that James, at that moment, genuinely wanted to go home and get help. Did Zach give you any more backstory for James? But the interesting thing about James asking for money to see his brother, is that true? Because it could be true in that moment. But once he has some money, he then might say, “I've got to get high so that I can come up with a plan to go see him.” So it's not necessarily a lie, at least not in that moment when he asks Julia's character for money. But I definitely discussed a lot of it with Zach, and he was open to me trying things and throwing things at him. He's so smart, and I just really trust his direction. IMDb can sometimes be inaccurate prior to the official release, but it had your character name written as Anthony for the longest time. Was that his name on an old script or breakdown? Yeah, that was his name at first, but between Archer and Alex, there were too many other A-names. You've had back-to-back foot chases in Wolfs and now Weapons. Did you feel more prepared for this one after going through that crucible on Wolfs? I ended up dropping some weight for Weapons, so the running was a little challenging, sometimes. But I ran for a much shorter period than the Wolfs sequence. Your Wolfs director Jon Watts used to be in a film school gang with Jake Schreier, so do you think Jake put you on Jon's radar all those years ago via Paper Towns? Yeah, they're really good friends, and I think Jon was in the editing room on Paper Towns, either watching or giving notes or just hanging out. Jon was going to make a Wolfs sequel until the movie's sudden lack of theatrical release rubbed him the wrong way. When I last spoke to Brian Duffield for No One Will Save You, he told me how Nope became a source of anxiety after his movie had already gotten moving. Well, another movie with a nearly identical premise to Brian's Whalefall announced itself in May just as you guys were about to start shooting. Has this subject come up at all on set? I didn't even know about it until weeks ago. So I really don't know much about it, but I've heard it might be a Spanish film or something like that. You're not returning for Euphoria season three, but your career and so many others have really accelerated from that show. Are there just too many big careers to juggle? There were a lot of tough situations that made it difficult. I know you're consumed by the innards of a whale right now, but Zach has already storyboarded Resident Evil. Have you also started wrapping your head around that role yet? ***Weapons is now playing in movie theaters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Weapons and Barbarian. Writer-director Zach Cregger's domestic anxieties have only gotten worse in the years since 2022's Barbarian. Leaving behind the specific issues of urban decay and gentrification, Cregger approaches broader themes for a wider audience in his major studio follow-up, Weapons. Continuing his idiosyncratic narrative structures, Cregger inverts Barbarian's form, shifting the question from “Whose house is this?” to “Whose house is that?” In doing so, his sprawling, Altman-meets-Twin Peaks dissection of a town shows how tragedy doesn't actually bring people together, but widens their divisions. Drawing from America's real-life wealth of viral, chaotic PTA and school board meetings about guns, bathrooms, and books, a meeting in an auditorium is the only scene in Weapons where the town is shown together, and it immediately falls apart, leaving the attendees to break off into the night with no hopes of communal solutions. Paul sleeps with Justine, gets caught, and takes his angry regret out on an unhoused meth addict, James (Austin Abrams). Cregger gives us a wider view of things, so we can squirm as Paul calls his wife two chapters after we saw him get with Justine. But the effect allows for a broader statement on how Americans treat each other when tragedy strikes. Clearly, Maybrook's antisocial tendencies existed before 2:17 A.M. As Archer learns, even the parents going through the same tragedy can't relate to one another; they've barely interacted. In Barbarian, he dug deep into the bones of an old house turned Airbnb. There's a specificity to Barbarian‘s primary location, 476 Barbary, the only home still standing in the decaying neighborhood of Brightmoor, Detroit. Barbarian kicked off a wave of movies about young people being lured into houses. Recently, Bring Her Back and Heretic saw innocent teens having their young lives upended by quirky adults who reveal themselves to be witches looking to shove them into an oven. Barbarian takes a different approach to a similar premise: Rather than spending the movie exploring what the villain wants, Barbarian wants to know who owns this space, and with every new revelation, we're introduced to another occupant and link in the chain that led to its current state. This narrow focus allowed Cregger to address a specific problem facing cities. By moving to the suburbs, Weapons explores a broader issue of the antisocial surveillance state, where not even single-family fortresses are safe and nobody knows their neighbors. Like Barbarian‘s Mother (Matthew Patrick Davis), Weapons‘ central villain, Gladys (Amy Madigan), is a grotesque representation of an older woman playacting as a nurturing mother. Whether or not Cregger blames mothers for societal breakdown is between the filmmaker and his therapist, but they are manifestations of a persistent neglect. She lucked out by finding a place with no shared camaraderie, and school administrators who know nothing about their students. Instead of Mother's bullet to the brain for an audience of one, Weapons concludes with a tear through an entire neighborhood, introducing us to faces, backyards, and living rooms the characters never bothered to explore beforehand.

In Korean writer/director Park Syeyoung's 2022 debut feature, “The Fifth Thoracic Vertebra,” mold on an abandoned mattress births a parasitic creature that feasts on the vertebrae of any humans it touches. The film enters more unpredictable, oddly moving territory than its B-movie-like premise may initially suggest, but that basic logline wouldn't feel out of place amongst the demonizing government propaganda that recurs throughout Park's compelling follow-up feature, “The Fin,” in which even the lightest physical contact with a minority group is portrayed as being life-threatening. Don't let them scream because the sound will kill you.Unlike a mattress monster that actually feeds on people, the othered beings in Park's second ostensible creature feature are recognizably human, even if the wider population is encouraged not to perceive them that way. Set in a speculative, post-unification Korea, “The Fin” tracks the relationship between brainwashed citizens and the underclass they've been trained to hate — and also to exploit.As a result of ecological devastation, a section of the Korean population — we're given little sense of how the rest of the world is doing — has undergone mutations that bring them closer to merfolk of legend. Known as Omegas, these mutated humans have fins and unusual feet, but otherwise look the same as the rest of their countrymen. To pass without hassle in Korea's various colonies, Omegas might cut off parts of their feet or fins, or conceal these appendages with prosthetics made by the rare “normal” person sympathetic to their plight. Any Omega discovered within a colony's borders is arrested to be exiled beyond the wall, or terminated on sight in cases where a trigger-happy government worker thinks their life is threatened by an Omega simply shouting.The non-mutated population is fed the suggestion that Omegas' screams are lethal outside of water, that their fins are full of toxins, and that when they die, they release radiation. Citizens are encouraged to reduce bathing for the greater good. Among the dirty-faced population, nostalgia for the sea and fishing becomes something that enterprising business owners can exploit. The film's opening narration draws on memories of water, infusing exposition about the dystopia with a personal touch. My first memory is of a blood-red sky. They tasted bitter, and I was sick all night. Father spent the night coughing as well. As this final photo in the montage starts to dissolve from view, a close-up of a young adult woman's face gradually appears in the center of the frame. Named Mia (Yeji Yeon, “Pachinko”), she will be sought out by both an unnamed Omega (Goh-Woo), infiltrating East Colony 114 with a mission to find her and deliver a severed fin, and Sujin (Pureum Kim), a novice government recruit in the taskforce that both checks up on Omega workers collecting waste over the wall and hunts down anyone suspected of abnormalities. Related Stories Do the ‘Time Warp' Again When Cinespia Screens ‘Rocky Horror' This October ‘Dracula' Review: Radu Jude's Gloriously Stupid Vampire Epic Is the First Movie to Make Any Meaningful Use of Generative AI Through Sujin, Park explores the mindset of someone following orders but beginning to doubt the state's ideology, and the subsequent contagion of fear that has infected so many in such unpleasant ways —  a notion that will prove all too timely in a good number of the countries where the film may be released. Sujin's ailing mother barely speaks, but when she does, it's mainly to spit venom at the mere mention of Omegas, suggesting that they should all be killed. Mia, meanwhile, represents the inner conflicts of the assimilated “other.” She passes by keeping elements of her identity a secret, buys into at least parts of the propaganda targeting the minority group she's secretly from, and is openly hostile when coming face-to-face with someone from that group reaching out to her.Patient in its pacing, “The Fin” is an engrossing mood piece rather than a dystopian tale based around constant clashes, even though the threat of violence is always looming. Like in “The Fifth Thoracic Vertebra,” Park, once again serving as his own cinematographer, gets a lot of mileage out of a strange kind of intimacy achieved through characters unwittingly being observed from a distance, be it through slightly open doors or high up from above. The wider aesthetic favors hazy saturation, the colors of city streets and the outside wilderness — each dead zones in their own way — at times recalling a post-apocalyptic touchstone like Konstantin Lopushansky's “Visitor to a Museum,” and in other places, Guy Maddin and Evan Johnson's recent collaborations like “The Forbidden Room.”As an independent production, “The Fin” is largely effective in its expressionistic solutions to budgetary limitations, with a pleasing tactility to the practical effects on display. It's a propaganda ad in an explicitly dystopian story, so it's obviously supposed to make you feel unpleasant, but there's something a little off about the imagery and motion in these brief clips; an uncanny quality inherent to poor simulacra of real art direction.Then we reach one of the longest clips in the propaganda video and the depressing explanation becomes apparent. A shot of the backs of several yellow-jacketed figures looking at a faraway statue only lasts a few seconds, but within that time, many of the still figures warp shape. Some “people” blur together, while others see the lower halves of their legs suddenly separate from the rest of their bodies. If you've been unlucky enough to have working eyes in the past few years, you'll recognize this as unmistakably an example of generative AI being used instead of real footage being shot. With all due respect to the pressures of making an unconventional sci-fi film on a tight budget, using ecologically destructive technology for a story of ecological devastation, in which clean water is an increasingly rare resource, adds an unintentionally grim layer of irony to the tale.

It's fitting that the first good movie to meaningfully incorporate AI into its aesthetic should be about an undead bloodsucker that feeds on humanity in order to seem alive. And yet, for a three-hour film that opens with a chorus of computer-generated Vlad the Impalers staring into camera and demanding that we suck their cocks, Radu Jude's gleefully stupid “Dracula” proves much too expansive — and much too invested in the centuries of barbarism that paved the way toward Silicon Valley — to be misunderstood as a simple rebuke against the grotesqueries of algorithmic image-making. Jude is an erudite man of the people whose hyper-literate intellectualism is only matched by his Chaucer-like vulgarity, and his work has long reveled in an impish fascination with the relationship between art, labor, and technology. Related Stories Do the ‘Time Warp' Again When Cinespia Screens ‘Rocky Horror' This October ‘The Fin' Review: A Compelling Sci-Fi Drama About Mutated Outcasts in a Seemingly Unified Korea A quasi-picaresque anthology about an unnamed director (“Kontinental '25” standout Adonis Tanța) who relies on a Transylvanian bot to salvage his new vampire movie after it only earns an 80 percent approval score from its latest test audience, “Dracula” provides Jude a perfectly dumb excuse to unleash AI on the cinema, literature, and history of a civilization that had already been feeding on its own neck for a century or longer before ChatGPT first came online. Here is a film that feasts on AI image-making in its ugliest and most nascent form in order to argue that it really isn't anything new — that its cannibalistic appetite and taste for exploitation are precisely what make this technology such an honest expression of the culture that created it. With “Dracula,” Jude makes a fun and wildly freewheeling case that it sucks now in much the same way that it's sucked for the last several hundred years, and in doing so he suggests that AI might be more interesting for what it reveals about the way things haven't changed than it is for what it threatens to change about them. The technology is central to this project, as well as the ostensible author of the film's 14 segments, wraparound story, and framing device, but “Dracula” mostly relies on algorithmic kinks and chimeras to lubricate more analog examples of the past eating itself — to use images of, and stories about, Vlad the Impaler to illustrate how easily history is stripped of its meaning. Shot on an iPhone and steeped in its film's local bent (there's an inherent humor to the idea that Jude is tackling his country's most famous legend on such frivolous terms), the wraparound story forces “Dracula” back to that mission whenever it threatens to wander too far astray. Jude doesn't waste any time poking fun at the mass appeal madness of trying to create something for everyone. A group of American vacationers are seen in the crowd with their kids. One European woman, meanwhile, has clearly just come to work out her kinks, and leaps at the chance to bid on a backstage tryst with the limp-dicked old man playing the immortal vampire (Gabriel Spahiu as Sandu). Lest anyone imagined that Jude's film would offer a more reverent take on Romanian history, the sight of that naked theater-goer shouting “Lick my pussy, Dracula!” at the impotent actor behind her legs should be enough to put such thoughts to rest. One evening, however, the two actors conspire to make a break for it — to stay hidden from the horde of paying customers, escape from the exploitative conditions of their jobs, and use their meager earnings to start new lives in another country. In turn, the director of the show invites his audience to kill his cast for real; a serious gamble on his part, as Elon Musk and Donald Trump have supposedly booked their own private performance for the following month. Sitting at his desk and speaking to camera in between each of the film's segments, Tanța's character recognizes that we're curious about the fate of Sandu and Vampira, and graciously agrees to check in on them whenever the mood strikes. In the meantime, he busies himself by asking his AI bot to mock up a wide variety of Dracula riffs, most of which — per AI's functionality — are Frankensteined together from previous takes on the story and/or the published histories they ingested as part of their creation. Murnau's “Nosferatu” to stream footage from that vampire classic, only for the clips to be overrun with internet detritus like pop-up ads for penis-enlargement surgery and the like (it's a rare instance in which Jude's extremely cock-centric sense of humor deigns to use a more polite word for the male sex organ). Another runs into rights troubles when it tries to summon the multiplex eroticism of Francis Ford Coppola's “Dracula,” forcing the director to re-create that Eiko Ishioka-designed fever dream with a nightmare-inducing AI orgy that hallucinates bloody new sex organs into every fold of the human body. Most of the vignettes tend to dig a bit deeper than mere cine-literate sight gags and in-jokes, even if they aren't substantially more highbrow for doing so. A wheelchair-bound grandma new to the facility is treated to a screening of some old Romanian films, when suddenly things go all “Sherlock Jr.” on her; the next thing she knows, Vlad the Impaler is standing before her in the flesh and demanding an exchange of fluids: He'll drink from her neck, and she'll give him a blow job. Jude later flips the script with a relatively dry and dutiful adaptation of Nicolae Velea's Romania-famous romance novel “Just So,” only to spoil the story's tragic emotional climax with a hilariously bad serving of gen-AI slop. I'm not sure that punchline is worth the 30 minutes or so it takes to set up (refreshing as it is to see Jude operate in a more classical mode for a while), but it's safe to say that no one will ever accuse the filmmaker of taking himself too seriously now that he's on the verge of displacing Cristian Mungiu as his country's most visible auteur. Compelled by the enduring savagery of a modern world that sells itself as being more evolved than the burial ground on which it was built, his films — as ultra-referential to the past as they are indifferent to it — have flourished at a time when history is being made by the same people who are most determined to erase it. That notion is most pronounced in a segment that plays on the Marxist concept of “dead labor,” undead in this case. It's called “Das Kapital,” and it finds Vlad returning to life as the ruthlessly capitalistic CEO of a gaming company whose employees farm experience points in order to sell their beefed-up accounts to lazy American players. Set on the site of a famous 20th century labor dispute but framed against a backdrop of MMORPGs and Twitter-era xenophobia, this ridiculous vignette — complete with Tanța as a boot-licking C-3PO — is the logical climax of a film that name drops both Umberto Eco and Britney Spears, and affords them roughly the same importance. In a far more pointed way than the film's stolid 50-minute re-creation of Romania's first vampire novel, or the similarly overstretched later chapter that offers a bawdy folk tale inspired by the author Ion Creangă (it starts with Jesus, and ends with Manoloche being pleasantly terrorized by a crudely animated flying dildo), “Das Kapital” collapses the distance between high and low, history and its end. The only distinction that matters in the end is what's alive and what's not, and Jude's exhaustingly exhilarating “Dracula” makes an effective case that it will only get harder to tell the difference from here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Sunday's episode of Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver observed that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a.k.a. “Now, I'm not saying that ICE isn't finding people. Cain has lately taken advantage of a general interest in Superman (a character he played nearly 30 years ago) to claw his way back into the zeitgeist—or at least adjacent to the zeitgeist. He generated some headlines for calling the latest Superman too woke and capitalized on the attention by announcing he was going to join ICE, which some out there (not us, you understand, but some) are calling extreme loser behavior. “Although, on the plus side, no need for that guy to wear a mask because the chances of anyone recognizing him are fucking zero,” Oliver snarked on his show. Oliver had bigger fish to fry than a handful of B-movies. During the segment dedicated to immigration under Donald Trump's administration, the comedian shared with his audience what to do if you're approached by ICE agents. But that really is it.” You can watch the full video below.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Susan Flannery, who played Laura Spencer Horton on “Days of Our Lives” and Stephanie Douglas Forrester on “The Bold and the Beautiful,” is moving Down Under. Her daughter, Blaise, has lived in Australia for years with her children, so plenty of family time is in Susan's future! Her close friend from Days, Susan Seaforth Hayes, shared the news in a new Instagram post. The iconic soap star has been close to both Susan Seaforth Hayes and Suzanne Rogers since the earliest  “Days of Our Lives” era. When speaking about getting the role of Maggie, she said, “Susan Flannery was a big influence. I've always had a warm place in my heart for Susan.” All three ladies got together before Susan's big move. The occasion: Susan Flannery, one of the great ladies of daytime or anywhere she turns up- is moving to Australia. Laughs, love, tears, hugs… just like Salem.We will miss her.” It was recently confirmed that Blaise now lives in Australia with her children. The actress's soap career is a dream come true. She earned 10 nominations in the Outstanding Lead Actress category at the Daytime Emmys, winning on her first try, in 1975, for her work on “Days of Our Lives.” Three more wins followed for her portrayal of B&B's Stephanie. Flannery became the first actress ever to win the Lead Actress award for two different roles on two different soaps. She remains close friends with former co-star Katherine Kelly Lang, who has frequently posted photos of the two of them together.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His husband, Hallmark star Jonathan Bennett, shared the emotional update on August 10, 2025. “This is the first time over the over 3,400 meals I've sat across from him where I didn't feel like he was fighting for his life just to get through it,” Bennett captioned a social media photo that showed Vaughan chewing his food at a restaurant and getting choked up — not by the meal, but by the sheer emotion of being able to swallow his food normally. “My husband has a condition that made it impossible for him to eat without throwing up for almost his entire adult life,” Bennett revealed, and then shared more about the procedure that is changing Vaughan's life. A person with the condition then struggles to swallow and may experience burning or sharp pains in their chest when they eat. For two decades, Vaughan didn't know why he had so much trouble eating nor that he had a Schatzki ring, named for the radiologist who first discovered the condition, per Cleveland Clinic. “Sharing this in case it could help someone who has this condition but didn't know about it for 20 years like my husband,” Bennett wrote in his post. Social media followers flooded Bennett's video, in which Vaughan got teary-eyed as he marveled at being able to swallow with ease. Another fellow Hallmark star, Hunter King, wrote, “❤️ this angel deserves the world!! So happy for him that he can now enjoy a delicious meal without worry. He now knows the feeling of what we take for granted every day! I know it was hard watching him struggle, so happy for you too!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bobby Whitlock, the singer-keyboardist and co-founder of 1970s blues-rock band Derek & the Dominos alongside Eric Clapton, has died, according to his manager, Carol Kaye. 's, the Staples Singers, Albert King, and others, eventually weaseling his way into their circuit by way of that respectful admiration. Though Stax mentor Steve Cropper took him under his wing and Donald “Duck” Dunn and Don Nix were planning to produce a pop album by him, Whitlock decided to leave Memphis to pursue music with the rock and soul duo Delaney & Bonnie. While touring with the duo, Whitlock met numerous musicians that he would collaborate with later on in his career, like Bobby Keys and Jim Price, as well as future Derek & the Dominos members Carl Radle and Jim Gordon. (Looking back on that leg, Clapton would describe Whitlock as “the most energetic sideman I had ever seen.”) Once Delaney & Bonnie dropped their live album On Tour with Eric Clapton in 1970, Whitlock was eager to test his skills in a new band. He reunited with Clapton, Radle, and Gordon for a quick session before getting an invite to join Clapton on his debut solo album, Eric Clapton, and to accompany George Harrison in the studio as he recorded All Things Must Pass, the late guitarist's third solo album and first following the Beatles' breakup. 1 album, playing organ, piano, harmonium, tubular bells, and backing vocals on most tracks, including the hits “My Sweet Lord” and “What Is Life.” Upon regrouping, the four musicians started Derek & the Dominos as a blues-rock group focused on forming ideas at a natural pace and reveling in their relaxed friendship. After welcoming guitarist Dave Mason and coming up with their new band name, a rushed idea-turned-bungled onstage introduction, Derek & the Dominos played their first show and then entered the studio in June 1970 to record the singles “Tell the Truth” and “Roll It Over” with Phil Spector. That autumn, after Mason's departure, they hit up producer Tom Dowd to track their debut full-length: the 1970 double album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. Together, Whitlock and Clapton wrote effortlessly romantic blues-rock hits like “Bell Bottom Blues” and “Layla,” the latter a seven-minute sprawler that, belatedly, became a staple of classic rock radio and a highlight of Clapton's career overall. They recorded only one studio LP together, but it's since considered to be a classic of the genre for its songwriting and performances—including one from the Allman Brothers Band's Duane Allman, who brought extensive contributions on lead and slide guitar, although he was not technically a member of the band. Halfway through writing their second album, Derek & the Dominos dissolved in a fit of tension and depression following the death of numerous friends in the months prior; Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident, and Jimi Hendrix died suddenly in his girlfriend's apartment. He released his self-titled debut studio album in 1972 and followed it with Raw Velvet later that same year. He went on to record four more solo albums, a few live LPs, and a handful of collaborative full-lengths with his partner Coco Carmel. In 2024, Whitlock was awarded a Brass Music Note on Memphis' own Beale Street Walk of Fame for his work. “My business is to try to conduct myself as a decent person and a gentleman as much as I can, get through this world, navigate through this without making too many waves. Because my addition made that music mine as well—whether it's a Jeff Healy record or whatever.
