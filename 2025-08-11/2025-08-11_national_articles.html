                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is holding a press conference following President Donald Trump's announcement Monday that he's taking over Washington's police department and activating 800 members of the National Guard in the hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed crime is already falling in the nation's capital. President Trump is invoking Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act to take over control of the city's police department, saying in a letter to a congressional committee that the police force is needed for federal purposes. By invoking the law, Trump is able to take over the police for more than 48 hours, but if he wants to continue for more than 30 days, both the House and Senate would need to give him a vote of approval. His statement did not mention any immediate actions congressional Democrats would take in response to Trump's plan. On his first day in office, he pardoned hundreds of violent felons—many of whom brazenly assaulted law enforcement officers on January 6,” he continued. “Export controls are a frontline defense in protecting our national security, and we should not set a precedent that incentivizes the government to grant licenses to sell China technology that will enhance its AI capabilities,” said the Republican from Michigan. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that the city had reached a 30-year low in violent crime. Bowser said that the steps were “unsettling” but not without precedent. Union chairman Gregg Pemberton said it agrees with the president that “immediately action is necessary” to tamp down crime.

Wes Moore says Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard in D.C. is also “deeply dangerous.” “He is simply using honorable men and women as pawns to distract us from his policies, which continue to drive up unemployment and strip away health care and food assistance from those who need it most,” Moore said. “We await outreach from the White House if they want to have a serious conversation about public safety. An email to the Office of Management and Budget on Monday was not immediately returned. It argued publicly disclosing spending decisions intrudes on executive power. The administration has faced numerous lawsuits over decisions to freeze spending authorized by Congress. Al Sharpton speaks during a ceremony in celebration of Roberta Flack's life at The Abyssinian Baptist Church on Monday, March 10, 2025, in New York. Following President Donald Trump's announcement on Monday that he would deploy National Guard troop to take over the city's police department, civil rights leader Rev. “Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” Sharpton said in a statement. “Let's call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration's handling of the Epstein files.” Sharpton said D.C.'s leadership must push back on the president's use of Washington D.C. and its residents as “political props.” “Threatening to hit if people spit, calling all Black and low-income neighborhoods slums, and throwing away the humanity of homeless people by equating them to criminals is the beginning of the end if we don't stand up. District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb says crime is not an emergency levels. The federal takeover could face a challenge in court, and Schwalb said his office is “considering all of our options.” Trump said a couple of times during the press briefing that he would be traveling to Russia to meet with Vladimir Putin -- but their summit is taking place in Alaska. “I'm going to Russia on Friday,” he said in one instance. He also made an erroneous reference at another time to the summit being next week instead. Later during the briefing, he joked they may be violating fire codes. “I've done this for years now, hard to believe,” he said. In fact, I'm sure it's a violation of every fire code.” Trump says he can see a scenario where the U.S. and Russia normalize trade relations if things go well at his meeting with Putin later this week. FILE - This combination of photos shows Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, in Moscow on May 9, 2025, and President Donald Trump in Washington on Aug. 1. He said “Russia has a very valuable piece of land” and mused about what would happen if “Putin would go toward business instead of war.” As for the prospect of progress at that meeting? The U.S.-China trade truce ends Aug. 12 and if it isn't extended, rates on Chinese goods could climb back to over 80%. “They've been dealing quite nicely,” Trump said, adding that he has a good relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump said “President Putin invited me to get involved” and even said he thought it was very respectful that Putin is coming to U.S. territory for the meeting in Alaska, instead of insisting that Trump go to Russia. The president said marijuana “does bad for the children,” but that easing penalties associated with it is a “very complicated subject” because some people support doing so. Trump said he'd “heard great things having to do with medical” use of marijuana. Trump said he hopes other cities, including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, are watching the steps he's announced in D.C. and would take steps to “self-clean up.” He said that if needed, the administration would take similar steps in other cities and criticized their leadership at the local and state levels. In addition, Trump also said “we will bring in the military if it's needed” but added “I don't think we'll need it.” “We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said.

One executive order invoked presidential powers under the Home Rule Act to take over Washington's police force. He also signed what the administration called statutorily required notification letters to DC Mayor Bowser and relevant congressional leaders. The polarizing Food and Drug Administration official is getting his job back less than two weeks after being pressured to step down at the urging of conservative activists. Dr. Vinay Prasad is resuming leadership of FDA's center for vaccines and biotech therapies, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. Prasad left the agency last month after drawing ire of right-wing activists, including Laura Loomer, who flagged his past statements criticizing President Trump. He was also targeted by biotech executives and patient groups for briefly halting shipments of a therapy for muscular dystrophy, due to safety concerns. But Prasad has also had the backing of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. And it's embarrassing for me to be up here,” Trump said. “I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was, with graffiti all over the walls.” Trump also said he would bring in the military if needed. Watch live as Texas House Democrats hold a press conference with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin. Trump said he wants to “rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor.” The Democratic mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, has noted that violent crime in Washington has decreased since a rise in 2023. “This is liberation day in D.C. and we're going to take our Capitol back,” the president said. “We're going to clean it up real quick, very quickly,” he said. The top Democrat on a House panel focusing on competition with China raised concerns over the reported agreement that the Trump administration is to get a 15% cut from U.S. chips sales in China in exchange of granting export licenses, calling it “a dangerous misuse of export controls that undermines our national security.” FILE - Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., speaks as Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., listens during a news conference on Capitol Hill, Aug. 10, 2022, in Washington. Krishnamoorthi, head of the Economic and Consumer Policy subcommittee, on Aug. 30, asked leaders of the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Federal Trade Commission for more information on the steps they are taking to curb the growth of fraud and consumer abuse linked to cryptocurrencies (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File) We shouldn't be gambling with our national security to raise revenue.” The U.S. has placed export controls on most powerful U.S. computing chips, banning their sales in China to prevent them from being used to boost China's military capabilities. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has invited President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the NATO secretary general and several European leaders to a virtual meeting Wednesday ahead of the Trump-Putin summit later this week. It said the talks will focus on “further options for action to put pressure on Russia” as well as “preparations for possible peace negotiations and related issues of territorial claims and security.” Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit Friday in Alaska. ▶ Read more about Europe and the upcoming summit on Ukraine Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell won't be released, a judge decided Monday. Audrey Strauss, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, points to a photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, during a news conference in New York on July 2, 2020. “And it is no answer to argue that releasing the grand jury materials, because they are redundant of the evidence at Maxwell's trial, would be innocuous. The same could be said for almost any grand jury testimony, by summary witnesses or others, given in support of charges that later proceeded to trial,” he added. The Justice Department didn't immediately have a comment Monday morning. The White House last week announced plans for an increased presence of federal law enforcement in Washington as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on crime. But the Europeans concede that Moscow is unlikely to give up control of Ukrainian land it holds. Ahead of the summit in Alaska on Friday, President Trump suggested that a peace deal could include “some swapping of territories,” but the Europeans see no sign that Russia will offer anything to swap. Europeans and Ukrainians so far are not invited to the summit. They are wary that President Vladimir Putin will try to claim a political victory by portraying Ukraine as inflexible. The only thing on Trump's schedule today is a news conference at 10 a.m., where he's expected to announce plans to tackle homelessness and crime in Washington. Trump wrote in a social media post that he would hold a White House news conference on Monday to discuss his plans to make the District of Columbia “safer and more beautiful than it ever was before.” “The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote Sunday. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. Last week, the Republican president directed federal law enforcement agencies to increase their presence in Washington for seven days, with the option “to extend as needed.” AP Morning Wire curates the most important stories and sends them straight to your inbox.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House, Monday, Aug. 11, 2025, in Washington, as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi look on. WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is bringing in 800 National Guard members to help law enforcement fight crime in Washington, but just 100 to 200 of the troops will be on the city's streets at any given time, the Army said. Trump's directive on Monday for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to activate the National Guard is just the latest example of him sending the Guard into cities to support immigration enforcement or fight crime over the objection of local and state officials. According to the Army, Guard troops will be deployed under Title 32, or “federal-state status” authority. “Their duties will include an array of tasks from administrative, logistics and physical presence in support of law enforcement,” according to a statement from the Army, to which the District of Columbia National Guard directed all questions. About 500 federal law enforcement officers are being assigned to patrols in Washington, including from the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration; Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the Marshals Service. Hegseth told reporters that Guard members will be “flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week.” He also said the Pentagon was “prepared to bring in other National Guard units — other specialized units,” though he didn't offer any further details. According to Trump's directive, National Guard troops will remain deployed until the president determines “that conditions of law and order have been restored.” Besides the 800 Guard members, Trump said “we will bring in the military if it's needed” — seemingly referring to active duty troops in addition to the Guard — but added that “I don't think we'll need it.” Troops were largely tasked with protecting federal buildings and guarding immigration agents as they conducted raids. “We will work alongside all D.C. police and federal law enforcement,” Hegseth said. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters that the National Guard's primary mission had been to guard two buildings that “frankly didn't need to be guarded.” In addition, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, also a Democrat, has questioned the effectiveness of using the Guard to enforce city laws. “I just think that's not the most efficient use of our Guard,” she said Sunday on MSNBC's “The Weekend.” It became a controversial moment in his first administration in part because Gen. Mark Milley, who was then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared alongside Trump. Some saw Milley's presence as the military's endorsement of using troops against U.S. citizens.</p>

Emergency crew gather after an explosion at the Clairton Coke Works, a U.S. Steel coking plant, Monday, Aug 11, 2025, in Clairton, Penn. CLAIRTON, Pa. (AP) — Explosions at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh left one dead, two missing and at least nine others in hospitals Monday, with emergency workers searching the badly charred rubble for victims, officials said. An Allegheny County emergency services spokesperson, Kasey Reigner, said one person died and two were currently believed to be unaccounted for. Allegheny County Emergency Services said a fire at the plant started around 10:51 a.m. “It felt like thunder,” Zachary Buday, a construction worker near the scene, told WTAE-TV. Josh Shapiro said via X that “multiple explosions” occurred at the facility. Allegheny Health Network said it had seven patients from the explosion being treated by its hospitals. It did not provide information about the patients' conditions. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center said it is treating two patients at UPMC Mercy, the region's only level one trauma and burn center. Clairton residents like Amy Sowers, 49, felt an explosion nearby. Sowers, who was sitting on her porch located less than a mile from the plant, felt her house shake. “I could see smoke from my driveway,” she said. “We heard ambulances and fire trucks from every direction.” Despite health concerns, Sowers said many residents cannot afford to leave. In July 2010, another explosion injured 14 employees and six contractors. The plant, a massive industrial facility along the Monongahela River south of Pittsburgh, is considered the largest coking operation in North America and is one of four major U.S. Steel plants in Pennsylvania that employ several thousand workers. In a statement, U.S. Steel said an “incident” occurred at the plant's coke oven batteries 13 and 14. To make coke, coal is baked in special ovens for hours at high temperatures to remove impurities that could otherwise weaken steel. The process creates what's known as coke gas — made up of a lethal mix of methane, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Clairton Mayor Richard Lattanzi said his heart goes out to the victims of Monday's explosions. “The mill is such a big part of Clairton,” he said. The Allegheny County Health Department said it is monitoring the explosions and advised residents within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of the plant to remain indoors, close all windows and doors, set air conditioning systems to recirculate, and avoid drawing in outside air, such as using exhaust fans. It said its monitors have not detected levels of soot or sulfur dioxide above federal standards. According to the company, the plant produces 4.3 million tons (3.9 million metric tons) of coke annually and has approximately 1,400 workers. In recent years, the Clairton plant has been dogged by concerns about pollution. In 2019, it agreed to settle a 2017 lawsuit for $8.5 million. Two workers who got material in their eyes received first aid treatment at a local hospital but were not seriously injured. The fire at the Clairton plant knocked out pollution controls at its Mon Valley plants, but U.S. Steel continued to run them anyway, environmental groups said. David Masur, executive director of PennEnvironment, another environmental group that has sued U.S. Steel over pollution, said there needed to be “a full, independent investigation into the causes of this latest catastrophe and a re-evaluation as to whether the Clairton plant is fit to keep operating.” The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh-based company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, dragging out the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Audrey Strauss, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, points to a photo of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, during a news conference in New York on July 2, 2020. NEW YORK (AP) — Transcripts of the secret grand jury testimony that led to the sex trafficking indictment of Jeffrey Epstein's former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell shouldn't be released, a judge ruled Monday in a stinging decision suggesting the Justice Department's real motive for wanting them unsealed was to fool the public with an “illusion” of transparency. Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said in a written decision that federal law almost never allows for the release of grand jury materials and that making the documents public casually was a bad idea. And the judge also belittled the Justice Department's argument that releasing grand jury materials might reveal new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, calling that premise “demonstrably false.” After privately reviewing the materials the government sought to release publicly, the judge wrote that anyone familiar the evidence from Maxwell's 2021 sex trafficking trial would “learn next to nothing new” and “would come away feeling disappointed and misled.” “The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor. “A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion — aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” he said. Florida lawyer Brad Edwards, who has represented nearly two dozen Epstein accusers, said he didn't disagree with the ruling and most wanted to protect victims. Messages for comment were left with the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors had asked to unseal the documents to calm a whirlpool of suspicions about what the government knows about Epstein, a well-connected financier who authorities said killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges involving dozens of women and girls as young as 14. Maxwell, a socialite, was later convicted of helping him prey on underage girls. The Justice Department has acknowledged that only an FBI agent and a New York Police Department detective testified before the grand jury in 2020 and 2021. Prosecutors have said much of what was discussed behind the grand jury's closed doors ultimately became public at Maxwell's 2021 trial, in victims' civil lawsuits or in public statements from victims and witnesses. The Justice Department has said much of the material was court-sealed to protect victims and little of it would've come out if Epstein had gone to trial. Another federal judge is weighing whether to release grand jury transcripts from the Epstein case. A federal judge in Florida declined to release grand jury documents from an investigation there in 2005 and 2007. Maxwell, who's appealing her conviction, opposed unsealing the documents. She recently was interviewed by the Justice Department and was moved from a prison in Florida to a prison camp in Texas. The Epstein saga has again become a national flashpoint years after Epstein served jail time and registered as a sex offender after pleading guilty to Florida prostitution offenses in a 2008 deal that let him avoid federal charges then. President Donald Trump raised questions about Epstein's death, and Trump allies stoked conspiracy theories that dark secrets were covered up to protect powerful people. Some of those allies got powerful positions in Trump's Justice Department and promised to pull back the curtain on the Epstein investigation — but then announced this summer nothing more would be released and a long-rumored Epstein “client list” doesn't exist. After trying unsuccessfully to change the subject and denigrating his own supporters for not moving on, Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi to ask courts to unseal the grand jury transcripts.</p>

President Donald Trump announced plans Aug. 11, 2025, to deploy the National Guard and to takeover the Metropolitan Police Department to address crime in the nation's capital. The fight between President Donald Trump and Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom over the National Guard's presence in California is coming to a head on Monday in the start of a three-day trial. While most of the National Guard members have since been demobilized, the trial could set the stage for more fights across the country as Trump federalizes guard members in Washington, D.C., and threatens to do so elsewhere in response to high crime rates in blue cities. Judge Charles Breyer, a Clinton appointee and brother of retired liberal Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, is presiding over the case. National Guard troops are deployed around downtown Los Angeles, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. Breyer previously granted a temporary restraining order in favor of Newsom, saying Trump's decision to mobilize the National Guard was illegal because it infringed on California's authority. One of the conditions required under the law Trump cited to federalize the National Guard is that a rebellion must be underway, and Breyer said the riots in California fell far short of that scenario. But Breyer's decision was quickly reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. "We are persuaded that, under longstanding precedent interpreting the statutory predecessor to §12406, our review of that decision must be highly deferential," the panel wrote. Protesters face off with police outside a federal building in downtown Los Angeles on June 14, 2025. While little is left on the ground in California for the judge to resolve – Newsom recently announced that about 300 of Trump's deployed National Guard members remain active in the state – legal questions surrounding Trump's actions persist. Newsom has argued Trump violated that law and plans to call military officials as witnesses during the trial to testify about the directions the National Guard and a few hundred Marines received. Newsom has said they were illegally engaged in law enforcement activities, while government attorneys argue they were protecting federal personnel and federal properties. While Newsom also argued that Trump's unusual decision to bring the National Guard into a state without the governor's consent was illegal and required the governor's permission, the three-judge panel has already leaned in favor of Trump on that point. Newsom has claimed more broadly that militarizing California was unnecessary and caused the unrest in Los Angeles to intensify. State and local law enforcement officers made about seven riot-related arrests prior to Trump's announcement about the National Guard on June 7, but they made about a thousand arrests during the subsequent 10 days, California attorneys said in court filings. An ICE official said in an affidavit that National Guard members were "essential" to providing reinforcements around the 300 North Los Angeles Federal Building, which was the site of protests during the controversial immigration raids. They also damaged federal property by spray painting death threats to federal law enforcement officers," the ICE official wrote.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on tensions in the region as President Trump's deadline for peace draws near on 'Special Report.' The agency said it recently "detected and responded to two Chinese research vessels operating in the U.S. Arctic and is currently monitoring a total of five similar vessels in or near the U.S Arctic." "On August 5, a C-130J Hercules fixed wing aircraft from Air Station Kodiak responded to the Chinese research vessels Ji Di and the Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di. The Chinese research vessel Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di is seen in an aerial surveillance photo taken by a Coast Guard C-130J Hercules aircraft from Air Station Kodiak. They noted that the aircraft and Waesche were "patrolling under Operation Frontier Sentinel, an operation that responds to adversaries operating in and around Alaskan and U.S. Arctic waters." The U.S. Coast Guard Legend-class cutter USCGC Waesche travels through the San Francisco Bay for the Parade of Ships during San Francisco Fleet Week in October 2023. SFFW is an opportunity for the American public to meet the Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard teams and experience America's sea services. During Fleet week, service members participate in various community service events, showcase capabilities and equipment to the community, and enjoy the hospitality of the city and its surrounding areas. "In July, Coast Guard Arctic District deployed a C-130J Hercules fixed wing aircraft from Air Station Kodiak to query the Xue Long 2, another Chinese research vessel, approximately 290 nautical miles north of Utqiagvik, Alaska," the Coast Guard also said. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem looks out during an aerial tour on a HC-130J aircraft from U.S. Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak on March 17, 2025, in Kodiak Station, Alaska. "The Coast Guard Arctic District works in conjunction with international partners, U.S. Northern Command, and Alaskan Command to constantly monitor the activity of foreign vessels operating near U.S. sovereign waters and the extended outer continental shelf to ensure homeland security, homeland defense, and compliance with U.S. and international law," the agency said.

President Donald Trump goes after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over 'land swapping' as he lays out upcoming 'feel out meeting' with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. President Donald Trump took aim at Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in a press event on Monday over his frustration with the Ukrainian leader's objection to "land swapping." "I get along with Zelenskyy, but, you know, I disagree with what he's done, very, very severely, disagree. This is a war that should have never happened," Trump said, reiterating his belief that the Ukrainian president is in part at fault for Russia's illegal 2022 invasion. "I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, ‘Well, I have to get constitutional approval'," Trump said. "I mean, he's got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap, because there'll be some land swapping going on." President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., on Monday, Aug. 11, 2025. "I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody," Trump added, noting it was "for the good of Ukraine." Zelenskyy – who did not declare war on Russia, as Moscow had already invaded, did declare Martial Law on Feb. 24, 2022 with the approval of Ukraine's parliament, which gave him presidential powers to mobilize a military response — made clear over the weekend that he objected to Trump's "land swapping" proposal and has repeatedly said it would require a national referendum under the nation's constitution, not a unilateral decision by him. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during a press conference during the Ukraine Recovery Conference 2025 at Roma Convention Center La Nuvola on July 10, 2025 in Rome. Trump wouldn't detail what exactly he hopes to get out of the meeting with Putin and described it as a "feel-out meeting," saying within "the first two minutes [he'll] know exactly whether or not a deal can be made." "I'm going in to speak to Vladimir Putin, and I'm going to be telling him, you got to end this war, you got to end it," Trump said, reiterating his belief that if he had won the 2020 election, Putin wouldn't have invaded Ukraine, saying "he wasn't going to mess with me." President Donald Trump, left, and Russian President Vladimir Putin shake hands at the beginning of a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16, 2018. "I go into that thing fully loaded right up there, and we're going to see what happens," he continued. "And, we're going to be dealing with the European leaders and, we're going to be dealing with President Zelensky and hopefully we're going to have a great success."

While most residents in Washington, D.C., told Fox News Digital that President Donald Trump should not federalize the nation's capital, most also said they are concerned about crime. President Donald Trump shared new details on Monday about his plan to take control of public safety in Washington, D.C., following a brutal attack on a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer, but D.C. residents aren't convinced. Trump announced on Monday that he is activating the District of Columbia National Guard and seizing control of the Metropolitan Police Department after floating the idea since last week's assault in Washington's Logan Circle. Some Washington residents who spoke to Fox News Digital called it a "terrible idea" that "doesn't make a lot of sense." "I think D.C. politics should stay with D.C., and, unfortunately, the federal government is apparently overstepping their bounds right now, so I hope that D.C. is allowed to govern itself, as well as police itself," one Washington resident told Fox News Digital ahead of Trump's announcement. Trump controversially federalized the California National Guard amid anti-ICE protests that delved into riots in Los Angeles in June. But just like in California, many Washington residents have concerns about seeing "troops on our streets." "We have laws for a reason," one resident told Fox News Digital. U.S. National Guard were deployed around downtown Los Angeles on Sunday, June 8, 2025, following an immigration raid protest the night before. Despite their apprehension about National Guard troops patrolling the nation's capital, many residents said something needs to be done to address crime in Washington, D.C. While the Department of Justice indicated a 30-year low in violent crime last year, concerns about the city's safety linger, with one resident telling Fox News Digital, "The city is getting dangerous." "I think it's a good idea," one resident said of Trump's new plan. So yeah, I think that's a great idea." And another Washington resident said, "We need all the protection that we can get in the city, because the city is really getting dangerous," telling Fox News Digital that she has to "make sure to come home before sundown" and she is afraid of getting robbed when she gets off public transportation.

(Andrew Leyden/Getty Images) "Things do seem out of control and desperate, but I don't know what kind of numbers to take, what numbers to read. One minute they'll say crime is out of control. Next minute, they will say crime is down a certain percentage. It's kind of confusing, and I don't know who to believe in and which way to go, to be honest," a Washington resident said, articulating the dichotomy between the low crime statistics and the alarming crime stories. But another D.C. resident said, "There's no way he should be in control of anything," and Washington, D.C., "should be a state," so the district has more power to make decisions for itself. "I don't think it's necessary," another Washington resident added. "I do think there needs to be some change within [the] Metropolitan [Police Department] because safety is an issue."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• DC crackdown: President Donald Trump announced he is placing the Washington, DC, police department “under direct federal control” and deploying National Guard troops to the nation's capital. The move comes after Trump ordered a seven-day surge in federal law enforcement within the city last week, pointing to several high-profile crimes. • Later this week: Looking ahead to his Friday summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said Volodymyr Zelensky “could” attend but expressed skepticism that the Ukrainian leader's presence would make a difference in reaching a peace deal. • Revenue for export licenses agreement: Meanwhile, chip giants Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for export licenses, an unprecedented quid pro quo arrangement that came together after Nvidia's CEO met with Trump last week. The Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department, including Chief Pamela Smith, along with Mayor Muriel Bowser, did not know of President Donald Trump's move to take over the department before his announcement Monday, three sources familiar told CNN. The Democratic mayor went so far as to highlight her “shared priorities” with Trump during an interview Sunday, saying she is “interested in being in neighborhoods and fighting crime.” The details of Trump's move and how it could change MPD's strategies to address crime are sparse, one source told CNN, noting that leadership has been out of the loop. DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb, meanwhile, slammed Trump's moves in a statement. There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. We are considering all of our options and will do what's necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents,” he said. President Donald Trump said Monday that Ukrainian President Zelensky “could” attend his summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday but expressed skepticism that it would make a difference in reaching a peace deal. You know, he's been there for three and a half years. Nothing happened,” Trump told reporters at the White House. “We're going to have a meeting with Vladimir Putin, and at the end of that meeting, probably in the first two minutes, I'll know exactly whether or not a deal can be made,” Trump said. The president later added that a meeting between Putin and Zelensky would be necessary. “Ultimately, I'm going to put the two of them in a room. The president said that “there could be many definitions” of a good deal, but he also seemed to lower expectations ahead of Friday's summit. “I expect to have a meeting with Putin that I think it'll be good, but it might be bad,” Trump said. House Oversight Chair James Comer praised President Donald Trump for placing Washington, DC, police under federal control and said he plans to follow up with a hearing with city officials when lawmakers return to Washington. Comer said the committee will hold a congressional hearing in September with DC District Attorney General Brian Schwalb, DC Council Chairman Phil Mendelson and Mayor Muriel Bowser. Lawmakers are currently in their home districts for Congress' August recess. The panel, Comer said, “is also advancing legislative solutions to protect Americans in their capital city.” Any request of over 30 days must be passed into law. As President Donald Trump formally declared a public safety emergency in Washington, DC, and federalized the local police, one significant budget issue facing the city went without mention Monday at the White House. House Republicans have yet to restore $1 billion in funding for the District of Columbia, following a budgetary fight in Congress earlier this year. Local leaders have warned the hole could result in cuts to a wide range of city services, including police. Speaker Mike Johnson said in May that he would work to pass the bill “as quickly as possible,” but no action has been taken on the matter for months. “I don't like being up here, talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was,” Trump said Monday, delivering a bleak and blistering assessment of Washington, DC, despite police statistics that show falling violent crime. The budget fight in Congress left a hole of about $1 billion after DC was forced to revert to last year's funding levels for the city. President Donald Trump said he's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday to see what the parameters of a peace deal could be before he speaks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European leaders. I think a deal should be made for both,” Trump said, adding that the next meeting should include both Putin and Zelensky. And he cautioned that Friday's meeting may not necessarily result in any movement. I may say, ‘This is not going to be settled,'” Trump said. I happen to be one of them by the way,” Trump said. President Donald Trump left the door open to further extending a trade truce with China, saying Monday that he's been “dealing very nicely” with the nation. “We'll see what happens,” Trump said during a White House press briefing. The relationship is very good with President Xi and myself.” Some context: The current 90-day pause on a series of aggressive trade penalties that the two countries agreed to in May is set to expire on Tuesday. US and Chinese officials have since suggested that the truce could be extended, though the two sides have yet to reach a formal agreement. President Donald Trump said Monday that his administration is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, telling reporters at the White House that officials will make a decision in the “next few weeks.” Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana, because if it does bad for the children, it does bad for people that are older than children. Some context: CNN reported last week that Trump is privately mulling how to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug. This would move marijuana from its classification as a Schedule 1 drug to Schedule 3, which includes “drugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration. Nearly a year ago, Trump suggested his return to the White House would usher in a new era for marijuana, one that would make it easier for adults to access safe products and give states greater leeway to pursue legalization. He signaled support for removing marijuana from the same legal category as dangerous narcotics like heroin. The pronouncement set him apart from many of his Republican predecessors and came as Trump courted younger Americans, minority groups and libertarian-leaning voters. Charles Allen, a member of the DC Council, quickly slammed President Donald Trump's move to take over the capital's police force, writing on social media Monday that the action is an “extreme, outrageous, and dangerous move for our city and the safety of all our residents.” Allen, who represents an area of DC that includes parts of downtown and the Capitol Hill neighborhood, wrote that “today's announcement will put untrained and unaccountable members of the military in an untenable position in our communities.” While any crime is one too many, every local leader in DC is committed to the work and progress of safer communities and preventing violence,” Allen wrote. Some context: Trump has repeatedly complained about rising crime in DC. But so far this year, overall crime numbers are lower than in 2024, according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC's Metropolitan Police Department — following a  similar trend of declining crime rates in major US cities. President Donald Trump said the Department of Defense stands ready to deploy active-duty military to address crime in Washington, but added that he doesn't think it'll be necessary. “We're going to have National Guard, but (Defense Secretary) Pete Hegseth will tell you about, we will bring in the military, if needed… I don't think we'll need it, I think we've got so many great people, including the people that are in the police department.” President Donald Trump said that his administration is going to change the statues relating to cash bail in cities like New York City, Chicago and Washington, DC. The ‘radical left' city council adopted no cash bail. That's what started the problem,” Trump claimed at a news conference. Referencing New York and Chicago, Trump said they would “change the statue” regarding cash bail systems with the help of Congress. “We're going to end that in Chicago,” Trump said. President Donald Trump said he's embarrassed that he has to address crime in Washington, DC, ahead of his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday. “It's embarrassing for me to be up here. You know I'm going to see Putin,” Trump told reporters at the White House this morning, adding that, “I don't like being up here talking about how unsafe and how dirty and disgusting this once beautiful capital was.” US officials are rushing to finalize the details of a summit between Trump and Putin in Alaska on Friday. It was Trump's decision to call Monday's event to talk about crime in DC, where so far this year, overall crime numbers are lower than last year's, according to a preliminary year-to-date crime comparison from DC's Metropolitan Police Department. President Donald Trump said he is designating Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole as interim federal commissioner of the DC Metropolitan Police Department. Cole was sworn in as DEA administrator on July 23. During his confirmation process, Trump touted Cole's work in Virginia overseeing 11 state public safety agencies with more than 19,000 employees. President Donald Trump on Monday announced the federal government would take control of the DC Metropolitan Police Department to address crime. Trump said Monday he was declaring a public safety emergency. Before Monday, there had never been a federal takeover of DC police under the Home Rule Act. It is not clear whether the president has taken that step. “I'm officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, you know what that is, and placing the DC Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control,” Trump said during a White House news conference. The president told a crowd of reporters that his actions come as “something's out of control, but we're going to put it in control very quickly, like we did on the southern border.” Trump also announced the deployment of National Guard troops to assist local law enforcement. “We will have full, seamless, integrated cooperation at all levels of law enforcement, and will deploy officers across the district with an overwhelming presence,” he added. Officers, Trump said, will have authority to do “whatever the hell they want,” he said, adding this will go beyond the country's capital. Flanked by top administration officials, Trump also vowed to take aggressive action to address homelessness and blight in the capital. President Donald Trump is expected to announce the activation of hundreds of DC National Guard troops this morning as part of his effort to address crime in the nation's capital, two US officials told CNN. The DC National Guard forces are expected to be providing safety and security support to law enforcement, though one of the officials said many of the operational specifics still remain unclear, such as where they will be placed throughout the city, what their command-and-control chain will be, and for how long they will be activated. Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth are expected to be at the announcement with Trump. Among the subordinate units of the DC Guard is a military police battalion, complete with maintenance and medical support, and an aviation support battalion. President Donald Trump says he will announce a plan Monday morning to make Washington, DC, “GREAT AGAIN!” and “stop violent crime” in the nation's capital. Those include plans for scores of FBI agents to patrol the city's streets. DC is managed under Home Rule, a 1973 law that gave Congress oversight and authority over the capital city but allowed district residents to have some control over how it is run. Trump has said he wants his administration to look into turning over Home Rule. “Washington, D.C. will be LIBERATED today!” he said Monday morning on Truth Social. US officials are rushing to finalize details ahead of Friday's summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska, with both logistical and geopolitical issues still unsettled four days ahead of the momentous sit-down. As of Monday, no venue for the summit had been announced. And a number of questions hang over the preparations. Among them: whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky would be invited. But they also acknowledged much would hinge on how the Trump-Putin meeting unfolds. President Donald Trump declared “Liberation Day” in Washington, DC, in a social media post this morning ahead of a White House news conference. “LIBERATION DAY IN D.C. WE ARE TAKING OUR CAPITAL BACK!! Trump is expected to speak this morning on safety in the nation's capital, though he has yet to provide specific details. It comes despite a preliminary year-to-date comparison from DC Police showing that 2025 crime numbers in the city are lower than last year's. Trump has threatened to assert federal control over the capital city, following an assault last week on a well-known employee of the Department of Government Efficiency. The days of ruthlessly killing, or hurting, innocent people, are OVER! I quickly fixed the Border (ZERO ILLEGALS in last 3 months! President Donald Trump has called a news conference at the White House today to address his federal crackdown on Washington, DC. In a series of posts on social media over the weekend, Trump claimed his announcement — scheduled for 10 a.m. He also said he will announce “Beautification” and “Cleanliness” efforts, which would apparently involve removing homeless people from the city. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital,” Trump wrote on Truth Social yesterday. “The Criminals, you don't have to move out. It's all going to happen very fast, just like the Border.” The president said DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is “a good person who has tried,” but claimed the city “only gets dirtier and less attractive.” We'll be covering the press conference as it happens today. Some context: The Trump administration ordered an increase of federal law enforcement in the US capital last week, deploying officials from different agencies in a push to crack down on crime. The federal government's plans for a surge of law enforcement in Washington calls for up to 130 FBI agents to patrol with officers from the city-run DC Metropolitan Police Department, according to one person familiar. President Donald Trump launched the initiative last week with a White House official saying Saturday up to 450 federal law enforcement officers are expected participate. It's not typical for FBI agents to patrol with local police departments.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal judge on Monday denied a request from the Trump administration to unseal grand jury material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking and is the longtime associate of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Grand jury records are typically kept under seal, but prosecutors argued the circumstances of Maxwell's case warranted an exception. “Its entire premise — that the Maxwell grand jury materials would bring to light meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes, or the Government's investigation into them — is demonstrably false.” After reviewing the records, Engelmayer said they contained “virtually nothing … that isn't public already” and would “not reveal new information of any consequence.” He added that anyone expecting significant revelations “would come away feeling disappointed and misled,” concluding there was “no ‘there' there.” Maxwell, who has maintained her innocence, was convicted in 2021 on sex trafficking and related charges for helping Epstein recruit and abuse underage girls. Authorities ruled it was suicide, which has since fueled years of speculation, conspiracy theories, and renewed demands for transparency. Maxwell was recently transferred to a minimum-security prison in Texas following an interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a move that has drawn scrutiny amid her cooperation with the DOJ. Efforts to secure her testimony before the House Oversight Committee have since been postponed while the Supreme Court weighs whether to hear her appeal at its Sept. 29 long conference. Maxwell's petition argues that her prosecution violated a nonprosecution agreement Epstein obtained from federal prosecutors in Florida in the 2000s, which she said should have shielded her from charges. A separate judge in New York is still weighing whether to release grand jury files from his 2019 sex trafficking charges, which never went to trial before authorities found Epstein dead in his cell on Aug. 10 of that year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? America's wildfire strategy is falling apart when it's needed most. This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. This year, some employees were shocked by the blunt remarks made during a meeting with forest supervisors and fire staff officers from across the Intermountain West. “We were told, ‘Help is not on the way,'” said one employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of losing their job. Agency leaders already knew it might be a bad wildfire season, made worse by having fewer hands available to help out. According to the employee High Country News spoke to, the Forest Service lost at least 1,800 fire-qualified, or “red-carded,” employees through layoffs, deferred resignation, and retirement offers. “We were told: Don't commit to an attack thinking the cavalry is going to come,” the employee said. As fire activity continues to pick up across much of the West, that warning rings true. The Forest Service claims it recently reached 99 percent of its firefighting hiring goal, with almost 11,300 wildland firefighters. But a recent ProPublica investigation and internal communications obtained by High Country News paint a grimmer picture than what the public is seeing. The Guardian also reported that vacancy rates were highest in the Pacific Northwest and Intermountain Regions, at 39 percent and 37 percent, respectively. “ProPublica's analysis doesn't reflect our current fire response capacity,” spokesperson Cat McRae told High Country News in an email. “Their numbers likely come from outdated org charts and unfunded positions.” In an email, ProPublica confirmed that their data excluded unfunded positions. According to McRae, “the Forest Service is fully prepared and operational to protect individuals and communities from wildfires.” But in a memo shared with HCN, Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz told agency leaders on July 16 that “as expected, the 2025 Fire Year is proving to be extremely challenging.” “We know the demand for resources outpaces their availability,” Schultz wrote. He requested that all red-carded employees, including IT and human resource staff, be made available for fire assignments. “We have reached a critical point in our national response efforts, and we must make every resource available.” Already, the Forest Service has asked at least 1,400 people with fire qualifications who had resigned to come back. “All those people matter,” said Dave Whittekiend, formerly the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache forest supervisor. Whittekiend, who retired in May, had also attended this spring's planning meeting for forest leaders in Nevada, Utah, and parts of Idaho and Wyoming, where he heard the same warning about limited help. “It was creating a sense of urgency,” he said. “It was pretty direct: ‘We are seeing changes, and so be careful about how you choose your strategies and what you think you might be able to do with a fire. Whittekiend pointed out that — even before all the layoffs and resignations this spring — the Forest Service sometimes struggled to get through busy fire seasons. Firefighters have been called in from Canada, Mexico, and Australia when resources are stretched too thin, and sometimes National Guard or military troops are deployed. It probably accelerated when a whole bunch of us said, ‘All right, we're out of here'” — including employees in overhead positions, like the people who buy food and organize shower trailers and outhouses for fire camps, as well as staffers who take weather forecasts and do safety checks on firefighting operations. Meanwhile, just last week, the Department of Agriculture announced a widespread reorganization to further slim down and consolidate the workforce. Fort Collins, Colorado, and Salt Lake City, Utah, were designated as two of the five new “hub” locations and the only offices that will be located in the entire West. Standalone research stations will be consolidated into one station in Fort Collins, while the Fire Science Lab in Missoula, Montana, will remain as is. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that up to half of staff may not relocate, according to Politico.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That cup of joe that jolts you awake in the morning is pretty safe when it comes to contaminants and toxins, a new investigation has found. “While some contaminants were present, most were found at minimal levels and well below the European Union's safety limits per 6-ounce serving. This means coffee is generally safe,” said Molly Hamilton, executive director of the nonprofit Clean Label Project, which conducted the investigation into caffeinated coffees. That's great news because coffee has a stellar résumé: Studies have found drinking about 3 cups of black coffee a day provides health benefits, such as reducing risk for such issues as heart disease, multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, liver disease, prostate cancer, stroke, dementia and more. But here's the grind — the testing found traces of a worrisome herbicide called glyphosate and one of its byproducts. Glyphosate is a popular herbicide that has been linked to hormone disruptions and neurotoxic effects, including the development of autism and other developmental disorders in children. The first MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) Commission report, released in May, raised concerns about the impact of glyphosate and other pesticides on children's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory bodies, however, say numerous studies and risk assessments have shown no adverse effects of glyphosate at levels found in the food supply. In addition to glyphosate, testing found some coffees also contained small amounts of phthalates, a plasticizer found in consumer products such as food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children's toys. Studies have also linked phthalates to asthma, childhood obesity and cancer. The reason for that isn't yet clear, “so our next study is going to be analyzing the packaging assembly line to discover why there is a change in contaminants,” Hamilton said. “The Clean Label Project plays an important role in post-market testing for contaminants in everyday consumer products, including this recent report on coffee,” said David Andrews, acting chief science officer for the Environmental Working Group, or EWG, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group that maintains a database on personal care products that contain toxins. “The higher phthalate levels found in coffee pods and canned coffee suggest that packaging could be a meaningful source of exposure to these chemicals of concern,” Andrews said. “Decades of independent scientific evidence show that coffee drinkers live longer, healthier lives,” NCA President and CEO William “Bill” Murray said in an email. To do the testing, Clean Label obtained samples of coffee from 45 popular brands — which they did not name. Coffee beans were grown in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kenya, Peru and Hawaii. A certified lab conducted over 7,000 tests looking for pesticides, including glyphosate; heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium; mycotoxins, which are toxic chemical compounds produced by some molds that grow on crops; and phthalates, a plasticizer found in consumer products such as food wrapping, food storage containers, shampoo, makeup, perfume and children's toys. Viva la coffee shop: Why we need to meet up in them, now! The half-life of AMPA is longer than that of glyphosate, which means it can persist in the environment and is easily absorbed by plants from soil and water. While certified organic coffee growers cannot use pesticides like glyphosate, it's possible for organic fields to be contaminated by runoff from neighboring conventional farms, Hamilton said. “We definitely need stronger safeguards and greater transparency in our food system.” Levels of heavy metals depended on where the coffee was grown. Hawaii, however, is a volcanic island and therefore expected to have more significant levels of heavy metals in the soil. An analysis also found 100% of the tested coffee samples contained small amounts of acrylamide, a colorless, odorless chemical formed when certain foods are cooked at high temperatures, such as when frying, baking and roasting. Despite that, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised manufacturers to attempt to lower levels in the food supply. “The dark coffees are the best choice because they are roasted at lower temperatures for a longer period of time so acrylamide levels don't rise,” Hamilton explained. “The light coffees are roasted minimally, so here too, acrylamide levels don't build up. “However, medium roasts have the higher levels of acrylamide because they are roasted at higher temperatures long enough to darken the beans,” she said. What could a coffee lover take away from the testing? “When you decide which coffee to buy, choose darker or the lightest roasts in bags or pods and consider where coffee is grown, which can impact the levels of heavy metals,” Hamilton said. “Caffeinated coffee is still one of the cleanest product categories we've ever tested.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The aim of the IAEA's visit is to “determine a framework for cooperation” after Iran suspended its ties with the watchdog in early July, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi announced on Sunday. That earlier move from Iran, which came after after the 12-Day War with Israel devastated the regime's top military brass and U.S. strikes set back its nuclear ambitions, has effectively kept its nuclear program in the dark. Shortly before that decision, the regime also banned the head of the IEAE Rafael Grossi from its nuclear sites and removed surveillance cameras from them. While the scheduled Monday visit signals Iran is willing to reopen lines of communication with the nuclear watchdog, Araghchi was clear that it will not include any inspection of its nuclear sites. “A deputy director general of Grossi will come to Tehran tomorrow, while there are no plans to visit any nuclear sites until we reach a framework,” he said. Iran previously reached a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in its war with Israel in late June, just days after the U.S.'s bombing of the nuclear sites. In early July, Araghchi laid out a condition for his country to reengage in talks that derailed just before the summer. “In order for us to decide to reengage, we will have to first ensure that America will not revert back to targeting us in a military attack during the negotiations. And I think with all these considerations, we still need more time,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump has previously not appeared willing to reenter negotiations with the regime, saying in late June that he would not be offering Iran “anything” while also trashing former President Barack Obama's Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018.</p>
