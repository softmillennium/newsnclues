                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday said that he initially asked Nvidia for a 20% cut of the chipmaker's sales to China, but the number came down to 15% after CEO Jensen Huang negotiated with him. The comments came after news broke over the weekend that Nvidia agreed to pay the federal government a 15% cut in return for receiving export control licenses that will allow it to once again sell the H20 chip to China and Chinese companies. Nvidia's Huang visited Trump in the White House on Friday. Trump said that Nvidia's H20 is an "old chip that China already has" and is "obsolete." He compared the H20 chip to Nvidia's current fastest artificial intelligence chip, which is called Blackwell, and said that he wouldn't allow those to be sold to China without significant downgrades, such as a 30% to 50% reduction in performance. They won't have it for five years," Trump said. One reason for the U.S. export controls is fear that providing advanced chips to China could allow the foreign power to leapfrog the U.S. in AI capabilities. Trump said that China already has chips with some similar capabilities to the H20. Huang has said that it is better for U.S. national security if Chinese AI developers use U.S. technology, and that denying them access to Nvidia chips would actually encourage the Chinese chip industry to develop and catch up. "He's selling a essentially old chip," Trump said. The H20 is a Chinese-specific chip that has had its performance slowed down. It is related to Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips that are used in the U.S. In April, the Trump administration said it would require a license to export the H20 chip, and in May, Huang said that "effectively closed" the market off to Nvidia. Huang said that Nvidia was expecting to sell about $8 billion in H20 chips in the July quarter before sales were stopped. "While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide," an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. Trump on Monday also said that Huang plans to visit him again to negotiate export licenses for the Blackwell chips. "I think he's coming to see me again about that," Trump said. A White House official confirmed to CNBC that Advanced Micro Devices, the second-place AI chipmaker, will also pay 15% to receive an export license for its China-focused AI chip, the Instinct MI308.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Peter Thiel-backed cryptocurrency exchange Bullish raised the size of its initial public offering. Bullish is aiming to raise $990 million, offering 30 million shares priced between $32 and $33 apiece, and targeting a valuation of $4.8 billion, according to a Monday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company, led by former New York Stock Exchange president Tom Farley, had previously marketed 20.3 million shares at a proposed range between $28 and $31 a share and sought a $4.2 billion valuation, per a filing last week. Bullish granted its underwriters, led by JPMorgan, Jefferies and Citigroup, a 30-day option to sell an additional 4.5 million shares. BlackRock and Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management have indicated interest in purchasing up to $200 million of the shares, according to the updated filing. Bullish, which also owns the crypto media site CoinDesk, is the latest crypto firm to join the public market, reflecting reinvigorated capital markets driven by investor confidence and increasing regulatory support and clarity from Washington. The stablecoin issuer Circle made its highly successful debut in June. In May, Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital uplisted to the Nasdaq and stock and crypto trading app eToro opened trading to the public.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gavin Newsom warned President Donald Trump on Monday that he will push to redraw his state's congressional district maps if Trump does not call on Texas and other Republican-led states to end efforts to redraw their own districts. "You are playing with fire, risking the destabilization of our democracy, while knowing that California can neutralize any gains you hope to make," the Democrat Newsom wrote in a letter to Trump. If the Republican majority in the Texas legislature is successful in redrawing district maps, it is expected to give their party an additional five seats in the House of Representatives. Democrats currently need to flip three House seats to win back control of that congressional chamber in the 2026 midterms. Trump, in an interview last week with CNBC, said that his fellow Republicans are "entitled to five more seats" in the House. Trump accused California and Illinois, which have Democratic-controlled House caucuses, of gerrymandering their congressional districts to maintain that edge. "This is not what the Founders envisioned, and California cannot stand idly by as this power grab unfolds," Newsom wrote. "If you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California to offset the rigging of maps in red states," Newsom wrote. Newsom's warning is among the starkest examples of Democrats vowing to counter the effort in Texas to redraw congressional maps. That effort has reached a fever pitch in recent days as Democratic state lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans a quorum needed to advance legislation in the state House. A number of Democratic lawmakers on Sunday suggested that the party has to "fight back" against the redistricting effort. Greg Abbott on Sunday reiterated his warning that the Democratic lawmakers will be arrested upon their return. "If they want to evade that arrest, they're going to stay outside of the state of Texas for literally years," he said on Fox News. The push to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 elections has also spread to other states, including Indiana.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ford on Monday announced it would invest $2 billion in a Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant aimed at rolling out more affordable electric vehicles. The investment comes on top of $3 billion already planned for a battery park in Michigan. Together the facilities will create or secure nearly 4,000 new jobs, Ford said in a news release. "We took a radical approach to a very hard challenge: Create affordable vehicles that delight customers in every way that matters – design, innovation, flexibility, space, driving pleasure, and cost of ownership – and do it with American workers," Ford CEO Jim Farley said in the release. The Detroit automaker's new "Universal EV Program" centered around low-cost EVs will start with a midsize, four-door electric pickup, produced at the Louisville Assembly Plant. Executives had teased the announcement on the company's latest earnings call as its next "Model T moment." Ford noted that lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for the new family of EVs will be assembled in the U.S. and not imported from China. Farley said during an event in Louisville on Monday that the announcement comes as the automotive industry is at a crossroads because of new technology and competition. They're all coming for us, legacy automotive companies," Farley said. "We needed a radical approach and a really tough challenge to create an affordable vehicle." The changes also come as Ford and other U.S. manufacturers are navigating shifting EV policies under President Donald Trump, including an end to EV tax credits that will take effect after Sept. 30. Ford said Monday that the Louisville plant will "secure" about 2,200 jobs, but noted that once it's retooled for EV production, it will employ about 600 fewer workers than in its current configuration. Farley told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during an interview with "Squawk on the Street" on Monday that the automaker continues to add new jobs elsewhere. We're not going to stop," Farley said. — CNBC's Phil LeBeau contributed to this report. Correction: This article has been updated to correct that the Louisville Assembly Plant will secure about 2,200 jobs. A previous version misstated the job impact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cannabis stocks rallied Monday after President Donald Trump said he is considering reclassifying marijuana, which would categorize it as less of a danger to public safety. Canopy Growth soared more than 26%, while Tilray Brands skyrocketed more than 41% in its best day since 2021. Cronos Group jumped around 16% and hit a new 52-week high. The AdvisorShares Pure U.S. Cannabis ETF (MSOS) surged around 28%, marking its best day since 2022. The Amplify Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ) recorded its biggest one-day gain on record, rising more than 26%. "We're looking at reclassification," Trump told reporters Monday during a press conference to announce the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C. "We'll make a determination ... over the next few weeks." "It's a very complicated subject," he added. Despite Monday's rally, many of these stocks are far below their all-time highs. Shares of publicly traded pot growers and distributors surged before the press conference after a Wall Street Journal report late Friday, citing people familiar with the matter, said Trump was considering changing marijuana to a less-dangerous drug classification. Trump disclosed he was considering such a move during a fundraiser at his New Jersey golf club earlier this month, the people said. Under federal law, cannabis is currently classified as a Schedule I drug in a group that also includes heroin and cocaine. Previously, reclassification discussions have centered on moving the drug to Schedule III, a class that includes steroids and Tylenol with codeine. Reclassification would allow marijuana companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment interest, among other benefits. Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC he expects the process of reclassification to take about a year. Trump discussing the matter publicly, and saying he plans to make a decision in coming weeks, is cause for optimism in the industry, Simon said. A move from Schedule I to Schedule III would be "a game changer" for the roughly $80 billion market, Tim Seymour, investing chief at Seymour Asset Management, said on CNBC's "Worldwide Exchange" on Monday. He noted that such a change seems to have bipartisan support. "But it does mean that you're investing now well ahead of a lot of institutional capital if you are, in fact, investing into this sector."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the end, success comes down to three things. If you think the first one is luck, sorry! But it also helps with the small stuff, like when the person sitting next to you in Row 45 on the Tampa-Chicago flight loves your product and places the order that saves you from bankruptcy. As a business academic who studies career trajectories, I've found long-term success is, aside from luck, a function of PIE. It refers to the quality of your: Instead, invest your time and energy making friends with all sorts of people, and lots of them, at work and out, with no expectation of anything in return. They may be able to help you someday, or maybe not, but if and when they do, their help will have more impact than any networking contact. No, of course not, and our friendship would have been just fine. But you've also never seen an easier, faster book deal brokered. Friends, real ones, are what make business go. You don't need a lot of ideas. But I've never met a successful person who didn't have a few really good ones over the long arc of their career. I'm thinking of Jeff Bezos when it dawned on him that he didn't need to sell just books online. Luckily for the rest of us, an original idea doesn't have to blow up the economy. It can be as small as replacing a bureaucratic process with a clean, simple one. Or a marketing activation that bumps sales 3% or a design tweak that makes an industrial product 5% more efficient. I know a car salesman who, in his first year on the job, doubled his location's sales by bringing a new question to his teammates. When a customer throws a lowball price at you, he said, instead of negotiating off the bat, ask, "Can you help me understand how you came up with that number?" This is the most underrated success-driver of the PIE triad — which is ridiculous, because any manager in the world will tell you they'd kill for a team member who gets you-know-what done. In my class at NYU, every MBA student must go through 360 Feedback, an evaluation tool that gathers input from former and current coworkers, bosses, and employees, and aggregates it into a report. Sarah, a student, reviewed her 360 results in class and immediately booked double office hours. When we met up, she was in tears. "Professor Welch, I need you to teach me how to be a leader," she said, "because my 360 Feedback results are horrifying." Dear Reader, it was a WTF moment for me, since my reaction to her results had been, "Nice!" The issue was that Sarah's 360 results had shown her to be kind of low on leadership traits. But every single piece of feedback suggested that Sarah was SEAL Team Six when it came to getting projects over the finish line. Her execution was perfect, precise, and invisible. As a leader myself, it made me feel faint with ardor. Did Sarah want to be a leader? There was a long pause, then: "Honestly? Just tell me what needs to be done and get out of my way. "But we're supposed to become leaders," she protested. "That's why we go to business school." The PIE theory drives much of the information Becoming You digs to unearth: how you relate to people, how your brain works, and how you show up in the world. It's literally set up to set you up to succeed, based on how I believe success actually happens.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Monday said he is placing the Washington, D.C., police department under federal control and deploying 800 National Guard troops in order to address what he claims is out-of-control crime in the capital city. "I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor, and worse," Trump declared at the start of a lengthy news conference in the White House press briefing room. "This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capitol back." But his emergency control is set to expire after a maximum of 30 days, according to the statute. That can be extended, but only if Congress passes a law authorizing it. While Trump has frequently complained about crime in the district, violent crime there has fallen to a 30-year low as of January, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Statistics from the Metropolitan Police Department also show that incidences of homicide, sexual abuse, assault with a dangerous weapon, robbery and overall violent crime have dropped by double-digit percentages so far this year. D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalbe called Trump's actions "unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful," and signaled his office will take action to challenge the administration. "There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year," Schwalbe said in an X post. "We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents," he said. D.C. Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat, in a statement called Trump's actions "an historic assault on D.C. home rule," and a "counterproductive, escalatory seizure of D.C.'s resources to use for purposes not supported by D.C. Trump, who has recently threatened to place Washington under federal control, said Monday morning that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi is "taking command of the Metropolitan Police Department as of this moment." He also said that he will deploy the National Guard to "help re-establish law order and public safety in Washington, D.C., and they're going to be allowed to do their job properly." Trump added, "You're going to have a lot of essentially military, and we will bring in the military if it's needed." D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's actions. She had previously pushed back on Trump's characterization of her city. Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false," Bowser said Sunday on MSNBC's "The Weekend." "Crime, Savagery, Filth, and Scum will DISAPPEAR. I will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN!" Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier Monday. On Sunday, he declared that "the Homeless" in D.C. will "have to move out, IMMEDIATELY," while assuring that the government "will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital." The Trump administration has disputed that crime in D.C. is dropping. White House communications director Steven Cheung on Monday morning pointed to a police union's reported accusation that crime statistics in D.C. have been manipulated. Trump's complaints about crime in D.C. ramped up after reports that Edward Coristine, one of the initial staffers on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, was assaulted there earlier this month. In another social media post, he wrote, "We are not going to allow people to spend $3.1 Billion Dollars on fixing up a building, like the Federal Reserve, which could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner for $50 to $100 Million Dollars." Gavin Newsom has sued the administration, arguing that Trump's actions were unconstitutional. A trial on the suit in California federal court was set to begin Monday morning.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Too bad there isn't a way to debug the tech job market. With Big Tech layoffs, the increase in computer science graduates, and quicker ways to learn through AI and vibe coding, there's a lot more tech talent, but not a lot of opportunities. The labor market has been frozen for months, marked by low layoffs, low hiring, and few openings for job seekers and switchers. Here are three charts that show how hard the tech job market is right now. Indeed Hiring Lab economist Brendon Bernard said in a recent report that tech opportunities have been weak since mid-2023 after climbing to an early 2022 peak. The Fed began raising interest rates in March 2022 to fight rising inflation, making financing big speculative investments in new tech riskier. A Burning Glass Institute analysis found the unemployment rate for Gen Z and younger millennials who were in computer and math occupations over the last couple of years has increased from their pre-pandemic rates in 2018 and 2019. The recent report said that knowledge economy sectors, which are primarily white-collar industries that usually absorb college graduates, have scaled back their hiring pace from before the pandemic, "suggesting that they have found a new lower-employment equilibrium." It's another sign of a quiet white-collar apocalypse afflicting Gen Z. Younger workers are also already on the tougher side of the career divide that's cleaving Gen Z white-collar workers. The oldest Gen Zers, who are turning 28 this year, experienced a labor market in 2021 and 2022 that was eager to staff up on white-collar workers, and may have benefited from firms willing to pay a premium to attract new employees amid the Great Resignation. That can still be the case if you're looking to move up the ladder or switch roles within your current company. Gusto economist Aaron Terrazas said a normalization from "aggressive talent retention strategies" that companies tried in 2021 and 2022 could be a factor. "We'll only know with time whether or not this is the new normal," Terrazas said about the slowdown in promotions across industries. "Right now, there are clearly a lot of structural forces, high interest rates, economic uncertainty, that would make it seem at least for the moment cyclical."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said he doesn't feel comfortable with how people are consulting ChatGPT on major life decisions. "A lot of people effectively use ChatGPT as a sort of therapist or life coach, even if they wouldn't describe it that way," Altman wrote on X on Sunday. Although that could be great, it makes me uneasy," Altman added. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Altman said in his X post that OpenAI has been "closely tracking" people's sense of attachment to their AI models and how they react when older versions are deprecated. "People have used technology including AI in self-destructive ways," Altman wrote on Sunday. He added that ChatGPT could be harmful if it leads people away from their "longer term well-being." "This is just my current thinking, and not yet an official OpenAI position," Altman said. In his post, Altman also referenced the negative response from some ChatGPT users after GPT-5 landed on Friday. People made posts on social media to voice their complaints about GPT-5, saying the model's replies were written in a "flat" tone and lacked creativity. Altman has previously expressed concern about how people are using ChatGPT as a personal therapist — and the legal concerns around it. "So if you go talk to ChatGPT about your most sensitive stuff and then there's like a lawsuit or whatever, we could be required to produce that, and I think that's very screwed up," Altman said. "No one had to think about that even a year ago, and now I think it's this huge issue of like, 'How are we gonna treat the laws around this?'"</p>
