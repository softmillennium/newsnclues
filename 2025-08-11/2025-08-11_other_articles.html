A recent Capitol Hill hearing is what has rekindled talks around Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the potential of extraterrestrial life. In the UAP briefing in May, physicist Dr Eric Davis - who is well known for working on top-secret Pentagon projects - captured listeners' attention by claiming there are four different types of aliens that have a possibility of being operators of unidentified crafts. The four distinct alien types he claims are 'Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians'. So, what are the distinct differences between each of these claimed alien types? The couple said the abduction was performed by small humanoids with smooth grey skin, large black almond-shaped eyes, and had a lack of typical human features like noses or ears. Nordics, on the other hand, are described as tall, slender beings, similar to Scandinavian humans, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and light skin. Lastly, the Reptilian theory - this was popular in the late 20th century through conspiracy theorist David Icke and claims shape-shifting reptilian aliens. Missouri Representative Eric Burlison, a member of the House Oversight Committee and UAP caucus, shared on The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher that he had heard these same four classifications in private discussions. I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that.” However, a self-claimed sceptic, Burlison admitted that he was uncertain about Davis' sources. He noted that the physicist's comments may come from firsthand knowledge or secondhand reports, indicating uncertainty, saying: "If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment. But he defended the investigation, stating that taxpayers help to fund Pentagon, intelligence, and energy department programs studying UAPs.</p>

USOs are similar to UFOs, but sighted in the world's oceans. The retired rear admiral claims that these USOs could be a threat to maritime security. Rear Admiral Timothy Gallaudet, former Oceanographer of the U.S. Navy, cited a 2019 sighting by a Navy warship as evidence that the phenomena of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and unidentified submersible objects (USOs) are linked. Gallaudet argues that the lack of knowledge about the undersea world poses hazards for submarines such as collisions with other submarines—such as the independent crashes of the submarines USS San Francisco and USS Connecticut, both of which were incidents that resulted in severe damage to the ships and one crew fatality—and undetected underwater seamounts. Further study of this realm, he believes, could shed additional light on these UFO/UAP sightings. One incident to which Gallaudet points in particular is a July 19, 2019 encounter between the Independence-class littoral combat ship USS Omaha and a so-called transmedium UAP. The AN/KAX-2 is a stabilized sensor turret built for maritime environments that includes a digital video camera, night vision camera, and laser rangefinder. The video appears to have been taken with the night vision camera, which uses imaging infrared to record objects in darkness. Meanwhile, one sailor off camera radios the other ships in the area—the guided missile destroyers Pinckney, Kidd, and Rafael Peralta—asking for a MH-60 helicopter to be launched as soon as possible. The video was leaked to UFO investigator Jeremy Corbell Lockyer, and was later verified as genuine by the Navy. Gallaudet also references another sighting from 2013, spotted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol personnel. The sighting—which took place near Aguadilla, Puerto Rico—was filmed using a similar imaging infrared camera. The video, shown here, depicts another spherical object appearing to enter the water and then re-emerge without losing any speed. The retired admiral writes, “Over three minutes, the object appears to fly at speeds between 40 and 120 miles per hour, enter and exit the Atlantic Ocean without any significant deceleration, reach a maximum underwater velocity of 95 miles per hour, and at one point split into two parts before entering the water again.” Other possible evidence cited by the admiral includes an incident in 2022, in which the NOAA underwater exploration ship Okeanos Explorer discovered an unusual series of holes on the North Atlantic seafloor at a depth of 1.6 miles. The centimeter-sized holes were in an unusually straight line and scientists are apparently at a loss to explain their origin. He assumed command of the Naval Meteorology and Oceanography Command in 2014, and served as Oceanographer of the Navy from 2016 until retirement in 2017. After his Navy career, Gallaudet served for two years as acting administrator in charge of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Today, he sits on the advisory board for Americans for Safe Aerospace, which describes itself as a “nonprofit organization dedicated to aerospace safety and national security with a focus on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).” ASA is led by Ryan Graves, a former U.S. naval aviator who reports having his own UAP sighting on active duty in 2014. Whether this will result in greater research to the same extent as the UFO/UAP issue remains to be seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TV series Alien: Earth captures “the aesthetic” of Sir Ridley Scott's original film, an executive producer has said. The sci-fi drama, from Emmy-winning producer Noah Hawley, is based on the acclaimed franchise, which began with Sir Ridley's 1979 film starring Sigourney Weaver as warrant off… That's the world of “Alien: Earth,” an eight-part series that expands what Ridley Scott created with the film, “Alien,” some 46 years ago. Sydney Chandler stars as Wendy in "Alien: Earth," a new FX series. In it, Chandler plays a humanoid robot with human consciousness, two years before the events of “Alien.” She's an advancement in the race for immortality and part of a group who discovers mysterious life forms that could be threatening. Humans, cyborgs and synths are like toys, manipulated by five corporations living in “Alien: Earth.” Xenomorphs, an extraterrestrial species that hunts humans (and figured into the films) are here, too. Chandler, the daughter of actor Kyle Chandler, says she saw the film “Alien” at a young age “and the Xenomorph visited me in my nightmares many a time. It was a full-circle moment to be chased by a real Xeno instead of just dreaming about it.” Filmed in Thailand, the series brought actors into a lush world bursting with humidity and other natural phenomena. She and other actors — including Alex Lawther, who plays her brother — talked about the possibility of something like “Alien: Earth” occurring. “Tomorrow some development might be made that changes how we figured it out today,” she says. You can't guess where Noah's imagination will go. There's so much to explore and such a massive ensemble.” In addition to Chandler and Lawther, the cast includes Timothy Olyphant, Samuel Blenkin, Babou Ceesay and others playing different chess pieces in the game of lifeforms. From left, Jonathan Ajayi, Adarsh Gourav, Sydney Chandler, Timothy Olyphan, Kit Young, Erana James and Lily Newmark star in "Alien: Earth." Those big sets, Lawther says, make it feel like a world has been built. “There's this discovery process that, after seven movies, we can't get back,” he says. Or they're not visible but you know they're out there because you're not sure what's going to happen next. For me, it was just function over form. What function do they provide in the story? Chandler says she and Lawther didn't meet until they got to Thailand but “the relationship was really natural. “I think, for most of us, it was our first time in Thailand. We were there for longer than six months,” he says. “I've never seen such hard-working, kind, funny, warm people.” Some 650 cast and crew worked on the set every day. Now it's a matter of seeing how audiences will receive “Alien: Earth.” If there's a second season, Chandler says, she's game. “I want to see everyone else's storylines follow through.” TV series Alien: Earth captures “the aesthetic” of Sir Ridley Scott's original film, an executive producer has said. Football star Aaron Hernandez's life was like an onion: Peel one layer and there was another to consider. Don't go into “Alien: Earth” thinking you know what's going on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"I think a lot of it had to do with management." Throughout rock history, quite a few rock bands have become massive in England but never truly obtained the same level of fame and success Stateside. For some reason, quite a few of these "close but no cigar" artists emerged in the '70s: T. Rex, Slade, Status Quo, Thin Lizzy, and certainly UFO. For much of the decade, UFO featured the great Michael Schenker shredding on his Flying V, and was an era that gave us such rock anthems as "Lights Out," "Rock Bottom," and "Doctor Doctor," as well as what is largely considered to be one of the greatest live rock recordings of all-time, 1979's "Strangers in the Night." During an interview with Talk Louder Podcast, longtime UFO drummer Andy Parker was a guest, and was willing to share his thoughts concerning why the band came oh so close to breaking through in the US market. "We were so close," Parker admitted (transcribed by Ultimate Guitar). Parker further explained that, additionally, things that were out of their hands ultimately proved to be a disadvantage to UFOs, particularly from the business side of things. As Parker just mentioned, Chrysalis is doing a splendid job expanding and reissuing UFO's classic albums, as evidenced by the recent double CD and triple vinyl release of their 1980 "No Place to Run," which was their first offering post-Schenker. "I've already been contacted about 'The Wild, the Willing' [as the next reissue], so I know that one's coming," Parker said. "And I have no reason to believe they won't do the others. Chrysalis owned, basically, anything we recorded, so they've got all this stuff. And I'm amazed, it's actually held up.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A recent discussion on Capitol Hill has brought new attention to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs) and the idea of life from other worlds. Davis, who has worked on secret Pentagon projects, mentioned "Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians" as beings that might be piloting unidentified flying objects or UFOs. He said these figures are human-like in shape and size, and could be part of hidden programs to study captured tech. On the podcast "The Endless Void with Kristin Fisher" last week, he shared that he had heard these same four types in closed-door meetings." I wasn't expecting Eric Davis, you know, respected scientists, to say that." Burlison calls himself a doubter and is not sure where Davis got his info — maybe from direct experience or just stories from others. "If true, this would be a paradigm-shifting moment," Burlison said. ALSO SEE: Declassified CIA Files Allege Aliens Attacked Soviet Soldiers, Turned Them Into Stones Nordics are seen as tall, slim people like Scandinavians, with light hair and skin, often tied to old UFO stories from the 1950s. Reptilians gained fame through conspiracy ideas in the late 1900s, claiming lizard-like shape-shifters rule Earth, with links to ancient Asian myths. Even though Davis listed these in the briefing, Burlison thinks UAPs are more likely advanced tech made by humans, perhaps from private companies. He pointed to progress in science like finding the Higgs Boson and quantum studies, wondering why no one has built better engines yet. Some people criticise the hearings as silly, with talk of reptilians and insectoids sounding like fantasy. Burlison thinks people could deal with proof of aliens. "Most would just read the headline and move on," he predicted. ALSO SEE: Elon Musk Talks UFO Sightings And Aliens, Promises To Share Evidence On X; 'I Guarantee...'</p>
