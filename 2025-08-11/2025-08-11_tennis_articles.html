                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three games down in the final set, Madison Keys was on the brink of an early Cincinnati Open departure at the hands of Eva Lys. It comes after her recent semifinal loss in the Canadian Open. Having rallied from a set behind to push for a decider, it seemed unlikely she'd conjure up another comeback. Yet, Keys rattled off three consecutive points to even the score at 3-3, ultimately clinching the set 7-1 in a nail-biting tiebreak. I was just trying to win the point directly ahead of me. I think it was just one of those days where neither of us played great at the same time, but we both kind of kept finding it. "I feel like sometimes that's just a tennis match: you're not both raising your level at the same time, and that kind of happened a little bit today. I also thought we both played really well at moments." As a past Cincinnati Open victor in 2019, Keys is gunning for another triumph in Ohio. I felt like there was times when I wasn't making the best decisions, but that's life. I'm really happy to have been able to in some way figure it out and get the win. There's never any match I've ever played where you look around and there's not hundreds of people around. They're very big tennis fans, and I feel like it's such a great central location for a lot of Midwesterners to come." The Express uses notifications to keep you updated</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And many high-profile players are taking on the Cincinnati Open in a bid to fully prepare for the major event at Flushing Meadows. Sinner and Alcaraz could play the Canadian Open in 2026, but this year the pair decided to start their North American hard-court swings in Cincinnati. Avoiding injuries will have been high on their agenda, with their absence in Toronto allowing them to recover for Cincinnati. READ MORE: What Carlos Alcaraz was seen doing straight after winning his first round match at the Cincinnati Open Also pulling out were WTA stars Naomi Osaka and Victoria Mboko, with the pair having just played out the Canadian Open final. The players are clearly trying to manage their schedules and fitness levels, and many have been left with no choice but to pull out of tournaments. And that is a blow to tournament organisers and fans who would have been eager to see the biggest names in action. The ruthless schedule has now seemingly claimed another victim, with Camilo Ugo Carabelli retiring hurt during his meeting with Ben Shelton in Cincinnati. And he isn't the only casualty, with Marta Kostyuk pulling out of her clash with Iga Swiatek due to a wrist injury that also forced her out of the Canadian Open at the quarterfinal stage. as Ugo Carabelli bows out due to a knee issue. It is, of course, too late for the ATP and WTA tours to do anything about the current schedule, but the constant and lengthy list of injuries and withdrawals must be looked at going forward. Fonseca moves on to the third round after Davidovich Fokina retires. WTA number one Aryna Sabalenka lamented the ‘intense' schedule earlier this month, having also returned in Cincinnati after a lengthy break following Wimbledon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Her nice two-match singles streak came to a sudden halt Monday morning, though. A lethargic Townsend was easily beat by Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, a 22-year-old Spaniard who kept Townsend out-of-rhythm to move through the third round. Townsend had begun her journey through the draw with an intense all-American matchup over Danielle Collins  that left a frustrated Collins in tears and Townsend contemplating an interesting question. Given a choice, Townsend was asked, would she prefer to win one singles major title or sweep the four Grand Slam doubles championships in a single year. Her quick answer was the one singles triumph. “Wait,” she said, “no one has ever won all four doubles Slams in a season, right? That's the unconventional Townsend at her most honest. In 2012 there was an ugly controversy with the United States Tennis Association (USTA), when its spokesman Patrick McEnroe suggested Townsend was denied a wild card into U.S. Open qualifying, an honor almost always given the top American junior. “Our concern is for her long-term development,” McEnroe said at the time. Lindsay Davenport, another top-ranked junior who struggled with her weight as a teenager plus Serena Williams and Martina Navratilova all vocally criticized the USTA and Townsend quit her USTA coaches, choosing to train with 1990 Wimbledon finalist Zina Garrison. Ever since, Townsend has gone her own way. She moved from Chicago to Atlanta to be coached by the father of Donald Young, another Chicago junior protégé. When you watch Townsend play tennis, it is with wonder. You can imagine her catching baseball line drives with ease. She has impeccable instincts at the net, so good it brings to mind John McEnroe and his creative net game. Her excellence in doubles has given her the ability to confound opponents with a serve that she places well and that has various spins and curves. And she isn't afraid to promote herself in ways beyond tennis. Being the best women's doubles player in the world wasn't enough to get Townsend a clothing contract so she unveiled her own line of apparel at this year's French Open, in collaboration with Alexander Julian. This is just the start.” Her outfits now have the logo TT and they fit her sturdy, athletic body perfectly. Townsend is only the 13th American to be the top-ranked women's doubles player, a statistic that makes Townsend smile. Her superior conditioning was in evidence Saturday afternoon. At every changeover Samsonava was wrapped in ice towels and packets so that she resembled a mummy and the Russian who was a Wimbledon quarterfinalist this year, left the court after losing the first set to change clothes and presumably enjoy a little air conditioning. Townsend stayed on the court, walking around and talking to her coach and seemed to be barely sweating. 3 in doubles with partner Zhang Shuai, a 36-year-old from China. It is always musical partners in tennis doubles. Shuai has won two doubles majors, both with partner Samantha Stosur, an Australian who once won the U.S. Open singles title. Townsend won Wimbledon in 2024 and the 2025 Australian Open with Katerina Siniakova and overall has eight WTA Tour doubles championships. Siniakova, of the Czech Republic and who has 30 career doubles titles, chose not to play her since she wouldn't be in the singles draw. But if Townsend continues to play with the confidence she showed in her wins over Collins and Samsonava, she may be playing singles more than she expected at the U.S. Open. She came isoff her own upset of 21st-seeded Canadian Leylah Fernandez who was a finalist at the 2021 U.S. Open to get to Townsend. So there will be no singles and doubles titles here for Townsend.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a new Canadian tennis star who announced her presence on the worldwide stage this month ahead of the 2025 U.S. Open. Teenager Victoria Mboko pulled off a stunning run to capture her first WTA title on Thursday, Aug. 7, defeating four former Grand Slam champions after entering the bracket as a wild card at the 2025 National Bank Open in Montreal. She beat Naomi Osaka in a thrilling final, which featured Mboko storming back after losing the first set. Mboko became the second-youngest player in WTA history to beat four Grand Slam champions in one event, with wins over Sofia Kenin, Coco Gauff and Elena Rybakina as well. She turns 19 on Aug. 26, two days after the 2025 U.S. Open begins in New York. Mboko was born in Charlotte, North Carolina after her parents, Cyprien Mboko and Godee Kitadi, moved to the United States in 1999 to get away from political turmoil and unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo, according to the WTA. The family moved to Toronto when Mboko was a small child. Mboko is the youngest of four siblings and they all played tennis growing up. 333 in the world and it has been an incredible rise since then. Osaka took some criticism on social media following her National Bank Open final loss to Mboko because she didn't mention Mboko during a brief speech at the trophy ceremony. Mboko, on the other hand, thanked Osaka "for an incredible match. I've always looked up to her when I was really little, so it's always great to play with such an amazing player like you." Osaka elected to skip her post-match news conference, but she later clarified her on-court comments in a transcript from the WTA and apologized in a social media post, referencing some awkward trophy ceremony speeches that didn't go well for her previously. "Thanks Montreal it's been a really great run. "You played a great match and have an amazing career ahead! Honestly I was in a daze and I was so focused on not having the same speech as (Indian Wells) 2018 final or the Jenny/Jennifer situation that I tried to make my speech as short as possible." Mboko and Osaka both announced after their Montreal Open final that they would be withdrawing from the Cincinnati Open. Mboko previously revealed she had injured her wrist during her semifinal match in Montreal and underwent an MRI. Mboko is still expected to play at the 2025 U.S. Open, which begins on Sunday, Aug. 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the men's event, Wimbledon breakout star Oliver Tarvet continued his strong summer by claiming his sixth ITF singles title, and first on home soil. The number one seed reached the final without dropping a set, including in a strong semi final win over former Wimbledon Boys' champion Henry Searle, and faced fellow Brit and number two seed Paul Jubb for the title. Jubb managed to get just a solitary game on the board in the final set, as Tarvet went on to secure victory 4-6 7-5 6-1. In the second all-British final of the weekend, James MacKinlay and Connor Thomson secured their first title as a pair, overcoming third seeds James Story and Matthew Summers 7-5 5-7 10-7. Connor Thomson (left) and James MacKinlay (right) claimed their first title together as a pair at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton. After claiming the women's doubles title in Roehampton the previous week, Alicia Dudeney claimed her first senior ITF singles title, defeating rising British star Hannah Klugman in Sunday's final. Dudeney enjoyed some strong performances throughout the week, coming through three-set battles against fellow Brits Emily Appleton and Brooke Black, as well as beating number one seed Tiantsoa Rajaonah, en-route to the final. Facing a confident Klugman, who came into the final having not dropped a set all week, Dudeney raced into an early lead, dominating the first set to take it 6-1. In the women's doubles, Naiktha Bains, along with India's Rutuja Bhosale, came out on top in a close final against American duo Mary Lewis and Brandy Walker. After losing a tight first set, Bains and Bhosale, stormed back to take it to a champions tiebreak, ultimately coming out on top 4-6 6-1 12-10. Naiktha Bains (right) claimed her 27th career ITF doubles title alongside India Rutuja Bhosale. Tournament Director Annabel Graham said, The Lexus British Pro Series Roehampton here at the National Tennis Centre was a great week of tennis.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tommy Paul made a winning return to competition in Cincinnati and spilled the details on his romantic proposal to his girlfriend, Paige Lorenze. 16 picked up a fresh foot injury during his shock second-round defeat at Wimbledon and was forced to wear a protective boot for weeks. You can check out at any time. The American is finally back in action at this week's Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, his first tournament since he ruptured a tendon in his foot - and his first as an engaged man. Last month, Paul and Lorenze took to Instagram to confirm their engagement, sharing some snaps from the dreamy proposal set-up in Nantucket. “I wanted to do it on the beach. Obviously I was out for a little bit, so it was kind of a forced vacation and I was like, ‘This is probably the best time for me to do it'. The forced vacation came after Paul suffered a four-set defeat to Sebastian Ofner at the All England Club. He raced through the opening set before losing 1-6 7-5 6-4 7-5. When they tell you that you ruptured a tendon, you just shut it down,” Paul said of his foot injury, which left him in a boot for two weeks. 16 missed the first few tournaments of the North American swing in Washington and Toronto, and even contemplated skipping Cincinnati. But he enjoyed a successful comeback, beating Pedro Martinez 6-2 6-2 in his first match in over a month. Paul will now face Adrian Mannarino for a spot in the last 16. And the American is now playing for something extra, as he has a wedding to start saving for. This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Will Raducanu exact revenge for her defeat by Sabalenka at Wimbledon? Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. The British No 1 battled gamely against the world No 1 in a tight encounter on Centre Court at Wimbledon last month before succumbing to a 7-6, 6-4 defeat, and is out for revenge here. Raducanu carries reasonable form into the contest after reaching the semi-finals of the Washington Open in late July, although she was then thrashed by Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova in Montreal. As the 30th seed in Cincinnati, Raducanu received a bye to the second round where she met Serbia's Olga Danilovic, who beat Britain's Katie Boulter in round one. Raducanu came through in straight sets to set up this match with Sabalenka, who comfortably saw off the 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in her second-round tie. Follow all the latest updates below as Raducanu meets Sabalenka in Cincinnati. Raducanu hits a lovely forehand winner on to the tramline at 30-0, whipped over the net with top-spin, and then serves it out with an ace. Sabalenka will serve to stay in the first set. Sabalenka looks frustrated as she makes a couple of wild swings during her service game, but she still holds with an ace to stay on serve. An excellent wide serve by Raducanu gives her advantage, but she loses the next point and then follows it with another double fault. Sabalenka is just as erratic with her return, though, eventually firing a forehand into the net and a backhand long to give up the game. “Relax, stay positive,” says Francis Roig repeatedly to Raducanu from courtside. “I cannot hear him, the music is too loud,” Raducanu complains. “Then he needs to speak louder,” comes the umpire's reply. At 15-30 down, Raducanu twice serves to the Sabalenka backhand and draws errors to avoid facing more break points. Sabalenka rattles off another service game and she's in full control of this first set now. Ominous, this, as Sabalenka rattles off a series of sensational groundstrokes off both wings to break again, finished with a forehand winner. This is shaping up to be the most Sabalenka set, with wild swings of quality, but at her best she is almost unplayable. A quick hold, and Sabalenka squares the scoreboard after that shaky start. Sabalenka wins her first point of the match at the 10th attempt, and then follows it with a powerful backhand winner that had some frustration in it. Raducanu misses with a backhand and Sabalenka takes the first of two break points to get quickly back on serve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Eight pairs have qualified via their combined rankings, and Rune (No. 9 in the world) and Anisimova (No. "We talked a bit and agreed that she will take care of the base line, and then I will take the net. I have seen both her forehand and backhand, and she has a lot of power, which is beneficial for me. And she has great hands, so I think we have a good chance." "I won't say too much, but I believe that we can play some good doubles tennis together", says Rune to the Tennis Channel. The US Open mixed doubles tournament will be held this year on 19/20 August  preceding the start of the US Open on 24 August. Rune and Anisimova were for a while just outside the group of eight couples who could qualify directly for the US Open's new mixed doubles initiative but thanks to Anisimova's Wimbledon campaign she moved up the rankings. "I saw her play at Wimbledon, and it's actually a lot of fun, that I said already at Queens that she would win Wimbledon. Eight pairs have qualified for the mixed tournament, while eight wildcards will also be awarded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three years ago, it looked like Felix Auger-Aliassime was on his way to establishing himself as a top-10 talent on the ATP Tour. 6 player in the world, and he was considered one of the sport's most promising young talents. These days, Auger-Aliassime is known as a cautionary tale about how quickly things can change in the world of tennis. Auger-Aliassime's career has been defined by inconsistent play and disappointing results in big tournaments. The 25-year-old has been eliminated in the first or second round in 10 of the last 13 Grand Slams, and he's just 2-5 this season at Masters 1000 events. Auger-Aliassime has an opportunity to buck that trend at the Cincinnati Open, where he's a chunky -250 favorite over Arthur Rinderknech in the Round of 32. 3 Alexander Zverev in Round 1 of Wimbledon and No. It's impossible to predict what will happen when either of these players steps onto a tennis court right now, but only one of them is a -250 favorite. Michael Leboff is a long-suffering Islanders fan, but a long-profiting sports bettor with 10 years of experience in the gambling industry. He loves using game theory to help punters win bracket pools, find long shots, and learn how to beat the market in mainstream and niche sports.</p>

In the first set, Seidel broke with her first opportunity, going up 5-4 before saving several break points against her to take the set 6-4. The loss is a huge blow to Navarro, whose billionaire father, Ben Navarro, has invested more than $300 million in this tournament. Through his private investment firm, Beemok Capital, Ben Navarro purchased the tournament in October 2022 and recently funded significant upgrades to the venue and its facilities for players and spectators. Navarro and her sister Margaret also lost their doubles match together on Sunday. She will arrive at the US Open with only one win and three defeats. Fellow American heiress Jessica Pegula advanced after securing a 6-4, 6-3 victory over Australian Kimberly Birrell.</p>
