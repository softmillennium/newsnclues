It's a dangerous Marxist ideology that was designed to indoctrinate young people into believing in racial hierarchies, aimed at replacing people of European descent in the United States. Language models are being furiously pushed for use in K-12 and higher education to supposedly enhance student learning. Organizations like UNESCO and the Gates Foundation are even claiming that AI-based instruction will be key towards reducing educational inequities. The picture being painted is idyllic, liberational, and rings of democracy. Yet consider that this is a system unlike any before seen in education: A few programs are driving the education of entire generations, and these systems are controlled by corporate-government partnerships. In fact, the Trump administration's new “AI Action Plan” desires exactly this, arguing for a frightening future where AI is forced to censor social justice-related information. To date, the large language model (LLM) systems being pushed into classrooms are created and controlled by Big Tech companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Corporations are actively signing agreements with institutions of education to incorporate their tools into the classroom. At the California State Universities, where I work as a postdoctoral researcher, there was recently a multimillion-dollar purchase of ChatGPT licenses for all students and staff. In 2023, Human Rights Watch wrote a lengthy report documenting Meta's policies of censoring and shadow-banning accounts that put forward pro-Palestine information. Politicians are also increasingly interested in extreme forms of information control to fit their agendas. A database from the World Population Review shows that in 2025, 20 states have signed bans on teaching critical race theory into law. The Trump administration has devastated higher education by cutting off funding for schools who promote diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. It is not outside the realm of possibility to imagine Big Tech complying with far-right directives to ban information, as the industry has already shown shocking acceptance of its role building systems for mass surveillance and deportation, as well as to facilitate the genocide in Palestine. But now, in 2025, we know the multitude of ways the internet has been twisted by corporate and government influence: biased search results, information censorship, flagrant proliferation of misinformation, paywalls, and targeted advertisements. In every classroom, there are AI systems that students have access to for discussion and information. Teachers are using AI tools to structure their lesson plans and curricula. Eventually, if the forces looking to cut educational costs have their way, we might live in a world where teachers are a thing of the past; students may be more used to learning from “intelligent” machines than from other human beings. OpenAI, Google, and Magic School argue on their websites that teachers are irreplaceable, but then continue to show how their tools can do core responsibilities of a teacher's job: create lesson plans, quizzes, tests, directly tutor and converse with students. Stanford's Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence group convened faculty and industry leaders for an AI Education Summit, where they argue AI can “provide real-time feedback and suggestions to teachers (e.g., questions to ask in the class),” “summarize the classroom dynamics… includ[ing] student speaking time,” and “help teachers stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in their field. For example, a biology teacher would have AI update them on the latest breakthroughs in cancer research, or leverage AI to update their curriculum.” These companies' generative AI tools are now being pushed as ways to “free up time and energy for teachers to work directly with students and families.” Yet after AI takes care of the lesson planning, materials creation, tutoring, classroom management, and post-class reflection, what is left? A 2020 report by Boninger et al., as well as a review of AI education by Williamson & Eynon, warned that AI and edtech solutions have been heavily funded by foundations like the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative and Gates Foundation, promising underfunded schools that they will be provided free learning programs. If AI is used to do everything these companies say it will, there will be strong pressures on underfunded schools to cut costs — likely through teaching hours. In these scenarios, there is a crucial piece of democratic society lost. Totalitarianism — as described by luminaries such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor Adorno, and Carl Friedrich — enacts the total control of a population through force, fear, media control, and crucially, takeover of education. Yet, as Shoshana Zuboff articulates in her work The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, the totalitarianisms of Mussolini and Stalin required “henchmen, and their henchmen, and their henchmen” — a vast network of humans to do the work. If a policy was passed to ban critical race theory, Google, Meta, and OpenAI need only compel workers to change the code and deploy an update that instantly suppresses critical thought for millions of students. Unfortunately, plans by the Trump administration seem to be heading this direction already. His administration's recent AI Action Plan dedicates a section to “protect[ing] free speech and American values.” It pushes for “AI procured by the Federal government objectively [to] reflect truth rather than social engineering agendas.” Among these social engineering agendas it lists things like “misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change.” It declares that any LLM contractors working with government must “ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias.” Already, we are seeing a desire from far right, authoritarian forces to censor AI systems. Yet this danger is buried under discussions of equity, efficiency, and personalized learning. As of now, much of the critical focus on educational AI that has made it into mainstream press is focused on whether AI is actually helping students learn. There is an urgent need to bring these considerations into the broader critical discourse, or else we risk missing the chance to stop this takeover. Once AI systems are widely integrated into classrooms, pedagogy is altered to fit this new model, and teaching capacity is reduced in the name of cost-saving, it will be incredibly difficult to build back to a society-wide human-based system of education. Right now, we have a chance to resist the takeover before it spreads and deepens. As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas wrote in his concurring opinion. “And it implicates an unsettled issue whether the judiciary may impose criminal contempt for violating injunctions entered without jurisdiction.” In addition to Katsas, the three-judge panel includes Neomi Rao, an appointee of Trump, and Cornelia Pillard, a Barack Obama appointee, who dissented. “The rule of law depends on obedience to judicial orders,” Pillard wrote in her dissenting opinion. “Our system of courts cannot long endure if disappointed litigants defy court orders with impunity rather than legally challenge them. In March, President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — which had last been used to justify the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — in order to send hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT. People incarcerated at the prison have been beaten, humiliated, denied medical care, and tortured. But during that time, the government flew two planes to El Salvador. Less than an hour later, the government sent a third flight to El Salvador. A subsequent Supreme Court ruling, which is dominated by Republican-appointed justices, vacated the judge's temporary injunction. Then, in July, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi directed the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to file a misconduct complaint against Boasberg. “We strongly disagree with the ruling and are considering all options going forward,” ACLU Attorney Lee Gelernt told Politico after the appeals court's ruling. Contrary to the Trump administration's claims, a CBS News investigation found that 75 percent of the men disappeared to El Salvador did not have any criminal charges or convictions. At least 22 percent had criminal records, although “the vast majority are for non-violent offenses like theft, shoplifting and trespassing.” About 12 out of over 230 people sent to CECOT have been accused of more serious crimes, like murder, rape, assault and kidnapping. One of the men who was disappeared to CECOT is a professional soccer player, Jerce Reyes Barrios, who has no criminal convictions and was seeking asylum in the United States. In the post, he made a hand gesture, which is “commonly known as the Rock and Roll hand signal, or it's sign language for ‘I love you. Many have spoken out about the torturous conditions they endured. As he was dragged off the bus, he asked a guard to help him with his glasses, which were falling off his face. “Welcome to hell!” the warden told them, Suárez recalled.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly seven months later, Israel killed the Al Jazeera journalist and four of his colleagues in a strike in Gaza City. One of the most well-known Palestinian journalists in Gaza – and one of dozens to be killed by Israel during the war – Al-Sharif's death has ignited international condemnation and calls for accountability. Al Jazeera recruited Al-Sharif in December 2023 after his social media footage of Israeli strikes in his hometown of Jabalya went viral. Then a professional cameraman, he was initially reluctant to appear on air but was persuaded by colleagues to front his reports, an experience he called “indescribable.” “I had never even appeared on a local channel let alone an international one,” he was cited as saying in the Sotour media outlet in February. I slept in 30 to 40 different places,” he told the outlet. After he took off his protective gear on air in January, crowds lifted him on their shoulders in celebration. “I am taking off the helmet that tired me, and this armor that has become an extension of my body,” he said live on Al Jazeera at the time as he paid tribute to colleagues killed and injured in Israeli strikes on Gaza. Al-Sharif's reports attracted the attention of the Israeli military, which, he claimed, warned him to stop his work for Al Jazeera, a network that had already lost several staff members to Israeli actions in Gaza, including Ismail Al Ghoul, killed last year, and Hossam Shabat, killed in March. “At the end, (the Israeli military) sent me voice notes on my WhatsApp number… an intelligence officer told me… ‘you have minutes to leave the location you are in, go to the south, and stop reporting for Al Jazeera'… I was reporting from a hospital live.” The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) didn't respond to CNN's request for comment. Israel first accused Al-Sharif of being linked to Hamas 10 months ago. Why it decided to target him now is unclear. In a statement confirming his targeted killing, the IDF accused Al-Sharif of leading a Hamas cell in Gaza that orchestrated “rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF forces.” In October 2024, the Israeli military published documents it claimed showed “unequivocal proof” of Al-Sharif's ties to Hamas and named five other Al Jazeera journalists who it said were part of the militant group. My only mission is to report the truth from the ground – as it is, without bias,” he wrote last month. Al-Sharif was in a tent with other journalists near the entrance to the Al-Shifa Hospital when he was killed on Sunday, according to hospital director Dr. Mohammad Abu Salmiya. The tent was marked with a ‘Press' sign, Abu Salmiya told CNN. The strike killed at least seven people, Salmiya added. Al Jazeera said correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and photojournalists Ibrahim Al Thaher and Moamen Aliwa were also killed in the strike, as well as Mohammed Noufal, another staff member. Al-Sharif's killing prompted condemnations from rights groups and officials. The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was “appalled,” adding that Israel has “a longstanding, documented pattern of accusing journalists of being terrorists without providing any credible proof.” Just hours before the strike that killed Al-Sharif and his colleagues, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said foreign journalists would now be allowed into Gaza, but only with Israeli military approval and accompanied by them, the same embed policy that has been in place since the beginning of the war. Anticipating his own death, Al-Sharif had written a will that was released by his colleagues after he was killed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, has found itself caught in the middle of President Donald Trump's historic trade war with China. The result: an extraordinary concession from a $4.5 trillion corporation that will give the United States a percentage of every high-end AI chip sold in China. The deal, which AMD also signed for some of its chips, could split the difference between two competing Trump administration goals: maintain America's AI dominance while securing a critical trade agreement with China. Nvidia and AMD will give US 15% of China sales. But Chinese state media warns about their chips Although the export licenses were granted Friday, no shipments have yet been made. “We follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,” a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. “While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.” AMD has not responded to CNN's request for comment. Governments, including the United States, have taken control of companies in the past when they were considered to be of strategic importance to national security. But it's not clear that the US government has ever demanded a percentage of a company's business without taking an equity stake – or if it's even legal to do so. Instead, Nvidia and AMD will voluntarily send funds to the US government. The companies will have no say whatsoever on how the US government deploys that money after it is sent. “It's hard to identify any historical precedent for this sort of arrangement,” said Sarah Kreps, law professor and director of the Tech Policy Institute at Cornell University's Brooks School of Public Policy. In recent years, the US government has sought to restrict China's access to advanced American technology in an effort to slow its progress on AI and let the United States get farther ahead. But the White House's reversal on export controls may be an acknowledgement that China is advancing in AI regardless, so American companies might as well be allowed to benefit. It could also give the White House another way to raise revenue for the US government, along with tariffs. “It seems like increasingly, the economic pragmatists are holding sway.” That approach would align with arguments from Nvidia's Huang, who has said that restricting sales of American AI chips is bad for US national security. Chinese developers could simply undermine US leadership by creating their own alternatives if they can't buy American technology, according to Huang, who has met with Trump repeatedly in recent months. The White House agrees with Huang, believing it's better to have China locked into a US-made chip sold through legitimate channels than to force China to the black market, a US official said. Big questions remain about where the 15% commission idea emerged and what it could mean for national security. “If there's a legitimate national security concern about exporting these chips to China, then I don't see how the payments to the US government address those risks. “And if there's not a sufficient national security risk or they can be adequately mitigated … then the US government should just get out of the way and expect nothing in return.” But the chips are widely believed to have contributed to DeepSeek, an advanced Chinese AI model that shook Silicon Valley upon its release earlier this year, raising concerns that China was further ahead on AI than previously understood. So, even if it has to fork over 15% of those sales to the White House, resuming shipments of the H20 to China could mean billions more dollars in revenue for Nvidia — which became the first publicly traded company to top $4 trillion in valuation last month. Combined, Nvidia and AMD could earn as much as $35 billion in annual revenue from sales of their H20 and MI380 chips to China, according to CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino's estimates. That means the White House would earn around $5 billion in revenue. Trump on Monday called Nvidia's H20 chip “obsolete,” saying that China “already has it in a different form.” But some experts disagree with Trump's characterization of the chips. “These H20s are still state of the art,” CSIS's Kennedy said. Although they're less advanced, in some ways, than other Nvidia chips, “they also come with elements that make them extremely sophisticated and valuable,” including their memory capabilities. Nvidia's H20 chip is also good at inference, says Param Singh, professor of business technologies and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University, which refers to the process an AI model goes through when answering a question. But Nvidia's H100 and H200 series chips, as well as its Blackwell line of chips, are much more powerful and better equipped to train large language models like OpenAI's GPT-5 he says. “You have to do a calculation based on what was lost from the export controls,” she said. Trump on Monday left open the possibility that Nvidia could export its super high-end Blackwell chips for a higher price. However, Trump on Monday said that he'd consider allowing Nvidia to sell the Blackwell chip. I wouldn't make a deal with that, although it's possible,” Trump said. They won't have it for five years.” Trump said Huang will return to the White House in the future to discuss selling an “unenhanced” version of Blackwell. “I think he's coming to see me again about that, but that will be a unenhanced version of the big one,” Trump said. Questions from Beijing about the security of American AI chips also raise uncertainty about just how successful Trump's commission policy could be. China could choose not to buy US tech firm Nvidia's H20 chips, the social media account Yuyuan Tantian, which is affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, said on Sunday. It claimed that the chips could have “backdoors” that impact their function and security, following previous similar claims from China's cybersecurity administration. Nvidia has repeatedly denied that its products have backdoors. However, that statement could be less an indication that China won't buy American chips and more a signal to Chinese tech companies to continue innovating in semiconductors even if US shipments do resume, Kennedy said. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called Nvidia export controls a “negotiating chip” in the larger US-China trade talks. But China knows that, and its posturing over supposed security concerns with the H20 chip this weekend suggests that it won't be won over so easily — even if it wants the chips for its market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Agreement defies media reports that contract for Duke and Duchess of Sussex would not be renewed The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have signed a fresh multi-year film and television deal with Netflix, contradicting reports this year that the streaming company would not renew its contract with them. Harry and Meghan, who struck a five-year deal in 2020 reportedly worth $100m (£78m) after stepping back from their duties as senior royals, have collaborated with Netflix on a number of projects, most recently the duchess's lifestyle series With Love, Meghan. With Love, Meghan – alongside which the duchess launched her brand, As Ever, in which Netflix is now a partner – failed to break into the streamer's top 300 shows in the first half of this year, while Harry's documentary, Polo, ranked 3,346 of 7,000 shows. The duchess said: “We're proud to extend our partnership with Netflix and expand our work together to include the As Ever brand. Their new output will include a second season of With Love, Meghan later this month, as well as a Christmas special in December. A boardroom dispute led to Harry stepping down in March from Sentebale, the charity he founded to help children orphaned by Aids in Lesotho. There is also “active development” on other Archewell projects with Netflix, which “span a variety of content genres”, including a feature adaptation of the bestselling romantic novel Meet Me At The Lake, by Carley Fortune. Not all the couple's forays into content creation have been commercially successful. “I wish I had been involved in the ‘Meghan and Harry leave Spotify' negotiation,” said Bill Simmons, who sold his company to Spotify for $196m in 2020 and gained a leadership role at the company.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Judge wrote transcripts from case of Jeffrey Epstein associate couldn't be released because it would risk ‘unraveling secrecy' of grand jury Dismissing it as little more than a “diversion,” a federal judge in New York has formally rejected the Trump-led US justice department's request to release transcripts of pre-indictment, grand jury interviews with witnesses in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, the convicted sex trafficker and associate of Jeffrey Epstein. Judge Paul Engelmayer wrote that the transcripts could not be released publicly – “casually or promiscuously” – as Donald Trump's government had pushed for because it would risk “unraveling the foundations of secrecy upon which the grand jury is premised”. And Engelmayer sought to answer those questions in his ruling. “A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the government's motion for their unsealing was aimed not at ‘transparency' but at diversion – aimed not at full disclosure but at the illusion of such,” he wrote. “Contrary to the government's depiction, the Maxwell grand jury testimony is not a matter of significant historical or public interest,” he added. It consists of garden-variety summary testimony by two law enforcement agents.” Trump's administration had requested the release of grand jury transcripts in July amid intense political heat around the investigation of Epstein – the late financier and convicted pedophile – and his co-conspirator Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Maxwell recently was interviewed by the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, and soon after was moved from a prison in Florida to a lower security prison in Texas, prompting accusations that a cover-up of evidence linking Epstein to Trump was in progress. An attorney for Maxwell says she spoke truthfully to Blanche. But thousands of other documents and electronic files are in the government's possession. In early July, the US justice department and FBI released a memo stating they found no evidence of an Epstein “client list” or blackmail – and that no further materials would be released to protect victims. Yet the fight over Epstein-Maxwell grand jury testimony is not complete. A federal judge in Florida is looking at releasing transcripts from the grand jury testimony that led to an earlier federal indictment against Epstein – from 2006 – that was later shelved. Maxwell has appealed her conviction to the US supreme court, claiming she should have been shielded under that earlier agreement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that the American capital 'has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he was deploying 800 National Guard troops to the U.S. capital and putting Washington's police department under federal control to combat what he said was a wave of lawlessness, despite statistics showing that violent crime hit a 30-year low in 2024. “I'm deploying the National Guard to help re-establish law, order and public safety in Washington, D.C.,” Trump told reporters at the White House, flanked by administration officials including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Attorney-General Pam Bondi. “Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals.” Trump's announcement is his latest effort to target Democratic-run cities by exercising executive power over traditionally local matters, and he has shown particular interest in asserting more control over Washington. Hundreds of officers and agents from over a dozen federal agencies, including the FBI, ICE, DEA, and ATF, have already fanned out across the city in recent days. Trump said he would also send in the U.S. military “if needed,” and Hegseth said he was prepared to call in additional National Guard troops from outside Washington. In making his announcement, Trump described Washington as a hellscape of bloodthirsty criminals and unchecked violence. The Democratic mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, has pushed back on Trump's claims, saying the city is “not experiencing a crime spike” and highlighting that violent crime hit its lowest level in more than three decades last year. Over the past week, Trump has intensified his messaging, suggesting he might attempt to strip the city of its local autonomy and implement a full federal takeover. The District of Columbia, established in 1790, operates under the Home Rule Act, which gives Congress ultimate authority but allows residents to elect a mayor and city council. Trump said last week that lawyers are examining how to overturn the law, a move that would likely require Congress to revoke it. Trump said he was declaring a “public safety emergency” in the city. Trump's own Federal Emergency Management Agency is cutting security funding for the National Capital Region, an area that includes D.C. and nearby cities in Maryland and Virginia. A federal trial was set to begin on Monday in San Francisco on whether the Trump administration violated U.S. law by deploying National Guard troops and U.S. Marines without the approval of Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom. Guard troops have been dispatched to Washington many times, including in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters. During his first term as president, Trump sent the National Guard into Washington in 2020 to help quash mostly peaceful demonstrations during nationwide protests over police brutality following the murder of George Floyd. Civil rights leaders denounced the deployment, which was opposed by Bowser. The “Central Park Five” sued Trump for defamation after he falsely said during a presidential debate last year that they had pleaded guilty.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The EU has received a third 1.6-billion-euro ($1.9 billion) tranche in windfall profits from frozen Russian central bank assets and will allocate 95% of it, over 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion), to repay Ukraine's loans. Ukraine receives funds from frozen Russian assets under the Group of Seven's (G7) Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration (ERA) mechanism. Within the ERA initiative, Ukraine is expected to get $50 billion in loans that will be repaid using future profits from frozen Russian assets. The EU received 1.6 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in windfall profits on Aug. 8 from frozen Russian central bank assets held in the bloc's central securities depositories, according to European Pravda. Previous tranches were disbursed in July 2024 and April 2025. Ukraine is expected to receive all funds from this initiative by the end of 2027. Ukraine received over $18.5 billion from frozen Russian assets this year, then-Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal announced on July 10. Kateryna Hodunova is a News Editor at the Kyiv Independent. She previously worked as a sports journalist in several Ukrainian outlets and was the deputy chief editor at Suspilne Sport.

Russian forces advanced toward the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway in Donetsk Oblast, seizing positions in nearby settlements to support further offensive operations. During the press conference, U.S. President Donald Trump added that he was "a little bothered" by Zelensky's words regarding "constitutional approval" for land swaps as part of a potential peace agreement. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has organized an online meeting between Volodymyr Zelensky and key European leaders. "Next Friday will be important because it will be about testing (Vladimir) Putin, how serious he is on bringing this terrible war to an end," Mark Rutte said. We asked Ukrainians on the streets of Kyiv how they feel about Trump's plan to negotiate a peace agreement with Putin without Ukraine's involvement, and what they think about such a territorial exchange. Previous tranches were disbursed in July 2024 and April 2025. Kyivstar, which serves 24 million subscribers in Ukraine, will reportedly become the first Ukraine-based company listed on Nasdaq. And the situation in diplomacy must correspond accordingly," President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X. The suspected move comes as the Kremlin intensifies efforts to create what it calls a "sovereign internet" disconnected from global networks, trying to replace Western services with domestic ones.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A priest prays over the fresh graves of unidentified civilians killed by Russian troops in Bucha, Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine, on Sep. 2, 2022. Leaving a permanent stain on the reputation of the New York Times, Pulitzer laureate Walter Duranty wrote in 1933: "You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs." The eggs were millions of Ukrainians deliberately starved by Moscow for wanting freedom. And the bloodthirsty chef was Joseph Stalin — a tyrant whose only rival in genocidal ambition at the time was Adolph Hitler. Duranty parroted Kremlin talking points, dismissed eyewitness accounts, and described the Holodomor — Stalin's deliberate and monstrous campaign to exterminate Ukrainians — as mere “malnutrition.” He publicly denied the deaths but privately admitted that millions had likely already perished. Nearly a century later, Moscow is once again attempting to erase Ukraine, while politicians and commentators, wittingly or not, cite statistics that diminish the scale of atrocities. Before going further, let's consider a phrase that has become far too comfortable in international reporting: “civilian casualties.” While civilians inevitably suffer in all wars, Russia's campaign is defined by the intentional targeting and murder of civilians. But there are no "casualties," only victims of war crimes. Despite overwhelming evidence of war crimes that Russian troops have committed in Ukraine since 2022, international media and institutions continue to rely on the UN's official figure of around 13,000 civilian deaths. What protects a reputation more: repeating an official undercount that serves Russian propaganda, or confronting uncomfortable truths? Its methodology, though careful and well-intentioned, excludes vast swaths of occupied territory, where unimaginable cruelty is buried and access is blocked by its perpetrators. Every death must be corroborated by at least two independent sources, which may be feasible in liberated areas but is impossible under Moscow's control. Before the war, it was home to nearly 450,000 people. After months of encirclement and bombardment in 2022, city officials estimated that 25,000–75,000 civilians had been killed. Those numbers alone would eclipse the UN's entire civilian death toll for the war, but they're not reflected in official statistics. These places, where phone lines are cut, media is silenced, and locals are terrified to speak, remain inaccessible to international monitors. And when these areas are liberated, the truth emerges. In Bucha, more than 400 bodies were found after Russian troops retreated in April 2022 — many with their hands tied, shot at close range. Thousands more may have been burned, buried without records, or never recovered. What lies buried in occupied Tokmak or Nova Kakhovka remains unknown. These deaths are rarely included in the UN's figures, but they're no less the consequence of Russia's aggression, and no less intentional than a bullet to the head. Entire towns have been cut off from power, heat, and water during winter. Pregnant women, cancer patients, and the elderly have died simply because they could not access care in time. Another blind spot in the numbers: filtration camps. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been abducted, forcibly deported, or detained in Russian-controlled facilities — many tortured, many executed. Journalists and policymakers lean on it to avoid the charge of speculation. But what protects a reputation more: repeating an official undercount that serves Russian propaganda, or confronting uncomfortable truths? In 1942, the Evening Star reported that 2 million Jews had already been killed in Nazi's genocide — a figure based on incomplete, unverified sources. The journalists who published it are not remembered as alarmists. Today, Russian propaganda exploits the UN's undercount to deny war crimes, minimize Ukraine's suffering, and subvert international resolve to hold the aggressor accountable. Duranty's failure to report on the genocide in Ukraine a century ago reminds us that defending truth requires moral clarity and courage. Kate Turska is a New Zealand citizen originally from Ukraine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. Michael B. G. Froman is President of the Council on Foreign Relations. The global trading system as we have known it is dead. The World Trade Organization has effectively ceased to function, as it fails to negotiate, monitor, or enforce member commitments. Fundamental principles such as “most favored nation” status, or MFN, which requires WTO members to treat one another equally except when they have negotiated free-trade agreements, are being jettisoned as Washington threatens or imposes tariffs ranging from ten to more than 50 percent on dozens of countries. Even if pieces of the old order manage to survive, the damage is done: there is no going back. Many will celebrate the end of an era. Indeed, although U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive use of tariffs and disregard for past agreements have put the final nails in the coffin, the turn against global trade has been embraced by both Democrats and Republicans in Washington over the past several years. If Washington continues on its current course—defined by unilateralism, transactionalism, and mercantilism—the consequences will be grim, especially as Beijing continues on its own damaging course of subsidized excess capacity, predatory export policies, and economic coercion. Looking beyond the existing structures does not mean simply accepting a Hobbesian state of nature. The best option for moving forward is to craft a system made up of coalitions of the like-minded, which together would constitute a network of open plurilateral relationships—smaller and more flexible than the multilateral trading system. Some coalitions would be mechanisms for trade integration and liberalization. Some countries would be members of multiple coalitions with varied purposes, and coalitions would likely have overlapping memberships and variable geometry. From a purely economic point of view, this system would be suboptimal and less efficient than the global trading system was. But it might well be the most politically sustainable outcome that could—crucially—prevent unilateralism from spinning out of control. Along with institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Washington established first the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade—the GATT, which laid out a set of rules, such as MFN, and created a process by which countries negotiated market-opening commitments—and then, in 1995, the WTO. The 1994 Uruguay Round agreement, which established the WTO, introduced a range of new trade disciplines and a binding dispute-settlement procedure, marking a major step forward in strengthening the multilateral rules-based system. At its founding, the WTO had 76 member countries; today, it has more than 160, which account for 98 percent of global trade. Trade policy has gotten both more credit and more blame than it deserves in the economic debates of recent decades. A 2023 National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by Sharat Ganapati and Woan Foong Wong found that from 1970 to 2014, the cost of transporting goods by weight fell between 33 and 39 percent and the cost of transporting goods by value fell between 48 and 62 percent. Seamless connectivity meant that everything from customer and back-office processing to coding and data analytics could be done almost anywhere on earth. Researchers at Ball State University have calculated that “almost 88 percent of job losses in manufacturing [between 2000 and 2010] can be attributable to productivity growth, and the long-term changes to manufacturing employment are mostly linked to the productivity of American factories.” Trade, they found, accounted for just 13.4 percent of job loss. Indeed, that decline in manufacturing employment, which occurred across advanced industrialized countries, started well before Washington signed any major trade agreements. China's emergence as the manufacturing floor for the global economy accelerated this trend, but it did not cause it entirely on its own. In developed economies with robust manufacturing sectors, the secular decline of manufacturing employment long predates the era of peak globalization. The emergence of China as an export-driven economic powerhouse resulted in what has become known as the “China shock”—the rapid closure of factories in particular communities in the United States. These included the weakness of certain restrictions on state subsidization and the nonmarket behavior of state-owned enterprises, as well as the protection of intellectual property rights; the difficulty of graduating members from developing-country status, which allowed them more lenient treatment; and a consensus, one-country-veto decision-making process that made reform all but impossible. At the time of China's accession to the WTO, in 2001, there was reason to believe that Beijing was on an irreversible path toward market reform and liberalization. Yet hopes were dashed as reform stalled under President Hu Jintao and then in some ways went into reverse under President Xi Jinping. WTO rules on intellectual property, subsidies, and state-owned enterprises proved insufficient in the face of the emergence and integration of a China that reformed its economic approach less than expected. And the challenge was not just that China played by its own set of rules; it was also the problem of scale. Such industrial overcapacity, sustained by domestic preferences, state-directed subsidies, and market protections, bears a considerable share of the blame for the current situation. As China's economic strategy increasingly challenged the integrity of a trading system designed to promote integration and interdependence, Washington grew skeptical of the system itself. As a negotiating forum, it has in recent years managed to conclude only marginal multilateral agreements, such as one on trade facilitation that expedites the entry of goods at customs. As a body for monitoring members' trade practices, it has had no recourse when large economies simply ignore their obligations to report policies. And as a dispute-settlement organization, it has been hobbled by disagreements over the mandate and functioning of its appellate body. For one thing, the global trading system has played a central role in lifting as many as a billion people out of poverty. The World Bank has concluded that “trade has been a powerful driver of economic development and poverty reduction.” Between 1990 and 2017, global GDP nearly tripled, developing countries' share of exports increased from 16 to 30 percent, and global poverty plummeted from 36 to nine percent. Another common fallacy in today's debate about trade is that it has benefited only other countries, not the United States. The clearest benefit has been for American consumers, by giving them access to more, and more varied, goods at lower prices. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that a ten percent reduction in U.S. import costs brings welfare gains to both high- and low-income households. Trade agreements also made it easier to export U.S.-made products and services by eliminating both tariff and nontariff barriers in other markets (which, as Trump himself has noted, have generally been higher than barriers in the U.S. market). They thereby reduced the impetus to move production abroad to serve those markets, where nearly all global consumers live, and supported jobs that on average pay more than nonexport-related jobs in the United States. (Imports grew more than 250 percent adjusted for inflation over this period.) A U.S. Census Bureau report found, based on data from 1992 to 2019, that firms engaged in trade “exhibit higher net job creation rates than non-traders controlling for firm size, age, and sector.” In an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Gary Hufbauer and Megan Hogan calculated that U.S. GDP in 2022 would have been $2.6 trillion lower without gains from post–World War II trade—averaging to gains of $19,500 per American household. Trade policy has also worked to level the playing field for American workers by pressing other countries to adopt better environmental, labor, intellectual property, regulatory, and anticorruption practices. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, for example, would have not only opened markets long closed to U.S. products, such as Japan, but also introduced enforceable standards on labor rights, environmental protection, and subsidization of state-owned enterprises in emerging markets, such as Malaysia and Vietnam—key ingredients of “fair trade.” In effect, the TPP dangled a reduction of already low U.S. tariffs as an incentive to get other countries to adopt policies consistent with U.S. interests and values while creating a U.S.-led alternative to Chinese economic power. (Before the first Trump administration, U.S. tariffs were relatively low, with the average applied tariff around three percent and significant restrictions in place in few sectors, such as shoes, clothing, sugar, dairy, and trucks.) Yet such arguments have always been a tough sell politically, since the benefits of trade liberalization are broadly shared but largely invisible. No one walks out of a Walmart and exclaims, “Thank goodness for the WTO!” Meanwhile, the costs of trade are acutely felt by a small number of workers in specific industries. Globalization could be blamed for introducing competition from other countries with lower labor costs, putting downward pressure on manufacturing wages in the United States and creating incentives to move production abroad. The economists David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson concluded that between 1999 and 2011, Chinese imports resulted in the loss of some two million jobs, including one million manufacturing jobs. That loss is relatively modest in the context of the overall U.S. economy: every year, some 50 million American workers experience “job separations,” including resignations and layoffs. Although “creative destruction” might have worked in aggregate, it meant little to specific towns or cities that had no way to replace gutted industries with new ones on a relevant timeline. And there was little understanding of the need for domestic policies, such as effective worker transition assistance, lifelong learning and upskilling programs, and place-based economic development strategies, that aggressively addressed the localized effects of globalization—a gap that has yet to be adequately addressed. For years now, Washington's response to the shortcomings of the global trading system has been ad hoc at best. It also negotiated what was essentially a purchase and sale agreement, rather than a trade agreement, with China, requiring it to buy more commodities and other products from the United States (which China did not in the end fulfill). Despite questioning both the economic and national security value of tariffs imposed on Chinese products such as footwear and apparel, the administration did not want to “reward” Beijing by reducing them. It also innovated the use of export controls, foreign investment restrictions, and industrial policy. Although such measures were focused on strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles, administration officials did not fully develop a clear framework, with guardrails and limiting principles, to prevent the list of products and technologies essential to national security from growing indefinitely and evolving over time into a policy of simple protectionism. On April 2, his so-called Liberation Day, Trump declared a national emergency and announced “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50 percent on scores of countries. Since then, he has repeatedly moved the goalposts for agreements while also threatening tariffs as a cudgel on nontrade issues, such as migration, fentanyl, the war in Ukraine, and even the judicial system in Brazil. And he has sought to impose “deals” unilaterally when negotiations have run aground. Wherever tariff levels precisely land, the current trade wars are almost certain to end with significantly higher barriers to trade. Accordingly, more expensive or less accessible inputs will make U.S. products less competitive, as was well documented after Trump's first term. “Tariffs on steel may have led to an increase of roughly 1,000 jobs in steel production,” the economists Kadee Russ and Lydia Cox later concluded. “However, increased costs of inputs facing U.S. firms relative to foreign rivals due to the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum likely have resulted in 75,000 fewer manufacturing jobs in firms where steel or aluminum are an input into production.” The Council on Foreign Relations' Benn Steil and Elisabeth Harding calculated that productivity, or output per hour, in the U.S. steel industry has dropped by 32 percent since 2017. If the Trump administration's goal is to create more manufacturing jobs, its approach is likely to have exactly the opposite effect. If countries retaliate, it will harm U.S. exports, including agriculture. The U.S. position has long been that no one else could tell the United States what was necessary for its national security. But until recently, Washington rarely invoked the national security justification. Trump has expanded the use of this tool to impose restrictions on steel, aluminum, and automobiles, including from close allies. Exacerbating all these costs is the uncertainty that results from Trump's approach. Consumers, companies, and investors tend to sit on the sidelines when they are unsure about the general economic outlook and the specific tariffs or other trade measures they might face. The United States thus finds itself the subject of a grand experiment in which long-standing assumptions about economics and global trade are being questioned, with significant near-term costs and uncertain long-term benefits. But no matter how fierce the eventual political reaction, there is no going back to the trading system that existed before. And China, lip service to multilateralism notwithstanding, is increasingly doing the same. Either way, the proliferating barriers to trade will reduce growth and damage productivity. For dominant economies, the short-term benefits of this raw use of power and disregard for constraints might appear to balance out the costs, but over the longer term, there are likely to be unintended consequences. Meanwhile, smaller and poorer countries will find themselves with insufficient market power to use tariffs and other trade restrictions in the same way. Other governments may at first strive to maintain the old order, no matter what the United States and China do, well aware that an abandonment of the system altogether would mean a return to a beggar-thy-neighbor world. For some countries, this effort reflects an ideological commitment to the multilateral rules-based system. There is thus likely to be a caucus of countries that continue to extol the virtues of the multilateral rules-based system, hoping that ultimately the United States will return to that system and China will modify its economic strategy to comply with it. This effort would play out in much the same way as the climate change regime has, with some countries coming together around a set of rules while many of the most important players choose their own paths instead. If an anarchical trade system is undesirable, but a return to the status quo ante is impossible, that leaves one clear task: developing a new system of rules even as the global economy moves away from a fully multilateral rules-based system. The most viable option is to build a new system around open plurilateralism: coalitions of countries that share interests in specific areas and come together to adopt high standards on certain issues, and then remain open to other countries that share similar interests and are prepared to implement those standards. For some countries, these coalitions could focus on trade liberalization, based on a shared willingness to provide market access to one another, in whole or in part, in order to further integration and economic efficiency. For others, coalitions could be avenues for pursuing regulatory harmonization or taking on new issues, such as AI, even if in an informal and nonbinding manner, similar to the role of the Financial Stability Board, an international body formed after the 2008 financial crisis that coordinates recommendations for financial regulation. In some cases, a coalition of countries with similar national security interests could coordinate on technology transfer and industrial policy—in other words, around a common approach to restricting trade rather than facilitating it. A coalition could, for example, discourage its members from importing certain products and services, such as telecommunications infrastructure, from countries that pose a national security threat while encouraging the development of secure supply chains among its members. Or it could align export controls and establish common rules for the use of state subsidies. The United States could forge a coalition aimed at building a competitive, collective industrial base to meet the challenge posed by China's scale, as former Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and the Council on Foreign Relations' Rush Doshi recently recommended in these pages. How should the United States incentivize countries to join such coalitions? One option for the United States is to take advantage of its innovation ecosystem—the unique combination of world-class universities, R & D investment, rule of law, deep capital markets, access to risk capital, and entrepreneurial culture. Many of these assets are currently under threat by Trump administration policies, but over the long run, the value of maintaining U.S. scientific and technological leadership should be self-evident, particularly in the context of great-power rivalry. A club of countries could secure preferential access to these opportunities and to those offered by other members of the club in exchange for alignment on a broader array of economic and national security interests. These coalitions would be open, meaning that countries that are able and willing to live by the standards are eligible to join. Some might be quite small, focused on securing semiconductor supply chains, for example, and include, say, Japan, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan. Others could represent larger groups of countries willing to agree to a broader set of rules to govern trade and investment relations generally, such as the successor to the TPP, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, or CPTPP, which was finalized without U.S. participation. In the absence of a fundamental change in Beijing's economic strategy and more, it is hard to imagine China as a candidate for membership in a coalition of this sort that involves the United States any time soon (although there might be room for coalitions cooperating on global public goods, such as pandemic preparedness). It is possible, over time, that Chinese policymakers will change strategy based on their own judgments, driven by demographic, financial, and other pressures. A structure of open plurilateralism, built with allies and partners, might expedite that decision. But after years of trying, U.S. policymakers should by now be quite humble about their ability to directly convince Beijing to change its approach and instead focus on using coalitions to shape China's external environment. In this world, the WTO might wither entirely, or it might persist in rump form for countries that have no more attractive coalitions to join. A key benefit of open plurilateralism is the flexibility it provides. Not being beholden to holdouts in a system in which each country has a veto, the approach creates opportunities to move forward on issues among those with a common view and a capacity to take on new issues as they arise and new members as they meet the standards. In terms of economic efficiency, this is a second-best solution. By definition, the benefits would be shared only among members. Principles such as MFN would be effectively consigned to the dustbin of history. And the variable geometry of custom-tailored plurilateral agreements could be as messy and inefficient as a spaghetti bowl of bilateral trade agreements. But although such a network would be more complex than the multilateral trading system, it might also prove more politically sustainable. It is a pragmatic response to the current challenge: maintaining at least some rules without the multilateral rules-based system. These downsides will remain even in the best-designed system, and it will be essential to find better solutions for the harms. Any new system must come with an accompanying set of domestic policies designed to ensure that American workers and communities can thrive in a rapidly changing economy, whether that change comes from trade, technology, or immigration. Past administrations have made modest attempts at place-based economic development and worker retraining, but never with the seriousness of purpose or degree of prioritization that will be necessary. Low-income Americans spend a disproportionate share of their income on imported goods. Industries that employ blue-collar workers depend on imported inputs. So while attention is focused on tariffs, policymakers should be devoting at least as much effort to preparing for the AI-driven restructuring of the American workforce. As with trade, the benefits might be widely shared. But in this case, the costs might be, as well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. He served as a Lieutenant General in the U.S. Air Force. Some point to the proliferation of small, cheap unmanned drones as evidence that traditional air superiority—the ability to control the skies—has been rendered obsolete. Others cite a “smart bomb trap,” the idea that leaders have grown overconfident in the ability of precision airstrikes to coerce states into submission. These critics argue that airpower alone cannot achieve political objectives and in fact often leads to endless, pointless bombing campaigns. The political scientist Robert Pape, for example, asserted in 1996 that “no strategic bombing campaign has ever yielded decisive results.” Underneath these critiques is a clear message: airpower is too limited, too expensive, or too reliant on the promises of technological innovations to matter much. Then, in June, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, an air campaign against Iran. Over the course of just 12 days, Israel's air force flew around 1,500 combat sorties, conducted more than 600 aerial refuelings, and struck over 900 Iranian targets, including hardened nuclear facilities, missile batteries, and military command centers. The results were decisive: Iran's nuclear program was significantly disrupted, key elements of its air defense network were shattered, and Tehran's military leadership suffered serious blows. All the while, not a single manned Israeli aircraft was lost. Although Israel did not fully eliminate Iran's nuclear capabilities, its air campaign delayed, degraded, and deterred Iran's ambitions, and further transformed the Middle East's political landscape. It reaffirmed airpower's ability to achieve meaningful political outcomes without a drawn-out ground war. The 1991 U.S.-led Desert Storm air campaign established the tenets of modern air warfare: gain air superiority, simultaneously strike key enemy centers of gravity, use stealth and precision, and prioritize desired effects over attrition of forces alone. The Israeli air force used stealth F-35I fighter jets to suppress and destroy Iranian surface-to-air missile batteries. These aircraft provided real-time targeting information to nonstealth F-15I and F-16I fighters, which carried out precision strikes on additional targets. Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) collected intelligence, jammed communications, and allowed Israel to deliver additional precision-guided munitions. By degrading Iranian defenses, Israel also cleared the way for the United States' Operation Midnight Hammer, in which B-2 stealth bombers struck deeply buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz, reachable only by U.S. Some critics have pointed out that the campaign failed to destroy all of Iran's nuclear infrastructure. By those standards, Rising Lion was a resounding success. By crippling key enrichment and weapons-support sites, eliminating senior military and scientific personnel, and gaining air superiority over Iran, Israel imposed a strategy of denial by delay—all without committing ground forces to Iran or becoming entangled in a prolonged conflict. Indeed, any Iranian efforts to enrich uranium or rebuild facilities will now occur under the shadow of Israeli precision air attacks. To be sure, Rising Lion was not an air-only campaign. Covert ground teams inside Iran used small drones to suppress defenses and relay coordinates. And an extensive set of military actions waged over several years in Gaza, Lebanon, and Syria had already severely degraded Iran's regional proxies, blunting Tehran's ability to retaliate. But it was airpower that played the predominant role. Leading-edge airpower capabilities have improved markedly since Desert Storm, when aircraft lacked accurate sensing technology, real-time connectivity, and all-weather munitions. Today's fifth-generation fighters, such as the F-35, can integrate data from a variety of onboard sensors, fuse it into accurate targeting information, and share it with other aircraft. F-35s function as integrated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensor-shooters, giving users more information and digital connectivity that they can use to precisely strike targets as they are revealed. As a result of these innovations, fewer fifth-generation aircraft are needed to achieve what would otherwise require dozens of less capable nonstealth aircraft. Technological advances are not restricted to modern combat aircraft, however. Air defenses have become cheaper and more adaptable than ever. Artificial intelligence, autonomous weapons systems, and advanced information integration are changing the character of warfare. In the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, for example, Azerbaijan used a network of Bayraktar TB2 drones, loitering munitions, and real-time targeting data to devastating effect against Armenian forces. Airpower can still be used to change adversary behavior, enforce strategic redlines, and reshape regional military balance—all without bleeding a country's treasury or excessively risking its sons and daughters. In fact, Russia's inability to achieve air superiority over Ukraine turned what the Kremlin assumed would be a fast and simple invasion into a grinding war of attrition. Israel, by contrast, used modern airpower to avoid such a trap. All this doesn't mean air campaigns alone can do everything: operations from any domain never achieve victory in isolation. Rather, it is a unique instrument of strategic leverage. In other words, Israel's air campaign did not just set back Iran's nuclear program. It reaffirmed that airpower can be the foundation of modern military success. Investing in air superiority is not optional for American security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's positions will only deteriorate further down the road, and "everyone knows" that Vladimir Zelensky will have to trade land for peace, Director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University Peter Kuznick told TASS, commenting on plans to hold a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US leader Donald Trump in Alaska on August 15. "Zelensky says he won't trade land for peace, but everyone knows he will have to. If he doesn't know it, Ukraine will have to find a leader who does," the prominent US political analyst and Professor of History said. "There is no way Ukraine is joining NATO in the foreseeable future or clawing back the land that Russia has seized," Kuznick emphasized. "This is actually the strongest position Ukraine will be in given its shortage of manpower, weapons, strategy, finances, and morale," the expert noted. Trump said on Friday that he expects to meet with Putin in Alaska on August 15. The date and venue for the upcoming talks were later confirmed by Kremlin Aide Yury Ushakov, who said that Putin and Trump will focus on discussing scenarios of reaching a lasting peace in Ukraine. Ushakov stressed that the Kremlin expects any follow-up meeting between the two leaders to take place on Russian soil after their talks in Alaska. Zelensky said on August 9 that the answer to Ukraine's territorial question already is in the country's Constitution and "no one will deviate from this." Trump explained on August 8 that a potential deal could require Ukraine to surrender significant parts of its territory and Russia to return some land to Ukraine as he warned that Zelensky "will have to get ready to sign something."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four Al Jazeera journalists including correspondent Anas al-Sharif have been killed in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City, Qatar's TV channel said. The journalists were in a tent for media workers outside al-Shifa Hospital when the strike using a drone was launched minutes before midnight local time (GMT +3), killing seven people. In turn, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had struck "the terrorist Anas Al-Sharif, who posed as a journalist for the Al Jazeera network." According to the Israeli military, he led a terrorist cell in the radical Palestinian movement and "was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops." The Palestinian enclave said on August 5 that the number of reporters killed there had risen above 230. And the Gaza Health Ministry reported on August 10 that the total death toll since the Gaza conflict escalated in October 2023 had climbed to 61,430, with more than 153,000 people injured. The situation in the Middle East deteriorated sharply after armed supporters of the Palestinian Hamas movement from the Gaza Strip entered Israeli territory on October 7, 2023, killing residents of border settlements and taking hostages. The radicals called this attack a response to Israel's actions against the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Israel blockaded Gaza and launched a military operation in the strip to free the hostages and dismantle Hamas's fighting capability. Several rounds of negotiations mediated by Qatar, Egypt, and the United States failed.</p>
