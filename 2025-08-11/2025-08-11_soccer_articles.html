                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several European leagues kicked off the new season this weekend, and MLS is in full form in the second half of the year, including the Leagues Cup, which means there's a ton of U.S. Men's National Team talent pool action to catch up on. Let's rewind some of the USMNT's top moments at their respective clubs from this weekend: Chris Richards started the new season with Crystal Palace the same way he ended last season — by lifting silverware. In the first regular-season match, Dest scored again. Just before half-time, Dest netted PSV's third goal on the way to a relentless 6-1 victory. It's a great showing for Dest, who missed much of last season rehabbing from an ACL injury. Arfsten picked up a quick pass from his Crew teammateAndres Herrera, and managed to regain control of the ball with a dribble before knocking it high into the far post. Columbus won two of its three group stage matches in Leagues Cup but won't advance to the knockout round because of goal differential. The transfer window has seen a slew of moves for USMNT players. Midfielder Malik Tillman, who had a strong Gold Cup, transferred to Leverkusen (Bundesliga). Tim Weah made the move from Juventus (Serie A) to Olympique de Marseille (Ligue 1). Matt Turner returned home to the New England Revolution (MLS). Strikers Patrick Agyemang (Derby County) and Damian Downs (Southampton) both signed with EFL Championship, Division II English squads. Downs assisted Jack Stephen on the go-ahead score in 90+6.</p>

In addition to stadiums, volunteers will provide support across at training sites, airports and hotels. The 2022 final with Lionel Messi leading Argentina past Kylian Mbappé and France, drew a record 1.42 billion viewers, including 26 million in the U.S. “The Super Bowl, which is fantastic, has what, 120-130 million viewers? The World Cup has 6  billion,” Infantino told Fox Sports in April. “A World Cup is 104 Super Bowls in one month.” Volunteers in the past ranged from students to seniors. No experience is required but applicants must be at least 18 years old. Those whose applications are accepted will be invited to attend the Volunteer Team Tryouts, which are expected to begin in October. ‘Volunteers are the heartbeat of FIFA events and champions of their host city — sharing their pride and passion with fans from all corners of the globe, welcoming visitors to experience the unique culture of their host city and supporting the extraordinary event that is a FIFA World Cup,” FIFA said in a statement. Los Angeles is one of 11 U.S. host cities, with eight games scheduled at SoFi Stadium, including the U.S. team's opener June 12. After playing its second match in Seattle on June 19, the U.S. will conclude group play at SoFi on June 25. Only one venue — AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas — was awarded more games with nine. “We look forward to being in L.A. [and] probably one of the best stadiums in the world and to get to play there twice in the group stage.” Other U.S. hosts cities include Seattle, Houston, Kansas City, Atlanta, Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Miami and the San Francisco Bay area. “FIFA changed my life,” longtime volunteer Craig Collins said on a video.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tournament, featuring an expanded 48-team format, will span 16 host cities over six weeks, starting June 11, 2026, in Mexico City. Nine matches will be hosted at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, including a Semi-Final. The FIFA World Cup 26™ Volunteer Community will support operations at stadiums, training sites, airports, hotels, and other venues, covering 23 functional areas. “Volunteers are the heart, soul and smile of FIFA tournaments,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said. “They get to show off their local pride, gain a behind-the-scenes view of the tournament and make memories and friendships that can last a lifetime, while supporting a historic event.” No prior volunteering experience is required, but applicants must be at least 18 years old, eligible to volunteer in the host country, and have a good command of English. “I'm so proud to be part of this moment – not just for FIFA, but for my city,” Collins said. Volunteers will receive an official FIFA World Cup 26™ uniform, exclusive reward items, meals during shifts, a volunteer certificate, and skills-based learning opportunities. Volunteers must commit to eight shifts, attend pre-event training, and pass a background check. The program welcomes individuals from all backgrounds, uniting them through a shared passion for soccer and community engagement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Spanish behemoths, aiming to dethrone Barcelona domestically and claim a 16th Champions League crown this term, travel to Innsbruck in midweek and face a historically humble WSG Tirol side that have started the Austrian Bundesliga season brightly. Alonso would've learned plenty about his squad in the United States, with only one addition made since Madrid returned to the Spanish capital, but there's still much to be done if Madrid are to leapfrog an imperious-looking Blaugrana. Here's how Real Madrid could line up for their one and only preseason outing of the summer. GK: Andriy Lunin—Thibaut Courtois was impressive at the Club World Cup, and doesn't exactly need to play here. RB: Trent Alexander-Arnold—The Englishman's injury altered Alonso's tactical plan for their Club World Cup semifinal defeat to Paris Saint-Germain, with the Spaniard previously utilising Alexander-Arnold as a wing-back. It seems unlikely that the new manager will have sustained success with a back three. However, for now, he's a part of Alonso's plans and will be used alongside Madrid's more experienced options here. CB: Dean Huijsen—The new signing has hit the ground running right away and looks to be an indispensable figure in Madrid's defense. CM: Aurélien Tchouaméni—The versatile Frenchman is set to play an important role for the flexible Alonso during the Spaniard's first season. CM: Thiago Pitarch—There could be an opportunity for the 18-year-old in Austria, after he impressed in a behind-closed-doors clash against Leganes. CM: Dani Ceballos—There could be a start for Ceballos, who enjoyed a resurgent campaign in 2024–25, with Eduardo Camavinga and Jude Bellingham out injured. The new boss trusts the talented Turkish playmaker, and he could be used in an advanced role here. ST: Vinicíus Júnior—The Brazilian's stock has slumped considerably over the past 12 months, and doubts remain over his Madrid future amid a contract dispute. Still, Alonso has insisted that Viní Jr remains a big part of his plans. Can he make the superstar partnership work up top?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Home > Morocco > Royal Decree Ends ‘World Cup Government' Race as New Foundation Takes Charge A royal decree (dahir) has officially put an end to the political battle over who will lead Morocco's government during the 2030 World Cup. Marrakech – A royal decree (dahir) has officially put an end to the political battle over who will lead Morocco's government during the 2030 World Cup. The announcement came after King Mohammed VI issued Decree No. The foundation is described as “a public benefit institution, not aimed at making profit, with legal personality and financial independence,” according to the law. Among the executive council's powers will be evaluating the progress of projects related to international event preparations based on received reports and suggesting necessary measures when required. It will also monitor the implementation of state commitments linked to organizing these international events. The legislation also establishes an advisory council serving as a space for dialogue and reflection. This council aims to mobilize all the country's vital forces through a participatory and inclusive approach to help create suitable conditions for successfully organizing these international football events. It will be chaired by the foundation's president and include representatives from the private sector, civil society, Moroccans living abroad, Moroccan football representatives, and African experts. A territorial management committee, chaired by the Minister of Interior, will be responsible for monitoring and coordinating the implementation of regional state commitments. These include advanced infrastructure and development projects that will benefit all Moroccan citizens. During a previous ministerial conference hosted by the National Higher School of Administration (ENSA) in Rabat, the foundation's president explained that these projects are based on a coherent approach among all stakeholders for integrated development in sports, economic, and territorial domains. Regarding transportation project financing, Lekjaa confirmed a partnership between public and private sectors, with annual state support of MAD 1.6 billion ($160 million) until 2030. Concerning financial arrangements, the Morocco 2030 Foundation president stated that they were designed not to burden the general budget, through an innovative concept based on partnership with the Caisse de Dépôt et de Gestion (CDG) and the National Company for Construction and Management of Sports Facilities (SONARGES), allowing cost recovery over twenty years. They pointed out that this step distances ongoing projects from political and electoral exploitation, rising above narrow calculations and the rhetoric about who will lead the “World Cup government,” warning against turning this description into what local media have portrayed as an “electoral apocalypse.” With the countdown to Morocco's hosting of major international football events now officially underway, the establishment of this foundation marks a significant shift in how preparations will be managed, placing them under specialized institutional oversight rather than within the regular political contest.

Now, in the first days of August, he was back, with AFC Bournemouth this time, on tour in the United States and preparing for the new Premier League season — a campaign he believes can be an important chance to level up at a vital time. (And with his club facing reigning champion Liverpool at Anfield in Friday's curtain-raiser, it won't be long before he's facing a first significant challenge.) It was a reminder of the 26-year-old's approach to the year leading into that largely home World Cup next summer. Adams' presence with the U.S. this summer shouldn't have been newsworthy. But for a Gold Cup that became as much about who wasn't in camp as who was, it was notable that the defensive midfielder was there despite a foot injury that kept him from fully training or playing in the first weeks of camp. Adams had gotten just one camp with Pochettino to that point since the Argentine's appointment in September last year, and he felt it was important to begin to prove himself and understand his new national-team manager better. “It was a great learning experience,” Adams tells The Athletic. “Just because I hadn't been in his initial camps to begin with. So I think a lot of guys had a lot more time with him than I've had. I've had the opportunity to do that now, so I feel like that will be really helpful in the long run, for not just myself, but a lot of the young guys that had the first opportunity as well.” The Milan forward and sometimes USMNT captain felt he needed rest if he was going to be ready for the 2025-26 season — and, as an extension, primed for the World Cup. Pochettino and his staff agreed to let him skip the tournament. Adams pushes back hard on the idea that he had anything to prove. “It's a topic that everyone wants to have an opinion on, of course, but what Christian did is what he had to do for himself,” Adams says. Everyone knows who Christian is as a person, and how good of a player he is as well. But everyone needs time in certain moments of their career or life to just say: ‘Let me take a step back, focus on myself for a second and then move forward'. And I just know that this summer, while he took a step away, he didn't anticipate that there was going to be that much noise and heat around it. But again, everyone wants to throw his name in the gutter because it creates a big story, or it creates noise around (the team). And that's how big of a player he is and how important of a player he is. “I can't say enough good things about him. The decision that he made was best for him, and it's going to help him in the long run.” It also turned a spotlight on what feels like a growing divide between the program's current players and its alumni, many of whom have taken on roles in the media. Several former USMNT players harshly criticized the team for its disappointing performances in the Concacaf Nations League finals in March, pointing to a perceived lack of heart or passion in losses to Panama and Canada. Multiple high-profile predecessors then offered thoughts on Pulisic's Gold Cup absence, including Clint Dempsey, Landon Donovan and Tim Howard. The comments from Donovan and Howard eventually led to Pulisic's CBS interview. “You can talk about my performances, whatever you want, but to question my commitment, especially towards the national team, in my opinion, that's way out of line, but that's how it is,” Pulisic told the Call It What You Want podcast. Asked about what feels like a disconnect between players past and present in the program, Adams calls it “the strangest thing.” “I can't even explain it,” he says. “I'm not a social-media guy, so I don't follow anything, but when people bring up some of the things that are being said and some of the stories that are being created, it feels weird, because it feels like not long ago that every single one of those people were on board with, like, the direction that the federation was going and how well the players were doing. My goal is to try to create an environment, especially within our team, where guys feel like they can go out, be themselves, be comfortable. Adams says he's “always a truthful guy” and that “the truth can hurt sometimes,” so he doesn't shy away from tougher conversations. That would include talks with former players who have criticisms, or with coaches who might want more from him, or initiating difficult conversations with teammates when the time calls for it. His goal for now, though, is to progress at the club level this season. He noted that this is his first chance to go through a full preseason in three years, and after having a full campaign last year without an injury, 2025-26 with Bournemouth is about reaching his peak form going into next summer. “This past season gave me the confidence that I needed to now say: ‘You could take the next step. Take a step in pushing yourself',” Adams says. There is no doubt that as the USMNT continues to push through what has been a tumultuous two years, it would benefit significantly from having Adams consistently available and in the lineup, much as he was throughout the previous World Cup cycle ending wth the tournament itself in Qatar. The Gold Cup was a huge step forward in that regard. Adams feels confident he's rounding into form at just the right moment. Paul Tenorio  is a senior writer for The Athletic who covers soccer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joao Neves will miss Paris Saint-Germain's Super Cup clash with Tottenham following his red card in the Club World Cup final. The showdown will be new head coach Thomas Frank's first competitive game in charge of the north London side. It will also mark the Dane's first taste of European football following his arrival from Brentford in June, and he has already been handed a huge boost. European champions PSG will be without key midfielder Neves after he earned himself a two-match suspension in their last outing. In the Club World Cup final in July, the Portuguese star was sent off late in the French side's 3-0 defeat to Chelsea for a pull on Marc Cucurella's hair following a VAR review. This was the first red card of Neves' career, and will also see him miss PSG's Ligue 1 opener against Nantes on Sunday. According to RMC Sports insider Fabrice Hawkins, the French giants have worked around the 20-year-old's absence, putting together a tailored training programme for him since starting their pre-season. With last season's extended schedule and the Club World Cup in the United States, PSG postponed their players' holiday period, and only resumed training on August 6. As a result, Luis Enrique's team are yet to play a warm-up match ahead of the new season, and will return to action in the Super Cup. And they will be looking to make the perfect start to the season by landing silverware, especially after enjoying huge success last term. On top of winning a fourth straight Ligue 1 title, the Parisians finally captured their elusive first Champions League title in May. PSG dismantled Inter Milan with a thumping 5-0 win, thanks to goals from Desire Doue, Achraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelai and Senny Mayulu. Neves also played a significant role, as he started in the historic triumph before being substituted in the 84th minute. His absence is sure to be felt against Tottenham, having been a mainstay in the PSG midfield throughout all of last season. The Portugal star was pivotal in the 2024/25 campaign, making 59 appearances altogether and registering seven goals and 10 assists. Spurs will certainly be looking to take advantage of Neves' suspension, as they head into the clash as underdogs. They booked their spot in the Super Cup by winning the Europa League with a 1-0 victory over Manchester United under previous head coach Ange Postecoglou. Speaking ahead of the final, Spurs' new boss admitted his side face a huge challenge, and urged his players to draw on their previous final experience as they eye up more silverware. Frank told UEFA.com: "We're playing in a final - it's fantastic. "[Paris] are the best team in Europe. "It's a fantastic challenge to have in the first game but, of course, we believe in ourselves.
