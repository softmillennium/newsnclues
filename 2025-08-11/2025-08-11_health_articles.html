                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research paper was published in Volume 16 of Oncotarget on July 25, 2025, titled "Dissecting the functional differences and clinical features of R-spondin family members in metastatic prostate cancer." In this study, researchers led by first author Aiden Deacon and corresponding author Justin Hwang from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities investigated a group of genes known as the R-spondin family (RSPO1/2/3/4) in advanced prostate cancer (PC). The RSPO gene family regulates Wnt signaling, a pathway involved in cancer progression. Most patients are treated with hormone therapies that target the androgen receptor; however, many tumors eventually become resistant. The research team analyzed thousands of tumor samples and found that RSPO2 alterations were more common than changes in other R-spondin genes or even some well-known cancer-related genes like CTNNB1 and APC. Patients with these alterations showed signs of more aggressive disease, including higher mutation rates and greater tumor complexity. Using laboratory models, the team discovered that RSPO2 increases cancer cell growth and triggers a biological process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Unlike other genes in the same pathway, RSPO2 also appeared to reduce the activity of androgen receptor genes, suggesting it drives a type of prostate cancer that no longer relies on hormones for growth. "In cell lines, RSPO2 overexpression caused up-regulation of EMT pathways, including EMT-regulatory transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2, and TWIST1." Importantly, RSPO2 showed structural differences from other R-spondin proteins, which may allow researchers to design drugs that specifically block its activity. However, this study highlights RSPO2 as a promising therapeutic target, especially for patients who do not respond to existing hormone-based treatments. This research adds critical knowledge about how aggressive prostate cancers develop and persist despite therapy. The identification of RSPO2 as a key driver of disease progression opens new possibilities for treatment strategies aimed at improving outcomes for patients with advanced prostate cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new generation of malaria drugs failed clinical trials, in part because they were hard to swallow. Chemists at UC San Francisco have found a way to rearrange the atoms in a new generation of malaria drugs to make them easier to put into pill form without forfeiting their effectiveness against the malaria parasite. New malaria drugs are desperately needed, as the parasite that causes the disease has developed resistance to today's best therapies, and this new resistant form is spreading from Southeast Asia into Africa. Now that drug resistance is in Africa, many more lives are at risk. These new molecules could give us the upper hand we need to control this deadly disease." In the 1950s, chemists developed new and more potent malaria drugs based on quinine, an anti-malarial compound found in plants. Today's most essential anti-malarial therapies include a compound called artemisinin that is found in sweet wormwood, which is used in traditional Chinese medicine. As with quinine, artemisinin gave chemists inspiration to make more effective drugs. Artemisinin was combined with other effective drugs into a cocktail, known as artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), that became the standard malaria treatment. We've tracked artemisinin resistance for years in Southeast Asia, but we're now seeing it spread to Africa, where 95% of cases and 95% of deaths occur. Given how long it takes to develop new drugs, there is widespread consensus that we need better drugs to circumvent this resistance ASAP." This would have been an improvement over ACTs, which must be taken for three days in a row to be effective. "For a disease like malaria, you would ideally like to cure the patient with one pill or a handful of pills and be done with it," Renslo said. But artefenomel proved difficult to study in clinical trials. The drug had to be given as an oral suspension - it resisted dissolving, so it needed to be shaken up with a liquid and swallowed quickly. This finicky nature also made it hard to combine with other drugs in a pill. Children also had trouble keeping the oral suspension down after drinking it, making it hard to know whether they had received the intended dose. In January of 2025, artefenomel was pulled from clinical trials. The scientists thought that a less-symmetric version of artefenomel might avoid this clumping and dissolve more readily, making it easier to put into pill form. Their first successful attempt at making this molecule proved them right when it disappeared immediately into a water-like solution. The team continued tweaking the new molecules, testing how they worked against malaria parasites in cells, and then animals, and finally against artemisinin-resistant parasites sourced from blood samples from malaria patients in Uganda. The optimized compound passed with flying colors: it was just as potent as artefenomel, and much more effective than artemisinin, against artemisinin-resistant parasites. "We're optimistic that a simple chemical change like this can pave the way for an effective successor to artemisinin," Renslo said, "one that's cheap to make and easy to combine with other anti-malarial drugs."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A research team from the University Hospital Bonn (UKB), the University of Bonn, and the Medical Center - University of Freiburg has gained new insights into the brain processes involved in encoding and retrieving new memory content. The study is based on measurements of individual nerve cells in people with epilepsy and shows how they follow an internal rhythm. The cells prefer to fire at specific times within these brain waves, a phenomenon known as theta-phase locking," says first author and postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bonn, Dr. Tim Guth, who recently joined the Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience group at the UKB from the Medical Center - University of Freiburg. The research team led by Tim Guth and Lukas Kunz found that the interaction between nerve cells and brain waves is active in both the learning and remembering of new information - specifically in the medial temporal lobe, a central area for human memory. "This suggests that theta-phase locking is a general phenomenon of the human memory system, but does not alone determine successful recall," says corresponding author Prof. Dr. Lukas Kunz, head of the Cognitive and Translational Neuroscience working group at the Clinic for Epileptology at the UKB and member of the Transdisciplinary Research Area (TRA) "Life & Health" at the University of Bonn. While most nerve cells always fired at the same oscillation time, some nerve cells interestingly changed their preferred timing between learning and remembering. "This supports the theory that our brain can separate learning and retrieval processes within a brain wave, similar to members of an orchestra who start playing at different times in a piece of music," says Guth. The study provides new insights into how nerve cells and electrical signals in the brain interact while new memories are formed. A better understanding of these processes could help us in the long term to better understand memory disorders and treat them more effectively. " Patients with particularly difficult-to-treat epilepsy have electrodes implanted in their brains for diagnostic purposes. However, these implanted electrodes can also be used to record human brain activity at the level of individual cells. The researchers used measurements taken at the Medical Center - University of Freiburg and would like to thank all patients who participated in this study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mitochondria, the tiny organelles without which our bodies would be deprived of energy, are gradually revealing their mysteries. In a new study published in Nature Neuroscience, researchers from Inserm and the University of Bordeaux at the NeuroCentre Magendie, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, have for the first time succeeded in establishing a causal link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the cognitive symptoms associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Thanks to the creation of a specific and unprecedented tool, they succeeded in increasing mitochondrial activity in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, where they observed an improvement in memory deficit symptoms. While these are only initial results, they open the door to considering mitochondria as a new therapeutic target. Indeed, when mitochondrial activity is impaired, neurons do not have the energy required to function correctly. Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by a progressive impairment of neuronal functions leading to the death of brain cells. In Alzheimer's disease, for example, it has been observed that neuronal degeneration, which precedes cell death, is accompanied by impaired mitochondrial activity. However, due to the lack of suitable tools, it has been difficult in the past to determine whether mitochondrial alterations play a causal role in these conditions or are simply a consequence of the pathophysiological process. In this new study, researchers from Inserm and the Université de Bordeaux, in collaboration with researchers from the Université de Moncton in Canada, developed for the first time a tool that allows to temporarily stimulate mitochondrial activity. In the present paper, the researchers succeeded in generating an artificial receptor, called mitoDreadd-Gs, able to activate G proteins directly in the mitochondria, thereby stimulating mitochondrial activity. "This work is the first to establish a cause-and-effect link between mitochondrial dysfunction and symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial activity could be at the origin of the onset of neuronal degeneration", explains Giovanni Marsicano, Inserm research director and co-senior author of the study. "These results will need to be extended, but they allow us to better understand the important role of mitochondria in the proper functioning of our brain. "Our work now consists of trying to measure the effects of continuous stimulation of mitochondrial activity to see whether it impacts the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and, ultimately, delays neuronal loss or even prevents it if mitochondrial activity is restored," added Luigi Bellocchio, Inserm researcher and co-senior author of the study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Building upon the success of the first in utero brain surgery for Vein of Galen Malformation (VOGM) reported in 2023, new data published today in JAMA provides further evidence for the potential use of fetal embolization for this condition. This causes a tremendous rush of high-pressure, high-flow blood into the veins, putting the fetus at high risk for mortality, heart failure, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delay. To improve outcomes for patients, a team at Boston Children's Hospital designed a fetal embolization procedure that results in markedly diminished blood flow through the malformation, without blockage, and launched a clinical trial. With standard postnatal care, even at expert referral centers, this high-risk fetal cohort had an expected 90% mortality, with only 9% likelihood of reaching developmental milestones at age 6 months. The investigators point out that five of the seven enrolled patients had unscheduled deliveries, including three preterm, at a mean of approximately 3 days post-intervention. These early results build on the success of our first case, demonstrating the feasibility of fetal embolization for VOGM and strongly suggesting that the procedure is safe and effective, though a full trial needs to be completed in order to draw solid conclusions." Darren Orbach, MD, PhD, Co-Director of the Cerebrovascular Surgery and Interventions Center at Boston Children's Hospital and PI of the study The research team plans to complete a full trial of this approach, weighing potential reduction in mortality, brain injury, and neurodevelopmental delays against an increased risk of unscheduled, preterm delivery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cornell researchers have developed an implant system that can treat Type 1 diabetes by supplying extra oxygen to densely packed insulin-secreting cells, without the need for immunosuppression. The system could also potentially provide long-term treatment for a range of chronic diseases. The findings were published Aug. 11 in Nature Communications. The co-first authors were former postdoctoral researcher Tung Pham and doctoral candidate Lora (Phuong) Tran. The technology builds off previous implantable encapsulation devices developed in the lab of Minglin Ma, professor of biological and environmental engineering in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) and the paper's senior author. Ma has explored a variety of ways to address Type 1 diabetes, in which the body's immune system turns hostile and destroys insulin-producing pancreatic cell clusters, known as islets. Without insulin, the body has no way to deliver glucose – sugar – into muscle and tissue cells to generate energy. People with Type 1 diabetes typically manage the disease through daily insulin injections or insulin pumps, but even with that treatment, patients still suffer devastating effects of the disease. Ma's previous implantable devices have proved effective in controlling blood sugar in diabetic mice, but they can only last so long. In our lab, they had success in mice that lived over one year, and they controlled the diabetes very effectively with some small capsules without oxygen generation. If we implant without generating oxygen, the cells often die within two weeks." Ma's team developed the new system in collaboration with electrochemical researchers from Giner Inc., including co-author Linda Tempelman, Ph.D. '93. The key components of the system are a cylindrical capsule with a ring-shaped cross-section that contains transplanted insulin-secreting cells, and an electrochemical oxygen generator that is roughly the size of a dime and removeable. "We have to meet two requirements," Tran said. "The capsules are immune protective and last for a long time without having some kind of fouling of the membrane. The body never likes when you put a foreign substance in. The new system would enable a much greater number of the 2 million people who suffer from Type 1 diabetes in the U.S. to now have an islet transplant or cell therapy without requiring immune suppression, which is considered too dangerous for routine use. The next step will be to implant the system in a pig model, and also test it with human stem cells. The researchers are interested in eventually trying to use the system for implanting different cell types in humans for long-term treatment of chronic diseases, according to Tempelman, who is CEO of Persista Bio Inc., a new startup she founded with Ma and Flanders that is licensing these technologies. "We see an age where people will be getting implants with allogeneic cells from other human beings, from stem cell lines, and using it long term to treat things that your body is missing," Tempelman said. In pain control, maybe you need more endorphins or some other molecule. In enzyme replacement therapy, you need more enzymes. We're interested in things like other autoimmune diseases where there's inflammation that's out of control. "So maybe you could put a small molecule in that would treat inflammation, and then someone, like a Lupus patient, wouldn't have to take an oral medication. Pham, T. T., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A team led by Ralf Jungmann (Chair Professor for Molecular Physics of Life at LMU and leader of the Molecular Imaging and Bionanotechnology research group at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry) has now taken an unprecedented look at how therapeutic antibodies reshape receptor organization at the single-molecule level, and how this affects the function of the antibodies. Using Resolution Enhancement by Sequential Imaging (RESI) - a novel super-resolution microscopy technique capable of visualizing single proteins - the researchers directly imaged the nanoscale architecture of CD20 receptors and their interactions with widely used anti-CD20 antibodies such as Rituximab and Obinutuzumab. "These nanoscale patterns directly correlate with therapeutic function and provide a blueprint for rational antibody design." Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies act through multiple mechanisms - triggering immune cells, activating complement pathways, or directly inducing cell death. However, traditional imaging methods lacked the resolution to reveal these arrangements in their native cellular context. The Jungmann team overcame this barrier by implementing multi-target 3D RESI imaging, a method that labels receptors and antibodies with orthogonal DNA barcodes and sequentially visualizes them at sub-nanometer precision. We can now directly see how structural changes in antibody design translate into different receptor patterns and cellular responses. This opens the door to structure-guided development of next-generation monoclonal antibodies." Beyond CD20, this RESI technology is capable of investigating virtually any membrane receptor and therapeutic antibody with molecular resolution directly at intact cells. Because RESI visualizes whole cells with high throughput, it enables systematic analysis of antibody candidates at a resolution previously only accessible through cryo-EM, but now directly in the cellular environment and with unique molecular specificity. Looking ahead, the team envisions combining RESI with the imaging of multiple receptors and intracellular signaling molecules to map entire therapeutic pathways. "For the first time, RESI combines the structure of nanoscale receptors with their function in a cellular context," summarizes Jungmann. "This technology has the potential to fundamentally transform immunotherapies." Pachmayr, I., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women who reported having been stalked or obtained a restraining order were each more likely to experience a heart attack and/or stroke in later years compared to those who did not, according to new research published today in the American Heart Association's flagship journal Circulation. "Although violence against women is common, and evidence has linked violence with consequences for women's later heart health, it is still not widely recognized or routinely considered by health care professionals as a potential cardiovascular risk factor among women," said study author Rebecca B. "We felt it was essential to look beyond traditional cardiovascular risk factors in women and strengthen our understanding of the relationship between underexplored types of violence and heart health." About 1 in 3 women have been stalked at some point in their lives, according to data on intimate partner violence collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study notes that common forms of violence against women, such as stalking, are rarely discussed in cardiovascular research. Lawn's previous research linked sexual assault and workplace harassment to higher blood pressure in women. Other studies report that people with restraining orders are more likely to experience poorer health. Researchers analyzed stalking, restraining orders, and heart disease or stroke development among participants in the Nurses' Health Study II, from 2001 to 2021. The analysis includes data for more than 66,000 women, average age 46 years in 2001. These women did not have cardiovascular disease in 2001, when they first shared whether they had experienced stalking or stalking harassment behaviors, such as receiving unsolicited correspondence, that made them fearful. Stalking is often seen as a form of violence that does not involve physical contact, which may make it seem less serious. Stalking can be chronic, and women often report making significant changes in response such as moving." Harmony R. Reynolds, M.D., FAHA, immediate past chair of the American Heart Association's Clinical Cardiology & Stroke Women's Health Science Committee, said she was surprised at the strong association this study found between stalking and cardiovascular disease. "People subjected to intimate partner violence face about a 30% higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the next few years compared to others. "Perhaps because it is our nature to re-think about things that happen to us, making us experience the situation over and over. It's helpful to have people you can trust to talk with, whether they are family, friends, people in the community or professionals," she said. Study authors note that the link between stalking and cardiovascular disease may be due to psychological distress, which may disrupt the nervous system, proper blood vessel function and other biological processes; however, these potential mechanisms were not examined in detail in this study. Lawn said more research, as well as training for health care professionals, is needed to understand the link between stalking or obtaining a restraining order and women's cardiovascular health. "We also need to increase awareness about the potential health harms of experiencing violence and provide women with help and resources," she said. Among the study's limitations are that participants-U.S. registered nurses-were mostly non-Hispanic white women. The findings may not apply to other populations or groups of people. The study notes that previous research indicated that, "violence history, including stalking, is more common among women from minority racial/ethnic backgrounds and those with low income." In addition, the study relied on participants self-reporting their history of experiencing stalking and restraining orders. Lawn, R. B., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For many key pediatric vaccines, completion rates dropped sharply during the COVID-19 pandemic and have not yet recovered, according to Michigan Medicine led findings in Pediatrics. "Our findings show that progress towards increasing childhood and adolescent immunizations is stalling in Michigan, increasing the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases," said senior author Kao-Ping Chua, M.D., Ph.D., a pediatrician and researcher at University of Michigan Health C.S. Researchers analyzed county-level data from Michigan's immunization registry between 2017 and 2023. During the study period, completion rates of a recommended group of childhood immunizations among toddlers (including vaccines for pertussis, polio, and measles-mumps-rubella among others) fell from nearly 76% to 67%. Meanwhile, completion rates of a recommended group of vaccinations among adolescents (including vaccines for meningitis, pertussis, and tetanus) declined from about 81% to 75%. The study also assessed adolescent completion rates of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series – which can prevent several types of cancers, including cervical and throat cancer. Although completion rates rose modestly - from 35% to 42% for males and 43% to 45% for females - the increases were smaller than expected based on pre-pandemic trends, in part because the rate of increase slowed after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Our findings suggest that the pandemic interrupted the progress that was being made in increasing HPV vaccination rates in adolescents." Kao-Ping Chua, M.D., Ph.D., pediatrician and researcher at University of Michigan Health C.S. The researchers examined trends in immunization completion rates by county socioeconomic factors, including income and insurance coverage. "These changes often resulted in the creation of new gaps in immunization completion rates by county income or uninsurance rate or the widening of pre-existing gaps", said Chua, who notes that this is one of the first studies to examine recent changes in childhood and adolescent immunizations by county characteristics. Vaccines have long been one of the most effective tools in public health. In 2019, childhood immunizations were estimated to prevent over 24 million cases of vaccine-preventable diseases nationwide. Michigan also saw a spike in measles with more than a dozen cases reported in 2025 as well as pertussis (whooping cough), with 855 cases reported the same year, including 152 in children under two. "Reversing the declines in childhood and adolescent immunizations is crucial to prevent further outbreaks of measles and pertussis, both in Michigan and in the U.S. more broadly," Chua said. "To achieve this goal, broad-based efforts to increase immunization rates in all counties should be coupled with targeted efforts focused on counties with lower income and higher uninsurance rates."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Experts have created a customizable, web-based tool that provides state and local leaders with tailored resources to reduce lung cancer mortality rates and advance treatment. The tool's development and features are described in an article published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths worldwide, screening rates have remained low, leading to delayed diagnoses and care and ultimately resulting in high mortality rates. To reduce lung cancer deaths, the American Cancer Society National Lung Cancer Roundtable (ACS NLCRT) was founded in 2017 to unite public, private, and non-profit groups, with more than 200 leading patient advocacy organizations, professional medical societies, state and federal government agencies, cancer centers, academic institutions, health systems, health plans, and corporate associations joining together to lend their expertise. Among its 10 task groups, the State-Based Initiatives (SBI) Task Group was charged to provide states with tailored resources, best practices, and implementation strategies to address lung cancer, and to create a centralized, web-based tool. The developers made an effort to allow users to navigate the webpage towards tailored recommendations based on their needs because every state or region has unique challenges and assets dependent on existing work in lung cancer, availability of funds, policies in place, levels of provider engagement, and community perceptions. Also, as limiting interventions to better-resourced communities without including underserved areas could worsen geographic, demographic, and cultural disparities in lung cancer outcomes, a focus on health equity was integrated throughout the SBI Planning Tool. Before the ACS NLCRT was established, but more so after, state coalitions focused on public health initiatives to reduce lung cancer deaths have sprung up. It is often said that 'all public health is local,' and the aim of the ACS NLCRT State-Based Initiatives Task Group is to give local leaders, health care professionals, and advocates the tools to efficiently and effectively develop tailored programs to advance lung cancer control in their state.
