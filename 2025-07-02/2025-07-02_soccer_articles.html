As the women's soccer players fought for equitable working conditions, they also found a profound way to give back by funding a program to support female entrepreneurs. "We wanted to partner with someone that was established in that space and could help us help small businesses get on their feet, whether it was starting or continuing to invest in their business." Through Kiva, the Players Association set up a revolving loan fund and a crowdfunding platform to allow women's soccer fans to support female entrepreneurs around the country. To date, over 5,100 businesses have received loans through this program, totaling $400,000. The initiative won a Gold Halo Award in 2023 for its social impact success and has a goal to lend out $2.5 million as the revolving fund grows. "Every conversation with U.S. Soccer's legal team, we always had at least one player represented on it," Annie Reid, director of Strategic Partnerships and Business for the USWNT Players Association, told Newsweek. Stars like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan fought for equal pay, even though their careers would end before the majority of the improvements in pay and working conditions took place. "With that win, that was a long time coming, players started to think about ... Where else do we want to have impact? There's a variety of ways that we at the Players Association, with our players, have worked to have that impact," Reid said. Reid shared that the larger economic justice mission also includes improving access to youth sports, where pay-for-play can prevent people from earning opportunities in sports, and driving equal pay for female athletes around the world. We've seen that drastically improve over the past couple of years. It's super evident, too, in how competitive the women's game is." Despite ongoing pay inequality globally, women's teams around the world have also pushed for better pay and working conditions as a result of USWNT's success. "These women are using their platform to talk about gender equity, economic justice, equal pay. These are all systemic problems, not just in sports, but throughout many different industries," Tess Murphy, director of corporate partnerships for Kiva, told Newsweek. "They understood what economic justice and empowerment meant for them, and they wanted to extend that opportunity to other women around the country." "I ... want to thank heroes like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, who brought that case against U.S. Soccer," Cantwell said. "U.S. women's soccer led the charge after winning the World Cup and making it clear to everyone that women athletes deserve equal pay." Kiva's data suggests that female small-business owners have a high community impact but are underserved in access to funding. These loans help them make key investments in starting or growing their business. One such business owner is Jimbi Mboob, who owns Smiling Coast Beauty Salon in Madison, Wisconsin. Through Kiva and its USWNT partnership, she secured a $14,500 loan to double the size of her store, make interior improvements and invest in social media for marketing. "My credit wasn't that great, and I have four kids," Mboob said. If I could get the resources to start up, getting my own chairs and booths, it will be better. So I used that to buy chairs and space that I rented for a few months just to get me on track." Mboob shared that she's hiring people to help them get into the field of braiding and has also hosted community events, including a Juneteenth youth function that centered around hair care. "It's a lot to deal with, but through these little resources ... The USWNT-Kiva partnership focused on supporting small businesses in cities where they were playing. They've also set up a small business fund for businesses impacted by the wildfires in Southern California. Many USWNT members, like Morgan, have their own business ventures. Their challenging personal experiences in the marketing and sponsorship world, despite being popular pro athletes, helped them realize the need to boost women-owned businesses, especially because they do not get as much funding or support from the financial services industry. "Their thought is, If I'm experiencing this as the known name that I have, what is that like for your average person?" "It's not just for our own benefit, but it's also for the benefit of many women out there, of many individuals looking to us as an inspiration." The USWNT has a friendly matchup against Canada on July 2 in Washington, D.C., kicking off at 7:30 p.m. Aman Kidwai is a Newsweek editor based in New Haven, Connecticut.

GOAL highlights some of the most stirring moments from the CWC so far, with quarterfinals commencing this weekend

As the quarterfinals of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup near, the expanded 32-team tournament has made its mark in 12 stadiums and 11 cities across the United States this summer.

GOAL takes a look at the heart, humor and hype of the CWC through some of the images that have helped define the tournament, which enters quarterfinal play this weekend and concludes with the final on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After two cutthroat rounds — where favorites Manchester City and Inter Milan were eliminated — the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has whittled the 64-team field down to eight. Both underdog clubs are surprises here; they upset the aforementioned Man City and Inter Milan. Later that day, Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field hosts Brazil's Palmeiras and England's Chelsea in their round of eight match at 9 p.m. NBC Sports claims Chelsea is the favorite to win it all, and, to add insult to injury, Palmeiras star Estevao Willian is joining Chelsea after the CWC. The next day, Saturday, July 5 at noon, France's Paris Saint Germain will do battle with Germany's Bayern Munich at Atlanta, GA's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. PSG dismantled Lionel Messi's Inter Miami FC in their previous match while Harry Kane and Bayern held off Flamengo. Finally, Spain's Real Madrid and Germany's Borussia Dortmund close the quarterfinals at East Rutherford, NJ's MetLife Stadium at 4 p.m. and features two exciting storylines. Also of note, Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham was set to face his younger brother Jobe, who recently joined Dortmund, but Jobe was suspended for this match due to yellow-card accumulation. If so, shockingly inexpensive tickets are available for all four high-stakes contests. Other games have tickets starting anywhere from $29 to $134 including fees.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's pretty uncommon for a pair of brothers to make it at the highest level, and even more rare for the two to face off against one another. Gary and Phil Neville, who spent much of their careers together at Manchester United, memorably avoided eye contact in the Goodison Park tunnel ahead of a Premier League encounter as opponents in 2010, while Kolo and Yaya Toure went head-to-head in the 2016 EFL Cup final. Jude and Jobe Bellingham looked poised to be the next brotherly tandem to meet on the big stage, as both Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund progressed into the Club World Cup quarterfinals. However, there will be no individual face-off between the pair. Madrid are taking on Dortmund in a repeat of the 2024 UEFA Champions League final at MetLife Stadium this Saturday, with a spot in the semifinals at stake. Jobe, who joined Dortmund from Sunderland before the Club World Cup got underway in a £31 million ($42.2 million) deal, has impressed this summer, as he attempts to emulate Jude's success in the Ruhr region. The 19-year-old scored his first goal for the club on his first start, against Mamelodi Sundowns, but then received a booking in Dortmund's final group game against Ulsan HD. Jobe will be eligible to return for the semifinals if BVB advance. “I think we all saw that he was very disappointed,” said Dortmund manager Niko Kovač post-match. “I think he did not exactly know that the second yellow card is a suspension at half-time. While there won't be a meeting between the two in East Rutherford this weekend, plenty more opportunities for a Bellingham face-off in a competitive setting are bound to arise, even as soon as 2025–26.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While this semifinal match is against Guatemala instead of the expected side in Canada, it goes to show how Concacaf has improved because any team can win on their day. The USMNT almost experienced that, facing Costa Rica, where Matt Freese had to save three penalties in order to avoid going out. That win will help propel the USMNT in this clash with Guatemala. Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more: This defense has had its moments of poor performances, but when that 2016 match ended in a 4-0 USMNT victory, it's easy to see how this could go. Rubio Rubin has been in good form for Guatemala and will be someone that the USMNT defense has to watch out for, but this is a game where they should be able to get a few goals in the first half to cruise to victory. USMNT: Matt Freese, John Tolkin, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Alex Freeman, Tyler Adams, Luca De La Torre, Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, Jack McGlynn, Patrick Agyemang Malik Tillman, PSV: Even with missing a penalty in the Costa Rica match, there may not be a player who has improved their stock more during this tournament. With three goals and an assist, Tillman has been a central figure to this run and could be rewarded for that with a move to Bayer Leverkusen. If others can follow his lead during this camp, the USMNT will be in a good place. Facing Costa Rica, the USMNT created issues for themselves in conceding penalties and having defensive lapses. It wasn't even a full-strength Costa Rica side either, which is why the result has a tinge of concern despite the good ending. It's something that this team has to work out of their systems under Pochettino and a strong performance here will go a long way. The USMNT must ensure that they aren't beating themselves as competition gets harder all around. Luna will set the tone with an early goal, and it'll be all USMNT from there. Like their opening match to this tournament, it will be a time that things are out of reach by halftime en route to the USMNT putting up a crooked number to book their place in the final. ☀️ Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Join Golazo Network as it help fans get their day started on the right foot on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

While early kickoffs and high prices in NFL stadiums have contributed to lackluster attendance for many Club World Cup matches, the weather hasn't helped either. This has largely forced players to play in summer heat that they aren't accustomed to — particularly those from the major European leagues. Borussia Dortmund players described Cincinnati's weather like playing in a sauna. The Club World Cup has already seen several long weather delays due to lightning. And though the five indoor stadiums will offer relief, FIFPRO did classify the open-air stadiums in Miami, Kansas City and Monterrey as "extremely high risk." Boston, Philadelphia and Guadalajara were listed as "very high risk." Professor Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, FIFPRO's medical director, told reporters on a Zoom call on Monday: “From our research, a couple of cities and some matches on the ongoing Club World Cup can be labelled as having a higher risk for heat-related illness, or, in the worst case, extreme high risk for heat related illness. “There are certain areas in a country that will be more at risk. So think about match destinations such as Orlando or Miami, for example, where you can see over a period of years that there's a higher risk attached to these venues and destinations. “The question is, if we look at match scheduling and match planning ahead of the tournament, if we actually need midday kick-off times in these locations or in these high-risk areas — if we should probably move towards late kick-off times as a preferences for these venues.” The World Cup final is slated to be played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, which FIFPRO calls "high risk." Though discussions are ongoing between FIFA and FIFPRO, there does not seem to be any immediate plans to shift kickoff times or venues. “I don't want to speak for FIFA, and obviously they call the shots, but I think they're circling in and around 3 p.m. New Jersey time for the World Cup final on July 19,” Murphy told The Athletic by phone on Tuesday. FIFA also commented about the weather via USA TODAY: “FIFA's top priority is the health of everyone involved in football,” a spokesman said. But there are seven indoor stadiums (Arizona, Detroit, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Indianapolis and San Antonio) that were not chosen to host World Cup matches. FIFA has plenty of options when it comes to the tournament in U.S. weather.</p>

Began working for Murphy as an intern in 2019

By David Wildstein, July 02 2025
1:00 pm

A top aide to Gov. Phil Murphy has left the governor's office to take a key post at the FIFA World Cup New York/New Jersey Host Committee.

Natalie Hamilton, who joined Murphy's staff as an intern in 2019, joined the governor's office in 2021 and became press secretary in 2024.  She will serve as the director of communications of the host committee.

“Natalie's deep knowledge of the region—its people, its diversity, and its energy—makes her uniquely positioned to help share our story with the world,” said Alex Lasry, the host committee CEO.  “We're excited to have someone with her regional insight, strategic vision, and commitment to community and public service help lead our efforts as we prepare to welcome the world in 2026.”

Murphy praised Hamilton's service.

“Natalie Hamilton has been an invaluable member of my team. Her sharp judgment, tireless work ethic, and strong, respectful relationship with the press corps made her an outstanding Press Secretary,” Murphy said.  “While we're saddened to see her depart for the NYNJ Host Committee, I'm confident she'll excel as the committee's director of communications.”

After graduating from the University of Delaware, Hamilton worked on Murphy's re-election campaign in 2021 and joined the governor's office that year.

In 2023, she took a short leave of absence to serve as a communications advisor to Brandon Presley, the Democratic candidate for governor of Mississippi.</p>

In a summer full of soccer, there's one match that stands out among the rest. The rivalry between the U.S. Women's National Team and Canada is one of the fiercest and most storied in women's soccer. And with the 67th edition on July 2 in the Allstate Continental Clásico, two players are on this week's episode to share their very different perspectives: Lynn Biyendolo, the veteran forward who recently captained the USWNT for the first time, and defender Jordyn Bugg, who at 18 years old just made her first career start.

Together, they join David Gass and Megan Klingenberg to discuss the 600th win in USWNT history (6:30), the superpowers of a soft-spoken leader (15:30), Lynn's thoughtful choice to change the name on her jersey (17:00) and Jordyn's decision to go pro at 17 years old (19:15) before diving into the rivalry with Canada (23:05). Then, the group concludes with some fun rapid-fire questions (34:00) including their takes on ‘Love Island USA' Season 7.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nearly 100 civil rights groups have signed a letter sent to FIFA expressing concern over United States immigration policies ahead of the men's soccer World Cup next year, which will feature several matches hosted in New Jersey. The message cited recent policies enforced by President Donald Trump, including a full travel ban for citizens of 12 countries and nationwide raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials. "If FIFA continues to stay silent, not only will millions be placed at risk, but the FIFA brand will also be used as a public relations tool to whitewash the reputation of an increasingly authoritarian government," the civil rights organizations stated. The message was also signed by unions based in eight states scheduled to host World Cup matches: New York, Pennsylvania, California, Massachusetts, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Missouri. MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford will be the site of eight fixtures during the 2026 World Cup, including the final on July 19. "The world is welcome in America," Infantino said. Vice President JD Vance, in a May 6 White House event touting the upcoming tournament, shared the same sentiment but warned travelers not to overstay their visas. "We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game," he said. "But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. The 2026 World Cup kicks off June 11 in Mexico City.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States Women's National Team played a series of friendly matches against the Republic of Ireland, earning two back-to-back 4-0 wins. After stringing together a series of impressive performances in the first half of the 2025 NWSL season, all four Reign FC players saw the pitch, marking many milestone moments. Forward Lynn Biyendolo, a United States Women's National Team veteran, has been called upon to lead the squad this international window. The quick series of passes opened up space out wide for Sears to run and chip a cross into the box. She is the youngest USWNT debutante since Olivia Moultrie debuted at 18 years and 76 days in 2023. The 18-year-old earned her first start in the very next match and played a full 90 minutes alongside fellow defenders Emily Sams, Tara McKeown and Izzy Rodriguez. The teenager Jordyn Bugg gets her first senior team cap!!!! Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey made her first appearance for the United States on June 26. She became the 29th goalkeeper in USWNT history to earn a cap. A long time in the making, Dickey had previously joined the senior national team this year but had not yet made an appearance prior to this international window. She didn't have a lot of work to do as the United States captured the shutout, as Ireland managed just two shots, both of which were off target. Midfielder Sam Meza also made her United States debut, starting the match on June 29. She became the first player to play in the USL Super League and earn a USWNT cap. She showed her quality in the midfield, using her strength and tenacity to control possession of the ball for the United States, in addition to connecting quick passes. She played for 87 minutes before giving way to Rose Lavelle. Busy couple days for Sam Meza! Next up, Biyendolo, Bugg, Dickey, Meza and the United States take on Jordyn Huitema and Canada today, Wednesday, July 2 at 4:30 p.m. PT.

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player "I grew up watching the Premier League, and Chelsea were a club that won trophies. "Every competition, you have to think, 'I play for Chelsea and that is my ambition'." Newcastle had also been interested in Pedro and had a bid of around £50m rejected, but it is understood Pedro only wanted to play for Chelsea. Watford, who sold Pedro to Brighton for £35m in 2023, will be due 20 per cent of the profit from this deal. Pedro's transfer takes Chelsea's spend on Brighton players to £260m since 2022. He has followed Marc Cucurella (£63m), Robert Sanchez (£25m) and Moises Caicedo (£115m) in making the move to west London. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler says selling Pedro to Chelsea is an "excellent deal" for the club Hurzeler said: "This is a good move for all parties. It's an excellent deal for the club, and a good return on a significant investment in an area of the pitch where we have a lot of competition and are already well served in terms of our attacking talent. "It's also an exciting move for Joao: it gives him the opportunity to play Champions League football this coming season, and he will of course be keen to cement his position in the Brazil team ahead of the World Cup next summer. They will not stand in a player's way if their value is met. After Pedro was sent off against Brentford and was involved in an altercation during training with Jan Paul van Hecke, it seemed an exit this summer could happen. Their existing options include record signing Georginio Rutter, Danny Welbeck, Evan Ferguson and new signing Charalampos Kostoulas - whom the club have extremely high hopes for.

Goalkeeper Matt Freese wound up the hero of the day after saving three of six attempts from 12 yards. Kick off time: 7 pm ET, WednesdayHow to watch: FS1, TUDNStream online: FOXSports.com or the FOX Sports app Two USMNT players, Malik Tillman and Patrick Agyemang, felt slightly worse for wear when they awoke on Monday after throwing themselves into 34 duels (18 won) and suffering eight fouls between them. Tillman has been a revelation at this tournament (3 goals, 1 assist) after finishing the Eredivisie season with a bang (5 goals, 1 assist in eight games upon returning from an ankle injury. And then, World Cup starting XI for the USMNT? We shall see, sooner rather than later. Guatemala found themselves a goal down midway through the first half as well, and their fortunes also changed right before halftime when Jacob Shaffelburg was shown his second yellow card and sent off. Los Chapines equalized through former United States international Rubio Rubin, who switched his international allegiance in 2022 to represent his mother's homeland. At this point of the tournament, Pochettino's team just about picks itself with promising performers (Tillman, Agyemang and Diego Luna) becoming breakout stars across the front line.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea aimed a dig at the Brazilian side upon their exit from the competition. Manchester City will no longer be a threat to Chelsea, whilst Thiago Silva helped knock out Champions League finalists Inter Milan with a dominant defensive performance. The Blues face Palmeiras in the quarter-final, with Enzo Maresca getting his first up-close look at Estevao Willian ahead of his transfer to the club. With Estevao frustrated at his manager, there will be optimism amongst the Blues that they can progress, which would set up a semi-final tie against Fluminense or Al-Hilal. Despite a potential final against one of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or PSG, the Opta Supercomputer is giving out positive results when it comes to Chelsea's chances. Maresca has already delivered silverware in his first season at Stamford Bridge in the form of the Conference League, however the Club World Cup being added to it would make for a remarkable 12 months in charge. Maresca has been forced to utilise most of his outfield players during the competition due to the extreme weather conditions facing Chelsea in the United States. Therefore he will be delighted that Joao Pedro is set to join the club after his £60m move from Brighton is set to be announced imminently. Pedro is available for the Club World Cup, whereas Jamie Gittens will have to wait for his debut after featuring in the competition for Borussia Dortmund. With Maresca a big fan of Pedro, it can be expected that he will give serious consideration to playing the Brazilian despite his limited time with the first team squad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Herculez Gomez takes a look at what the USMNT still has to improve on after narrowly beating Costa Rica on penalties in the Gold Cup. Since arriving to Mexico City giants Club América in 2022, the FC Dallas academy product has been a revelation. His efforts have helped cement three Liga MX titles with Las Águilas, and when including all competitions, that trophy haul then extends to five. Watching the U.S. men's national team from afar as they take part in this summer's Gold Cup. When head coach Mauricio Pochettino revealed his MLS-heavy roster shorn of marquee attacking names such as Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah and Giovanni Reyna, Zendejas seemed perfectly suited to guide the backup squad that didn't have many key players. Leaving the winger out ensured zero representation for Liga MX, a league that was once a vital source of talent for the USMNT. A handful of players were also added in the two following Gold Cup tournaments, as well as at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Why is a game-changing América starter like Zendejas still left out? "He's going to play on June 1 [with América] against [LAFC] to see if he qualifies for the Club World Cup, so he's a player where there was a risk to consider him," Pochettino told members of the media when asked why Zendejas wasn't included in a USMNT training camp ahead of the Gold Cup. América went on to lose that Club World Cup play-in match, thereby leaving a window of time for Zendejas to be chosen by Pochettino, who then didn't select him. It becomes even more of a head-scratching decision when considering the lack of wingers at Pochettino's disposal for the 4-2-3-1 lineup he's preferred in this tournament. Malik Tillman, Brenden Aaronson, Quinn Sullivan and Jack McGlynn all have played in wide attacking roles this summer -- Tillman, Aaronson and Sullivan historically have operated more centrally, while McGlynn is a traditional central midfielder. I've watched Zendejas," Sebastian Saucedo, who has had runs in both Liga MX and MLS while representing the U.S. youth national team, said to ESPN. Alejandro Guido, a former player in both Liga MX and MLS who was called up to the USMNT in 2018 while with Tijuana, was also perplexed by Zendejas' omission. "He's playing for if not the biggest club in North America and doing a great job," said the now FC Cincinnati 2 assistant coach. Last season, Zendejas provided an impressive tally of 22 goal contributions (goals plus assists) across 3,063 minutes of play, one every 139.2 minutes. In a much smaller sample size for the USMNT, that production drops to two goal contributions across a total of 511 minutes since his 2023 debut, one every 255.5 minutes. "I'm a big believer in Zendejas and his level in Liga MX, but certainly when we're talking about the U.S. men's national team, he's not exactly showered himself in glory," said Herculez Gomez, an ESPN analyst and former USMNT striker that played in both MLS and Liga MX. "Do I think he's done enough to merit call-ups? Do I think it's a mistake if they leave him off? That may simply be due to the current numbers. Of the 16 American players in Liga MX in 2024-25, only 22-year-old FC Juarez full back Ralph Orquin (now back at América after his loan spell with Juarez) was as frequent of a starter for his club side as Zendejas. After those two names, the U.S. list then ranges from rotational options to scarce minutes. "[Orquin] should be given an opportunity, you see a lot of new MLS guys getting an opportunity," Saucedo said. "These guys should get one too, but there is a lack of Mexican-Americans in Mexico that used to play at a top level like Joe [Corona], like Ventura [Alvarado]." Guido has seen firsthand how the gap between Liga MX and MLS isn't as great as it once was. Before going pro across the border with Tijuana in 2012, the San Diegan at first considered signing with the Colorado Rapids before ultimately deciding that Liga MX would be better for his career. It's a lot better, and yes, I would be considering if I was starting [my career today] to play in the U.S." As seen in the aforementioned lack of minutes for many U.S. players in Mexico, it's difficult to make your mark in a Liga MX whose split seasons emphasizes short-term goals at the expense of long-term development. While that condensed format leads to unpredictable and entertaining soccer, it also means that many managers aren't willing to take chances on the younger generation when needing to find success in such limited timeframes. "You know the landscape in Liga MX, young players don't get much opportunity," Gomez said. "Liga MX doesn't really prioritize their youth." Alianza, the largest amateur grassroots soccer program in the United States for Latinos, has also seen a developing trend with MLS being able to provide more pathways in players' own backyards. For years, the program was dominated by Liga MX scouts who would offer pathways for budding U.S. stars through the Mexican league. "We love all the scouts from Liga MX and they're always big supporters and they continue to show up to our events, but there has definitely been a shift with more and more MLS teams coming to our events," Daina Lecuona, a director at Alianza, said to ESPN. "There's a lot of these players that were slipping through the cracks previously that were landing up in Liga MX teams, but now that [MLS] academies are getting more and more well funded ... now you have more and more pumping funding into the academy system, so they're sending scouts or being able to canvas a lot wider of an area. On "The Football Reporters" podcast, Jeff Carlisle gauges how USMNT fans are feeling about Mauricio Pochettino's time in charge of the team. With plenty of MLS options stepping up, Pochettino and his men earned three consecutive victories in the group stage and recently defeated Costa Rica on penalties in a dramatic quarterfinal clash. Although they've battled through some close calls, few could complain about a goal differential of +7 through 360 minutes of play. For many of these MLS-based options, the intensity and expectations might be something they've never experienced before in a league that's growing, but still developing. In Liga MX, meanwhile, there are certain intangibles that can be gleaned by a decisive attacker like Zendejas, who has shined in a league that not only has a significant amount of history but also an ongoing domination of the region with 19 of the last 20 Concacaf club titles. And when things inevitably become difficult for Pochettino's men in the Gold Cup's latter stages, Zendejas' experience may have proven invaluable. "The way you mature, the way you adapt to a different culture, it's just going there and thinking exclusively about soccer and leaving your family to pursue your dream ... it's definitely more challenging and I do agree that it brings a different sense of maturity to a player." Saucedo agreed, and despite no current spot for a Liga MX player in the USMNT, the winger still hopes to see others following in his and Zendejas' footsteps. "The way I saw it was, I'm gonna go and sacrifice, going away from home, going and seeing what it's like to play at one of the biggest clubs in Mexico ... everything that I experienced, I soaked it in," he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Joao Pedro has become the 18th forward to sign for Chelsea in just over three years under their current owners. The Fluminense youth product scored 30 goals in 70 games for Brighton after joining from Watford in 2023 for just under £30m, which at the time was a club record fee. Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said it was a "good move for all parties". "It's an excellent deal for the club, and a good return on a significant investment in an area of the pitch where we have a lot of competition and are already well served in terms of our attacking talent," he added. "It's also an exciting move for Joao - it gives him the opportunity to play Champions League football this coming season, and he will of course be keen to cement his position in the Brazil team before the World Cup next summer." They have had a £55m bid for English winger Jamie Gittens, 20, accepted by Borussia Dortmund. Once Chelsea's move for Gittens goes through, they will have added Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap to an already strong attack featuring Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson, Pedro Neto, Noni Madueke, Christopher Nkunku, Marc Guiu and Tyrique George. Estevao Willian is also joining the club after the Club World Cup as he prepares to face Chelsea with Palmeiras on Sunday. The signing of Joao Pedro is expected to add competition for the number nine and 10 positions, with Nkunku expected to leave. Gittens will come in as a left winger and replace Jadon Sancho after his loan spell from Manchester United was not made permanent. It's also worth noting Mykhailo Mudryk remains provisionally suspended for a failed drugs test. Delap comes in to add competition for Jackson in the number nine position, with Chelsea having looked short up front last season. Chelsea are not forcing any of the players in their Club World Cup squad out but could accept substantial offers for Madueke or Jackson, who are not deemed untouchable like Palmer is at Stamford Bridge. It's worth noting Chelsea have eight attackers for four forward positions, but we haven't mentioned the likes of midfielders Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos, who often play as number 10s as well. The prospect of loaning out Guiu and George, both 19, remains open. They played a substantial part in last season's Conference League campaign, but Chelsea need to strengthen the squad now they are back in the Champions League. Chelsea's deal for Joao Pedro takes their spending on initial transfer fees to £1.32bn in seven transfer windows, including this one, under their current ownership. The expected arrival of Gittens would mean the club's outlay surpasses £1.5bn in three years once you include potential add-ons and Joao Felix's loan fee. Even taking into account sales, their net spend is £1.07bn. Thirteen of those have made their debut for the Blues, with mixed returns so far. By buying younger players on lower wages and spreading the payments over long-term contracts, Chelsea's strategy is to unearth new stars and sell on unwanted talent for a profit. But their ability to further bolster their ranks may be determined by the Premier League's response to the sale of their women's team to parent company BlueCo for £198.7m - a process that put the wider business into profit. This move gave them "headroom" under the Premier League spending rules, while Chelsea's finances are also being boosted by playing in next season's Champions League and the Club World Cup run. Chelsea's sale of their women's team to themselves - what does it mean? Edu Rubio, former West Ham, Crystal Palace and Wolves coach: but for me, Joao Pedro is exactly what Chelsea need. He can offer Liam Delap space for forward runs, which will stretch the opposition and offer Chelsea more pockets and options in the final third. Joao offers more of a much-needed presence in that final build-up than Nicolas Jackson. His ideal position is striker but he can also play as a false nine and offers Enzo Maresca more options. Joao's stats in penalty kicks, assists and open-play goals are also impressive. He definitely brings a new game dimension to Chelsea.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is a fresh Fortnite mystery that's swept the gaming world, but this time, football is the mystery itself—it just happens to center on why three of England's biggest clubs aren't attending the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. Why aren't they participating, and what does that indicate about the selection process for the teams? 32 of the world's largest clubs will be invited to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, but none of England's giants. Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal were not invited alongside their counterparts, reports Gistreel, on the basis of a strict points-based system used by FIFA. Manchester United, despite all their past glory, have been performing terribly in the recent past in European competitions. United, Liverpool, and Arsenal did not qualify, forfeiting precious points and ultimately a spot in the longer tournament. There has to be caution against confusing Manchester United with Manchester City, who will represent England at the 2025 Club World Cup. Manchester City's recent dominance of football on the pitch in European as well as domestic football, capped by a Champions League title, ensured their participation. The same could not be assured of United, Liverpool, or Arsenal, whose recent European display was short of the required standard as provided by FIFA. As TalkSport summarizes, “Manchester City, Chelsea, and Real Madrid are already among the clubs to have secured spots in the 2025 Club World Cup.” United, Liverpool, and Arsenal's absence is a reminder that past triumphs won won't secure future appearances—performances today alone matter. Rebuild now begins for the three clubs. Missing out on competing in the 2025 Club World Cup will be a letdown to Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal supporters, but it is an indication of just how much these words mean to them. The “secret room” of this tale is concealed, however, not in Fortnite but in the FIFA qualification system. Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal were denied entry into next year's 2025 Club World Cup on recent performances and not on merit. Rebuild now begins for the three clubs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two all-European clashes, Brazilian flair and a Saudi surprise form the last-eight clashes of the Club World Cup. Eight teams from across three continents have their sights set on the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 trophy as the tournament enters the second stage of knockout phase. After an extra-time thriller, two major upsets, three close encounters and two thumping wins, the quarterfinal lineup has been completed as Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund became the last two teams to seal their spots. Here's how the Club World Cup quarterfinals line up: When: Friday, July 4 at 3pm (19:00 GMT) Where: Camping World Stadium, Orlando, Florida Emotions will run high and the stands will be replete with colour and noise when one of Brazil's oldest football clubs, Fluminense, take on Saudi Arabia's football giants Al Hilal at the 65,000-capacity venue in Florida. Their Brazilian opponents, too, achieved similar success as they ousted Italian giants and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter Milan in a 2-0 win. Their opponents, who won the Club World Cup in 2021, will look to move past a disappointing English Premier League season and enter the business end of the competition for a chance to finish the season with a trophy. When: Saturday, July 5 at 12pm (16:00 GMT) Where: Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia A win over German giants Bayern will consolidate European champions PSG‘s pedigree as one of the biggest clubs in the world and offer the Paris-based side a chance to complete a sensational season quadruple. When: Saturday, July 5 at 4pm (20:00 GMT) Where: MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey Real have welcomed back their star forward Kylian Mbappe and will hope he returns to his goalscoring form in a tough last-eight clash against a talented Dortmund team. A full house at MetLife Stadium's 88,000 seat arena on Saturday would go a long way to quelling doubts about American fan interest in the Club World Cup ahead of the semifinals and finals.</p>
