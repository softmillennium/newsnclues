                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Historical data fail to show a consistent link between Bitcoin price gains and US debt ceiling increases. United States Senators successfully advanced President Trump's ‘One Big Beautiful Bill' on Tuesday, moving it one step closer to becoming law. Although several solid analyses point to a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, past US debt ceiling increases and suspensions have generally led to bearish outcomes, at least in the six months that followed. However, that assumption weakens when looking at Bitcoin's flat performance. On Tuesday, Bitcoin held steady at $105,000, the same level as five months earlier. At that time, economists projected the government would run out of funds by mid-August. Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, criticized US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's claims that the bill represents a step toward “controlling the US debt.” According to Henrich, raising the debt ceiling while “running record deficits” and lowering interest rates aligns with “modern monetary theory”—an approach suggesting that governments can fund expenditures by creating money, rather than through taxes or borrowing. Rather than focusing solely on lawmakers' decisions, attention should turn to how the central bank will respond. If the US Federal Reserve maintains higher interest rates, debt servicing costs rise. Generally speaking, higher US Treasury yields reflect reduced investor confidence, as buyers demand greater compensation for perceived risks. Historically, this indicator has shown a positive correlation with Bitcoin's price, meaning both tend to rise together, given the cryptocurrency's appeal as an alternative asset. Therefore, Bitcoin holding above $105,000 while the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.25% from 4.50% on June 6 suggests early signs of a decoupling. Even so, it remains too early to declare Bitcoin a proven reserve asset, particularly as both gold and the S&P 500 approach their own all-time highs. Related: Bitcoin holds steady as major catalysts align for breakout above $110K In effect, broader markets appear to be pricing in a weaker US dollar, as evidenced by capital flowing into assets that traditionally benefit from currency debasement, such as equities, commodities, and Bitcoin itself. Ultimately, while the debt ceiling increase may coincide with a Bitcoin rally above $110,000, historical patterns do not support a direct causal link between these events.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin and Ethereum Bounce, But This Meme Coin Is Stealing the Show: Analysis The crypto market is serving up a classic rotation play as meme coins steal the spotlight from their blue chip cousins. Global crypto markets posted gains alongside traditional equities following geopolitical easing, with overall market sentiment shifting from fear to greed. Traditional markets are providing strong tailwinds—the S&P 500 inched higher to a fresh record this week, breaking above the psychologically important 6,000 level for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the geopolitical picture has improved dramatically as oil prices fell sharply Tuesday, returning to levels last seen before the Iran-Israel conflict, with Brent crude dropping 6% to $67.14. Bitcoin's modest 3.59% gain to $109,507 masks the underlying strength in the world's largest cryptocurrency, supported by a bounce after two days of correction, testing the resistance of a bearish channel in play since mid-May. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Bitcoin is at 60, suggesting BTC has momentum but isn't overheated. You can think of RSI like a temperature gauge where 70+ means the engine is running too hot and might need to cool down. This moderate reading suggests there's enough fuel in the markets for another leg higher. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, provides crucial support below current prices, acting as a safety net that institutions often use to add positions. The 200-day EMA sits further below, creating multiple layers of support that would need to break for any serious correction. However, the Average Directional Index, or ADX, at 12 indicates weak trend strength, which is to be expected considering this small correction happens in the middle of what is a heavily bullish trend in play since at least before the last halving. Ethereum's 3.16% rise to $2,559 shows the smart-contract blockchain king refusing to go down without a fight, even as technical indicators flash warning signs. The network scored a major adoption win as Robinhood's deployment of 213 tokenized stock contracts on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 network, signals growing enterprise adoption, proving that real-world utility continues expanding despite price struggles. The technical setup presents challenges that traders need to navigate carefully. The RSI at 54 sits right in the middle of its range—neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a market in equilibrium waiting for a catalyst. This neutral reading often precedes sharp moves once the market picks a direction. But the gap between those two price zones is very, very small, showing markets are basically trading sideways, with traders opening and closing positions with little margin. With institutional adoption accelerating, the bias leans bullish, but a strong bullish breakout is needed in order to wake up the markets. But enough about boring ol' Bitcoin and Ethereum: Welcome to the fun meme coin madness of the day. The meme coin crashed 10% on July 1 due to aggressive shorting, creating a perfect storm for contrarian buyers. Smart money didn't waste time: on-chain data shows a greater number of net inflows to private wallets, suggesting whales accumulated at lower prices. The RSI for SPX6900 sits at 52, showing plenty of room to run higher without hitting exhaustion levels that typically trigger profit-taking. The ADX at 23 is approaching the critical 25 level, and is a good sign for traders considering the meme coin is set to break out of a triangle pattern that could be decisive for its longer term future. The 50-day EMA at $1.10 now acts as a floor. When price stays above the 50-day EMA, it signals short-term bulls are in control. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows compression is "on," meaning volatility has tightened like a coiled spring and it could be potentially bullish if all the other indicators remain valid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is now generating more revenue than one of the asset manager's most iconic products, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Bloomberg data. Despite having just $52 billion in AUM — a fraction of IVV's $624 billion in total assets — IBIT's higher fee structure has turned it into a bigger moneymaker for the world's largest asset manager. Bloomberg estimates that IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee. By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. That means it generates around $187.1 million in annual fees, despite managing roughly nine times more in assets than IBIT. IBIT launched in January 2024 as part of a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs approved by U.S. regulators. Since then, the fund has seen inflows every month except one, amassing $52 billion in assets to date. The rapid growth of IBIT highlights the ongoing demand for regulated bitcoin investment products, particularly those offered by established financial firms like BlackRock. While IBIT's management fee is higher than more traditional ETFs, it reflects the added complexity, custody and regulatory requirements involved in offering exposure to a digital asset like bitcoin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin could target $170K as global M2 money supply hits a record $55.48 trillion. BTC price historically lags M2 breakouts, with past patterns suggesting imminent upside. A weakening US dollar adds fuel for BTC bulls, with DXY down 10.8% in H1 2025. Bitcoin BTCUSD could be on track to reach $170,000 as global liquidity, measured by broad money supply (M2), hits a new record high of $55.48 trillion on July 2. When M2 rises, it indicates that more money is circulating in the economy, including in bank accounts, checking deposits, and other liquid assets. Such surplus liquidity can increase capital flowing into “riskier assets” like crypto. Bitcoin has historically followed global and US M2 supply with a 3–6 month lag, especially during liquidity shifts. While BTC has rallied during low M2 growth, such moves often prove unsustainable. In contrast, M2-driven rallies tend to produce longer, more stable uptrends, suggesting the current cycle may be supported by real liquidity, not speculation. “As global money supply expands, Bitcoin's next target sits around ~$170K, following the flow,” says analyst Crypto Auris. Weakening USD puts Bitcoin rally in play The growing demand for Bitcoin appears against a weakening US dollar. Historically, major divergences between Bitcoin and the dollar have signaled key trend reversals. If past patterns repeat, this could mark the beginning of a new Bitcoin uptrend. Prolonged dollar weakness could amplify this move beyond Bitcoin's typical cycle behavior. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stocks tied to the price of ether, better known as ETH, were higher on Wednesday, reflecting renewed enthusiasm for the crypto asset amid a surge of interest in stablecoins and tokenization. BitMine Immersion Technologies, a bitcoin miner that announced plans this week to make ETH its primary treasury reserve asset, jumped about 20%. Betting platform SharpLink Gaming, which has also initiated an ETH treasury strategy, added more than 11%. Bit Digital, which last week exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans, jumped more than 6%. "We're finally at the point where real use cases are emerging, and stablecoins have been the first version of that at scale but they're going to open the door to a much bigger story around tokenizing other assets and using digital assets in new ways," Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens. On Tuesday, as bitcoin ETFs snapped a 15-day streak of inflows, ether ETFs saw $40 million in inflows led by BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust. ETH ETFs came back to life in June after much concern that they were becoming zombie funds. Ethereum has been struggling with an identity crisis fueled by uncertainty about the network's value proposition, weaker revenue since its last big technical upgrade and increasing competition from Solana. Market volatility, driven by geopolitical uncertainty this year, has not helped. The Ethereum network's smart contracts capability makes it a prominent platform for the tokenization of traditional assets, which includes U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. Fundstrat's Tom Lee this week called Ethereum "the backbone and architecture" of stablecoins. Both Tether (USDT) and Circle's USD Coin (USDC) are issued on the network. BlackRock's tokenized money market fund (known as BUIDL, which stands for USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund) also launched on Ethereum last year before expanding to other blockchain networks. The latest wave of interest in ETH-related assets follows an announcement by Robinhood this week that it will enable trading of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs across Europe, after a groundswell of interest in stablecoins throughout June following Circle's IPO and the Senate passage of its proposed stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act. Ether, which turns 10 years old at the end of July, is sitting about 75% off its all-time high. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Oculus VR founder and flip-flop evangelist, Palmer Luckey is part of a collective of tech billionaires who are founding a new crypto-focused U.S. bank called Erebor. This bank will focus on providing capital for technology start-ups, AI-ventures, defence and manufacturing industries, and cryptocurrency endeavours, as well as for individuals looking to invest in these spaces. It will be headed by co-CEOs Owen Rapaport and Jacob Hirshman, the latter of whom was a former adviser to stablecoin company Circle, as per Reuters. He's joined by the Peter Thiel-backed Founders Fund, and Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded Palantir with Thiel. Both are cited as major donors to U.S. President, Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. The bank is looking to fill the empty boots of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which collapsed in 2023 amidst an insolvency crisis. Like SVB, the filing suggests Erebor would look to “differentiate itself,” by doing business with entities and customers that are not as well served by traditional financial institutions. In an effort to head off concerns of SVR-like liquidity issues at Erebor, the backing group has announced that they'll hold cryptocurrency stablecoins on its balance sheet. These crypto assets have their value pegged to traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which can provide more stability for their value than other, more volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. However, cryptocurrency assets have become increasingly common on the balance sheets of many financial organizations in recent years as a way to hold value and to accelerate cross-border payments which can be slow and fraught with fees. Erebor said that it aimed to become "the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating stablecoin transactions", in its charter application. PYMNTS quotes Brett McLain, head of payments at cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken, ““Everybody's jumping into stablecoins right now [...] “All the big banks, they're talking about creating their own; others want to leverage existing ones.” Regulation of this new banking space is expected to take some time, but the impetus is clearly there to make stablecoins a major component of modern finance and credit, and Erebor is looking to be at the forefront of that new endeavour.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AllUnity has received regulatory approval from German regulator BaFin as an E-Money Institution, the license needed to launch a stablecoin under the EU's MiCA regulations. AllUnity is a joint venture between Deutsche Bank's asset management arm DWS, Galaxy and Flow Traders. “This license is not just a regulatory hurdle cleared, it's a foundational step towards building a truly secure, transparent and compliant digital cross-border payment ecosystem for Europe and global markets,” said AllUnity CEO Alexander Höptner. AllUnity will enter a relatively small but growing European stablecoin market. Despite MiCA coming into force for electronic money tokens a year ago, to date the dollar still dominates stablecoins with 99% of the market. AllUnity is not the first euro stablecoin affiliated with a systemically important bank. Societe Generale FORGE issued its EURCV more than two years ago and was amongst the first wave of MiCA approvals. In recent months it has announced several new alliances. However, AllUnity's joint venture structure may give it distinct advantages over existing competitors. On top of that, Höptner  has an extensive network from his background at Börse Stuttgart and Börse Stuttgart Digital, one of the first institutional crypto offerings. We plan to publish an article on AllUnity next week as part of our Ledger Insights Pro offering, following a recent interview with Höptner.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The voluntary carbon market, a critical tool for global climate action, has long been hamstrung by fragmentation, opacity, and skepticism. But a groundbreaking collaboration between S&P Global and JPMorgan's Kinexys unit is now positioning blockchain technology to transform this $200 billion sector into a transparent, liquid, and investor-friendly ecosystem. By tokenizing carbon credits, the partnership aims to unlock trillions in climate finance while addressing systemic inefficiencies that have stifled institutional participation. For investors, this represents a rare convergence of innovation, regulatory momentum, and existential demand. Voluntary carbon credits—financial instruments representing avoided or removed CO₂ emissions—are central to corporate net-zero pledges and climate accountability. Liquidity Constraints: Illiquid markets deter institutional investors seeking scalable, tradable assets. These issues create a “greenwashing risk premium” that deters capital, even as demand for credible climate solutions surges. S&P Global and Kinexys' exploratory pilot, set to launch in July 2025, targets these pain points head-on. The collaboration leverages S&P Global's Environmental Registry—a trusted platform for carbon project data—and integrates it with Kinexys' blockchain infrastructure. A system that turns carbon credits into programmable, tokenized assets, governed by smart contracts and recorded on an immutable ledger. Key Innovations:- Standardization: A unified data model ensures credits from reforestation, renewable energy, or carbon capture projects are comparable.- Fraud Prevention: Blockchain's “single source of truth” eliminates double-counting and ensures credits are retired upon purchase.- Streamlined Settlements: Cross-chain capabilities enable frictionless transfers, mirroring the efficiency of traditional financial markets. Tokenization creates an audit trail, enabling investors to verify a credit's origin, additionality, and permanence. This aligns with growing regulatory scrutiny—e.g., the EU's proposed Carbon Removal Certification Framework—and rising ESG accountability demands. By digitizing credits, the partnership taps into institutional demand for “real-world asset” (RWA) tokenization. The RWA market, projected to hit $18.9 trillion by 2033, is increasingly viewed as a bridge between physical assets and digital finance. Kinexys' prior success with tokenized U.S. Treasuries ($1.5 trillion in transactions since 2015) underscores its technical credibility. Tokenized credits directly support Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which mandates integrity and transparency in carbon markets. Institutional capital flowing into these instruments could accelerate the voluntary market's growth to over $2 trillion by 2030—a trajectory amplified by corporate net-zero commitments and sovereign climate bonds. Regulatory divergence between regions like the EU and U.S. could fragment standards, while overhyping tokenization may lead to speculative bubbles. Investors should:- Focus on Infrastructure Players: Companies like S&P Global and JPMorgan, with established climate finance expertise, stand to benefit disproportionately.- Monitor Regulatory Developments: Track the EU's Carbon Removal Certification and U.S. SEC guidance on tokenized assets.- Prioritize Liquidity: Seek platforms offering tradable carbon credit tokens, akin to ETFs or futures contracts. By digitizing carbon credits, they're creating a financial instrument that marries environmental impact with market discipline. As the pilot unfolds this summer, institutional investors should act decisively:- Buy SPGI and JPM: Their leadership in standard-setting and infrastructure will command premium valuations.- Explore Carbon Credit ETFs: Products like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) hint at future specialization.- Advocate for Policy Clarity: Lobby for global carbon accounting rules to solidify the market's foundation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Currently trading at $0.01475, PENGU registered a marginal 1.86% appreciation over the preceding 24-hour trading period but is still dominant across top exchanges as a very highly traded token. This unwavering support is despite rising activity among so-called “whale” players, crypto wallets that hold over a million dollars in assets. Most recent on-chain records indicate these whales have acquired a total of nearly 240 million tokens throughout the past week, evidencing growing optimism among veteran market players. Following that momentum, the team behind Pudgy Penguins is set to introduce “Pudgy Party,” a mobile phone game that is intended to attract mainstream players and further expand the project's ecosystem beyond traditional ownership of NFTs to phone entertainment. For those not aware, @pudgypenguins is about to drop a mobile game called Pudgy Party.Gameplay looks fun AF, think Mario Party meets Fall Guys. Cboe BZX recently filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to trade shares of a potential PENGU exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by Canary Capital. The filing is a good indication that the meme coin is gathering mainstream acceptability and may be more attainable for mainstream investors shortly. Notable crypto analyst “degengambleh” pointed out similarities in pricing behavior and foresaw a very bullish upside target of $0.1774, more than 10 times the spot level. Meanwhile, trader Ali Martinez pointed out that a close above the resistance level of $0.015 to $0.017 per coin might ignite a very strong breakout and drive PENGU still further in the short term.

The project has been able to raise a total of $465,670 via its ongoing presale, and there isn't much time left before the next pricing level is activated, showing strong early investor demand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a bold move similar to Strategy's $BTC playbook, DeFi Development (formerly Janover) announced a $100M convertible note offering yesterday to fund large-scale purchases of $SOL. Such a move could significantly boost investor appetite for $SOL. It may also act as a powerful catalyst for top Solana-based altcoins. But the asset of choice isn't $BTC this time around, it's $SOL. Known as the ‘Ethereum killer,' Solana remains popular among retail and DeFi users. However, it has so far lacked strong institutional backing compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin. Within thirty minutes of announcing its plans to accumulate more $SOL on X, DeFi Development's stock price dropped by 9% in after-hours trading. This sharp decline reveals skepticism among investors who might be wary of $SOL's recent market volatility. That said, large institutional buy-ins, such as DeFi Development's, could be precisely what $SOL needs to find its footing. If DeFi Development's plan pans out, it doesn't just suggest a rosy future for $SOL but also Solana-based coins like Snorter Token ($SNORT), Grass ($GRASS), and BIO Token ($BIO). Reason being is that it could drive liquidity, visibility, and developer activity across the entire network. Snorter Token ($SNORT) is more than just another meme coin; it powers Snorter Bot, an advanced Telegram-based trading assistant launching on Solana in Q3 2025. Built for speed and precision, Snorter Bot sniffs out the best Solana meme coins, manage your crypto portfolio, and automates strategies seamlessly on a unified Telegram interface. Boasting the highest speeds and lowest fees at 0.85% on Solana, it's built to outperform competitors like Maestro, Trojan, Banana Gun, and Bonk Bot. Moreover, it's backed by MEV-protection and 85% accurate rug-pull detection, so you can rest easy knowing that your trades are safeguarded against frontrunning and scams. It's also getting set to launch across major EVM-compatible chains, as part of its plan to become a multi-chain trading powerhouse. In a nutshell, it leverages a network of over 3M users who run nodes to collect vast amounts of public web data for AI models. It challenges the current landscape, where only a few large companies, such as Google (with Googlebot) and Microsoft (with Bingbot), control extensive web crawling capabilities. You can contribute by downloading and running the Grass application to share your unused internet bandwidth. In return, you'll earn ‘Grass Points,' which track your contributions. These points will then be converted into $GRASS, typically through airdrops. You can also boost your earnings by referring new users to the platform, partaking in community activities, and maintaining consistent uptime for your node. Get involved by purchasing $GRASS for approximately $1.13 on some of the best crypto exchanges, including MEXC and Bybit. As a result, it offers you broad access to the fast-growing decentralized science (DeSci) movement. Following the news of DeFi Development's $SOL acquisition, its native token, $BIO, is up by roughly 10%. Fueling its popularity is BioDAO, a community-governed initiative that funds early-stage biotech and scientific innovations. When a project is successful, it may generate valuable intellectual property (IP) or products. By doing so, it aims to challenge traditional, centralized models of scientific funding, which are dominated by governments, universities, and large corporations. It'll also make science more transparent, efficient, and globally inclusive, unlocking innovation at scale that traditional systems often stifle. Join the movement by purchasing $BIO on top exchanges like Binance and OKX for roughly $0.05196. With DeFi Development pledging $100M toward $SOL purchases, the so-called Ethereum Killer may finally get the institutional attention that it has long been denied. If that plays out, the biggest beneficiaries might not just be $SOL but also coins that leverage the Solana network, such as $SNORT, $GRASS, and $BIO.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Notabene Transact is a secure real-time transaction authorisation solution designed for regulated entities managing complex digital asset flows. Specifically tailored for cryptocurrency transactions, Notabene Transact handles multi-party transactions, allowing institutions to scale in a compliant manner and accelerate their operations. Clear regulatory guidelines are expected to drive institutional adoption; however, the increasing complexity of transactions necessitates robust compliance measures. Institutions will require a powerful authorisation infrastructure to facilitate simplified real-time transactions. Many existing tools fall short in managing today's digital asset flows. Notabene Transact addresses this gap by focusing on practical applications, streamlining multi-party transactions, and automating compliance across various jurisdictions, thereby enabling scalable and compliant real-time transactions. One key feature of Notabene Transact is its integration of two capabilities: a discovery and verification system that identifies all counterparties within a transaction flow, and a customisable policy engine that automates decisions following an institution's risk appetite, regulatory responsibilities, and established business relationships. This trust-based system facilitates quicker approvals, reduces friction, and increases transaction throughput, thereby promoting growth across international borders. The Transaction Authorisation Protocol (TAP) is an open-source, decentralised messaging system that, unlike traditional systems such as SWIFT, enables secure, policy-based data exchange across any blockchain or protocol without restricting institutions to closed infrastructures. TAP features an end-to-end encrypted data model, avoids central control, and ensures interoperability within varying regulatory environments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen has argued that an ‘altcoin season‘ has failed to materialize due to monetary policy, liquidity and stubborn Bitcoin BTC/USD dominance. According to Cowen, a sharp drop in Bitcoin BTC/USD dominance and a relative surge in altcoin performance — the conditions that typically fuel altcoin rallies in coins like Ethereum ETH/USD, XRP CRYPTO: XRP), and Solana SOL/USD — aren't present. Reviewing historical trends, Cowen noted that true altseasons in 2017 and late 2020 to early 2021 followed clear collapses in Bitcoin dominance, allowing altcoins to outperform BTC on a relative basis. Cowen highlighted that before the last two major alt runs, altcoin-to-Bitcoin valuations dropped to roughly 25% of BTC's market cap. “We're nowhere near those levels now,” he explained, suggesting that a reset to those lows might be necessary to "rip the band-aid off" and set the stage for a true altcoin cycle. Also Read: Bitcoin's ‘Perfect Storm' Could Extend Bull Run Into 2026: Report Why It Matters: Cowen pointed to broader macroeconomic headwinds as the key suppressors of altcoin momentum. "We're still in a period of quantitative tightening, and the Fed is holding off on rate cuts," he explained. "Jerome Powell even acknowledged they're concerned about inflation risk from tariffs, which keeps the door shut on easing." Historically, major altcoin rallies have aligned with aggressive rate cuts and liquidity injections, monetary easing that allowed speculative assets to flourish. What's Next: According to Cowen, the setup for altcoins could improve only after a meaningful shift in U.S. monetary policy, especially if the Federal Reserve pivots to rate cuts or renewed liquidity support. Until then, Cowen advises caution: "You probably would have outperformed most of the altcoin market by simply staying Bitcoin-heavy this year."

Riyadh, Jul 2 (SPA/APP): The International Camel Organization (ICO) participated in the closing ceremony of the International Year of Camelids (IYC), organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) at its headquarters in Rome.
The global event marked the culmination of a year dedicated to highlighting the importance of camelids in enhancing food security, economic development, cultural heritage, and climate resilience across more than 90 countries.
As a full member of the International Year of Camelids' Steering Committee, the ICO has played an active role throughout the year by supporting awareness in the camel sector.
ICO Founder and Chairman Fahd bin Falah bin Hathleen stated: “Our involvement in the International Year of Camelids has been rooted in our mission to elevate the camel sector on the global stage. Camels are considered a symbol of cultural identity and supporters of rural communities' sustainability and livelihoods. We remain committed to supporting their role across all scientific, cultural, sport, economic, and welfare sectors.”
ICO Secretary General Abdulrahman Alieedan added: “The closing ceremony was an opportunity to reflect on a year of achievements and to look ahead. We are dedicated to ensuring that the momentum built during the IYC continues through international cooperation, knowledge exchange, and strategic partnerships to strengthen camel-based economies and communities.”

While the two appear similar, China's digital currency is quite different from the cryptocurrencies many economies are rushing to regulate

When South Korea reportedly halted its digital currency pilot programme this week in favour of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a reference asset, typically a fiat currency – it sent shock waves through central banks across the world.

At first glance, stablecoins appear to have similar qualities to the digital yuan or other digital currencies, but there are significant differences in their design, purpose and management.

First piloted in 2020, it had been used in 26 cities for transactions worth a total of 7 trillion yuan (US$977 billion) by June last year.

The digital yuan is largely intended for small domestic retail payments, and it cannot be exchanged for foreign currencies. Its cross-border use is being developed through the mBridge project, coordinated by the multinational Bank for International Settlements.

Unlike the digital yuan, which is entirely under the umbrella of a central bank, stablecoins are blockchain-based and privately issued cryptocurrency tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the United States or Hong Kong dollars. Issuers hold reserve assets, such as US Treasury bills, to back the total value of the tokens at a ratio of one to one.</p>

Correspondent clearing allows Prometheum Capital to provide clearing, custody, execution, and recordkeeping services on behalf of other broker-dealers, enabling their clients to access and transact in on-chain securities. Correspondent clearing is a critical gateway for broader market participation with these assets, supporting the modernization of U.S. capital markets and accelerating institutional and retail access to on-chain securities. “Financial markets are evolving from electronic to digital, blockchain-enabled infrastructure, facilitating the migration of the $130 trillion securities industry on-chain,” said Aaron Kaplan, founder and co-CEO of Prometheum. Prometheum Capital is excited to support the broker-dealer community's growth by offering a pathway into digital markets.” This development expands Prometheum's role as a leading on-chain securities infrastructure provider, allowing broker-dealers—who currently cannot custody or directly transact in on-chain securities—to access these products and expand their offerings into digital assets. LCH CDSClear also expanded its client clearing services to the US in 2024. The bank's Treasury division can access a vast liquidity pool and benefit from netting efficiencies. Clients will make significant capital savings through the exchange's clearing partnership with LCH Limited. This decision recognizes the critical role of central clearing in promoting financial stability.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We use cookies to improve your experience. This has led analysts to speculate that PENGU could be on the verge of a rally similar to what happened with Pepe (PEPE). This represented an appreciation of 8.58% over the past day alone. At the same time, the total crypto market capitalization has dipped 3.18%, highlighting PENGU's strength in a market otherwise in decline. Several factors could be contributing to PENGU's performance. First, the NFT market is showing strong growth overall. According to Artemis data, NFT has been the top-performing sector over the last week, with a 33.8% uptick. Additionally, interest in Pudgy Penguins is notably high. Meanwhile, institutional interest in the meme coin is also growing. Last week, Cboe BZX filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC to list and trade shares of Canary Capital's proposed PENGU ETF. “With this filing, the PENGU and Pudgy Penguins NFTs ETF becomes only the second meme coin-style ETF, after DOGE, and first filing with NFTs to enter the SEC's formal review process, joining coins such as BTC, SOL, XRP, and DOGE,” an analyst wrote. Additionally, PENGU's availability on RevolutApp has significantly increased its accessibility. The mascot's appearance at NASDAQ alongside VanEck, a major asset management firm, has also amplified its visibility. Furthermore, the team is preparing to launch a mobile game, Pudgy Party, which could again draw substantial interest. Don't be surprised when it tops the App Store,” a product designer, Steve, stated. This increased attention has translated into actual accumulation. On-chain data from Nansen indicated significant whale activity. This is a bullish signal that suggests large investors anticipate further gains. Amid these catalysts and strong price growth, analysts are drawing parallels to the explosive rally of PEPE, another meme coin that experienced a dramatic surge in 2024. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) highlight optimism, with some market watchers suggesting PENGU's viral potential could mirror PEPE's trajectory. “Many aren't ready for what PENGU is about to pull. The similarities with PEPE chart is uncanny. The stars have never been so aligned,” an analyst posted. Another analyst highlighted that the conditions for a short squeeze on PENGU are aligning. “Chart looks amazing & funding flipping super negative. Thus, while the current conditions appear favorable, whether PENGU can sustain its upward trend or replicate PEPE's success remains to be seen.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ethereum Community Foundation will champion projects enforcing ETH burning mechanisms to support network's economic integrity without new token issuance. Ethereum developer Zak Cole is spearheading a new initiative called the Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF), which will primarily work to enhance the digital asset's economic value. Founded by Cole and a group of ecosystem supporters, the ECF has reportedly already raised “millions” and intends to allocate its treasury to projects that enforce immutability, avoid issuing new tokens, and implement mechanisms to burn Ethereum (ETH). These requirements align with the foundation's mission to reduce circulating ETH supply and strengthen the network's monetary policy. The ECF's initial initiative, known as the Ethereum Validator Association (EVA), will give validators greater influence in protocol development by enabling them to signal preferences using their staked ETH. The EVA will also invest in validator infrastructure to improve decentralization and network security. Beyond validator initiatives, the ECF aims to fund real-world asset integrations that bring traditional financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and real estate onto Ethereum's blockchain. The foundation views these integrations as critical to institutional adoption, which it sees as a key driver of long-term network value. Additionally, the ECF will prioritize funding for public goods that address technical challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem, including adjustments to mispriced blob space used in data availability layers. Funding decisions will be governed by coin voting, allowing the broader Ethereum community to participate in determining grant allocations. The ECF has emphasized that all funding decisions, treasury movements, and project milestones will remain publicly transparent to ensure accountability and alignment with the community's goals. The ECF's mandate extends to engaging with governments, regulators, and policymakers to promote Ethereum as a trusted institutional infrastructure layer. While specific backers of the foundation have not been publicly disclosed, further announcements regarding its supporters and upcoming funding rounds are expected in the coming weeks. By focusing on projects that reinforce ETH's economic integrity without introducing new tokens, the ECF is positioning itself as an alternative funding avenue within the ecosystem. It aims to complement but also differentiate from the Ethereum Foundation's current priorities. Specializing in financial journalism, he now focuses on crypto reporting.
