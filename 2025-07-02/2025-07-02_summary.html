Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) released on July 1 video footage showing domestically produced drones striking multiple Russian air defense assets and a fighter jet in occupied Crimea in what it described as a successful special operation.

The undated footage shows the combat use of UJ-26 drones, commonly known as Bober (Beavers), targeting high-value Russian military systems.

"These reliable weapons in the hands of HUR special forces are turning critically important Russian targets into useless scrap," the agency said in a statement. 

HUR added that the Bober drones are effectively "gnawing through" Russia's expensive air defense systems "like barberries."

The released footage shows that the strikes destroyed or severely damaged several Russian military assets, including a Pantsir-S1 air defense system and its crew, a Niobium-SV radar, a Pechora-3 coastal radar, a Protivnik-GE radar, and a Su-30 fighter jet stationed at the Saky airfield in occupied Crimea. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify HUR's claims.

The strikes are part of Ukraine's ongoing efforts to degrade Russian military capabilities in Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Moscow reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the peninsula earlier on July 1, with the Crimean Wind Telegram channel reporting attacks in the vicinity of S-300/S-400 air defense systems.

Ukraine has increasingly deployed new drone systems to target Russian military assets on the front line and deep inside the Russian rear.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry has summoned the Ukrainian charge d'affaires to protest "inappropriate remarks" by Kyiv regarding recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran, the ministry said on July 1.

Tehran threatened Ukraine with unspecified "consequences" should such statements be repeated.

The diplomatic spat follows a wave of Israeli and U.S. air strikes targeting Iran's nuclear program, with Iranian forces attacking Israel and a U.S. base in Qatar in response.

Highlighting Iran's military support for Russian aggression against Ukraine, Kyiv responded by calling for the dismantling of the Iranian nuclear program to prevent it from threatening the Middle East or the wider world.

In response, Shahram Farsaei, head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Eurasian affairs department, relayed a protest note to Ukraine via the Ukrainian envoy in Iran, Kyrylo Pozdniakov. The ministry did not specify what exact comments prompted the reaction from the Iranian side.

Tehran also said that Ukrainian officials have "disregarded Ukraine's international legal obligations concerning respect for the principles and purposes of the U.N. Charter as well as the four Geneva Conventions."

Iran has provided ballistic missiles and thousands of Shahed drones to Russia, directly backing its armed aggression in Ukraine, itself launched in violation of international law and the U.N. Charter.

Moscow has backed Iran diplomatically after U.S. and Israeli attacks, urging a response from the U.N. Security Council and calling the attacks an "unprovoked aggression."

Marwan al-Sultan, a renowned cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital, is the 70th healthcare worker to be killed by Israeli attacks in the past 50 days, says Palestinian medical organisation

An Israeli airstrike has killed one of Gaza's most senior doctors in a “catastrophic” loss to the already decimated healthcare system. A number of family members were reported to have been killed alongside him.

Dr Marwan al-Sultan, a renowned and highly experienced cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital in the Gaza Strip, is the 70th healthcare worker to be killed by Israeli attacks in the last 50 days, according to Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), a Palestinian medical organisation.

“The killing of Dr Marwan al-Sultan by the Israeli military is a catastrophic loss to Gaza and the entire medical community, and will have a devastating impact on Gaza's healthcare system,” said Muath Alser, director of HWW.

“This is part of a much longer and systematic atrocious targeting of healthcare workers sanctioned by impunity. This is a tragic loss of life, but also an obliteration of their decades of lifesaving medical expertise and care at a time when the situation facing Palestinian civilians is unfathomably catastrophic,” Alser added.

“We are in great shock and grief. He cannot be replaced,” said Dr Mohammed Abu Selmia, director of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. “He was a prominent scholar and one of the two remaining cardiologists left in Gaza. Thousands of heart patients will suffer as a result of his killing. His only fault was that he was a doctor. We have no option but to be steadfast, but the sense of loss is devastating.”

Earlier this month, al-Sultan spoke to the Guardian about the critical situation he and other staff at the Indonesian hospital were facing as they struggled to cope with the number of civilian casualties after the escalation of Israeli attacks in May.

Among the healthcare workers killed in the past 50 days were three other doctors, the chief nurses of the Indonesian hospital and al-Nasser children's hospital, one of Gaza's most senior midwives, a senior radiology technician and dozens of young medical graduates and trainee nurses. On 6 June, the first day of Eid, nine healthcare workers were killed in one day in airstrikes in the north of Gaza, where they were sheltering with their families, according to HWW.

Fares Afana, who leads ambulance services in northern Gaza, lost his son in June. Bara'a, who was also working as a paramedic, was at an apartment block in Gaza City's al-Tuffah neighbourhood on 9 June treating people injured in an Israeli airstrike when the building was hit for a second time by Israeli artillery, killing everyone inside.

“They were directly targeted,” said Afana, who says that Bara'a died alongside two other paramedics. “When I went to the place, it was a horrible sight and cruel to see their bodies torn to pieces. If there had been some reaction from the world when healthcare workers were first targeted by the Israeli forces, they would have not dared to commit more of these attacks.”

He said his son had dedicated his life to the medical profession and had dreams of being a doctor. “He was kind and loved by everyone who knew him.”

The total number of healthcare workers who have lost their lives in military attacks since the war began in October 2023 now exceeds 1,400 according to UN figures.

Insecurity Insight, a conflict data NGO, says it has verified the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers who have been killed inside health facilities, while attempting to reach wounded civilians, by Israeli sniper fire, when travelling in ambulances, while evacuating patients, at checkpoints and inside schools and refugee camps used as temporary shelters since October 2023.

It is believed that hundreds more healthcare workers from Gaza remain in Israeli detention, where they have reported being tortured, beaten and held without charge.

Medglobal, a medical NGO based in the US that provides medical services and care in Gaza, says it believes more than 300 medical staff are in Israeli prisons, among them senior physicians including Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan hospital who has been held in detention since December 2024.

Program mirrors earlier successful mission to fight new world screwworm fly, whose larvae can infest living tissue

The US government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.

That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the US from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.

“It's an exceptionally good technology,” said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. “It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.”

The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the new world screwworm fly. The US Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies – sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and, over time, the fly population dies out.

It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the US and other countries north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.

The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.

Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the new world screwworm fly and its old world counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers – and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.

“A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,” said Michael Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.

Veterinarians have effective treatments for animals suffering from an infestation, but it can still be unpleasant – and also cripple an animal with pain.

Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infested cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.

“It smelled nasty,” he said. “Like rotting meat.”

The new world screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive midwestern or great plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the US and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.

The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.

One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: females mate only once in their weeks-long adult lives.

Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the US temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.

But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.

Decades ago, the US had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.

The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million flies a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5m on the Texas site and $21m to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.

In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.

But, she added, “You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.”

Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.

In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and on to the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing resembling a dark brown Tic Tac candy. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.

Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's extension service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.

Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.

In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a “whiz packer”.

The method is still much the same: light planes drop crates containing flies.

Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's “crowning achievements”.

Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.

“Something we think we have complete control over – and we have declared a triumph and victory over – can always rear its ugly head again,” Burgess said.

The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031.

One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.

It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.

In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump's first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.

In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.

By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan's suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.

But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn't follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.

These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.

At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA's budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.

Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it's “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”

“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration's historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”

In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.

“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.

That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)

Scientists and advocates also said it's unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.

“I don't understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don't understand it.”

Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”

The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA's Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.

Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump's first term. Zeldin's EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.

The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation's playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.

Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.

The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”

The EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.

When Biden's EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.

Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.

When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.

In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don't benefit public health.”

The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.

“It's just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.

Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.

A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)

Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”

PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.

Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they're held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they're angry.

“I feel like we're walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”

“It's one thing to say you're going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It's another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”

The EPA of Trump's first term didn't just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.

In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina's investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”

Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.

At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.

Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year's growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.

In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

The contrast between the agency's words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State's Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.

“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we're doing is we're undermining our ability to translate the science that we're developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”

At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.

About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”

Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”

Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don't know how much longer we will be operating as is.”

The EPA told ProPublica that it's “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan's administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump's first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.

The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.

“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”

The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA's workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.

“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency's ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”

“News media owners are much better off standing strong than acquiescing,” said Reporters Without Borders USA.

The parent company of CBS News, Paramount Global, announced Tuesday that it has agreed to pay U.S. President Donald Trump $16 million to settle what legal experts called an entirely meritless lawsuit over the media organization's handling of a pre-election “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris.

Under the reported terms of the settlement, the money will go toward Trump's legal fees and his future presidential library. Paramount said the settlement deal does not include a formal apology, but the company agreed to release written transcripts of future “60 Minutes” interviews with presidential candidates.

Critics responded with outrage to news of the settlement, which one observer characterized as “spineless capitulation to extortion.” Some posted screenshots to social media showing they canceled their Paramount+ subscriptions in response.

As Paramount engaged in talks with Trump's legal team over the lawsuit in recent weeks, press freedom advocates and members of Congress implored the organization not to settle, warning that caving to the president would reward and embolden his attacks on media outlets he views as his political enemies.

“If you settle cases, you're going to send a message to your news team to not push the envelope for fear of people being sued,” media attorney Edward Klaris told The Washington Post, “and you're going to court more cases against your company because they might think that if they sue you they're going to collect.”

Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, supported a settlement with Trump in the hope that it would “clear the way” for federal approval of the company's merger with the entertainment company Skydance, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the internal discussions. Bloomberg reported that Redstone could reap $180 million in “severance and other benefits on top of hundreds of millions from the sale of her stock” if the merger goes through.

In May, the Freedom of the Press Foundation — a Paramount shareholder — cautioned that a settlement with Trump “could amount to a bribe” to the Trump administration in exchange for approval of the merger. The advocacy group said it would sue Paramount if the company caved to the president, arguing that “a settlement of Trump's meritless lawsuit may well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system.”

Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) similarly warned Paramount that a settlement with Trump could run afoul of federal anti-bribery laws.

“Paramount appears to be attempting to appease the administration in order to secure merger approval,” the senators wrote in a May 19 letter to Redstone.

Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders USA, said in a statement Wednesday that the settlement was “a shameful decision by Paramount.”

“Shari Redstone and Paramount's board should have stood by CBS journalists and the integrity of press freedom,” said Weimers. “Instead, they chose to reward Donald Trump for his petty legal assault against both. A line is being drawn between the owners of American news media who are willing to stand up for press freedom and those who capitulate to the demands of the president.”

“Paramount's leaders chose to be on the wrong side of that dividing line, but they'd be mistaken to believe appeasing Trump today will stop his attacks in the future,” Weimers added. “News media owners are much better off standing strong than acquiescing.”

Former staff likened offices of video game company in Paris to a ‘boys' club above the law'

Three former executives at the video game company Ubisoft have been given suspended prison sentences for enabling a culture of sexual and psychological harassment in the workplace at the end of the first big trial to stem from the #MeToo movement in the gaming industry.

The court in Bobigny, north of Paris, had heard how the former executives used their position to bully or sexually harass staff, leaving women terrified and feeling like pieces of meat.

Former staff had said that between 2012 and 2020, the company's offices in Montreuil, east of Paris, were run with a toxic culture of bullying and sexism that one worker likened to a “boys' club above the law”.

Ubisoft is a French family business that rose to become one of the biggest video game creators in the world. The company has been behind several blockbusters including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and the children's favourite Just Dance.

The state prosecutor, Antoine Haushalter, had told the court the world of video games and its subculture had an element of “systemic” sexism and potential abuse and called the trial a “turning point” for the gaming world.

Thomas François, 52, a former Ubisoft editorial vice-president, was found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment and an attempted sexual assault. He was given a three-year suspended prison sentence and fined €30,000 (£26,000).

The court heard how he once tied a female member of staff to a chair with tape, pushed the chair into a lift and pressed a button at random. He was also accused of forcing one woman wearing a skirt to do handstands.

She told the court: “He was my superior and I was afraid of him. He made me do handstands. I did it to get it over with and get rid of him.”

At a 2015 office Christmas party with a Back to the Future theme, François allegedly told a member of staff that he liked her 1950s dress. He then allegedly stepped towards her to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her by the arms and back. She shouted and broke free.

François had told the court there was a “culture of joking around”. He said: “I never tried to harm anyone.”

Serge Hascoët, 59, Ubisoft's former chief creative officer and second-in-command, was found guilty of psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment.

He was acquitted of sexual harassment and complicity in psychological harassment. He was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a fine of €45,000.

The court heard he once handed a young female member of staff a tissue in which he had blown his nose, saying: “You can resell it, it's worth gold at Ubisoft.” The court heard that Hascoët bullied assistants by making them carry out personal tasks for him such as going to his home to wait for parcel deliveries.

Hascoët had told the court he was unaware of any harassment, saying: “I have never wanted to harass anyone and I don't think I have.”

Hascoët's lawyer, Jean-Guillaume Le Mintier, said his client was considering an appeal.

The former Ubisoft game director, Guillaume Patrux, 41, was found guilty of psychological harassment and given a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €10,000.

The court heard he had punched walls, mimed hitting staff, cracked a whip near colleagues' faces, threatened to carry out an office shooting and played with a cigarette lighter near workers' faces, setting alight a man's beard. He had denied the charges.

Russia's full-scale invasion may have turned Ukraine into the world's largest minefield.

As of March 2025, Ukraine's mine-affected land spans an estimated 139,000 square kilometers — or 23% of its territory — covering more ground than all of Greece and posing an immense threat to civilian life and recovery efforts.

Clearing landmines and unexploded ordnance is essential to preventing civilian casualties and enabling the safe use of land and infrastructure, fostering the country's recovery and future development.

Demining in Ukraine is primarily carried out by the State Emergency Service and the Armed Forces, with both international and domestic non-governmental organizations contributing to the effort.

The world's largest demining non-governmental organization, the HALO Trust, has operated in Ukraine since 2015 and scaled up its efforts after the full-scale invasion began.

The HALO Trust has cleared nearly 7.9 million square meters of land and located over 41,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance since Feb. 24, 2022.

The organization has grown from a small team of 400 in Kramatorsk, a front-line city in Donetsk Oblast, to a workforce of 1,500 people operating in eight regions across Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent spoke with James Cowan, the CEO of HALO Trust, about the organization's ongoing effort to rid Ukraine of landmines, his assessment of how long it might take, and what new technology could revolutionize the process.

Editor's note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe the scale of landmine contamination in Ukraine today, and how does it compare to other conflict zones you've worked in?

James Cowan: The HALO Trust has existed since 1988. We are the world's largest NGO that clears landmines, so we know about other areas of the world.

This is the biggest landmine challenge since World War II.

Unless it's done quickly, it's going to take hundreds of years.

The nearest example is the minefield between North and South Korea — it's 178 kilometers long. Ukraine's front line is 1,000 kilometers long, and that is not the only contamination.

There are landmines well inside free Ukraine and landmines well inside Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent: Can you describe how your team operates in Ukraine — which regions you're active in, and what the process looks like from detection to removal when a mine or unexploded ordnance is found?

James Cowan: There are three units: one in the north, one in the northeast, and one in the south. We want to expand further, and when it is possible, we would be happy to help Ukraine clear even more parts of the country.

We have survey teams that confirm the contamination and are also trying to shrink the area to the absolute minimum. We then bring in our teams to conduct the clearance.

This is an area where there could be improvement. We work in countries like Afghanistan, which is mountainous; in countries like Cambodia, which is jungle; and in countries like Angola, which is African bush. In those places, mechanical methods are not easy to use. But in Ukraine, there are open fields — some of the best agricultural land in the world. They are the most suitable and optimized environment for mechanical clearance.

We have mechanical diggers, but we're not allowed to deploy them because authorization is very slow. We would ask the Ukrainian government to speed that up because currently, it is very bureaucratic and takes too long. We need to be able to use all the assets available.

Ukraine does not want to be like Afghanistan, where HALO has worked since 1988 and is still working.

The Kyiv Independent: Why is it so difficult to speed up the process?

James Cowan: Every country has its own bureaucracy. Sometimes, government officials aren't as entrepreneurial as those in the private sector. But it would be good to see more speed. This is not a conscious decision but more a bureaucratic inertia.

But Ukraine needs to act because its land is covered in landmines. Without action, Ukraine can't export its grain, open its roads, or bring its population back. Unless it's done quickly, it's going to take hundreds of years.

The Kyiv Independent: Given the ongoing ceasefire negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, do you think demining should also be part of the talks?

James Cowan: If a ceasefire happens, that is the inflection point. It is the point at which everyone's efforts move from a war to a defensive posture, in which, of course, Ukraine's army will continue to protect the sovereignty of their country. Still, the civilian effort will move toward reconstruction and away from the fighting.

At that moment, Ukraine's priority will be to restart its economy, get all that land that hasn't been farmed for three or four years back into use, and allow communities to return to their homes. And it's not just about large-scale farming — it's also about local, small-scale agriculture. Some people haven't been able to grow vegetables, raise goats or sheep, or use their cows and donkeys. They need access to their land again.

It's also about reopening roads, schools, shops, and factories. All these things need to be cleared (from mines), and the whole economy needs to be helped to get up and going.

There is a lot of emphasis on the mineral deal, but you can't mine for minerals without demining for landmines.

The Kyiv Independent: If the war were to end tomorrow, would it be realistic to fully clear all mines in Ukraine within the next 10 years?

James Cowan: If the war were to stop tomorrow along the current front line, it wouldn't be possible to clear landmines on the Russian-occupied side, despite it being sovereign Ukrainian territory, unless Russia allows it.


Combining artificial intelligence with imagery is a key development.
    

Regarding territory under Ukrainian control, whether all landmines can be cleared within 10 years remains open — but I believe it's possible. If Ukraine applies the same level of innovation and energy to mechanizing demining as it has to advancing drone technology, then yes, I think it's achievable. That said, it's still too early to be certain.

The Kyiv Independent: How do you assess Ukraine's National Mine Action Strategy (approved in June 2024)? In your view, how realistic and effective is it given the current scale of contamination? Has HALO Trust been involved in shaping or advising on the strategy?

James Cowan: I've worked alongside Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko. The strategy she's built is a good one.

But all strategies need to evolve; they're not just documents on a dusty shelf, and this one will. I'd particularly like to see the adoption of mechanical clearance.

The Kyiv Independent: What emerging technologies do you see as having the greatest potential to transform demining efforts in Ukraine?

James Cowan: Combining artificial intelligence with imagery is a key development. In terms of detection, there are several exciting technologies, such as synthetic aperture radar, ground-penetrating radar, and magnetic resonance — especially the magnetic resonance methods developed in Australia for detecting rare earth elements like gold, which can also be applied to finding landmines.

There are also cutting-edge nuclear industry technologies, like the neutron-associated particle imaging (NAPI), which could be game-changing. The problem is that these technologies are very good at finding mines, but also find mines that aren't there. This means they produce false alarms, which slows the process. So, the technology needs to become better at only detecting real landmines, not fake ones.

The Kyiv Independent: As the CEO of a leading humanitarian organization, you chose not to publicly condemn the U.S. decision to provide Ukraine with anti-personnel mines in 2024. Could you explain why? Has your position on this changed since then?

James Cowan: Ukraine's fundamental right to self-defense is something everyone should respect. Your country is fighting for its very existence. Who am I to question your right to exist? I wasn't willing to condemn you for that.

Yes, my organization's mission is to clear landmines, but I'm not here to judge who is right or wrong. My role is simply to clear the landmines.

Hi! Daria Shulzhenko here. I wrote this piece for you. Since the first day of Russia's all-out war, I have been working almost non-stop to tell the stories of those affected by Russia's brutal aggression.

Special soil spray is used to increase amount of water grass can absorb to prevent courts from drying out 

A special chemical is being used at Wimbledon to make “water wetter” to try to reduce water bills and tackle rising temperatures.

As the championship welcomed rain on Wednesday after opening with scorching temperatures, Neil Stubley, Wimbledon's head of courts and horticulture, said the tournament uses a soil spray to adjust the amount of water a plant root system can absorb.

Stubley said: “It sounds a weird term but it makes water wetter. The surface tension of a water molecule, a plant root system, at a certain point, can't penetrate it as the moisture gets smaller, because the surface tension is more. We can adjust that so that actually a plant root can tap into that water.”

On Wednesday, tennis fans poured into Wimbledon under light rain after the hottest start to the championship on record as temperatures soared to 32C on Monday and 34.2C on Tuesday.

The high temperatures meant extra water was needed to avoid the rapid drying of courts, which could lead to cracks. But with cooler temperatures expected to come, Stubley anticipates a “routine championship” will follow.

Stubley and the team of 20 full-time grounds staff, who have 250 championships' worth of experience between them, are used to being reactive and adaptive to Britain's temperamental weather.

To maintain the delicate balance between the whims of mother nature and conditions required for elite tennis, data is collected each day, including considerations of the ball's rebound, soil firmness and moisture content, to determine how the courts are managed in the evening. By morning, mowers are set and the grass is tailored to a precise 8mm.

While irrigation is the key to controlling how the surface is played, it is just one of many considerations Stubley and his team take into account. In addition to water conservation, they have also looked toward more “drought tolerant” plants.

Stubley said: “We actually made a conscious effort that the hydrangeas – and those types of flowers we've used historically here that actually do need a lot of water to survive – if you look at the grounds over the last 10 to 15 years, although they're still in areas, there's a lot less of them.

“We're now selecting grasses that are more wear-tolerant, more drought-tolerant grasses that we can use in the UK that have been used elsewhere.”

Compared with other sports, namely those using winter or full pitches, the amount of water used throughout the summer championship will be less, he said.

“It's a living surface, the environment will always have an impact on how it plays,” said Stubley. “It's just being reactive and making sure you adapt.”

The detention center visit seemed to represent a landmark in a defining issue since even before his first term: migration

Donald Trump's tour of the bloodcurdlingly-monikered – and hastily-constructed – “Alligator Alcatraz” migrants detention center in Florida's Everglades had the hallmarks of a calculatedly provocative celebration of the dystopian.

Accompanied by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, the Florida governor Ron DeSantis and a phalanx of journalists, the US president saw only virtue in the vista of mesh fencing, barbed wire and forbidding steel bunk beds.

“Between Kristi and Ron, it's really government working together,” he said. “They have done an amazing job. I'm proud of them.”

Not that Trump was blind to the intimidating nature of the facility his long crusade against undocumented people had willed into existence in this hot, steamy part of southern Florida, prized by environmentalists as a crucial nature preserve but now redesigned to be a location of dread to those lacking documentary proof of their right to be in the US.

“Biden wanted me in here,” he said, snidely referring to his predecessor in the White House, who he accuses – without evidence – of orchestrating criminal prosecutions against him. “It didn't work out that way, but he wanted me in here, the son of a bitch.”

Tuesday's visit seemed to represent a new landmark in the administration's embrace of unabashedly authoritarian solutions to meet what has been Trump's defining issue since even before his first term: migration.

Recent weeks have seen several escalations as the White House and law enforcement agencies have sought to project an ever more draconian approach.

Deaths have been recorded of several detainees who had been taken into custody by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (Ice) officials.

Footage of masked officers without insignia arresting people in the streets has sent shockwaves through immigrant communities nationwide.

National guards troops and marines have been deployed against demonstrators protesting migrant roundups on the streets of Los Angeles, even as local authorities and California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, insisted they were not needed.

In what has seemed like performative acts of political intimidation, several Democrats have been arrested and handcuffed by Ice and FBI agents near detention facilities or immigration courts. Senator Alex Padilla of California was pinned to the ground and handcuffed after trying to ask a question of Noem at a press conference, even after identifying himself.

The administration's schtick was clear when Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador and self-proclaimed “world's coolest dictator”, was feted in the White House in April days after more than 200 Venezuelan alleged gang members were summarily deported from the US to the sprawling Cecot facility in El Salvador.

Shortly afterwards, Noem compounded the message by traveling to the center – said to have capacity for 40,000 prisoners – where she posed outside a cell into which large numbers shaven-headed detainees were herded.

All of the this has drawn howls of condemnation from critics as signaling red flags for the state of US democracy and constitutional guarantees.

Tuesday's event indicated the strength of the administration's contempt for such concerns. It was case of all-in on the Bukele approach, at least in imagery if not in scale.

Enough beds have been installed in two separate areas of the facility to house 5,000 prisoners.

Seized from its owners, Miami Dade county, by DeSantis using emergency powers as governor, the setting has drawn accusations of cruelty from immigrants rights organizations who point to the area's extreme heat and humidity and surrounding marshlands, which contains alligators, Burmese pythons and swarms of mosquitoes.

Trump seemed to revel in the potential for detainees' misery at what was termed a round-table discussion but which devolved into fawning praise of his leadership from administration and state officials and obsequious questions from journalists representing friendly rightwing news outlets.

“It might be as good as the real Alcatraz site,” he said. “That's a spooky one too, isn't it? That's a tough site.”

As if in confirmation that this was an event designed to showcase ruthlessness, Trump handed the floor to Stephen Miller, the powerful White House deputy chief of staff and widely-acknowledged mastermind of the anti-immigrant offensive, calling him “our superstar”.

after newsletter promotion

Miller responded with a pithy summation of the policy's raison d'être.

“What you've done over the last five months [is] to deliver on a 50-year hope and dream of the American people to secure the border,” he said. “There's a 2,000 mile border with one of the poorest countries in the world, and you have open travel from 150 countries into Central America and South America.

“There are 2 billion people in the world that would economically benefit from illegally coming to the United States. Through the deployment of the military, through … novel legal and diplomatic tools, through the building of physical infrastructure, through the empowering of Ice and border patrol and the entire federal law enforcement apparatus, President Trump achieved absolute border security.”

And there would be more to come – courtesy of funds secured for deportations in Trump's sweeping spending bill, which secured narrow Senate passage during Trump's visit to the facility.

“Once this legislation is passed, he will be able to make that, with those resources, permanent,” Miller said.

PBS reported that the bill envisions roughly $150bn being spent on the administration's deportation agenda over the next four years.

Taking the soft cop line, Noem on Tuesday told undocumented people that it didn't have to be this way; they could still, to use the administration's terminology, take the “self-deport” option by returning voluntarily to their home countries – where she said the governments were waiting with open arms.

“Anybody who sees these news clips should know you could still go home on your own, you can self-deport,” she said, adding that they could apply to return to the United States “the right way”.

A more telling attitude to accountability was displayed by Trump himself at the end of the media question and answer session when a Fox News reporter asked how long detainees could expect to spend at the Florida facility – days, weeks or months.

After clarifying the question, Trump seemed – or perhaps decided – to misunderstand it.

“This is my home state,” he said. “I love it … I'll spend a lot of time here. I'll be here as much as I can. Very nice question.”

Zhi Alan Cheng, 35, admits to filming assaults of patients and acquaintances in his apartment and workplace

A New York City doctor charged with raping or otherwise sexually abusing several hospital patients and acquaintances has pleaded guilty.

Zhi Alan Cheng, a gastroenterologist, acknowledged filming assaults in his apartment and the hospital where he had previously worked, New York-Presbyterian Queens, state prosecutors said in a statement on Monday after his guilty plea.

He is expected to receive a 24-year prison sentence from Queens supreme court justice Ushir Pandit Durant at a hearing tentatively set for 28 August.

“The level of violence and perversion displayed by Zhi Alan Cheng in sexually abusing multiple victims is compounded by the fact that he took an oath to do no harm as a medical professional,” said a statement attributed to local district attorney Melinda Katz.

The guilty plea resulted from one of several prosecutions of prominent physicians in New York and other parts of the US on allegations they violated patients in medical settings.

As prosecutors put it, authorities arrested Cheng on 27 December 2022 on allegations that he had raped a woman whom he knew at his apartment. That woman discovered videos depicting her and other women being assaulted by Cheng, and an attorney of the survivor approached Queens prosecutors with that information.

An ensuing investigation led to the seizure of numerous devices containing videos of Cheng sexually abusing unconscious women who were his patients or over at his apartment. Investigators also seized recreational drugs – fentanyl, ketamine, cocaine, LSD and MDMA – as well as powerful medical sedatives, including propofol and sevoflurane.

In August 2023, prosecutors obtained a 50-count criminal indictment charging Cheng, who had been held without bail since his arrest.

He faced additional charges in an indictment handed up against him in March 2024 after another hospital-related victim came forward.

Ultimately, Cheng, 35, pleaded guilty to four counts of rape and three counts of sexual abuse, all in the first degree. He also entered what is known as an Alford plea to one count of sexual abuse, which means he maintained his innocence on that charge but conceded overwhelming evidence against him would probably get him convicted at a trial.

Four of the survivors involved in the case against Cheng were described as hospital victims, prosecutors said. The rest, prosecutors said, were described as apartment victims.

“I thank the brave victim who initially came forward and exposed this abuse,” Katz remarked in her statement. “We hope the guilty plea allows all the victims to continue to heal.”

Authorities have said that the hospital which had employed Cheng cooperated in the case against the disgraced doctor.

“As caregivers, we are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of our patients. It is a sacred trust. The crimes committed by this individual are heinous, despicable, and a fundamental betrayal of our mission and the patients' trust. We are deeply sorry for all that the victims and their families have endured,” New York-Presbyterian hospital spokesperson Angela Karafazli said in a statement.

News of the charges against Cheng came about two weeks after former Manhattan obstetrician-gynecologist Robert Hadden had been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for sexually abusing numerous patients.

Back then, Cheng's attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he recognized “how serious the charges” against his client were.

Lichtman on Monday thanked prosecutors for his client's plea agreement and said: “The charges to which Mr Cheng has pleaded guilty today are extraordinarily serious.”

MOSCOW, July 2. /TASS/. As the European Union evolves into a military alliance a la NATO, Russia must stay vigilant and prepare itself to respond to this threat, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said.

In a broadcast by the Rossiya-24 TV channel, he noted that the European Union is morphing from a peaceful project into "something resembling a very aggressive military bloc." "This is being shaped not only by decisions to provide it with additional military capabilities to develop the military-industrial complex but also in terms of its entire philosophy," Grushko asserted.

"This is ideological, and that bothers us a lot because we would indeed have to deal with a new military organization which harbors aggressive intentions against Russia and develops its military strategy and organization accordingly, fosters military opportunities which directly create threats to us against which we have to defend. And we will do so," the senior Russian diplomat emphasized.

That said, Grushko expressed doubts that Brussels' plans would result in the emergence of an "independent NATO." "One must keep in mind that the US controls NATO and NATO controls the European Union. If you read all strategic documents passed jointly by NATO and the EU, <...> they postulate the European Union's subordinate role with regard to NATO. That is, NATO formulates the tasks, and the European Union carries them out," he continued. "So it is very hard to separate the European Union and NATO," Grushko concluded.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry told U.S. Charge d'Affaires John Ginkel that any delays in U.S. military aid would only prolong the war, the Foreign Ministry said on July 2 after the Pentagon reportedly paused some weapons shipments.

Ginkel met Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa at the request of Ukraine's chief diplomat, Andrii Sybiha. 

During the meeting, the Ukrainian side warned that "any delay or hesitation in supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities will only encourage Russia to continue war and terror, rather than pursue peace."

The meeting came amid reporting in the U.S. media that the U.S. Defense Department had paused some of the previously allocated shipments of weapons to Kyiv as part of a review. Among the withheld items are Patriot air defense missiles, precision artillery rounds, Hellfire missiles, and other munitions used by Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly later confirmed the move, saying that the decision "was made to put America's interests first following a (Defense Department) review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe."

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry did not explicitly confirm the pause in its statement. According to the ministry's readout, Betsa underscored Ukraine's gratitude for U.S. aid and stressed the critical importance of continued deliveries, namely air defenses.

Separately, parliamentary defense committee member Fedir Venislavskyi told RBK-Ukraine that Ukraine has not received an official confirmation of the suspension.

"Any restrictions on the supply of those resources that are very important to us are undoubtedly negative," Venislavskyi said, adding that Ukraine nevertheless has some "reserve capacities."

In the conversation with Ginkel, Betsa also stressed that Russia continues to reject a U.S.-proposed ceasefire that Kyiv agreed to during talks in Jeddah on March 11 and only intensifies its aerial attacks and ground offensives against Ukraine.

"Ukraine supports peace efforts and supports the U.S. calls for an immediate end to the killings and the war, stressing the need to compel Russia to seek peace," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

"Under these circumstances, strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities and ramping up coordinated transatlantic pressure on Russia are critically important."

The aid pause comes in a critical moment as Russia is ramping up its aerial strikes across Ukraine and intensifying offensive operations along the front line. In June, Russia launched a record 5,337 Shahed-type attack drones at Ukrainian targets, the highest monthly total since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The Trump administration has yet to approve any new major aid package for Ukraine and revealed plans to reduce military assistance in next year's budget. The pause comes despite U.S. President Donald Trump recently signaling support for further Patriot supplies to Kyiv.

According to Bloomberg, some European allies hope the Trump administration will soften or reverse the decision. 





The plant produces Tor and Osa air defense systems, as well as Harpy-type attack drones. 

Pornography production and distribution are illegal in Ukraine, with broad interpretations meaning even sharing nude photos can result in jail time.

If the Strait were mined, Iran could block one-fifth of global oil demand and spike world energy prices — a boon for Russia's oil-dependent economy. 

"When it comes to Ukraine, in the short term, Ukraine cannot do without all the support it can get," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said.

Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Oleksii Chernyshov will keep his position after a decision from the High Anti-Corruption Court on July 2. 

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg denied that he agreed to "work on" halting Ukraine's drone attacks on Russia, contradicting Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko's claim.

The Kyiv Independent's Chris York sat down with Michael McFaul, an academic and former U.S. ambassador to Russia (2012–2014), to discuss the state of the Ukraine-Russia peace process following U.S. President Donald Trump's failed effort, the threat of U.S. disengagement, and a congressional bill introducing new sanctions against Russia and its trading partners supporting its war machine.

The project remains a cornerstone of Russian-Turkish energy cooperation. 

The SBU said it had established that Metropolitan Onufrii, also known by his secular name, Orest Berezovskyi, voluntarily received Russian citizenship in 2002 and failed to inform Ukrainian authorities of the fact. 



According to the statement, a small Russian reconnaissance group managed to briefly enter the village of Dachne, located on the edge of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The group reportedly took photos with a Russian flag, but Ukrainian forces "eliminated them."

Lisa Lambert is the chief executive officer of Quantum Industry Canada.

The world is shifting beneath our feet. A new economic race is under way – beyond just jobs or growth. It's a race for the advanced technologies that will shape Canada's prosperity, resilience and security for decades to come. 

Quantum technologies harness the strange behaviour of nature at its smallest scales, unlocking a powerful new platform poised to transform industries and national security. Quantum computers, for example, use entirely different rules than today's machines, allowing them to solve certain problems – such as simulating molecules and optimizing complex systems – that are beyond the reach of even the most powerful conventional computers. Quantum has now become a defining front in that new economic race.

Canada's quantum sector is already making global waves. Across the country, researchers and companies are solving problems once thought to be decades away. A striking example: three Canadian firms – Xanadu Quantum Technologies Inc., Nord Quantique and Photonic – have each recently made world-first breakthroughs in quantum error correction, one of the hardest challenges to scaling quantum computing systems. Their work is drawing international attention: All three were selected by DARPA – the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), which was behind the internet and the Global Positioning System – for its elite Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. 

These breakthroughs represent just one part of Canada's broader quantum strengths. We're not just experimenting – we're building the frontier systems the world is racing to deploy.

Quantum technologies are no longer a lab curiosity. They're real, they're moving fast and they're becoming infrastructure – reshaping how we communicate, compute, sense and secure critical systems. Canada has what it takes to lead – but only if we act with urgency and intent.

BTQ Technologies CEO buys as Carney puts quantum computing in the G7 spotlight

Canadian quantum company Xanadu Technologies opens packaging facility

Prime Minister Mark Carney has set a clear ambition: to build the strongest economy in the Group of Seven countries. That won't happen with incrementalism. In June, he declared quantum a core focus of Canada's G7 agenda. Also last month, he announced accelerated defence investments, including Ottawa's new Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Innovation and Science for frontier technologies such as quantum, cyber and artificial intelligence. Inspired by the successes of DARPA, BOREALIS sends a clear message: Quantum is integral to Canada's economic and strategic future.

Canada was ahead of the curve. We were one of the first countries to recognize the quantum opportunity, making early strategic investments that positioned us as a global leader. Canada made the right foundational bets: funding research, growing a base of talent and building an emerging quantum industry that delivers a global impact that exceeds our scale. Today, we're known for it: Per capita, we have more quantum small- and medium-sized enterprises than any other country. 

But our early lead is under pressure. Canada's National Quantum Strategy, launched in 2021, is no longer globally competitive. Other countries are scaling fast, backed by strategic investment and national urgency. If we don't move now, we'll be locked out of systems, supply chains and decision-making tables being built without us – shutting us out of the very systems we helped make possible.

We've seen this pattern before. Canada led groundbreaking AI research, built aerospace clusters from scratch and developed world-class telecom networks. But too often we've stopped short of translating scientific leadership into lasting economic and strategic advantage. We have been strong in discovery, but slow on scale.

If we want to lead in quantum – and secure the greatest strategic advantage for Canada – we can't just innovate. We have to industrialize.

Commercialization brings technologies to market. Industrialization builds capacity: fabrication, integration, secure supply chains and deployment at scale. It's how we ensure that high-paying jobs, national prosperity and strategic control stay in Canada. Without it, we may be forced to rely on others for the very systems that underpin our economy and security.

Quantum is not niche; it's a nation-building project. And it requires more than research grants and trickles of startup capital. We need co-ordinated public-private investment, agile procurement and bold, milestone-based support that accelerates scale and sends a clear signal to global markets. Public investment won't replace private capital – it will crowd it in.

We also need those investments to protect what we've built. Some of our most strategic companies are being eyed by foreign investors. Others are looking south for faster scale. 

The opportunity is enormous. McKinsey & Co. estimates that quantum technologies could unlock upward of US$2-trillion by 2035. Canada's National Research Council projects it could contribute more than 3 per cent of our gross domestic product by 2045, rivalling aerospace in scale and strategic importance.

Quantum is not next; it's now. And every delay increases the chance we'll be left behind – for good.

As Prime Minister Carney has said, Canada must build bold, build big and build now. Industrializing quantum is exactly that kind of project. It will deliver economic resilience, national security and long-term strategic relevance for Canada.

We can help shape the future or depend on systems with Canadian roots that were ultimately built and owned by others.

The choice is ours. Let's make the right one.

            A village in Chicago's south suburbs is poised to purchase Pope Leo XIV's childhood home after its board voted unanimously on Tuesday to take control of the property.
    


            Since the pope's election, the small, two-story house on E. 142nd Place in Dolton, Illinois – around 20 miles south of the Windy City - has gained national attention, drawing visitors and attracting those interested in the leader's early life.
    


            Leo, known before as Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected in May as the first American pope – a decision that stunned many in the United States who celebrated his ascension as a historic moment. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson called Leo's election at the time as “one of the biggest moments in the modern history of our city.”
    


            Born in Chicago in 1955, Prevost earned his bachelor's in mathematics from Villanova and went on to receive his diploma in theology from the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago. He later spent decades as a missionary, including 20 years in Peru, where he is a naturalized citizen and served as a bishop.
    


A surreal moment as America celebrates its first pope — and wonders what his election means



            Members of the Dolton Village Board on Tuesday called the purchase of the pope's home a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” saying that gaining control over the house will allow the board to “do it justice.”
    


            “We can either seize this moment and move it forward, or we can let that moment go to an investor,” Dolton Mayor Jason House said at a board meeting Tuesday. The purchase will provide Dolton with the opportunity to re-evaluate enterprise and historic land zones and bring “state and congressional funds” into the town, House added.
    


            Other trustees at the Tuesday meeting joined the mayor in expressing support for the decision, with some citing the homes of Michael Jackson and Martin Luther King as examples of historic sites that have brought economic benefits for their communities.
    


            Officials, however, acknowledged the concerns and complaints of residents who say that traffic into the community has added further strain to already-dilapidated roads.
    


            “Purchasing the pope's house is admirable,” longtime Dolton resident Mary Avent told CNN affiliate WBBM, “but with the state we're in right now, I guess my concern is, do we have the money?”
    


            Avent told the outlet that Dolton currently lacks a police and fire chief, which she believes is more important.
    


            Trustee Edward Steave, at the Tuesday meeting, assured residents that their complaints were valid, but asserted “we can do this great thing at the same time.”
    


            The sale is likely to close within the next two weeks, the mayor said.
    


            Photos posted on the village's Facebook page late Tuesday show workers conducting repairs to the roof of the pope's house. It is unclear whether those repairs are being directed by the town.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Dolton Village Board for further information.

            Dozens of House Republicans are — for now — standing in the way of delivering President Donald Trump the first major legislative victory of his second term.
    


            For weeks, Trump and his team have promised Hill Republican leaders that he would deliver the headstrong GOP hardliners who are still vowing to defy the president on his agenda, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
    


            Now, it's all coming down to the wire. Trump and his team have spent much of the day in talks with the GOP holdouts on the bill, including summoning groups of Republicans for meetings at the White House to air their grievances with the Senate-passed version of the package. And Trump's key ally Speaker Mike Johnson is again facing a test of his powers in the narrowly divided House, as he seeks to steer his fractious conference to swallow a vote that many of them dislike.

            In a meeting with centrist-leaning Republicans, Trump's tone was “cordial,” one GOP member in the room said. The White House brought in Dr. Mehmet Oz – who leads the agency in charge of Medicaid – to help educate members on related provisions in the Senate GOP bill, such as provider taxes and a bolstered fund for rural hospitals, and the potential impacts to hospitals in their districts, according to another person familiar with the discussions. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were both in attendance, helping to convince members to back the bill, those two people said.
    


            “Those meetings are having a big impact, members are moving to yes,” Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told reporters after returning from the White House meeting with Oz, Trump and Vance.
    


            House Majority Whip Steve Scalise nodded to the importance of Trump's involvement in the discussions earlier Wednesday, telling reporters at the US Capitol, “The president from day one has been our best closer, and he's going to continue to be through today.”
    


            Both Johnson and Trump have been adamant that the bill land on Trump's desk in time for him to sign it on the Fourth of July, leaving almost no time for more talks. They also have almost no room for error: House Republicans can only afford to lose three votes if they have full attendance. So far, Republicans are still missing multiple members as lawmakers race to Washington after multiple storm-related flight delays.
    


            It all amounts to a pivotal week that could define Trump' second term: So far, the push to pass his agenda in Congress has been marred by weeks of tense GOP infighting that has even some Republicans worried about how the bill could play in the 2026 midterms.
    


            Yet if it passes next out of the House, Trump and his Hill allies believe it will help cement his legacy on issues like border security and tax policy – including fulfilling his campaign promises of no taxes on tips or overtime pay – while attempting to rein in federal spending by instituting work requirements for able-bodied adults for Medicaid and SNAP.
    


            Meetings were ongoing at the White House as of midday Wednesday, but key conservatives were still insisting they want to change the Senate bill — a promise that Trump and Johnson aren't willing to make.
    


            “It's not ‘take it or leave it.' I don't need take it or leave it legislating. How about we send it back to him. We say, ‘Take it or leave it,' all right? So the Senate doesn't get to be the final say on everything,” Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, one of the most vocal critics of Trump's bill, said before he left for the White House on Wednesday. “We need more spending restraint.”

Here's how Trump's megabill will affect you



            Roy is a leading member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which outlined their opposition to the Senate's version of Trump's domestic policy bill in a new memo obtained by CNN.
    


            The right-wing group of Republicans pointed to more than a dozen problems they have with the current bill, including what they described as watered-down energy tax credit measures, an increase to the deficit and various Medicaid provisions that differ from the House-passed version of the bill.
    


            And in another troubling sign for the White House, the Freedom Caucus' chairman, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, told reporters he declined to attend the meeting with Trump. “I'm still voting no on the rule. We have to get this thing right,” Harris said.
    


            Another possible “no” vote, Rep. Keith Self of Texas, said he was not invited to the White House.
    


            The Senate's Tuesday passage of the bill had been a hard-fought victory for Trump, who spent days wrangling fellow Republicans behind the multi-trillion-dollar bill, which includes tax cuts and funding boosts for the Pentagon and border security. It also includes more contentious spending cuts to pay for the rest of the bill, including the biggest downsizing of the federal safety net in decades.
    


            Across the Capitol, House GOP leaders are confident the latest version can pass the House, according to multiple sources. But it will likely take significant political muscle, as Johnson grapples with his own high-stakes battle between centrists and right-wing hardliners.
    


            The legislative brawl inside the US Capitol has also included some dramatic moments – including over the weekend when a key Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis, stunned Washington by announcing he would not seek reelection after defying Trump and voting to block his bill on the floor. (Within a day of Trump threatening to primary him, Tillis exited the race altogether.)
    


            Those high-stakes moments will likely continue on Capitol Hill. Before the bill can come to a final passage vote in the House, the chamber must first take a key procedural vote known as a vote on the rule – and some conservative are threatening to rebel against it, creating a new headache for the speaker. (That vote was already delayed by several hours Wednesday.)
    


            The bill did clear one early hurdle in the House: The House Rules Committee voted to advance the rule on Trump's agenda bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning after the panel met for almost 12 hours. GOP Reps. Ralph Norman and Chip Roy, two conservatives who have harshly criticized the Senate's version of the package, joined Democrats on the panel to oppose advancing the rule.
    


            Some Republicans, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, still insist July 4 was an “arbitrary” deadline.
    


            Massie, who has consistently voted against the bill over his deficit concerns and has faced the ire of Trump, said he intends to stand firm against the bill.
    


            Asked if there was anything at all leadership could do to win his vote, he said, “We could go back to the drawing board.” Asked about the self-imposed deadline, he added: “There's no reason to bankrupt the country because you want to go shoot off some fireworks.”

Ukrainian prosecutors have documented cases of Russian forces summarily executing 273 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs), the Liga.net news outlet reported, citing a statement from the Prosecutor General's Office.

Kyiv and the U.N. have raised alarm over the rising number of such cases, saying they point to a systematic policy by Russia to murder Ukrainian captives. Half of the document cases were recorded this year alone.

Seventy-seven criminal cases have been launched in connection with the killings of POWs, while only two people were convicted, and a trial against a third person is ongoing. The statement did not clarify whether the convictions were issued in absentia.

A total of 188 people have been convicted of various war crimes, including 18 captured Russian soldiers and one civilian, who were convicted in person. The rest were convicted in absentia.

Earlier this week, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported a case of the likely murder of a Ukrainian POW who was apparently tied to a motorcycle by Russian soldiers and dragged along the road. 

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said in May that it alone had documented more than 150 cases of Ukrainian soldiers being executed after surrendering to Russian forces. Multiple intelligence reports suggest that Russian soldiers have received explicit orders to kill prisoners of war.

The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine confirmed in March growing numbers of incidents in which Russian forces killed or maimed surrendering Ukrainian troops.

A separate Ukrainian investigation is also underway into the killing of around 50 Ukrainian POWs in the Russian-run Olenivka prison in 2022. Kyiv blamed the killings on Russia, saying Moscow's forces deliberately put Azov fighters in a separate building that was later destroyed.

Russia denied responsibility, claiming the explosion was caused by a Ukrainian HIMARS strike—a version U.N. investigators have rejected. 

Although Moscow blocked an independent investigation by denying U.N. monitors access, Lubinets recently said that an internal U.N. analysis concluded Russia was to blame.

According to Bloomberg, some European allies hope the Trump administration will soften or reverse the decision. 





The plant produces Tor and Osa air defense systems, as well as Harpy-type attack drones. 

Pornography production and distribution are illegal in Ukraine, with broad interpretations meaning even sharing nude photos can result in jail time.

If the Strait were mined, Iran could block one-fifth of global oil demand and spike world energy prices — a boon for Russia's oil-dependent economy. 

"When it comes to Ukraine, in the short term, Ukraine cannot do without all the support it can get," NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said.

Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Oleksii Chernyshov will keep his position after a decision from the High Anti-Corruption Court on July 2. 

U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg denied that he agreed to "work on" halting Ukraine's drone attacks on Russia, contradicting Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko's claim.

The Kyiv Independent's Chris York sat down with Michael McFaul, an academic and former U.S. ambassador to Russia (2012–2014), to discuss the state of the Ukraine-Russia peace process following U.S. President Donald Trump's failed effort, the threat of U.S. disengagement, and a congressional bill introducing new sanctions against Russia and its trading partners supporting its war machine.

The project remains a cornerstone of Russian-Turkish energy cooperation. 

The SBU said it had established that Metropolitan Onufrii, also known by his secular name, Orest Berezovskyi, voluntarily received Russian citizenship in 2002 and failed to inform Ukrainian authorities of the fact. 



According to the statement, a small Russian reconnaissance group managed to briefly enter the village of Dachne, located on the edge of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The group reportedly took photos with a Russian flag, but Ukrainian forces "eliminated them."

Foreign ministers from the Quad alliance agreed on July 1 to cooperate on securing and diversifying critical mineral supply chains amid efforts to tackle challenges in the Indo-Pacific region.

The four-nation bloc—which includes the United States, Australia, Japan, and India—announced the launch of the “Quad Critical Minerals Initiative” following a meeting in Washington.

“Speak plainly!” Russian President Vladimir Putin snapped at his foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, at a televised security council meeting on the eve of his shambolic full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Naryshkin was visibly nervous. Once he had finally stammered out his support for recognizing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states—the words Putin was waiting for—he was abruptly told to sit down, like an unprepared pupil flubbing an oral exam. Naryshkin's apparent ambivalence about embracing Putin's pretext for the war was likely due to the lack of solid intelligence that Putin's “special military operation” would return Kyiv to Moscow's imperial orbit. But rather than air any misgivings, Naryshkin chose compliance and conformity. The intelligence may have been hazy, but the risks of contradicting Putin were clear.

Putin's unwavering belief that Ukraine would swiftly capitulate represents the greatest intelligence failure of his quarter-century tenure in power. He was furious when his invasion did not unfold as he envisioned, casting blame on and even arresting some senior security officials. But Putin had laid his own trap. Like many authoritarians, he had fostered conditions in which subordinates told him only what he wanted to hear. Intelligence, in its best form, encourages political leaders to ask the right questions, challenge their assumptions, and consider what might go wrong. Although intelligence officers have a professional responsibility to adapt to the interests, foreign policy priorities, and preferred briefing style of the leaders they serve, sometimes the highest form of service an intelligence agency can provide is to disabuse its political masters of a strongly held but false idea.

The United States possesses an intelligence community that is the envy of the world. But under President Donald Trump, some of the same pathologies that make authoritarian regimes prone to intelligence failures are making the U.S. system similarly vulnerable. His populist, personalist style has led him to disregard the value of intelligence and abuse the agencies that produce it. In late June, the day before he sent U.S. bombers to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump dismissed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's congressional testimony that Iran was not close to developing a nuclear weapon—an assessment that conflicted with the president's own claims. “I don't care what she says,” Trump said. After the U.S. strikes, he triumphantly declared that the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were “completely and totally obliterated,” whereas a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report made a more conservative estimation of the damage.

The problem is not just that Trump himself belittles intelligence. His administration is also creating conditions in which senior officials tailor their assessments to please him. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth repeated Trump's hyperbolic claims of obliteration, brushing aside his own intelligence agency's report. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the “alleged ‘assessment' is flat-out wrong.” Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, quickly claimed to find “new intelligence” to support Trump's interpretation of events but declined to share it publicly.

Increasingly staffed by loyalists rather than seasoned professionals—one critical counterterrorism office in the Department of Homeland Security suddenly found itself under the command of a recent university graduate with no national security experience—intelligence agencies risk becoming overly politicized, providing justification for policy decisions rather than informing them. Meanwhile, the United States faces serious national security threats, not least a heightened terrorism threat as Iranian-backed groups seek retaliation for the United States' strikes on Iran. Whether it results in a terrorist or cyber attack, a foreign policy miscalculation, or a military surprise, the consequences of an intelligence failure could be profound. And the risk is only growing.

Intelligence failures are inevitable even in healthy systems. Uncovering and properly assessing secrets is hard at the best of times; human fallibility guarantees that there will be errors in process and analysis. But distortions within the system increase the likelihood of failure. The classic case is an authoritarian regime in which the self-assured ruler does not tolerate other views. Intelligence officers in such systems operate in an environment where speaking truth to power is not tolerated, acquiescence is preferred over expertise, sycophancy trumps insight, and “alternative facts” must be presented to maintain the leader's preferred narrative. Offering good-faith assessments that contradict the ruler's views is considered disloyalty and invites punishment. Without space for analytical dissent and the presentation of unvarnished views, leaders can receive and act on faulty intelligence, as the hapless Naryshkin could attest.

The United States today faces a similar risk. Trump's populism is characterized by deep skepticism toward credentialed authority and an intolerance of experts who present inconvenient facts or analysis that challenge his movement's core beliefs. As authoritarian leaders do, Trump has surrounded himself with loyalists who pass ideological litmus tests, such as by insisting that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. The resulting culture of politicized analysis, self-censorship, and suppression of unwelcome truths mirrors the conditions in autocracies that generate intelligence failure.



The most important qualification to serve Trump is personal loyalty, not competence or relevant experience. Of course, a U.S. president should be able to expect a degree of loyalty from federal employees. But the expectations of the Trump administration place personal allegiance above the truth. Several long-serving professionals have been asked who they voted for as a prerequisite for traditionally apolitical national security positions—a kind of loyalty test that disqualifies capable officers and sends a message to those who remain that continued service means compliance.

Loyal senior intelligence officials serving a populist or an autocrat will often tailor their agencies' activities on the basis of what the leader may or may not want to hear. This can cause intelligence resources to be directed away from actual threats. As director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, Kash Patel has reorganized the agency to divert special agents and analysts toward immigration enforcement and the reduction of violent crime, leaving investigations into threats with more serious national security implications—counterterrorism, cybercrime, Chinese or Russian intelligence activity in the United States—underresourced. Although curtailing violent crime is a laudable goal, protecting U.S. national security requires that the FBI and other agencies manage a far wider array of risks.

This is not the only example of the Trump administration's sidelining or shuttering intelligence units that focus on foreign malign influence operations, nor is it the only redirection of resources away from serious threats to serve political interests. In early May, Gabbard directed U.S. intelligence agencies to increase their intelligence collection in Greenland, specifically to assess the strength of the island's independence movement. Greenland, an autonomous territory of a NATO ally, is not a security threat to the United States; the reason for gathering such intelligence is to support Trump's proposal that the United States annex the island. Intelligence agencies do not have unlimited bandwidth. If they are wasting valuable resources on nonexistent threats or dubious schemes to take control of other countries' territories, they are more likely to be surprised by the plans and intentions of adversaries such as China, Iran, and Russia.

Politicians are always tempted to strip out caveats, overstate analytical confidence levels, or downplay dissenting views, as Trump did when he dismissed as “inconclusive” the DIA's initial report on damage to the Iranian nuclear program. His is not the first U.S. administration to prefer intelligence that fits around a particular policy narrative. In the late 1960s, frustrated with the United States' lack of progress during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson preferred the Pentagon's rosier assessments of the war's trajectory to the CIA's more pessimistic views—which distorted his understanding of the war and caused him to hold out false hope for a failing escalation strategy. And in 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld set up the Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon to establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda—a connection the CIA did not find credible—to support the case for a U.S. invasion of Iraq.

In both cases, cherry-picking intelligence led U.S. presidents toward strategic failure. But the lessons of history have apparently been lost in the present White House. In May, Gabbard fired the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council and his deputy after they assessed that the Venezuelan-based criminal group Tren de Aragua was not controlled by the Venezuelan government, contrary to the claim the Trump administration has used to justify its deportation of Venezuelans. When they first reached this conclusion, Gabbard's chief of staff, a Trump loyalist, asked the council to “relook” at the evidence and “do some rewriting” so that the assessment would not be “used against” Gabbard or Trump—a nakedly political request. The NIC leaders broadly maintained their initial judgment rather than amend their assessment to suit the president's policy, and it cost them their jobs.

It is easy to foresee how firing intelligence officials for making evidence-based assessments could drive those still serving to engage in self-censorship and groupthink, both key ingredients in intelligence failure that are prevalent in autocratic systems. Brave analysts may no longer be willing to stick their heads above the parapet to provide intelligence that Trump needs to know, even if he doesn't want to hear it. And if the president only receives assessments designed to please him, he will become stuck in his own echo chamber, unable to make fully informed decisions based on hard reality.

The blatant politicization of intelligence has consequences beyond the halls of the White House. During the dark days of the Bush administration's clamor for war in Iraq, the U.S. intelligence community lost credibility not only with the American people but also with partners abroad. The same corrosion of civic trust and falling confidence of allies is underway today. If the United States' allies and partners consider U.S. intelligence untrustworthy or worry that their own intelligence may become politicized, they may choose to share less with Washington, which could rob U.S. intelligence agencies of a vital clue they may need to foil a plot or understand a key development. Cooperation with foreign agencies is a central part of U.S. intelligence gathering. Washington itself has enormous capabilities, but it cannot replace the collection and analysis provided by its partners.

While publicly claiming that its actions are meant to depoliticize U.S. intelligence agencies, the Trump administration has in fact politicized them further by pressuring them to produce assessments that reinforce preferred policy narratives, dismissing assessments that don't, purging staff members who are perceived to be disloyal, and harassing the workforce through methods such as random polygraph tests conducted under the guise of leak investigations. It is clear to members of the civil service that their positions are subject to the administration's whims. Like the NIC leaders, they could be fired for simply doing their jobs. Like staff members working in diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, they could be fired for doing a job the administration did not want done. Like six National Security Council staffers who were let go after Trump met with the far-right activist Laura Loomer, they could be fired for perceived disloyalty. Or, like the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, they could be fired for no stated reason at all.

Administrative chaos masquerading as cost-cutting has sapped morale. In March, Trump's adviser Elon Musk and staffers at his so-called Department of Government Efficiency visited the CIA and the NSA headquarters, sending shivers down the spines of career professionals. Shortly afterward, both agencies announced thousands of job cuts, mostly in the form of rescinded job offers, layoffs of new hires, routine retirements, and voluntary buyouts. The buyout offer enticed several senior intelligence officers out of public service, although many stated privately that the offer only made the difficult decision to resign easier to swallow. Not only does their premature departure deprive the administration of their expertise and experience, but the cancellation of job offers means they will not be replaced by promising young officers brimming with passion and patriotism.

Ideally, intelligence agencies should welcome and harness talent from all corners. Narrowing the talent pool robs the country of the opportunity to tap the full potential of its citizens, undermining the potential contributions of intelligence to statecraft. In the Soviet Union, only Communist Party members were permitted to join the primary intelligence agency, the KGB. That commitment to Marxist-Leninist ideological purity damaged the KGB's analytical performance: the agency routinely underestimated the resilience of Western cohesion and overestimated the strength of Soviet client states and revolutionary movements. During World War II, British intelligence benefited from Alan Turing's codebreaking genius in part because he kept his homosexuality hidden. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is repelling talent by making it clear that it no longer values diverse perspectives in U.S. intelligence agencies. Instead of simply reassigning officers who had had been temporarily detailed to work on DEI initiatives in the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the administration fired them when those initiatives were shut down, sending the message that it expects ideological conformity.



A U.S. intelligence community that increasingly operates like that of an autocratic country will struggle to retain employees and recruit new ones. At the moment, public service may not look appealing to America's best and brightest. Worse, the current workforce is demoralized and distracted by the purges and the abuse of the system that they witness. Thousands of intelligence officers are tapping their professional networks and getting their secret resumes cleared so that they can apply for private-sector jobs. A nervous and preoccupied workforce will hardly deliver peak performance.

The Trump administration's proximity to conspiracy theorizing also corrodes its relationship to intelligence. Loomer, whose meeting with Trump prompted several high-profile intelligence agency firings, is known for promoting conspiracy theories, including the unsubstantiated claim that the 9/11 attacks were an “inside job.” Other members of the Trump administration, such as Dan Bongino, the deputy FBI director, have openly floated conspiracy theories accusing the “deep state” of withholding the truth from the American people on every topic from the prison death of the criminal defendant Jeffrey Epstein to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. No genuine conspiracies have been uncovered, but the vilification of U.S. intelligence agencies deemed part of the “deep state” has a lasting effect on the perceived legitimacy of the work they do.

Demonizing intelligence ultimately makes the United States less safe. Intelligence agencies need the support of the public if they are to do their jobs well. Federal law enforcement, for instance, relies on tips from citizens; repeatedly calling the FBI “irredeemably corrupt”—in the words of its deputy director—may dissuade people from cooperating when approached by special agents. And if Trump-aligned media outlets are spouting populist rhetoric about the threat from within—specifically, the threat that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies pose to civil liberties—politicians may find it difficult to support legislation that enables necessary intelligence gathering. Early last year, when it came time to reauthorize Section 702 of a 2008 amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a key provision that permits the U.S. government to surveil foreign citizens outside the United States, the same people who are now leading the FBI joined far-right media outlets to misleadingly paint the law as providing Orwellian power to an unaccountable deep state. The provision was eventually renewed for two more years, but the episode illustrated the vulnerability of intelligence agencies' most valuable tools to exaggerated political rhetoric.

Trump is not a born intelligence consumer. Judging by the infrequency of his briefings in this area—his public schedule has not included more than one per week, in contrast to the six per week that his predecessors typically received—he seems uninterested in the advantages good intelligence can confer. He operates on instinct and often justifies his polices as “common sense,” which is the sort of populist heuristic approach that does not align with the methodical process of intelligence analysts. Trump prefers slogans over substance, narrative over nuance, and conspiracy over curiosity. He avoids digging into details. His ideological positions run headlong into empiricism, as the administration's fight with economists over the effects of its tariff policy has shown. Trump seems to value intelligence only when it validates his own instinct; he does not look to it to challenge his beliefs or to help him consider different angles.

The way the Trump administration is managing the U.S. intelligence system increases the likelihood of an intelligence failure. It could take the form of a surprise attack, a misreading of an adversary, or an inability to anticipate another consequential event. Trump has ignored warnings before. During his first term, he was slow to respond to alerts about the spread of COVID-19, hindering the United States' early pandemic response, and he was dismissive of the security risks of aggressive homegrown nativism presented to him by intelligence analysts at the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in the lead-up to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.



Something similar could happen today. Warnings, repeatedly dismissed with prejudice, may eventually stop arriving. Intelligence may fail because critical information may not reach Trump. Fear of retribution could cause officials to self-censor or avoid providing assessments that may provoke an ideologically motivated backlash, such as alerts about domestic violent extremism among far-right groups or about Russian information operations. As the former senior CIA analyst Brian O'Neill wrote in Just Security last month, “the next intelligence failure will not be a surprise. It will be a choice.”

An intelligence failure on his watch may not compel Trump to fix the problems that caused it. Instead, he could blame U.S. intelligence agencies for falling down on the job or even falsely suggest that they were always out to get him. Any reform his administration introduced after an intelligence failure would likely be designed to further politicize the intelligence community, weaken its independence, and give the executive branch greater control of its budgets, personnel, and authorities.

A talented sports team coached badly can still squeak out a win. If the United States avoids a major intelligence failure in the next few years, it will be thanks to the enduring professional ethos of its intelligence agencies. But those agencies will not be reaching their highest potential; if they are consistently misused, ignored, and politicized, they will not be able to produce the information advantage that the intelligence community was designed to deliver to the U.S. president. Trump is enamored of the United States' natural resources—its oil and natural gas, its timber, its agriculture. The country's unparalleled intelligence community is another precious resource, a pillar of the “greatness” Trump strives for. Ensuring American security today and for future generations depends on his good stewardship of this national treasure.

WASHINGTON, July 2. /TASS/. The US Department of Defense has suspended deliveries of air defense system missiles and precision-guided munitions to Ukraine due to depleted stockpiles, Politico reported citing sources.

According to the report, the decision to halt the shipments was initiated by US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby. It followed an internal review of US ammunition stockpiles, which raised concerns over the sharp decline in the overall number of artillery shells, air defense missiles, and precision-guided munitions.

Politico sources noted that the decision to suspend certain aid deliveries, originally approved under former US President Joe Biden's administration, was made in early June but has only now gone into effect.

When asked by TASS to comment on the Politico publication, the Pentagon stated that the US Armed Forces are "fully equipped to deter against any threat." According to Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell, "Our service members are fully equipped to deter against any threat, and the Senate's recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill ensures that our weapons and defense systems are modernized to protect against 21st century threats for generations to come.".

Deep in the Florida Everglades, the latest illegal immigration detention and deportation facility opened for business on July 1, eight days after state officials said work began.

A cluster of temporary structures large enough to hold up to 3,000 illegal immigrants and 1,000 staff members now stands next to a runway 10,499 feet long and 150 feet wide. The facility was paid for largely by the Department of Homeland Security.

Washington Times' Stephen Dinan praises the Trump administration for the work it's done to secure the border on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order that sought to prevent migrants crossing the border from seeking asylum or applying for withholding of removal in the U.S., a major blow to Trump as he looks to further enforce his broad immigration crackdown.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Daniel Moss, an Obama appointee, said Wednesday that Trump's Jan. 20 proclamation, which sought to block all migrants "engaged in the invasion across the southern border" from claiming asylum or seeking withholding of removal, exceeds his authority — siding with a group of 13 asylum-seekers and immigrants rights groups who sued over the proclamation earlier this year.

The group urged the court in February to block Trump's proclamation from taking force, arguing that the action was "as unlawful as it is unprecedented."

Moss, who heard arguments in the case in April, appeared to agree. Trump, he said in his order, "lacks the inherent constitutional authority" to supplant federal statutes governing removals.

"To hold otherwise would render much, if not most, of the INA simply optional," the judge said.

Moss elaborated further in the 128-page opinion, saying neither the U.S. Constitution nor the Immigration and Nationality Act grant Trump the authority to "replace the comprehensive rules and procedures set forth in the INA and the governing regulations."

"The Court recognizes that the Executive Branch faces enormous challenges in preventing and deterring unlawful entry into the United States and in adjudicating the overwhelming backlog of asylum claims of those who have entered the country," Moss said in his order.

"But the INA, by its terms, provides the sole and exclusive means for removing people already present in the country, and, as the Department of Justice correctly concluded less than nine months ago, neither § 1182(f) nor § 1185(a) provides the President with the unilateral authority to limit the rights of aliens present in the United States to apply for asylum."

Moss stayed the order for a 14-day period to allow the Trump administration to seek emergency relief and appeal the case to a higher court. 

The judge also granted plaintiffs' request to certify a class of migrants who would were either subject to the proclamation or would be in the future, which he said would not be affected by last week's Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. Casa, which limited the scope of injunctive relief courts can provide.

The decision was blasted by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who described Moss as a "marxist" judge in a post on X.

"To try to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling on nationwide injunctions a marxist judge has declared that all potential FUTURE illegal aliens on foreign soil (eg a large portion of planet earth) are part of a protected global "class" entitled to admission into the United States," Miller said.

The news comes as Trump has sought to prioritize hard-line immigration policies in his second presidential term. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments earlier this year over another order Trump signed, which seeks to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. 

The administration has also cracked down on deportations, invoking a 1798 wartime immigration law to more quickly send hundreds of migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador earlier this year.

The ‘Fox News Sunday' panel discusses the vital Supreme Court race in Wisconsin capturing the attention of the nation and more.

\The Wisconsin Supreme Court's newly elected liberal majority on Wednesday voted to strike down a near-total state abortion ban, voting 4-3 to overturn the stringent, 176-year-old law. 

The decision reflected a deeply partisan split, with all four liberal justices voting to invalidate the 1849 abortion law and the three conservative justices dissenting.

It also crystallized the impact of the state's Supreme Court election earlier this year that raked in millions of dollars in donations, the highest amount in U.S. history for a judicial race. It included involvement from then-Trump ally Elon Musk, former President Barack Obama and others.

Writing for the majority, Justice Rebecca Dallet said the law had been superseded by more recent precedent, including a 1985 statute that allowed for abortions up to the point of fetal viability, or around the 20-week mark.

"We conclude that comprehensive legislation enacted over the last 50 years regulating in detail the 'who, what, where, when, and how' of abortion so thoroughly covers the entire subject of abortion that it was meant as a substitute for the 19th century near-total ban on abortion," Dallet wrote. 

"Accordingly, we hold that the legislature impliedly repealed [the 1849 ban] to abortion, and that [that law] therefore does not ban abortion in the State of Wisconsin."

Conservative Justice Annette Ziegler, in a dissent, described the ruling as "a jaw-dropping exercise of judicial will" and charged that the liberal justices ruled on the matter based on their personal preferences.

The 1849 law, and efforts to revive it, came to the fore in Wisconsin in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade — effectively snapping back into place the state law that had been dormant for decades.

The Wisconsin law made it a felony for individuals in Wisconsin to perform abortions, including when the health of the woman was at risk, and without exceptions in cases of rape or incest. 

Though the law was not enforced by the state in recent years, at least some Republicans had urged the state Supreme Court to keep it in place, prompting opponents to push more urgently for it to be struck down.

The 4-3 decision puts to rest the possibility that it could be revived.

It's also the clearest sign to date of the impact that liberals on the bench could have after they regained the court majority in 2023 for the first time in 15 years. 

The closely watched state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin was the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, attracting more than $100 million in donations and far eclipsing the $56 million spent on the state Supreme Court race just two years earlier, according to figures compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice. 

Susan Crawford ultimately beat out conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who was backed by President Donald Trump and Musk.

Musk personally donated $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party earlier this year, while his two super PACs spent more than $17 million on Schimel's behalf.

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers praised the state Supreme Court decision Wednesday, describing it as a win "for women and families" and healthcare professionals in the state.

"Three years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court upended five decades of precedent and threw reproductive freedom in Wisconsin and across our country into chaos," Evers said in a statement. "I promised then to fight like hell to ensure every Wisconsinite has the freedom to consult their family, their faith and their doctor and make the reproductive healthcare decision that is right for them, and I've never stopped.

"Today, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld that basic freedom."

The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for legal permission to fire three Democratic-appointed members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission after the move was blocked by a lower court.

U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox previously ruled that Trump's termination of Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr. was unlawful. He argued that the firings went against the provision that a president could only fire commissioners for neglect of duty or malfeasance. Solicitor General D. John Sauer is now taking the matter to the nation's highest court.

In the filing, Maddox alleged that the three members immediately worked to sabotage the work of the CPSC, and were effective in doing so due to their making up a majority on the five-member board. He also pointed out that they were undermining the work of the CPSC's acting chairman, to whom “Congress has vested the agency's ‘executive and administrative functions.'”

Maddox further alleged that the members were threatening staff, throwing the agency into chaos.

“The Acting Chairman views respondents' actions as procedurally improper and thus invalid, but one of the respondents has threatened agency staff: ‘If you chose to ignore the directive of the Commission, I suggest you read the [district court's] order and decide whether you want to personally violate it,'” Maddox wrote.

THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO COULD DEFECT TO SINK TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

“Respondents' actions have thus thrown the agency into chaos and have put agency staff in the untenable position of deciding which Commissioners' directives to follow,” he added.

The episode represents the latest of many legal struggles faced by the Trump administration, which has been hounded by legal barriers every step of the way in carrying out its agenda.

The budget bill sabotages one of the biggest growth sectors of the US economy.

The first solar cell ever made was built in the United States. Tesla, based in the US, was once the largest EV manufacturer in the world. The lithium-ion battery was codeveloped in the US.

But today, China — not the US — is the largest manufacturer of solar cells and batteries. China's BYD — not Tesla — is the largest EV manufacturer in the world. And China is starting to outrun the US on research and development investment. 

The US has a long history of taking the lead in clean energy, and a long history of losing it. And President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” which passed the Senate on Tuesday, would again leave the US on the margins of a global clean energy revolution that it could have dominated. 

For years now, clean power has been the largest source of new electricity in the US. Solar, batteries, and wind are on track to make up more than 90 percent of new electricity capacity on the US power grid this year. Wind and solar now produce more electricity on the US power grid than coal. Almost twice as many Americans work in clean energy compared to fossil fuels, and the sector is still growing. 

But thanks to the bill, that may not be the case for much longer. 

Some of the more extreme provisions in earlier drafts of the bill have been removed, like an excise tax targeting renewable energy. But the latest version of the bill rolls back many of the investments from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the single-largest US investment to address climate change by giving the energy transition a boost. It calls for more rapid phaseouts of tax credits for wind and solar power and eliminates a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of a new electric vehicle. The spending bill working its way through Congress doesn't just undo incentives for clean energy — it also creates a new tax credit for coal. 

These provisions are in line with Trump's longstanding antipathy toward renewable energy and disbelief in climate change. But they stand to hobble the US economy more broadly. 

The US is facing significant load growth on the power grid for the first time in decades as the tech industry scrounges for electrons to power their electricity-devouring data centers. Energy demand is rising and the cheapest, most readily deployable supplies of energy are being throttled. 

The alternatives, however, are not likely to make up the gap in time. Fossil fuels take longer to ramp up. The US is currently the largest oil and gas producer in the world, but it can take years to site, permit, and acquire the materials to build power plants that burn these fuels. Since these are internationally traded commodities, their prices can fluctuate based on factors beyond the US's control. 

Right now, oil prices are at four-year lows and natural gas prices are falling, and when prices are low, it's much harder to make the business case for more mining, drilling, and power plants, even with incentives. Trump may have some levers to pull — he can, for example, open up more federally managed lands for energy production — but many of those leases sit unused because energy companies don't want to create a supply glut. Meanwhile, employment in the oil and gas industry remains volatile, while coal jobs are continuing their decades-long decline. 

“We're in this moment of surging demand and you can't build another gas turbine for at least five years beyond what's already been booked,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director for modeling and analysis at the think tank Energy Innovation. “We have this demand growth that's going to have to be met. The only thing you can build to meet it on the timeline needed over the next five to 10 years is solar, wind, or battery storage.”

The Senate bill does extend tax credits and loan programs for nuclear energy and geothermal power. However, the cuts in the bill would also slow efforts to build up the domestic energy supply chain needed to bolster other zero-emissions technologies, from raw materials like lithium and rare earth minerals to battery factories. It would do little to relax the bottlenecks for connecting new power plants to the grid, which are adding years to project timelines. The US is also dismantling research and development that could yield the next energy breakthrough. On top of all this, Trump's tariffs are raising operating costs not just for renewables, but also for the fossil fuels he loves so much.

The net result is a policy suite that will not only hamper clean electricity, but energy overall, making it more expensive for everyone across the country. According to Energy Innovation, the Senate bill would reduce how much energy the US adds to the grid in the years to come compared to the current trajectory, thereby increasing household electricity prices on average by $130 per year, eroding almost a trillion dollars in economic productivity, and costing 760,000 jobs by 2030. 

While the US is putting clean energy in reverse, other countries are racing ahead. Clean energy technology investment is poised to increase to $2.2 trillion this year around the world. Renewables are on track to overtake coal as the biggest power source in the world this year. Wind, solar, and batteries are still getting cheaper. Effectively, the US is ceding one of the biggest growth industries in the world to China, particularly as developing countries industrialize and other wealthy countries look to decarbonize their economies. 

The case for more clean energy — lower costs, faster deployment, fewer greenhouse gas emissions — remains robust. Even with all the deliberate obstacles the Trump administration is placing ahead, there are some wind, solar, and battery projects still poised to come online in the US as they work their way through the pipeline, albeit at a much slower pace than before. 

But without continued investment, the US will lose ground to the rest of the world and condemn itself to dirtier, more expensive energy while worsening a problem that will extract a dear toll from the economy.

After facing several months of backlash, the Colorado state Capitol has replaced a controversial portrait of President Donald Trump, which he claimed was "purposely distorted" by the artist. 

A new presidential portrait, recently donated by the White House, was installed last week at the Denver Capitol, the Colorado Capitol Building Advisory Committee told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. It replaces Colorado artist Sarah Boardman's painting, which had hung since 2019.

Despite the previous portrait's six-year run on display, Trump took to social media last spring to criticize the artwork, saying Boardman "must have lost her talent as she got older" and had "purposely distorted" his image. The Colorado Springs artist denied the claims. 

While Boardman's painting depicted a much younger Trump, the latest display by Arizona artist Vanessa Horabuena mirrors Trump's intense official presidential photo.

COLORADO TO TAKE DOWN TRUMP PAINTING AT STATE CAPITOL

"Thank you to the Highly Talented Artist, Vanessa Horabuena, and the incredible people of Colorado," Trump said Tuesday on Truth Social.

Horabuena is a "Christian worship artist" who has done several other depictions of Trump as well as Abraham Lincoln, Mount Rushmore and Jesus Christ, according to her website. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. 

Boardman told Fox News Digital she had no comment on the new painting.

TRUMP WANTS 'DISTORTED' PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF REMOVED FROM COLORADO CAPITOL, SLAMS GOV. POLIS: 'TRULY THE WORST'

The Horabuena portrait was installed as a temporary display following a Thursday decision by the advisory committee, which oversees art displays at the Capitol. 

"The Capitol Building Advisory Committee has agreed at the committee's meeting on June 26, 2025, to temporarily display this donated portrait and will consider the disposition of the full presidential portrait collection at a future meeting," the committee told Fox News Digital. "The new portrait is installed in the third floor gallery of the Colorado Capitol."

Lois Court, a former state lawmaker who chairs the committee, told the Associated Press that installing the donated artwork was the right move.

"There was a blank on the wall," Court said. "It seemed inappropriate. We knew that the White House had sent us this replacement and it simply made sense to put it up."

Boardman's portrait was removed from the Capitol's presidential gallery wall in April, according to the committee, after Colorado Democrats – who control the legislature – agreed to take it down at the request of local Republican leaders.

"Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before," Trump said in March on Truth Social. "The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one of me is truly the worst. She must have lost her talent as she got older."

Several centrist House Republicans could defect to sink President Donald Trump‘s “big, beautiful bill.” The bill can only survive three GOP defectors if all members are present and voting, and numerous Republicans have expressed hesitation to support it.

With Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Warren Davidson (R-OH) signaling immovable “no” votes — they voted “no” for the version approved by the House in May — two more holdouts would sink the megabill.

The bill narrowly passed in May after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) included some sweeteners to win over reluctant Republicans. After a marathon session, the Senate passed the significantly revised bill on Tuesday in a 51-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.

House Republicans are less enthused with the new version of the bill despite Trump's threats and his July 4 deadline to pass it. Centrists expressed dismay with welfare cuts, while fiscal hawks were uneasy with its potential to raise the deficit, which was the main problem that triggered Elon Musk's fallout with Trump.

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) appeared to be the firmest “no” outside of Massie and Davidson, responding in the negative twice when reporters asked if he would vote for the bill as he did in May.

“What we ought to do is take exactly the House bill that we sent over and go home and say ‘when you're serious, come back,'” Norman said, according to the New York Times.

Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) heavily implied that he would not vote in favor of the bill unless significant changes were made, which would require it to be sent back to the Senate.

“The changes the Senate made to the House passed Beautiful Bill, including unacceptable increases to the national debt and the deficit, are going to make passage in the House difficult,” he said, expressing his willingness to work past the July 4 deadline to make it acceptable. “We cannot in good faith pass a bill through our chamber that hinges on cut corners and earmarks. The American people won't stand for it.”

Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) took issue with the bill's treatment of green energy subsidies, saying the Senate's changes in favor of them are “a deal-killer of an already bad deal.”

Roy was careful to portray his opposition as out of support for Trump.

“The President's team has worked hard with us. … I love the president and what he's doing. I want to deliver. But here we sit, and I didn't come to Washington to increase deficits. I didn't come to Washington to continue the Great New Scam,” Roy said, asking why they couldn't just repeal the green subsidies. “The president is kicking ass. Congress is up here dithering.”

Roy clarified that rejecting the Senate's version of the bill would not “kill” it. He suggested the House write a new version and send it back to the upper chamber.

Rep. Roy: "The President's team has worked hard with us… I want to deliver. But here we sit, and I didn't come to Washington to increase deficits. I didn't come to Washington to continue the Great New Scam…The President is kicking ass. Congress is up here dithering." pic.twitter.com/qfxDycrGnD

Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) also opposed the bill in support of Trump, favorably quoting Stutzman's X post explaining his opposition to the current version of the bill.

The House Freedom Caucus has adopted this position, even releasing an ad portraying opposition to the Senate's version of Trump's bill as support for the president.

“The House Freedom Caucus says no” to the reinstituted subsidies, the ad said. “The message: Stand firm. Stand with President Trump and end the Green New Scam now.”

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) said the Senate's version of the bill “is not ready for prime time.”

“We support the president's agenda. The president's agenda was not to raise the deficit by three-quarters of a trillion dollars over the next 10 years,” he told Fox News in an interview. “The bottom line is the House will have its say, and this will not sail through the House. We're going to have to negotiate with the Senate one more time.”

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate's version would add $3.4 trillion to the national deficit, compared to the $2.4 trillion the House version would add.

On the other end of the conservative spectrum, centrist Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) also portrayed his opposition to the bill as in line with Trump's position.

“I've been clear from the start that I will not support a final reconciliation bill that makes harmful cuts to Medicaid, puts critical funding at risk, or threatens the stability of healthcare providers across CA-22,” he said in a statement on X released before the Senate's version of the bill passed.

“President Trump was clear when he said to root out waste, fraud, and abuse without cutting Medicaid, and I wholeheartedly agree. I urge my Senate colleagues to stick to the Medicaid provisions in H.R. 1 — otherwise, I will vote no,” Valadao added.

On Tuesday, Johnson expressed dissatisfaction with the Senate's version of the bill, saying he was “not happy” but “we understand this is the process.” Nevertheless, the House speaker said he would push to get all Republicans to vote “yes.”

Meanwhile, Trump is working overtime to push reluctant House Republicans to support the bill. He cleared his Wednesday schedule in order to meet with holdouts.

“Our Country will make a fortune this year, more than any of our competitors, but only if the Big, Beautiful Bill is PASSED!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social. “As they say, Trump's been right about everything, and this is the easiest of them all to predict. Republicans, don't let the Radical Left Democrats push you around. We've got all the cards, and we are going to use them.”

TRUMP CLEARS SCHEDULE TO CONVINCE HOUSE GOP HOLDOUTS TO PASS ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Despite widespread doubts in the House, Trump suggested on Tuesday that the new version of the bill would “do very well in the House.”

“We thought the Senate was going to be tougher than the House. We got there, and we got pretty much what we wanted,” he said when asked if he thought it would be a struggle to wrestle House Republicans to vote in favor.

Riley Gaines and Keith Olbermann were at it again on social media this week after the ex-ESPN host took aim at the former University of Kentucky swimmer following the resolution agreement between the University of Pennsylvania and the Education Department that resulted in the school stripping program records previously held by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. 

Olbermann posted a message on X on Tuesday calling Gaines "whiny" in response to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announcement that it had reached an agreement with UPenn following its investigation into Title IX violations that centered on Thomas' participation on the women's swimming team during the 2021-22 season.

"Wanted to congratulate Whiny Gaines on now being able to say she finished tied for FOURTH not tied for FIFTH in the Lia Thomas race," Olbermann wrote in his post, referencing the 2022 NCAA Division I swimming championships when Gaines tied with Thomas for fifth place in the 200 free.

Gaines, the host of OutKick's "Gaines for Girls" podcast and a 12-time NCAA All-American swimmer, responded promptly to Olbermann's slight and reminded the ex-ESPN host that Thomas ranked lower in the men's competition before transitioning to the women's team.

"Thank you! And while you're keeping track, make sure to congratulate Emma Weyant, the right National Champ in the 500 freestyle, too," Gaines said, referring to Thomas' title in the 2022 championships.

Gaines continued, "(If you're insinuating 5th in the nation is bad, what do you call a man who ranks 462nd nationally in the men's category?)"  

UPENN STILL ACKNOWLEDGES LIA THOMAS RECORDS IN UPDATE AFTER RESOLUTION WITH EDUCATION DEPARTMENT

Thomas became the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title. During competition, Thomas set multiple individual program records. On Tuesday, UPenn announced that a trio of records set by Thomas that season would be updated to reflect the female competitor's records. 

A note on the school's website, however, still recognized Thomas' records based on the NCAA's eligibility requirements at the time. 

"NOTE: Competing under eligibility rules in effect at the time, Lia Thomas set program records in the 100, 200 and 500 freestyle during the 2021-22 season," the annotation read.

Earlier this year, in compliance with President Donald Trump's executive order, the NCAA announced it was updating its gender eligibility policies to ban all biological males from competing in women's competition.

In UPenn's statement on Tuesday, Penn President J. Larry Jameson said the university plans to "fully comply" with Title IX and the NCAA's current policies. 

"The University will not – on the basis of sex – exclude female students from participation in, deny female students the benefits of, or subject female students to discrimination under, any athletics programs. In addition, in providing to female student-athletes intimate facilities such as locker rooms and bathrooms in connection with Penn Athletics, such facilities shall be strictly separated on the basis of sex and comparably provided to each sex," the school wrote.

Emmanuel Acho reacts to the growing concern around how the WNBA is handling Caitlin Clark. From intense physical play to mounting injuries, Acho questions whether the league is pushing her too far.

Caitlin Clark has finally snapped back at her opponents.

Since making her WNBA debut last year, Clark has been the victim of hard fouls on the court and cultural wars off of it.

The cries from fans saying Clark's opponents are jealous of her have been loud and clear, and they were recently amplified when players ranked her the ninth-best All-Star guard in the WNBA.

Well, it appears Clark is hitting back.

The Indiana Fever won the WNBA's Commissioner's Cup, an in-season tournament, with their 74-59 win over the Minnesota Lynx on Tuesday night, and the team celebrated in the locker room with some champagne and vodka seltzers.

Fever forward Aaliyah Boston took to Instagram Live to give a behind-the-scenes look at the celebration when Clark, who did not play due to a groin injury, took a shot.

"Guys, I just know everybody in the league is sick," Clark is heard saying from out of the shot.

The teammates replied with laughter, with Boston adding, "They're p---ed."

SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS AS FELLOW PLAYERS RANK CAITLIN CLARK 9TH-BEST ALL-STAR GUARD: 'THESE GIRLS ARE LAUGHABLE'

While celebrating, Clark also voiced an opinion on the tournament and the $500,000 prize for the winning team.

"You get more (money) for this than you do if you're the (WNBA Finals) champion. It makes no sense. Someone tell [WNBA commissioner] Cathy [Engelbert] to help us out," she said in another video.

It's been reported that WNBA champions win an extra $20,000, but the in-season tournament winnings come out to around $30,000 per player.

Clark was the first overall pick last year after becoming the NCAA's all-time leading scorer in both men's and women's Division I basketball. Her games in both college and the pros have been among some of the most-watched of all time. Her return from a calf injury on June 14 garnered 2.2 million viewers, the third-most watched WNBA game ever on ABC. The game peaked at 2.8 million viewers, a 76% increase from last season's regular-season average on the network.

The WNBA had its most-watched regular season in 24 years last season and its highest attendance in 22 years.

Ahead of the WNBA season, the Fever had the 10 most in-demand games on StubHub, with most of their games being moved to larger capacity venues.

Despite this, Angel Reese once said that the rise of women's basketball "is not just because of one person - it's because of me, too." A'ja Wilson also once said that Clark's race was a "huge thing" when it came to her popularity.

Peter Lumaj, former U.S. Senate candidate and attorney who fled communist Albania, speaks on fears over New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's allegedly 'communist' ideas.

President Donald Trump vowed to "save New York City" from mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday.

Trump made the statement from his Truth Social account, blasting the Democratic Party's nominee for mayor and claiming that he has the power to step in and take action if he chooses.

"As President of the United States, I'm not going to let this Communist Lunatic destroy New York," Trump wrote. "Rest assured, I hold all the levers, and have all the cards. I'll save New York City, and make it 'Hot' and 'Great' again, just like I did with the Good Ol' USA!"

The post was only Trump's latest salvo against Mamdani, who has faced intense criticism from conservatives and even some Democrats over his socialist policies and refusal to condemn terrorism-linked rhetoric.

HAKEEM JEFFRIES SAYS NYC HOPEFUL MAMDANI NEEDS TO 'CLARIFY' HIS POSITION ON 'GLOBALIZE THE INTIFADA'

Zohran Mamdani is a "communist lunatic" who will "crush" New York City if elected mayor, says President Trump. 

Mamdani's campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Trump had previously threatened to pull federal funding from the city, saying in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday, "I can tell you this – whoever's mayor of New York is going to have to behave themselves, or the federal government is coming down very tough on them financially."

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Mamdani would "crush" New York City if he is elected mayor.

Fox News' White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked Leavitt about recent calls for Mamdani to be deported, citing calls from one lawmaker who said Mamdani should be denaturalized.

"I haven't heard him say that. I haven't heard him call for that. But certainly he does not want this individual to be elected. I was just speaking to him about it and [Mamdani's] radical policies that will completely crush New York City, which is obviously a city that the president holds near and dear to his heart," Leavitt responded.

Leavitt went on to say that Trump would be willing to work with Mamdani if he is elected, though she predicted that the relationship would be difficult.

"Look, the president is always willing to work with everyone. He's working with Democrats across the country, Democrat governors. And he said he'll work with people on the far left. He works with Republicans. He works with people in the middle. He wants to do what's right for America," Leavitt said.

"But surely someone who holds these values and is quite literally a communist and condemns every value that makes this country great: common sense, law and order, low taxes, working hard, and earning your keep in this country. He's against all of that. And I think the president would find it difficult to work with someone like that, if he is elected. I'm sure you'll hear more from the president on that, but we'll have to see. Hopefully, the voters of New York City choose wisely," she finished.

            CBS News parent Paramount Global has agreed to pay $16 million to resolve an extraordinary lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” news report last fall.
    


            The long-gestating and highly controversial settlement payment was announced by Paramount late Tuesday night.
    


            Paramount said the $16 million sum “includes plaintiffs' fees and costs,” and will not be paid to Trump directly, but instead will be allocated to Trump's future presidential library — mirroring a settlement agreement that Disney's ABC struck with Trump last December.
    


            “The settlement does not include a statement of apology or regret,” Paramount specified.
    


            But it is still an embarrassing episode for CBS, because legal experts maintained that Trump's suit was frivolous and that CBS was on solid ground to fight and win the case in court.
    


            “This is a very sad moment for '60 Minutes,' CBS News and journalism,” a CBS News staffer told CNN on condition of anonymity.
    


            Other employees also described widespread outrage and disgust about the payment to Trump. But there is also “a slight sense of relief that we can start to put this behind us,” the staffer added.
    


            A spokesman for Trump's legal team, meanwhile, celebrated the deal as a victory, even though Trump had claimed billions of dollars in damages, and wound up settling for a tiny fraction as much.
    


            “With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,” the spokesman said. “CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle.”
    


            Outside analysts have framed it very differently – as an instance of corporate priorities trumping journalistic principles.
    


            Paramount has been trying for months to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, and the deal requires approval from the Trump administration, in part because CBS owns local stations that are licensed by the government.
    


            This gave Trump a form of leverage over Paramount — and may have put more pressure on the company to pay up.
    


            The Writers Guild of America East, which represents writers at “60 Minutes” and across the news division, said the settlement was a “transparent attempt to curry favors with an administration in the hopes it will allow Paramount Global and Skydance Media merger to be cleared for approval.”
    


            Paramount said Tuesday night that “this lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process. We will abide by the legal process to defend our case.”
    


            FCC chair Brendan Carr has also repeatedly said that his merger review process is separate. But before being promoted to chairman, the Trump appointee said complaints over the “60 Minutes” edit would be “likely to arise” as part of the FCC's merger review.
    


            Carr did not respond to a CNN request for comment about the status of the review on Wednesday.
    


            Press advocacy groups, meanwhile, blasted Paramount for deciding to settle.
    


            “Paramount's spineless decision to settle Trump's patently unconstitutional lawsuit is an insult to the First Amendment and to the journalists and viewers of '60 Minutes,'” the Freedom of the Press Foundation said. The group has vowed to file a shareholder's derivative lawsuit over the settlement, meaning the litigation over the matter is not over yet.
    


            The settlement deal included a promise from CBS that “in the future, ‘60 Minutes' will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.”
    


            This is notable because the lawsuit at issue is all about a contested transcript.
    


            Trump's complaint was about a single question and answer in a lengthy “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. He claimed without evidence that the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit the Democratic candidate and hurt him.
    


            Conservative media watchdogs had noticed that CBS aired two different soundbites from Harris in response to correspondent Bill Whitaker's question about the Biden administration's relationship with Israel amid the war in Gaza. One clip aired on “Face the Nation” and another clip aired on “60 Minutes,” which generated confusion on the part of the viewing public.
    


            As criticism mounted and Trump threatened to sue, CBS said it merely edited the vice president's answer for time, in accordance with television news standards, and it declined to release the full transcript.
    


            Trump went on the warpath, claiming “election interference” and calling it “the biggest scandal in broadcast history.” He accused CBS News of violating a Texas consumer protection law and demanded $10 billion in damages. His lawyers later raised the total to $20 billion.
    


            Legal experts slammed the suit as “frivolous and dangerous,” and CBS defended “60 Minutes” on First Amendment grounds.
    


            Under pressure from the FCC last winter, CBS released the tapes and transcript of the interview, and the raw materials confirmed that it engaged in normal editing, not any nefarious activity like Trump alleged.
    


            Nevertheless, the lawsuit posed a serious problem for Paramount, especially its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, who stands to make hundreds of millions of dollars through the Skydance deal.
    


            So once Trump took office for a second term, Paramount executives sought to make the lawsuit disappear. Critics of the settlement effort, inside and outside CBS, used words like payoff and bribe to describe the proposed settlement.
    


            At “60 Minutes,” “everyone thinks this lawsuit is an act of extortion, everyone,” a network correspondent told CNN earlier this year.
    


            Several Democratic lawmakers even raised concerns that a settlement might run afoul of anti-bribery laws. The media company may be guarding against those warnings by paying the same amount as Disney.
    


            Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks, speaking at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, observed that companies settle litigation all the time for all sorts of reasons.
    


            “Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial, as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction.”
    


            Normally, however, the beneficiary of the settlement is not a sitting president.
    


            Trump's CBS lawsuit was part of his larger and ongoing effort to attack major media organizations he deemed unfavorable to him. He sued The Des Moines Register and pollster J. Ann Selzer last December over a pre-election survey that showed Harris leading Trump in Iowa, which he ultimately won by double digits. Trump claimed the poll violated consumer fraud protections; the Register is currently fighting the suit in court.
    


            He also sued ABC News, alleging that anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him, and the network ultimately settled that case, creating a blueprint of sorts for the Paramount agreement.
    


            In recent months, the CBS newsroom has been consumed by Trump's pressure, the prospect of a settlement and the corporate maneuvering aimed at securing the merger's approval.

            That internal strife spilled out into the public view in late April when “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned, citing a loss of editorial independence. Days later, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley called out Paramount on-air, revealing that executives “began to supervise our content in new ways” amid the pending merger. “No one here is happy about it,” he said.
    


            A month later, Wendy McMahon, the executive in charge of CBS News, also resigned. She alluded to a “challenging” past few months in her farewell memo to employees, adding that “It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.”
    


            All the while, “60 Minutes” kept producing substantive investigations about Trump and other subjects, including a probe of his efforts to punish law firms he dislikes.
    


            On the news division's daily editorial conference call Wednesday morning, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski thanked staffers for “blocking out the noise” of the past few months and said it is important to “lock arms” and move forward reporting the news.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.

That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.

“It's an exceptionally good technology,” said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. “It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.”

The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies — sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.

It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.

The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.

Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers — and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.

“A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,” said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.

Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant — and cripple an animal with pain.

Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.

“It smelled nasty,” he said. “Like rotting meat.”

The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.

The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.

One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.

Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.

But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.

Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.

The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.

In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.

But, she added, “You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.”

Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.

In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.

Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.

Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.

In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a “Whiz Packer.”

The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.

Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's “crowning achievements.”

Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.

“Something we think we have complete control over — and we have declared a triumph and victory over — can always rear its ugly head again,” Burgess said.

The Arizona Diamondbacks have finally had enough with one of their most loyal fans.

Dave McCaskill is a season-ticket holder for his beloved D-Backs and owns an Advantage Membership account, which grants him access to specific events, early postseason ticket access and discounts throughout the ballpark.

However, after being involved in yet another fan-interference dilemma, the Diamondbacks banned him for the remainder of the year and terminated his membership account.

"This particular fan has been involved in multiple offenses at Chase Field…" the team said in a statement. "This fan will have the opportunity to return to Chase Field in 2026 so long as he meets certain terms and abides by our Fan Code of Conduct."

McCaskill reached for a ball that was off the bat of San Francisco Giants third baseman Christian Koss. The ball just missed the outstretched glove of left fielder Tim Tawa. Center fielder Alek Thomas appeared to exchange words with McCaskill, who tossed the ball to Thomas. Thomas then tossed it back up. Koss was initially ruled out, but after review, he was awarded a double, and McCaskill was booted from the ballpark.

Recent videos of McCaskill making plays on borderline home run balls resurfaced on social media shortly after the D-Backs' announcement.

"I'm a D-Backs fan. I would never want to do anything to hurt the D-backs or to have them lose the game," McCaskill told Fox 10 Phoenix.

However, he admitted to being "ejected three times." (He later corrected himself to "technically… twice.")

"I caught the ball, came right down, and you see my glove hit the yellow, the top. So I think the ball would have bounced on top and gone over," McCaskill explained.

Fans are not allowed to reach over the wall, or the imaginary line directly above it, to catch a ball. But, it is fair game once the ball crosses said imaginary line. Jomboy Media pointed out a total of four instances, with other social media accounts saying he's been involved in five such reviews.

"What I can comment on is last night, the play happened, I want the play to play. I want the play to be played out… I want plays to be made by the players," Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.

McCaskill, according to the New York Post, said he has "followed" notorious ballhawk Zack Hample, who has garnered plenty of controversy throughout his game-attending days. Hample has caught over 10,000 baseballs.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on U.S. military planning for possible involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, including what it would take to deploy bunker buster bombs.

FIRST ON FOX: A bipartisan pair of lawmakers has proposed authorizing President Donald Trump to transfer B-2 stealth bombers and 30,000-pound "bunker buster" bombs to Israel if Iran is found to still be developing a nuclear weapon after last week's strikes. 

Proposed by Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., the Bunker Buster Act would allow Trump to "take actions to ensure Israel is prepared for all contingencies if Iran seeks to develop a nuclear weapon." 

B-2 bomber pilots launched 14 bunker buster bombs on Iran's top three nuclear sites, in a move that Trump claims "totally obliterated" the Iranian regime's nuclear program. 

Israel, for its part, hit a number of Iranian sites and took out top military brass. However, it doesn't possess the 30,000-pound GBU 57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, precision-guided munition bombs developed for the U.S. Air Force. The 20-foot-long weapons can travel 200 feet deep inside a target before exploding. 

TRUMP WOULD STRIKE IRAN 'WITHOUT QUESTION' IF IT RESTARTS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM

As of 2024, the U.S. had 19 B-2s in operation. It does not transfer custody of its B-2 stealth bombers to any of its allies. 

"Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror, and one of America's top enemies, can never have a nuclear weapon. That's why I strongly supported our military actions earlier this month. Iran has killed scores of Americans, including our service members, and repeatedly attacked our key democratic ally, Israel. Israel must be able to defend herself against Iran, and ensure that Iran cannot rebuild its nuclear capabilities," Gottheimer said in a statement. 

"This bill gives the President the authority to equip Israel with the tools and training they need to deter Tehran and make the world a safer place," said Lawler. 

The International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Chair Rafael Grossi told Radio France Internationale the centrifuges at Iran's underground Fordow nuclear site are "no longer operational," after the U.S. strikes.

However, some have questioned whether Iran may have attempted to move its stock of enriched uranium away from the sites that were targeted, but Grossi told CBS over the weekend that Iran may again begin enriching uranium in a "matter of months." 

"The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there," he said.

"It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage," Grossi added. "Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again."

Meanwhile, after a Houthi strike on Israel, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee suggested the U.S. send B-2 bombers to Yemen to strike Houthi targets.

"We thought we were done with missiles coming to Israel, but Houthis just lit one up over us in Israel. Fortunately, Israel's incredible interception system means we go to the shelter & wait until all clear. Maybe those B2 bombers need to visit Yemen!" 

B-2 bomber planes traveled to Yemen to strike Houthi targets in October 2024.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The University of Pennsylvania on Tuesday modified a trio of school records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and said it would apologize to female athletes “disadvantaged” by her participation on the women's swimming team, part of a resolution of a federal civil rights case.

The U.S. Education Department and Penn announced the voluntary agreement of the high-profile case that focused on Thomas, who last competed for the Ivy League school in 2022, when she became the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title.

The department investigated Penn as part of the Trump administration's broader attempt to remove transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports, concluding the university in Philadelphia had violated the rights of female athletes.

Under the agreement, Penn agreed to restore all individual Division I records and titles to female athletes who lost to Thomas and send a personalized apology letter to each of those swimmers, the Education Department said. 

By Tuesday afternoon, the Penn website showed other athletes holding the school's top times in Thomas' events. The site was annotated with a note that read, “Competing under eligibility rules in effect at the time, Lia Thomas set program records in the 100, 200 and 500 freestyle during the 2021-22 season.”

“While Penn's policies during the 2021-2022 swim season were in accordance with NCAA eligibility rules at the time, we acknowledge that some student-athletes were disadvantaged by these rules,” Penn President J. Larry Jameson said. “We recognize this and will apologize to those who experienced a competitive disadvantage or experienced anxiety because of the policies in effect at the time.”




As part of the settlement, the university must also announce that it “will not allow males to compete in female athletic programs” and it must adopt “biology-based” definitions of male and female, the department said. 

In his statement, Jameson said Penn has always been in compliance with NCAA and Title IX rules as they were interpreted at the time, and that the university has never had its own policies around transgender athlete participation. The school has followed changes to eligibility guidelines as they were issued earlier this year, he said. The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes in February, limiting competition in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

“Our commitment to ensuring a respectful and welcoming environment for all of our students is unwavering,” Jameson said. “At the same time, we must comply with federal requirements, including executive orders, and NCAA eligibility rules, so our teams and student-athletes may engage in competitive intercollegiate sports.”

Education Secretary Linda McMahon called it a victory for women and girls.

“The Department commends UPenn for rectifying its past harms against women and girls, and we will continue to fight relentlessly to restore Title IX's proper application and enforce it to the fullest extent of the law,” McMahon said in a statement.

Former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines thanked President Donald Trump on social media and wrote of the settlement, “ Are pigs flying?” Gaines has said she started her activism against transgender athletes competing in women's sports after sharing a locker room with Thomas at the 2022 NCAA championships.

The Education Department opened its investigation in February and concluded in April that Penn had violated Title IX, a 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination in education. Such findings have almost always been resolved through voluntary agreements. If Penn had fought the finding, the department could have moved to refer the case to the Justice Department or pursued a separate process to cut the school's federal funding.

In February, the Education Department asked the NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations, or NFSHSA, to restore titles, awards and records it says have been “misappropriated by biological males competing in female categories.”

The most obvious target at the college level was in women's swimming, where Thomas won the national title in the 500-yard freestyle in 2022.

The NCAA has updated its record books when recruiting and other violations have stripped titles from certain schools, but the organization, like the NFSHSA, has not responded to the federal government's request and did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. It was not clear how either would determine which events had a transgender athlete participating years later.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — More than 60 years after a white supremacist assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers, his daughter still sees the same strain of political violence at work in American society.

“It's painful,” said Reena Evers-Everette. “It's very painful.”

Evers-Everette was 8 years old when her father, a field secretary for the NAACP, was shot to death in the driveway of his home in Jackson, Mississippi.

A few months after Evers' killing in 1963, President John F. Kennedy was gunned down. The deaths of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy followed later that decade.

Now, experts say the level of political violence in America over the past few years is likely the highest it's been since the 1960s and 1970s. The past year alone has seen the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, the killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers, and two assassination attempts on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

At a four-day conference celebrating Evers' life just before what would have been his 100th birthday on July 2, his daughter was joined by the daughters of slain civil rights leaders: Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and Bettie Dahmer, the daughter of civil and voting rights activist Vernon Dahmer. The 2025 Democracy in Action Convening, “Medgar Evers at 100: a Legacy of Justice, a Future of Change,” was held in Jackson.

“I just was feeling so much pain, and I didn't want anyone else to have to go through that,” Kennedy said, recalling that after her father died, she prayed for the man who killed him. “I was saying, ‘Please don't — please don't kill the guy that killed him.'”




Two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams spoke at the event, denouncing efforts by the Trump administration to strip the names of activists from Navy vessels, including possibly Evers. 

“They want to take his name off a boat because they don't want us to have a reminder of how far he sailed us forward,” Abrams told the conference crowd. 

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has undertaken an effort to change the names of ships and military bases that were given by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, which often honored service members who were women, people of color, or from the LGBTQ+ community. 

Abrams drew parallels between acts of radical political violence and the Trump administration's use of military resources against protesters in Los Angeles who were demonstrating against immigration enforcement actions.

“Unfortunately, we cannot decry political violence and then sanction the sending of the Marines and the National Guard to stop protesters and not believe that that conflicting message doesn't communicate itself,” Abrams told The Associated Press. “What I want us to remember is that whether it is Medgar Evers or Melissa Hortman, no one who is willing to speak for the people should have their lives cut short because of what they say.”

In addition to her father's life and legacy, Evers-Everette wants people to remember the hatred that led to his assassination. 

“We have to make sure we know what our history is,” she said. “So we don't repeat the crazy, nasty, racist mess.”

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — On St. John the Baptist's feast day in late June, an extended Tohono O'odham family attends Mass out at their desert camp, where they gather to harvest saguaro fruit in a process sacred in their Native spirituality.

“When you're raised as being a Catholic and raised as being an O'odham, you have both of those within your home, you have both of those within your family,” said Maria Francisco. “So it's a combination.”

With her cousin, Tanisha Tucker Lohse, and about three dozen other family members and friends, Francisco worshipped at the early morning Mass in a ramada — a canopy topped with saguaro ribs to provide shade, this one decorated with paper flowers. A folding table covered by a white and gold tablecloth served as an altar. A priest visited from Tucson to celebrate the Mass.

A statuette of St. John the Baptist stood by a bunch of fresh flowers, candles and burning desert sage in lieu of incense. There also were photographs of Tucker's late mom and their great-great-aunt, known as “Grandma Juanita,” whose advocacy preserved the camp. Juana is Spanish for Jane, so she celebrated her name day on St. John's and the family is continuing the tradition.

A dozen cross-shaped saguaro fruit-picking poles leaned behind the table. Made from saguaro ribs, they're used to hook the fruits and push or pull them down from the towering plants.

The history of encounters between Catholicism and Native spirituality has often been marred by violence and oppression. But many members of the Tohono O'odham Nation hold onto both faith traditions as they were passed down since the late 17th century, when an Italian-born Jesuit missionary, the Rev. Eusebio Kino, introduced Christianity to these remote deserts in what now are the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. 




“To me, it's the lived consequence of trying to do Catholicism on their own,” said Seth Schermerhorn, a Hamilton College professor who studies Indigenous adoption of Christian practices.

Many O'odham villages have mission churches, though a shortage of priests means regular Mass is a rarity. The Rev. Aro Varnabas came from his parish, Saint Kateri, to celebrate this service.

“Making people feel connected to God through the things they're familiar with, that's what I see,” he said.

Michael Enis, who works for the O'odham's San Xavier's district — home to one of the most beautifully decorated colonial Catholic churches in the Southwest, San Xavier del Bac — brought his three young children.

He sees a special kinship between his nation and Jesus' cousin, who lived off the desert, calling for repentance at the risk of his life, and baptized Christ himself in the Jordan River.

“You connect the story of St. John and O'odham life, and you're stronger for it,” Enis said.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Philippine campaign aimed at exposing China's aggression in the disputed South China Sea has shattered “the illusion of China being peaceful and friendly,” Lithuania's defense chief said Wednesday, urging democratic countries to stand united against an emerging axis of authoritarian countries led by China and Russia. 

Beginning in 2023, the campaign, which Manila calls a “transparency initiative,” includes publicizing images of China's aggressive actions in the disputed waters. 

“I believe that, in this case, revealing to the world how China is harassing the Philippine's navy and fishermen of the Philippines in their own waters is very important because it shatters the illusion of China being a peaceful and friendly neighbor,” Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė said.

“It's nothing peaceful when you see water cannons being used against peaceful fishermen and there's nothing peaceful about ramming the ships of Philippines in the territorial waters of the Philippines,” she added.

Šakalienė expressed support to former Filipino senator Francis Tolentino while in the capital for talks aimed at deepening defense ties between the two countries.

Tolentino was sanctioned by China on Tuesday for his strong criticisms of Beijing's acts of aggression and for his work on two new laws, which demarcated Philippine territorial zones, including in parts of the South China Sea that Beijing claims.

Šakalienė said she and her family had also been sanctioned by China and banned from entering the country for her strong criticisms of China's aggression and human rights record.




“Welcome to the club,” Šakalienė said in an interview with a small group of journalists, including from The Associated Press, in response to China's sanction against Tolentino. “Talking about China's crimes is what gets you into the blacklist.”

“Pressure, coercion and threats is their usual method of operation,” she said.

Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Šakalienė's remarks.

During President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration, which began in mid-2022, the Philippines invited Filipino and foreign journalists to join its coast guard and navy patrols in the disputed South China Sea. They have witnessed an increasingly alarming spike of confrontations in the waters in recent years, with China using water cannons and dangerous maneuvers to defend its claim to the global trade route.

China blames the Philippines for instigating the clashes. A 2016 international arbitration decision invalidated China's claims based on the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, but Beijing has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.

Šakalienė said that in the Baltic Sea, Chinese ships and crew members have helped suspected Russian fleets damage undersea oil pipelines, and data and electricity cables belonging to rival European nations like Lithuania by dragging steel anchors on the seafloor. She warned that such acts of sabotage could also be carried out in Asia by China and Russia.

Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the long-simmering territorial disputes in the South China Sea but they have not been as vocal against China's aggression as the Philippines.

The United States does not lay claim to the disputed waters but has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to defend the Philippines — Washington's oldest treaty ally in Asia — if it comes under an armed attack.

Šakalienė warned that it's crucial for countries to band together and fight an emerging authoritarian bloc consisting of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea which she said is a threat to democracy.

Trying to keep track of all the chaos is overwhelming. So here's a one-stop guide to the turmoil this Court caused.

There are two big winners in the Supreme Court's most recent term.

One is social and religious conservatives. In the last two days of its term, the Court imposed heavy new burdens on public schools at the request of religious conservatives, and it rendered much of federal Medicaid law unenforceable in a case lashing out at Planned Parenthood. It heard its first major pornography case in over two decades, upholding a Texas law that seeks to limit youth access to porn. And the Republican justices handed a historic defeat to transgender Americans, permitting states to block at least some trans people from receiving gender-affirming medical care.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Four justices also voted that the Constitution requires most states to fund religious public charter schools. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was recused from this case, is likely to provide the fifth vote for religious public schools in the future.

Indeed, as I'll explain in more detail below, the Court's Republican majority is willing to tear down major American institutions in order to advance the cultural right's political goals.

Another winner is President Donald Trump. One year after the Republican justices ruled that Trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes, these same justices continue to treat him as the special favorite of the laws.

The Court's most high-profile Trump-related decision, Trump v. CASA, placed vague new restrictions on lower courts' power to block Trump administration policies. This decision is defensible — the Biden administration sought a similar ruling while it was in power — but it is notable that the justices waited until a Republican was president before weakening lower courts' power to rein in the executive.

Even before the CASA decision, however, the Court frequently blocked lower courts that ruled against the Trump administration. When lower courts block Trump's policies, the Republican justices routinely reinstate those policies on the Supreme Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices consider on an expedited basis.

There was also one unexpected loser this term: the business and fiscal conservatives that have historically dominated the Republican Party. In the same week that the Court handed down most of its biggest decisions, it also rejected an attack on Obamacare. And it waved away a request to put drastic new limits on federal agencies' power to regulate business. 

So, while the Court now hands out victories to the cultural right as if it were passing out candy on Halloween, several of the GOP justices did show more moderation on the kinds of issues that preoccupied Republicans as recently as a decade ago. It was a lot to keep track of, especially given Trump's ability to dominate the news, so here's a quick rundown of how the Court reshaped the law during its recent term.

At least two cases this term did serious harm to institutions that millions of Americans depend upon, both in decisions that benefited cultural conservatives. 

In Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Court's Republican majority ruled that public schools must inform parents before their children are taught a lesson those parents might object to on religious grounds, and that those parents must be given an opportunity to opt their child out of that lesson.

The Supreme Court used to treat public schools with more respect.

Mahmoud arose out of a dispute over queer-themed books — Montgomery County, Maryland, approved several books with LGBTQ characters that could be used in classroom instruction. But the First Amendment prohibits discrimination among people with different religious beliefs. So, if parents with anti-LGBTQ religious views have a right to notification and an opt-out, so too does every parent who might object to any lesson on any religious ground.

This rule, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor warns in a dissenting opinion, is likely to cause “chaos for this Nation's public schools.” Requiring every public school teacher to anticipate which lessons might implicate a parent's religious beliefs “will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,” especially in a nation as diverse as the United States.

In the past, courts have rejected similar lawsuits brought by parents who object to books or lessons that feature magic, women who have achievements outside the home, and include topics as diverse as divorce, interfaith couples, “immodest dress,” and “false views of death.” After Mahmoud, however, all of these parents now have a right to advance notice.

Schools that fail to predict that a lesson about a Jewish woman with a career, a Hindu husband, or an immodest wardrobe will offend a parent's religious belief will now face very serious financial consequences. Federal law often lets the “prevailing party” in a suit about constitutional rights collect attorney's fees from the losing party. So lawyers can hunt for parents with idiosyncratic religious views, file a lawsuit against a school, and demand payment to avoid litigation that will be even more expensive for the school district.

The Supreme Court used to treat public schools with more respect, out of concern that the Constitution should not be read to prevent such an important institution from functioning. 

Like the right to free exercise of religion, the right to free speech is also protected by the First Amendment. That is why the Court held in Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) that public school students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”

But Tinker recognized that free speech should not be used as a weapon that can shut down classroom instruction altogether — if any student could get up in the middle of class and start yelling, for example, their right to free speech would destroy every one of their classmates' right to an education. 

And so Tinker also held that public school students may not engage in speech that “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.” The Court struck an appropriate balance between protecting free expression by young people, and making sure that public schools continue to produce an educated workforce that ultimately benefits every single American.

That decision stands in stark contrast to Mahmoud, which establishes that the rights of religious objectors must be advanced at all costs, even if it would mean imposing such enormous burdens on public schools that every child receives an inferior education.

A similar dynamic was in play in Medina, which pitted the GOP's disdain for abortion providers against a federal law permitting Medicaid patients to choose their own doctors. Just as in Mahmoud, the Republican justices handed a sweeping victory to social conservatives — seemingly without any regard for how their decision would damage Medicaid.

Federal Medicaid statutes are riddled with provisions establishing who must be covered by Medicaid, how that coverage should be provided, and what minimum standards of care Medicaid patients are entitled to receive. South Carolina illegally forbade Medicaid patients from choosing Planned Parenthood as their health care provider. Rather than ordering South Carolina to comply with the law, in Medina the Republican justices effectively repealed the choice-of-provider provision.

The question of which Medicaid laws can be enforced through federal lawsuits, and which provisions are essentially worthless, is one of the most important questions in American poverty and elder law and has been litigated for decades. But two years ago, in Talevski, the Supreme Court finally settled on a clear rule that judges could apply to identify which provisions are enforceable. 

If you want to know more about these many decades of litigation, I explain many of those details here. But the most important thing to know about Talevski is that it established that Medicaid laws which are “phrased in terms of the persons benefitted” and that “focus on the benefitted class” are enforceable. So, if a specific provision of Medicaid law mentions Medicaid patients, or otherwise names the individuals who are supposed to benefit from that law, it is enforceable.

The choice-of-provider provision at issue in Medina refers to “any individual eligible for medical assistance.” So it was enforceable under Talevski. Medina should have been an open and shut case.

Yet, instead of following Talevski, the Republican justices produced an incoherent opinion that does not even announce a new legal rule, beyond a vague statement that Medicaid laws are “especially unlikely” to be enforceable. Much of Justice Neil Gorsuch's opinion in Medina fixates on seemingly random facts about the choice-of-provider provision, such as the fact that it “appears in a subsection titled ‘Contents,'” as if that's somehow relevant to the question of whether this provision is a meaningless husk.

It is impossible to come up with a principled explanation for why, two years after Talevski, the Republican justices decided to abandon that decision and replace it with a new legal standard that renders much of federal law completely useless. But it's certainly possible to come up with a political explanation. Unlike Medina, Talevski did not involve an abortion provider. Several of the Court's Republicans appear to have flipped their votes between Talevski and Medina in order to lash out at Planned Parenthood.

The worst thing about the Medina decision is that the Republican justices could have come up with some good-for-this-ride-only legal reasoning that denied Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, but that otherwise left Talevski intact. Instead, they appear to have overruled Talevski and replaced it with a vague new rule that does little more than tell lower court judges that Medicaid plaintiffs should nearly always lose.

It seems that, in order to spite Planned Parenthood, the Supreme Court stripped tens of millions of Americans of countless rights protected by federal law.

Many of the Court's most consequential decisions were handed down on its shadow docket, a process that allows a party that lost in a lower court to seek an immediate Supreme Court order blocking that decision. 

This term, the Republican justices used the shadow docket to temporarily nullify the Convention Against Torture, a treaty that is supposed to prevent the United States from deporting noncitizens to countries where they may be tortured. The Court also used its shadow docket to effectively repeal federal laws protecting the leaders of several federal agencies from being fired by Trump, and to prevent lower courts from interfering with the chaotic work of Elon Musk's former office, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). (In an unusual liberal victory on the shadow docket, the justices also ruled that Trump must give certain immigrants due process before he ships them off to a notorious Salvadorian prison.)

Traditionally, the Supreme Court takes months or even longer before it decides a case. With rare exceptions, a case must be heard by a trial court and at least one appeals court before the justices will even consider taking it up. And getting the justices to hear a case is a bit like winning the lottery. 

Lawyers hoping the Court will review their case file over 8,000 petitions seeking such review in any given year, but the justices only grant about 60–70 of these petitions. Then, once a case is granted, that's only the beginning of a months-long process where lawyers submit briefs, the justices review them and hold oral arguments, and then they spend months working on the final decision. Contentious suits can wait an entire year for a decision, even after the justices announce that they will hear the case.

The reason for this slow, highly selective process is that the Supreme Court has the final word on questions of US law. So if it gets a case wrong, that mistake can linger uncorrected for decades. The Court's plodding deliberation is supposed to minimize the risk of that happening.

Beginning in Trump's first term, however, the Court started relying heavily on a separate, much less cautious process to decide cases involving Trump and his government. 

Historically, the Court's shadow docket was used primarily for death penalty appeals, where the petitioner seeking Supreme Court review would be killed if the justices did not act very swiftly. Litigants in non-death penalty cases could seek expedited review on the shadow docket, but it was so discouraged, and shadow docket petitions were so rarely granted, that smart lawyers typically decided not to annoy the justices with them. During the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Justice Department sought shadow docket review about once every other year.

Now, however, whenever the Trump administration claims that it must have a Supreme Court order blocking a lower court's decision, the Court treats that claim as an emergency that must be tended to immediately. 

In Nken v. Holder (2009), the Supreme Court held that a party seeking shadow docket relief must do more than simply show they are likely to prevail if the Court hears their case on the merits. Among other things, they must also show that they “will be irreparably injured” if the justices do not immediately block the lower court's decision.

But, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pointed out in a pair of opinions dissenting from two shadow docket orders, the Republican justices seem to have decided that the Trump administration is exempt from Nken, as they often grant shadow docket relief to Trump even when he cannot show irreparable injury. In Social Security Administration v. AFSCME, a case about whether DOGE may access highly sensitive Social Security data, Trump's lawyers didn't even make an argument that his administration would experience irreparable harm without Supreme Court intervention. Yet the Republican justices intervened anyway. 

As law professor Steven Vladeck has pointed out, the Court granted, at least in part, “each of the last 14 [shadow docket] applications filed by the Department of Justice.”

The federal government's exemption from Nken, moreover, only appears to be in effect when a Republican occupies the White House. In one dissenting opinion, Jackson pointed to several Biden-era cases where the Justice Department sought shadow docket relief from lower court orders. In some of those cases, the Court left the lower court's injunction in place for as much as a year, before finally concluding that the injunction was illegal after the case went through the much slower, traditional appeals process.

The Republican justices, in other words, are manipulating the Court's calendar to benefit Trump. When ordinary litigants — or a Democratic administration — seek shadow docket relief, the justices often apply the traditional rules and norms that prevent them from granting those requests. But when Trump asks the Supreme Court to do him a favor, the Republican justices swiftly oblige.

While the cultural right was one of the biggest winners in the Court's recent term, the Republican Party's traditional business constituency fared less well. On the final decision day of the term, the Court handed down a ruling upholding provisions of Obamacare that require health insurers to cover certain treatments, as well as a decision rejecting an aggressive attempt to limit federal agencies' power to regulate business. Earlier in the term, a unanimous Court also rejected a suit challenging the FDA's decision to pull many nicotine vaping devices off the market.

The Court's Obamacare decision, known as Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, aligns with broader trends within the Republican Party. During Trump's first term, the GOP famously tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. Eight years later, the party has a more modest health care agenda, at least when compared to their ideas from 2017. Congressional Republicans are likely to enact deep cuts to Medicaid, but they are not pushing for full repeal of Obamacare.

Decisions like Braidwood and Medina, in other words, closely track the Republican Party's agenda in Congress. Like their counterparts in Congress, the Republican justices voted to drastically cut back on Medicaid in Medina. But many of them voted to uphold key provisions of Obamacare in Braidwood.

One common element in the Braidwood, the agency power case (FCC v. Consumer's Research), and in the vaping case, (FDA v. Wages & White Lion Investments), is that they all arose out of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a court dominated by MAGA-aligned judges who routinely hand down decisions that are too extreme even for this Supreme Court. 

In recent years, the Fifth Circuit has done everything from declaring entire federal agencies unconstitutional to attempting to pull a popular abortion drug from the market. It once ruled that Texas Republicans may seize control over content moderation at all of the major social media platforms. Many of the Fifth Circuit's judges have taken positions that, if they were embraced by the Supreme Court, risk triggering a second Great Depression.

The Supreme Court frequently balks at the Fifth Circuit's decisions, but it does not do so all of the time. Just last week, for example, in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the Court upheld a Texas law requiring pornographic websites to verify that their users are over age 18, despite a 21-year-old Supreme Court decision that struck down a nearly identical law. The Court took up the Free Speech Coalition case after the Fifth Circuit decided it wasn't bound by that two-decade-old decision.

The best lesson to draw from cases like Braidwood, White Lion, and Consumer's Research, in other words, is that no matter how partisan or ideological the Supreme Court may be, there will likely be other voices within the judiciary pushing the justices to go harder. These voices will even sometimes succeed, as they did in the Free Speech Coalition case.

If Trump gets to replace any members of the current Court, moreover, he could potentially replace relatively moderate justices with the kinds of judges who dominate the Fifth Circuit. No matter how bad the Supreme Court gets, it can always get worse.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

The Court's opinion has disturbing things to say about privacy, but the biggest losers are likely to be judges themselves.

The Republican justices' decision fundamentally altered how public schools must operate.

﻿This decision isn't really about birthright citizenship.

The Republican justices just nuked much of federal Medicaid law, in order to spite Planned Parenthood.﻿

The Court picked a hell of a time to give lawsuit immunity to federal law enforcement.

The decision nullifies a treaty designed to protect immigrants from torture.

BANGKOK (AP) — A U.S. judge has ruled that China's Huawei Technologies, a leading telecoms equipment company, must face criminal charges in a wide reaching case alleging it stole technology and engaged in racketeering, wire and bank fraud and other crimes. 

U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly on Tuesday rejected Huawei's request to dismiss the allegations in a 16-count federal indictment against the company, saying in a 52-page ruling that its arguments were premature. 

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The U.S. accuses Huawei and some of its subsidiaries of plotting to steal U.S. trade secrets, installing surveillance equipment that enabled Iran to spy on protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and of doing business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions there. 

During President Donald Trump's first term in office, his administration raised national security concerns and began lobbying Western allies against including Huawei in their wireless, high-speed networks. 

In its January 2019 indictment, the Justice Department accused Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and charged its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran. 

Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.

Chinese officials have accused the U.S. government of “economic bullying” and of improperly using national security as a pretext for “oppressing Chinese companies.” In their motion to dismiss the broad criminal case, among other arguments Huawei's lawyers contended that the U.S. allegations were too vague and some were ”impermissibly extraterritorial,” and do not involve domestic wire and bank fraud. 




The biggest maker of network gear, Huawei struggled to hold onto its market share under sanctions that have blocked its access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology. The limits led it to ramp up its own development of computer chips and other advanced technologies. 

The company also shifted its focus to the Chinese market and to network technology for hospitals, factories and other industrial customers and other products that would not be affected by U.S. sanctions.

    Editor's Note: Design for Impact is a series spotlighting innovative solutions for communities affected by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.



            In the multibillion-dollar global fight against wildfires, early detection is critical. Satellites, drones, thermal cameras and manned lookout towers are just some of the tools currently used to alert authorities and first responders to imminent threats.
    


            In under-resourced areas, however, these defenses can be prohibitively expensive. That's why a group of recent design graduates has developed a smaller, simpler and, they say, cheaper solution: A pinecone-sized fire detector that can give vulnerable communities an invaluable head start in the race to escape or contain major blazes.
    


            Made primarily from wax and charcoal composites, Pyri's sensors are designed to blend in with — and leave no footprint on — the environment. The device can be deployed in fire-prone areas and left for years without maintenance, according to its creators. When a fire occurs, the heat melts an internal trigger, producing a low-frequency signal that raises the alarm.
    


            “It can help people evacuate sooner, and it can stop fires from growing before they're uncontrollable — before they're really devastating,” Pyri co-founder Karina Gunadi told CNN in a video interview. “If you can catch a fire small, it's a lot easier to put out.”

            Pyri started in London as a college assignment between four design engineering students, three of whom decided to pursue it as a commercial venture beyond their graduation last year. Their company's name comes from the scientific word “pyriscence,” which describes the ways nature adapts to wildfires.
    


            As an example of a “fire-dependent species,” Gunadi pointed to various types of pine tree that not only thrive in fire-prone areas — they need blazes to reproduce, as their seeds are only released when the resin sealing their pinecones melts in high heat.
    


            This idea directly influenced Gunadi and her fellow designers. “What if we can be inspired by how nature already responds to fire, take that, use nature-based materials and create the simplest form of wildfire detection we can?” she said, recalling the genesis of the group's design.
    


            Pyri's pinecone-like appearance is also functional: The lightweight sensors' shape and ribbed structure helps protect them against impact, especially if deployed from the air when covering large or hard-to reach areas. But the designers also wanted them to escape the attention of passersby, whether human or animal.
    


            “We've actually lost one in the environment. So, in terms of camouflage, we're doing maybe a little too well!” Gunadi joked.
    


            Another major challenge stems from the co-founders' commitment to non-toxic materials — especially when it comes to the electronics required to produce a signal. Although Pyri is not publicly detailing its trigger technology or disclosing its precise material composition (a patent application is pending), the designers looked to organic electronics and are avoiding rare earth metals and lithium-ion batteries. Once the devices “burn up,” Gunadi wants to ensure they are “not going to leave any negative impact on the environment.”
    


            Extreme wildfires are becoming more frequent globally, with fire seasons now longer, hotter and drier than before. Climate change is a major contributor, as drought and rising global temperatures make the infernos bigger, faster and harder to stop. This, in turn, may worsen the climate crisis. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), wildfires were responsible for an estimated 6,687 megatons of carbon dioxide pollution in 2023 — seven times more than was emitted by global aviation that year.

            UNEP predicts a 30% increase in extreme fires by the end of 2050 — and a 50% increase by the end of the century. Major blazes are also occurring in places that have not, historically, been considered fire-prone, from America's eastern seaboard to Siberia, Russia.
    


            The impact of wildfires is, for Pyri's creators, personal. One of the company's co-founders, Richard Alexandre, hails from Brazil, where he witnessed first-hand the devastation of forest fires in Pantanal, a region that experienced a record-breaking number of blazes last summer. Gunadi, meanwhile, grew up in Palo Alto, California. She was living in San Francisco during the 2020 North Complex Fire that engulfed the city in smoke.
    


            “I woke up and the sky was dark orange, and it was like that for days,” she recalled. “That was really scary.”
    


            Wildfires spread at speeds of up to 14 miles per hour, so every minute counts. A 2020 study into early bushfire detection by the Australian National University found that a one-hour reduction in response time could reduce the frequency of large fires by 16%.

            Earlier this year, the outgoing Biden-Harris administration earmarked $15 million in funding to construct and deploy a “new suite of fire weather observing systems” in high-risk US locations (though it is unclear what impact, if any, President Donald Trump's attempts to block funds associated with the bipartisan infrastructure law will have on these programs). Google, meanwhile, recently announced $13 million in funding for its FireSat initiative, which will use a “constellation of satellites” to track fires as small as 5 square meters (54 square feet) using realtime images that refresh every 20 minutes.
    


            Pyri is by no means the only company developing simpler, on-the-ground sensor technology. Since 2019, the US Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) has been researching and trialing new wildfire detectors in collaboration with small businesses including Maryland-based N5 Sensors, which says it can detect ignition within five minutes, even if a fire is “only a few square meters in size.”
    


            Traditionally, sensors have relied on optical cameras or thermal imaging that could “see” the flames, but S&T says it hopes its new devices can “sniff” gases or solid particles in the air. It is also using data from earlier trials to inform artificial intelligence algorithms used in its latest sensors.
    


            Pyri's designers are also looking to artificial intelligence: When one of their devices is triggered, AI can analyze available weather and satellite data to assess the likelihood that the signal was indeed the result of a wildfire.
    


            The number of devices required in any given area will depend greatly on the geography of the site, including topography and vegetation, Gunadi said, adding that “fire dynamics are very complicated.” Pyri is hoping to sell a per-kilometer subscription package that bundle together sensors with installation and monitoring software. Declining to reveal the startup's future pricing, Gunadi said it is aiming for fees that are “half the cost of our nearest competitor.”
    


            As such, Pyri hopes to target customers with fewer resources — whether that is money, skilled labor, infrastructure or time — to tackle wildfires. It aims to start with the forestry, agriculture and utility sectors in the US, but has fielded queries from around the world.
    


            Since graduating, Pyri's co-founders have been carrying out research and development and raising funds — including a £5,000 ($6,677) prize from winning a James Dyson Award, an international student design competition founded by the titular British inventor and Dyson founder. The company hopes to run small-scale tests and demonstrations later this year, with a view to operating larger pilots next year and launching commercially in 2027.

Microsoft is cutting more workers in another major round of layoffs at the company this year.

The company said it is making cuts affecting less than 4% of its total workforce. That would be around 9,000 employees based on its head count of around 220,000 employees.

Multiple employees confirmed to Business Insider that the layoffs have begun. One affected employee said they have until July 8 to sign a severance agreement, after which they'll receive 60 days of paid leave.

"We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson told BI in a statement.

The spokesperson said the company is focused on reducing layers with fewer managers and streamlining processes, products, procedures, and roles to become more efficient.

A current employee told BI that cuts to the sales organization were expected after the company said it would consolidate sales "solutions areas." BI previously reported on the internal slides that detail those changes.

The latest cuts come months after Microsoft in May announced layoffs affecting about 6,000 workers.

Executives previously told BI that those layoffs were intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders to non-coders on projects as Microsoft aimed to grow its "span of control," or the number of employees who report to each manager. But those cuts also ended up including many individual-contributor-level engineers. A spokesperson told BI at the time that those cuts were not performance-driven.

It's not just Microsoft. Many of its Big Tech peers are making similar cuts to flatten management levels and become leaner in the name of efficiency.

Google recently cut vice president and manager roles by 10%. Amazon has been working on increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers.

Besides managers, Microsoft and Meta have also recently cracked down on workers they deemed "low performers."

Microsoft:

Hundreds of people were laid off as the company canceled upcoming games such as Everwild

An Xbox games controller

Microsoft Corp.'s gaming division began cutting hundreds of employees on Wednesday, part of a broader culling at the software company as it seeks to control costs. 

Subsidiaries across the gaming organization were told that they would be affected by the layoffs. Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division, which makes Candy Crush, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs, according to people familiar with the plans. Other European offices, such as ZeniMax, also began cutting employees early Wednesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the press.

Amazon is leaning harder on its "Leadership Principles" to rate employee performance, as CEO Andy Jassy continues to create a more disciplined workforce at the tech company.

Starting this quarter's mid-year review cycle, Amazon managers will use a three-tiered system to evaluate how effectively corporate employees demonstrate the company's core values in their work, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.

Although the Leadership Principles have long been central to Amazon's culture and considered in performance reviews, this is the first time they've been formally embedded into the evaluation process. Amazon relies on its 16 LPs, which stress things like customer focus and cost discipline, to guide nearly all business decisions.

As part of this shift, Amazon is streamlining the rating scales for the other two evaluation criteria ("performance" and "potential"). Together with how employees use LPs, these factors determine an Overall Value (OV) score for each corporate employee, which influences future raises and whether they may be placed on a performance improvement plan.

The internal guideline said the changes will "improve our ability to identify top talent and further strengthen our culture." It added that only 5% of the employees will be eligible for the top "role model" grade when measuring their LP behavior.

"By making Leadership Principles a formal input to Overall Value ratings and increasing the granularity of the input rating combinations, the updated process helps us strengthen the connection between performance and culture," the guideline added.

The move is part of a wider wave among tech giants to rethink how they manage performance and reward employees. Microsoft has a new 2-year rehire ban on ousted underperforming employees. Both Google and Meta have also made policy changes that better reward high performers this year.

The initiative demonstrates Jassy's ongoing commitment to cultivating a more rigorous workforce and a more cohesive corporate culture.

In the past year, Jassy has enforced a full return-to-office policy, reduced management layers, and updated its pay model to better reward top talent. Last year, he also shared a video series explaining each LP, and recently warned that AI will reduce Amazon's workforce because of efficiency gains.

Amazon's spokesperson Sam Stephenson told BI that the company regularly reviews its performance review process to "ensure it best supports the growth and development of our employees."

"Our unique culture, which is rooted in our Leadership Principles, drives the innovation we deliver for customers each day," Stephenson said. "These changes streamline the process for managers and help to ensure greater consistency."

Amazon's performance review policy has long been controversial.

Some employees have cited concerns over limited oversight and the potential for misuse, with one former employee describing the system as "predatory and opaque." Some people have also criticized Amazon's cutthroat "stack-ranking" culture, in which a fixed percentage of the workforce is replaced every year.

Amazon managers group their employees in five broad buckets of performance tiers: Top Tier (TT), Highly Valued 3 (HV3), Highly Valued 2 (HV2), Highly Valued 1 (HV1), and Least Effective (LE). Teams with more than 50 employees should categorize 20% as TT, 15% as HV3, 25% as HV2, 35% as HV1, and 5% as LE, the internal guideline said.

Amazon seems to recognize the nuanced nature of performance evaluations. The internal guideline urges managers to dedicate sufficient time to reviewing each employee to ensure accurate assessments.

"Evaluating employees is a high-judgment decision," the guideline said. "You should invest sufficient time in gathering comprehensive and objective feedback to ensure accuracy and minimize unconscious bias."

The impact of President Trump's tariffs on prices throughout the economy is expected to increase over the summer. At U.S. department store chains including Macy's, Nordstrom, and Dillard's, the evidence of more sticker price inflation is starting to show up across more items.

Recent price increases in apparel, footwear, and bags across major U.S. department-store websites tracked by DataWeave indicate a turning point in May, when prices started their ascent.

DataWeave analyzes nearly 15,000 SKUs (stock keeping units), a scannable code retailers use to identify and track a product, and has been collecting that data from January to June for signs of price hikes in footwear, apparel, and bags.

"Footwear is now as much as 4% above January levels at some banners, while apparel is roughly half that pace," said Karthik Bettadapura, co-founder & CEO of DataWeave.

According to the data, Macy's 1589 SKUs of footwear reported a 4.2% increase in price, followed by Nordstrom (3.1%), and Dillard's (2%.)

Prices in store may vary slightly from online prices, but typically follow the same pricing trend.

Type of product and its sourcing can influence how fast the price hikes arrive.

Private-label lines, many of which are made in China, refresh every few months, so retailers like Macy's and Nordstrom feel higher landed costs sooner, according to Bettadapura. Footwear reacts fastest because it carries some of the steepest baseline duties and relies heavily on China for finished pairs. "Even a modest levy can ripple through quickly once fresh stock lands in distribution centers," Bettadapura said. Apparel, with longer design cycles and a more diversified supply base, "is moving more gradually," she added.

Macy's, Nordstrom and Dillard's did not respond to requests for comment.

The SKU data supports findings from a recent survey conducted by the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, where 55% of respondents said they expect their average retail price to rise between 6%-10% in 2025 as a result of tariffs.

"With all back-to-school styles now facing tariffs of between 10-30 percent, higher prices should not be a surprise this summer," said Stephen Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. "While each company makes their own decisions, these tariff costs are now being felt across the board," he said.

In apparel, DSW topped the list in recent price increases, at 2%, followed by Macy's (1.9%), and Nordstrom (1.8%), according to Dataweave.

"If these tariffs persist or increase after July 9, we can expect more of the same in the seasons to come," Lamar said.

Trump has been non-committal recently on sticking to the July 9 deadline his White House set for tariff deals with many trading partners or implement additional tariffs. The White House announced on Wednesday morning it has a trade deal with one key retail manufacturing partner, Vietnam.

Trump said in a social post the tariff rate on Vietnamese goods will be 20%, and go to 40% for any goods that are finished in Vietnam but originate in other countries, such as China, in what is called "transshipment," a supply chain strategy that has been used by companies in China to avoid tariffs.

Apparel companies that rely on Vietnam's manufacturing capacity could face higher import costs under the new tariff rate. Nike, Lululemon, Patagonia, Puma, and H&M are among retail industry companies with manufacturing operations in Vietnam.

Vietnam is the second-largest supplier for footwear, apparel, and accessories sold into the U.S. market, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.

"We'll be watching the back-to-school intake closely to gauge whether this pricing momentum accelerates or levels off," Bettadapura said.

In the bags category (which includes handbags & shoulder bags, crossbody, sling and belt bags, totes, backpacks, travel & duffel bags, small goods and clutches), outdoor recreation store REI had the top price increase, at 2.6% Dillard's, Macy's, and Nordstrom all had nominal increases.

"Retailers have long warned that tariffs will impact pricing, and some consumers may be starting to see those reflected in key consumer products," said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. "Tariffs continue to be a significant challenge for retailers, especially with the ongoing uncertainty and unknowns regarding the final tariff rates."

He said retailers have tried to mitigate price increases, but the merchandise subject to the tariffs is working its way through the supply chain and is now being placed on store shelves.

Bill Simon, former CEO of Walmart, said the data correlates with what he is seeing, and the next move in either stoking or stifling the inflation trend across products may be up to the consumer.

"Companies are mitigating what they can and are passing on the rest," Simon told CNBC. "Consumers, who are the final arbiter of tariffs, then come into play. Will they buy the item that has gone up in price, or will they switch to another item in the same category that has less (or no) tariff? The customer gets to decide if they want to leave the category all together," he said.

Simon gave an example from the grocery aisle, saying if the price of bananas goes up because of a tariff, customers can decide to either buy them or exit the category and buy oranges from California or Florida instead. "If you look at the item level, you will see a higher price on banana but when you look at the category, you will see no price increase because consumers switched to oranges. That is why I believe despite seeing item-level price increases, we are not seeing broader inflation increasing. Consumers are using their power to determine what is too much and what is not," he said.

Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, says inflation is underway, "and has been for the last few months," citing a recent rise in core import prices, ex food and energy, in April and May. "The only question is how this will now flow through the supply chain and who gets to eat it," Boockvar said. "[Fed Chair Jerome] Powell has made it clear that he is going to wait as long as possible until the tariffs fully work their way through the supply chain so he can see where they end up in terms of absorption."

Apple:

Foxconn Technology Group has asked hundreds of Chinese engineers and technicians to return home from its iPhone factories in India, dealing a blow to Apple Inc.'s manufacturing push in the South Asian country.

The bulk of Foxconn's Chinese staff at iPhone plants in southern India have been told to fly back in a move that began about two months ago, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named as the information is private. More than 300 Chinese workers have left, and mostly support staff from Taiwan remain in India, one of the people said.

Crypto ETFs:

Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) signage at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York.

At the world's biggest asset manager, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund now generates more revenue than its signature tracker of the S&P 500 Index.

The roughly $75 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) has seen a torrent of cash from institutional and retail investors alike, drawing inflows in all but one of the last 18 months. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, the fund brings in an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees, based on back-of-the-envelope math calculated by Bloomberg as of July 1. That slightly edges out the $187.1 million made by BlackRock's iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which is nearly nine times larger at around $624 billion in assets, and charges just 0.03%.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the United States has struck a trade deal with Vietnam that includes a 20% tariff on the southeast Asian country's imports to the U.S. 

Trump's announcement on Truth Social said that the deal will give the U.S. tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets.

Vietnam also agreed that goods would be hit with a 40% tariff rate if they originated in another country and were transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the United States.

The process, known as transshipping, is used to circumvent trade barriers. China, a top exporter to the U.S., has reportedly used Vietnam as a transshipment hub.

Trump wrote that "Vietnam will pay" that 20% duty, but tariffs are taxes on foreign goods that are paid by the importers of those products.

The agreement was unveiled less than a week before a 90-day pause on many of Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs was set to expire, sending U.S. duties on imports from dozens of countries soaring.

Under that protectionist trade scheme, Vietnamese imports to the U.S. were subject to a 46% blanket tariff. That rate was lowered to 10% during the 90-day interim. Raising the tariff on Vietnamese goods to 20% will hike costs for U.S. importers, which could be passed on to consumers or suppliers.

The S&P 500 nevertheless rose slightly on news of the trade deal. 

Read Trump's full post:

"It is my Great Honor to announce that I have just made a Trade Deal with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam after speaking with To Lam, the Highly Respected General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. It will be a Great Deal of Cooperation between our two Countries. The Terms are that Vietnam will pay the United States a 20% Tariff on any and all goods sent into our Territory, and a 40% Tariff on any Transshipping. In return, Vietnam will do something that they have never done before, give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade. In other words, they will "OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES," meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff. It is my opinion that the SUV or, as it is sometimes referred to, Large Engine Vehicle, which does so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam. Dealing with General Secretary To Lam, which I did personally, was an absolute pleasure. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"

It was unclear from Trump's post when the deal will take effect, or if it has been officially signed by both parties.

Trump has signaled that he may ignore or revise the upcoming deadline for his reciprocal tariffs to snap back higher. The 90-day pause, which lowered tariffs on nearly all other countries to a blanket 10% rate, was imposed in early April to give countries breathing room while they negotiate deals with the U.S.

With the deadline approaching, the Trump administration has only struck revised trade frameworks with China and the United Kingdom, though it has repeatedly said the U.S. is close to deals with numerous other countries.

Vietnam, whose exports to the U.S. reportedly comprised 30% of its gross domestic product last year, is especially vulnerable to Trump's tariffs.

Critics of Trump's unpredictable tariff policies warn that the duties create economic uncertainty and will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers. The Trump administration and its defenders counter that tariffs do not cause inflation and note that the president's duties have brought in billions of dollars to the U.S. government.

A pricing model created for CNBC this month by retail consulting group AlixPartners found that a 10% U.S. tariff on Vietnamese goods would cause the price of an imported men's sweater to rise by about 8%. Under the 46% tariff Trump initially slapped on Vietnam, the price of that same sweater would rise roughly 35%, the group found.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that officials expect the impacts of Trump's tariffs will start to show up more during the summer months.

Prices on certain items, including apparel and footwear, are already ticking higher as a result of the tariffs, CNBC has reported.

Some analysts believe the lack of a widespread impact on U.S. prices so far is the result of pre-tariff stockpiling by companies, as well as the time it takes for those tariffs to show up in the economy.

Sean "Diddy" Combs was found guilty on Wednesday of prostitution-related offenses but cleared of more serious charges, in a blow to prosecutors who had urged a jury to find him guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.

Combs was convicted of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking, a partial win for the former billionaire known for elevating hip-hop in American culture.

After the judge dismissed the jury and lawyers for both sides, Combs knelt before his chair and appeared to pray. Combs then rose and faced the courtroom gallery.

"I'm gonna be home soon," he said, smiling and clasping his hands. "I love you. Thank you, I love you."

Combs' family and supporters erupted into applause and cheers.

The verdict followed a criminal trial in which two of the music mogul's former girlfriends testified that he physically and sexually abused them.

Combs faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence on each of the two prostitution counts. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian will determine Combs' sentence at a later date.

The acquittals on the sex trafficking counts mean he will avoid a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. He could have faced life in prison if he were convicted on sex trafficking or racketeering conspiracy.

After the jury read its verdict, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo asked Subramanian to release Combs on bail, which prosecutors opposed. Subramanian asked lawyers for both sides to submit written arguments on whether he should release Combs by 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT).

Combs has been held in federal lockup in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest.

Combs' family left the courthouse to chants of "love, love, love," from Combs' supporters. During his career, Combs' stage monikers included Love, Puff Daddy and P. Diddy.

The trial focused on prosecutors' allegations that Combs for two decades used his business empire to force two of his romantic partners to take part in drug-fueled, days-long sexual performances sometimes known as "Freak Offs" with male sex workers in hotel rooms while Combs watched, masturbated and occasionally filmed.

During the seven-week trial in Manhattan federal court, jurors saw some of the 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant authorities found during searches of his homes, which prosecutors said he would use in the performances. They also heard testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends, the rhythm and blues singer Casandra "Cassie" Ventura and a woman known in court by the pseudonym Jane, who said Combs beat them and pressured them to take part in the performances.

Combs, 55, had pleaded not guilty to all five counts. His lawyers acknowledged that the Bad Boy Records founder, once famed for hosting lavish parties for the cultural elite in luxurious locales like the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez, was at times violent in his domestic relationships.

But they said the sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual, and accused prosecutors of trying to criminalize Combs' private sex life. They argued that Ventura and Jane were strong, independent women who voluntarily took part in the sexual performances because they wanted to please Combs.

Both women testified they spent time with Combs and took part in sexual performances after he beat them. Defense lawyers argued that Ventura and Jane were retrospectively accusing Combs of forcing their participation in the performances because they were jealous he was seeing other women.

"If he was charged with domestic violence, we wouldn't all be here," Combs' defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in his closing argument on June 27. "He did not do the things he's charged with."

Combs was convicted of transportation to engage in prostitution related to both Ventura and Jane. Those charges required prosecutors to prove that Combs paid the male escorts for sex, and arranged for their travel across state lines.

Prosecutors had argued that Combs' conduct as to both women amounted to sex trafficking because he compelled Ventura and Jane to take part in the performances using physical violence and threats to withhold financial support or leak sexually explicit images of them.

"The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted," prosecutor Christy Slavik said in her closing argument on June 26. "He doesn't take no for an answer."

At the trial, jurors saw surveillance footage from 2016 showing Combs kicking and dragging Ventura in the hallway of an InterContinental hotel in Los Angeles, where she said she was trying to leave a "Freak Off."

Jane later testified that Combs in June 2024 attacked her and directed her to perform oral sex on a male entertainer, even though she told him she did not want to. That alleged attack took place a month after Combs apologized on social media for his 2016 attack of Ventura, footage of which had been broadcast on CNN.

Prosecutors also argued that Combs was guilty of racketeering conspiracy because he and his associates committed crimes to facilitate his abuse and keep evidence of his wrongdoing under wraps.

The defense argued Combs was a successful entrepreneur who used drugs recreationally, but kept his professional and personal lives separate.

The criminal trial is not the only legal problem Combs faces. Ventura sued Combs in November 2023 for sex trafficking, the first of dozens of civil lawsuits accusing him of abuse. Combs, once feted for turning artists like Notorious B.I.G. and Usher into stars, settled with Ventura for $20 million. He has denied all wrongdoing.

"Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution," Ventura's lawyer Douglas Wigdor said in a statement after the verdict.

In the wake of high-profile layoffs, many workers are feeling anxious about job security.

U.S. employers reported nearly 700,000 job cuts in the first five months of 2025, according to outplacement services firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, an 80% increase compared to job cuts in the first five months of 2024.

It's little wonder, then, that 46% of Americans report feeling "concerned" about layoffs in the next year, according to a recent Indeed survey.

The fear of losing your job can be all-consuming, affecting everything from your productivity to your personal relationships.

According to executive coach and licensed social worker Melody Wilding, layoff anxiety can create a "vicious cycle" of overwork for employees.

Concern for their jobs is "causing people to work much more, maybe in areas that are not productive, and burn out faster," she says.

Below, experts share tips to keep layoff anxiety from affecting your well-being, both at work and at home.

Layoff anxiety can make it difficult to stay focused, even on tasks you usually handle with ease, Wilding says.

"It's always in the back of your head, so you're not really bringing your best to anything you're doing," she says. "There's just a hum of anxiety in the background."

According to career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin, constantly thinking or talking about your job is another red flag.

"If it's something that is just popping into your mind, even at unrelated times, and you're having a hard time distracting yourself or redirecting yourself from that thought, that is definitely a telltale sign that you should probably do something about that anxiety," she says.

On a larger scale, layoff anxiety can create a negative environment at work. According to Wilding, when people are on edge, they're more likely to be "reactive and maybe even defensive or snippy" with their co-workers, which creates an atmosphere of "tension and fear."

Equally, Gavin says, it can strain your personal relationships: if you're constantly "stress venting" to your loved ones about your job concerns, you run the risk of overexerting your support system.

"Anxiety from any place in your life is going to seep into the rest of your life," she says.

For many of Gavin's clients, the hardest part of layoff anxiety is "feeling like you have absolutely no control over the situation."

While anxiety may feel "paralyzing," coming up with a clear action plan can give you a greater sense of stability, she says.

"When my clients are catastrophizing about this sort of thing, I always ask them, 'what would you do? I know you would feel bad, but what would you do?'" she says. "Often we're able to come up with a list of actions that we can take."

If you have a good relationship with your supervisor, Gavin recommends having an honest conversation about the prospect of layoffs, as well as doing some industry research on your own time.

Even if you do get laid off, Wilding says, "it usually isn't as catastrophic as we make it" in our minds. You may have to tighten your budget and put more energy into job searching, but being laid off doesn't mean that your career is over.

Wilding suggests sprucing up your resume and reconnecting with your professional network so that you're ready to hit the job market if necessary.

"It can give you a feeling of agency and control that should something bad happen, at least I'm ready to go," she says.

America's Top States for Business 2025 will be revealed July 10 - stay tuned for coverage of this year's rankings

Six months after wind-whipped wildfires killed 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in and around Los Angeles, the scenes in Altadena and Pacific Palisades are still horrific, with block after block of burned out homes and businesses. 

But every so often, there are small signs of rebirth, from a property owner cleaning up their lot, or workers repairing a home that was merely damaged. Occasionally, one can even see homes being rebuilt — the owner having navigated the complicated permitting process, and, crucially, having managed to obtain insurance.

"The situation in insurance has actually been remarkably stable, considering everything that happened," said Scott Wilk, an independent insurance agent and owner of the Santa Clarita, California, branch of TWFG Insurance.

That is not to say that premiums are not surging after the wildfires. The online marketplace Insurify projects California premiums will rise 21% this year, even in areas that are far from Los Angeles, in what experts had predicted would be a year of only modest increases in the state.

"An event like that in California just has a really significant impact on how much we project premiums to go up," said Chase Gardner, data insights manager at Insurify. He added that when insurance companies "are paying out more than they're bringing in premiums, the more that goes up, the more they need to raise prices."

In fact, Insurify is projecting premium increases in all 50 states this year, averaging around 8%. California's increase is not even the largest. That distinction belongs to Louisiana, where premiums are projected to rise 28%. Nor is the phenomenon limited to coastal states. Iowa and Minnesota are also looking at double-digit increases.

"It's not just a story for areas like coastal Florida or the wildfire prone parts of California. It's really a much more national story," said Benjamin Keys, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "We're seeing states like Vermont with rising costs related to recent floods. We're seeing states like Colorado, which historically was a middle of the pack state when it came to the cost of insurance, seeing rapidly increasing insurance costs due to recent wildfires, and increased hail storms in many parts of the Midwest."

Insurance premiums are regulated state by state, so in theory, a company can't use a disaster in one state to justify a rate increase in another. But in practice, experts say, there is a ripple effect as companies try to balance their risk by more aggressively seeking premium increases in some states, and by reducing their exposure in others by not renewing policies.

"These insurance companies are national companies, and this could affect things like their overall book of business," Gardner said. "Even if they're profitable in ten states, if they're really unprofitable in one state, that can impact how they think about business and how they think about acquiring new customers."

Premiums vary widely from state to state, with Florida's the highest at $15,460 on average as projected by Insurify, though increases in the state appear to have moderated after the state adopted a series of reforms. The lowest average premium is in Vermont at $1,248, despite its recent increases. Even with this year's 21% increase, California's projected average premium of $2,930 is less than Insurify's national projected median premium of $3,520.

That disparity among the states can be a factor in competitiveness. Companies deciding where to locate or expand frequently consider the cost of living for prospective employees. So, CNBC is using Insurify data on premiums and projected increases as components of the Cost of Living category in this year's America's Top States for Business study.

"Home insurance is just becoming a bigger and bigger chunk of people's monthly housing payments," Gardner said. "I think it's kind of really eating into the idea of homeownership being a really stable, cost-capped long term bet, especially if you live in a state like Florida or California, or even Texas."

Experts expect the increases to continue as storms and other natural disasters become more severe, and home values and replacement costs continue to rise.

Wilk said that while the worst of the crisis in California may be over, there is more sticker shock to come.

"There's a very long process for a rate change to get through. Sometimes it can take between 12 to 36 months," he said.

State Farm, the state's largest insurer, which dropped thousands of California policyholders just before the January fires, won state approval in May for a 17% emergency rate hike. But the company had sought a 30% increase, and it has already petitioned state regulators to approve the remaining 13%.

Wilk said that there are still affordable options, relatively speaking, from smaller carriers in California, or from so-called "non-admitted" firms that can sell policies to California homeowners independent of the state regulators.

He said that many of his clients are happy just to be able to get insurance.

"Early on in my career, pre-insurance crisis, if I had a customer's rate go up by five bucks a month, I could be hearing about it and hearing complaints about it," he said. "Now, people are just excited when their policy renews and it's still in force."

Tesla's delivery numbers are in — and they're as bad as Wall Street expected.

The electric automaker delivered 384,000 EVs in the second quarter, narrowly missing analysts' grim expectations.

Wall Street had prepared for disaster, with analysts on average expecting 389,400 vehicles delivered in the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The actual number represents a year-over-year decrease of 13.5% from the roughly 444,000 vehicles it delivered in the second quarter of 2024.

This is the biggest quarterly decline in pure numbers in Tesla's history, representing a drop of 60,000 deliveries compared to Q2 2024.

The latest report follows a bruising first quarter for Tesla. The automaker delivered nearly 336,700 EVs in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 13% decrease from the same period in 2024 and its lowest quarter since 2022.

Tesla's stock was around 3% higher soon after the market opened Wednesday following the announcement.

The challenging quarter came after Tesla experienced its first year-over-year delivery decline in 2024 as the company grappled with an industry-wide EV slowdown, increasing competition, and backlash from some against Elon Musk's political actions.

In the company's first quarter earnings call, CFO Vaibhav Taneja attributed lower delivery numbers to assembly line changeover for the refreshed Model Y and anti-Tesla hostility that had an impact in some markets.

The refreshed Model Y — Tesla's best-selling vehicle — has since launched, fueling an increase in new vehicle sales in April for the automaker as other manufacturers saw a monthly decrease, according to Cox Automotive data. However, it's not the more affordable model that the company previously said was on track to begin production by the end of June.

Although Musk stepped down from his political stint at the White House, the full extent of any brand damage to Tesla is not clear.

The company's stock got a boost after Musk stepped away from his work with DOGE, though the Tesla CEO later ignited a highly public feud with Trump. Tesla's stock has seen volatile swings in recent weeks as the two trade insults.

Tesla's delivery report arrives as the automaker has faced shrinking sales in multiple markets in recent months.

Data from Shanghai-based consultancy ThinkerCar indicated that Tesla's EV sales in China decreased 18% year-over-year between January and May as its rival BYD surged.

The company did get some good news in its second-largest market on Wednesday. According to data from China's Passenger Car Association, the number of cars shipped from Tesla's Shanghai factory rose slightly in June compared to last year, halting an eight-month run of year-over-year sales declines.

Tesla's EU market share dropped year over year from 1.6% to 0.9% in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The automaker saw a 45.2% drop in EV registrations in the first five months of the year in Europe.

When previously asked about declining Tesla sales in Europe, Musk has said that Europe is not a key market for the EV maker and that demand remains strong in other regions.

"Europe is our weakest market," Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May.

May data from Cox Automotive suggests that the US EV industry is also facing challenges. New EV sales are down 10.7% year over year despite a 4.2% uptick from the month prior, according to the data. Despite the industrywide headwinds, the report estimated that Tesla remained the market leader in May.

Musk has said that Tesla's bet on solving full vehicle autonomy is key to the company's future growth. The company launched a limited rollout of its robotaxi service in Austin in June, with plans to expand the service in the coming months.

Microsoft said Wednesday that it will lay off about 9,000 employees. The move will affect less than 4% of its global workforce across different teams, geographies and levels of experience, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.

The announcement comes on the second day of Microsoft's 2026 fiscal year. Executives at the Redmond, Washington-based company typically unveil reorganizations at the time of the new fiscal year.

"We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email.

Microsoft has held several rounds of layoffs already this calendar year. In January, it cut less than 1% of headcount based on performance. The 50-year-old software company slashed more than 6,000 jobs in May and then at least 300 more in June. As of June 2024 it employed 228,000 people. In 2023, it laid off 10,000.

Perhaps the largest culling of Microsoft workers came in 2014, when the company eliminated 18,000 after acquiring Nokia's devices and services business.

As was the case with the May layoffs, Microsoft is looking to reduce the number of layers of managers that stand between individual contributors and top executives, said the person who asked not to be named while discussing internal matters.

"To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness," Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, wrote in a Wednesday memo to employees in that division.

Microsoft reported nearly $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter. The numbers were well ahead of Wall Street's consensus, keeping Microsoft ranked as one of the most profitable companies in the S&P 500 index, according to data compiled by FactSet.

Executives called for about 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter, thanks to expected expansion in Azure cloud services and corporate productivity software subscriptions

Microsoft stock closed at a record high of $497.45 per share on June 26. At the start of Wednesday's trading session, the shares were down about 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was roughly flat.

Autodesk, Chegg and CrowdStrike are among the other software providers that have slimmed down in 2025. Earlier on Wednesday, payroll processing company ADP said the U.S. private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June. Economists polled by Dow Jones had predicted an increase of 100,000.

In this article

Intel's new chief executive is exploring a big change to its contract manufacturing business to win major customers, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a potentially expensive shift from his predecessor's plans.

If implemented, the new strategy for what Intel calls its "foundry" business would entail no longer marketing certain chipmaking technology, which the company had long developed, to external customers, the people said.

Since taking the company's helm in March, CEO Lip-Bu Tan has moved fast to cut costs and find a new path to revive the ailing U.S. chipmaker. By June, he started voicing that a manufacturing process that prior CEO Pat Gelsinger bet heavily on, known as 18A, was losing its appeal to new customers, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

To put aside external sales of 18A and its variant 18A-P, manufacturing processes that have cost Intel billions of dollars to develop, the company would have to take a write-off, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Industry analysts contacted by Reuters said such a charge could amount to a loss of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars.

Intel declined to comment on such "hypothetical scenarios or market speculation." It said the lead customer for 18A has long been Intel itself, and it aims to ramp production of its "Panther Lake" laptop chips later in 2025, which it called the most advanced processors ever designed and manufactured in the United States.

Persuading outside clients to use Intel's factories remains key to its future. As its 18A fabrication process faced delays, rival TSMC's N2 technology has been on track for production.

Tan's preliminary answer to this challenge: focus more resources on 14A, a next-generation chipmaking process where Intel expects to have advantages over Taiwan's TSMC, the two sources said. The move is part of a play for big customers like Apple and Nvidia, which currently pay TSMC to manufacture their chips.

Tan has tasked the company with teeing up options for discussion with Intel's board when it meets as early as this month, including whether to stop marketing 18A to new clients, one of the two sources said. The board might not reach a decision on 18A until a subsequent autumn meeting in light of the matter's complexity and the enormous money at stake, the person said.

Intel declined to comment on what it called rumor. In a statement, it said: "Lip-Bu and the executive team are committed to strengthening our roadmap, building trust with our customers, and improving our financial position for the future. We have identified clear areas of focus and will take actions needed to turn the business around."

Last year was Intel's first unprofitable year since 1986. It posted a net loss attributable to the company of $18.8 billion for 2024.

The Intel chief executive's deliberations show the enormous risks - and costs - under consideration to move the storied U.S. chipmaker back onto solid footing. Like Gelsinger, Tan inherited a company that had lost its manufacturing edge and fell behind on crucial technology waves of the past two decades: mobile computing and artificial intelligence.

The company is targeting high-volume production later this year for 18A with its internal chips, which are widely expected to arrive ahead of external customer orders. Meanwhile, delivering 14A in time to win major contracts is by no means certain, and Intel could choose to stick with its existing plans for 18A, one of the sources said.

Intel is tailoring 14A to key clients' needs to make it successful, the company said.

Tan's review of whether to focus clients on 14A involves the contract chipmaking portion of Intel, or foundry, which makes chips for external customers.

Regardless of a board decision, Intel will make chips via 18A in cases where its plans are already in motion, the people familiar with the matter said. This includes using 18A for Intel's in-house chips that it already designed for that manufacturing process, the people said.

Intel also will produce a relatively small volume of chips that it has guaranteed for Amazon.com and Microsoft via 18A, with deadlines that make it unrealistic to wait for the development of 14A.

Amazon and Microsoft did not immediately comment on the matter. Intel said it will deliver on its customer commitments.

Tan's overall strategy for Intel remains nascent. So far, he has updated his leadership team, bringing in new engineering talent, and he has worked to shrink what he considered bloated and slow-moving middle management.

Shifting away from selling 18A to foundry customers would represent one of his biggest moves yet.

The 18A manufacturing process includes a novel method of delivering energy to chips and a new type of transistor. Together, these enhancements were meant to let Intel match or exceed TSMC's capabilities, Intel executives have previously said.

However, according to some industry analysts, the 18A process is roughly equivalent to TSMC's so-called N3 manufacturing technology, which went into high-volume production in late 2022.

If Intel follows Tan's lead, the company would focus its foundry employees, design partners and new customers on 14A, where it hopes for a better chance to compete against TSMC.

Tan has drawn on extensive contacts and customer relationships built over decades in the chip industry to arrive at his view on 18A, the two sources said.

The clock is ticking in trade talks between Washington and the European Union, with European officials now saying their best hope is striking a "political" deal before a key July 9 deadline, three sources told CNBC.

Concrete details of such a trade arrangement would have to be worked out at a later time.

"The U.S. proposal from last week is aimed at an agreement in principle," one EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, told CNBC, adding that this agreement in principle would then "be negotiated out into a proper trade agreement at a later stage."

Previously close allies, the U.S. and EU have had a fractious relationship amid disagreements over trade and support for embattled Ukraine in the months since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's second term. Tensions escalated in early April, when White House announced a spate of reciprocal tariffs against most global trade partners, including a 20% levy on the EU. All such duties have been temporarily reduced until July 9 to facilitate talks.

The U.S. sent a new proposal to the EU's negotiating team last week. European negotiators are having face-to-face talks with their American counterparts later this week with the view to get a deal done in the coming days. Total bilateral trade in goods between the EU and the U.S. accounted for 851 billion euros ($1 trillion) in 2023, according to figures from the European Commission.

European officials expect a new update on the negotiations Friday, but the situation is fluid. On Monday, European ambassadors had conversations about the state of play in the trade negotiations. Lithuania's Minister of Finance Rimantas Šadžius told CNBC on Wednesday that he is "slightly optimistic" there will be a trade compromise between both sided of the Atlantic.

Despite this, sources told CNBC that, despite efforts to reach a trade compromise, the EU is preparing for any possible outcomes, including the return of reciprocal tariffs.

"The general sense is that in the coming days and weeks, all outcomes, ranging from a successful deal on a framework agreement all the way to higher US tariffs with additional sectors, are still possible," the same EU official told CNBC.

This sentiment was also shared by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last Friday.

"We are ready for a deal. At the same time, we are preparing for the possibility that no satisfactory agreement is reached," she said at a press conference.

The European Commission was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC Wednesday about an update to the talks.

Another EU official, also speaking to CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said there is an awareness in Brussels that it is almost impossible to return to the trade relationship that the EU and U.S. enjoyed before the April 2 announcement of reciprocal tariffs.

A third EU official, who also chose to speak anonymously, told CNBC that there is a risk that the outcome of the talks will be an "asymmetrical" deal, under which the EU will not escape some additional U.S. levies.

Nonetheless, the bloc is looking to get concessions in critical areas for its economy, including automotive, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, all three sources confirmed.

The first EU official added that some member states will only agree to a deal in principle if there is a commitment from the Trump administration to "upfront tariff relief."

The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, negotiates trade with other parts of the world, but its proposals and position reflects the thinking of the 27 capitals.

Summer internships: where ambition and imposter syndrome so often collide.

At KPMG, the tiny fraction of applicants who landed a coveted place on its program are now working to secure a full-time job post-graduation.

A summer internship at a Big Four professional services firm is as competitive as it is prestigious. For most interns, the two-month KPMG internship comes after more than 18 months of applications, networking, and building up their resumé. Just 2,200 of more than 42,000 applicants made the cut this year.

Business Insider asked KPMG partners, including its head of talent, how they should impress in an office of busy people, new AI-enabled ways of working, and tight competition.

"You are in a job interview for the whole internship," Wendy Lewis, managing partner of KPMG's Richmond, Virginia office, told BI at the company's purpose-built Lakehouse in Florida, where around 225 interns gathered in June for four days of inductions and training.

Interns often have a misconception that they only need to be technically impressive, but soft skills are equally important, Lewis said.

She told BI she's interested in whether interns can communicate well, take initiative, and demonstrate their eagerness to learn.

Leaders aren't expecting interns to conduct audits themselves, Lewis added — attitude makes them stand out.

Jason LaRue, KPMG's national talent & culture lead, also emphasized the importance of attitude. LaRue told BI that an intern should be "a great learner."

He said that requires transitioning from classroom learning to an environment where you learn on the job with colleagues. "You have to make that shift from one mindset to the other," he added.

KPMG interns start that transition at the firm's Lakehouse, where they attend training sessions and can unwind with mini-golf and karaoke alongside partners and their peers, before returning to work in KPMG offices around the country.

"The people who really stand out and are the ones who are sponges. They're looking to be able to build new skills all the time to give themselves that extra advantage," LaRue said.

Becky Sproul, the talent and culture leader for KPMG's audit division, said interns should show curiosity, especially amid rapid change in the industry.

The Big Four are restructuring as they try to recover from a recent slowdown in demand for consulting, while also trying to anticipate how AI will change the world of work and their business models.

Sproul described the industry's rapid pace of change as "the new world order." In that kind of environment, continuous learning and agility are important traits, she said.

Rema Serafi, KPMG's vice chair of tax, said interns should show curiosity about the firm's business model and take advantage of its tech tools. Show that you're "interested in what we do as a business," she said.

She said some Gen Zers now entering the workforce are already knowledgeable about generative AI and automation.

"Ideas are welcome," Serafi said, adding that she wanted to know how interns thought KPMG could enhance its use of generative AI.

BI spoke to two KPMG interns at the Lakehouse who said they were worried about impostor syndrome.

"I've talked to interns about this too, not just at KPMG but also my friends interning at other companies, and impostor syndrome comes up a lot," said Andre Gaviola, a 21-year-old audit intern, adding it could feel intimidating to be around so many older, more experienced people.

Evelyn Nunez-Alfaro, a 22-year-old tax intern, told BI that, though she loved stepping outside her comfort zone, she has wondered, "Am I really supposed to be here?"

"Deep down, usually we all feel the same. We're a little nervous, we're a little scared, and don't want to ask the wrong question or seem like we don't know," Nunez-Alfaro said.

LaRue told BI he advised interns to find support figures in their workplace who can coach them through moments of imposter syndrome and sponsor them as they progress in their careers.

At a Q&A at the Lakehouse, one intern asked partners what advice they had for managing impostor syndrome.

Lewis told the interns to build up their self-confidence and realize that they can be themselves and still be successful.

Tell yourself, "I am confident. I can do this. I do belong here," she said.

Honor on Wednesday touted the slimness and battery capacity of its newly launched thin foldable phone, as it lays down a fresh challenge to market leader Samsung.

The Honor Magic V5 goes will initially go on sale in China, but the Chinese tech firm will likely bring the device to international markets later this year.

The company, which spun off from Chinese tech giant Huawei in 2020, is looking to stand out from rivals with key features of the Magic V5, like artificial intelligence, battery and size.

Honor said the Magic V5 is 8.8 mm to 9mm when folded, depending on the color choice. The phone's predecessor, the Magic V3 — Honor skipped the Magic V4 name — was 9.2 mm when folded. Honor said the Magic V5 weighs 217 grams to 222 grams, again, depending on the color model. The previous version was 226 grams. 

In China, Honor will launch a special 1 terabyte storage size version of the Magic V5, which it says will have a battery capacity of more than 6000 milliampere-hour — among the highest for foldable phones.

Honor has tried hard to tout these features, as competition in foldables ramps up, even as these types of devices have a very small share of the overall smartphone market.

Foldables represented less than 2% of the overall smartphone market in 2024, according to International Data Corporation. Samsung was the biggest player with 34% market share followed by Huawei with just under 24%, IDC added. Honor took the fourth spot with a nearly 11% share. 

Honor is looking to get a head start on Samsung, which has its own foldable launch next week on July 9.

Francisco Jeronimo, a vice president at the International Data Corporation, said the Magic V5 is a strong offering from Honor.

"This is the dream foldable smartphone that any user who is interested in this category will think of," Jeronimo told CNBC, pointing to features such as the battery.

"This phone continues to push the bar forward, and it will challenge Samsung as they are about to launch their seventh generation of foldable phones," he added.

The thinness of a foldable phone has become a battleground for smartphone makers to appeal to consumers who want the large screen size the device has to offer without extra weight.

At its event next week, Samsung is expected to release a foldable that is thinner than its predecessor and could come close to challenging Honor's offering by way of size, analysts said. If that happens, then Honor will be facing more competition, especially against Samsung, which has a bigger global footprint.

"The biggest challenge for Honor is the brand equity and distribution reach vs Samsung, where the Korean vendor has the edge," Neil Shah, co-founder of Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.

Honor's push into international markets beyond China is still fairly young, with the company looking to build up its brand.

"Further, if Samsung catches up with a thinner form-factor in upcoming iterations, as it has been the real pioneer in foldables with its vertical integration expertise from displays to batteries, the differentiating factor might narrow for Honor," Shah added.

Vertical integration refers to when a company owns several parts of a product's supply chain. Samsung has a display and battery business which provides the components for its foldables.

Smartphone players, including Honor, have also looked to stand out via the AI features available on their device.

In March, Honor pledged a $10 billion investment in AI over the next five years, with part of that going toward the development of next-generation agents that are seen as more advanced personal assistants.

Honor said its AI assistant Yoyo can interact with other AI models, such as those created by DeepSeek and Alibaba in China, to create presentation decks.

The company also flagged its AI agent can hail a taxi ride across multiple apps in China, automatically accepting the quickest ride to arrive? and cancelling the rest.

Pressure is piling on London's stock exchange, with reports that British pharma giant AstraZeneca may move its listing to the U.S. delivering yet another blow this week.

CEO Pascal Soriot is considering moving the company's stock listing from London to the U.S., British newspaper The Times reported on Tuesday afternoon, citing anonymous sources. Soriot's frustrations with the U.K.'s regulatory environment — particularly rules around new medicine approvals and drug pricing systems — are said to be driving the move.

AstraZeneca declined to comment on the Times report.

The company's exit from the U.K. market would spark a major index re-weighting, given AstraZeneca is the most valuable business listed on London's FTSE 100. AstraZeneca's market cap was £161.2 billion ($221.1 billion) as of Tuesday's closing price, according to LSEG data.

AstraZeneca's potential transatlantic move would add to concerns around London's weakening status as a global financial hub. A number of companies have delisted from the London market or reconsidered plans to float shares in the city over the past year.

Toni Meadows, head of investment at London's BRI Wealth Management, labeled AstraZeneca's rumored listing considerations as "disappointing" for the U.K. equity market — but he conceded that "it is not surprising" given that it would form the latest development in a wider established trend.

Earlier this year, reports emerged that Chinese fast fashion giant Shein was looking to list in Hong Kong instead of London, when it goes public. Last week, news agency Reuters reported that the company was planning to file confidentially for a Hong Kong IPO.

Metals investor Cobalt Holdings, meanwhile, confirmed to CNBC last month that it had scrapped plans for a London IPO, while British fintech giant Wise announced in June that it was moving its primary listing from London to New York.

Kristo Kaarmann, Wise's CEO and co-founder, said in a statement at the time that the move would help raise awareness of the company in the U.S., while giving the firm better access to "the world's deepest and most liquid capital market."

Companies listed in London have historically had much lower valuations than their Wall Street counterparts. Research from British investment manager Rathbones last year showed that the forward price-to-earnings ratio for U.K. stocks was 32% lower than those listed in the U.S. on a like-for-like basis.

On the flipside, the Financial Times reported last week that Norwegian software giant Visma had chosen London for its upcoming debut on the public market.

"Large and important companies like AstraZeneca are seeking a valuation uplift from exposure to a wider investor base and they will get that from moving to a US listing," BRI's Meadows told CNBC via email on Wednesday.

"The trend to move listing, or the stream of takeovers for UK listed stocks, highlights value in the UK equity market, but it does nothing to encourage a new supply of companies listing here to support the future standing of the index in a Global context," Meadows added.

Claire Trachet, founder of M&A advisory Trachet, said AstraZeneca shifting its listing to New York would represent "a memorable loss" for the London Stock Exchange.

"Given the complexity of the company, this isn't simply because of liquidity or valuation advantages often cited by departing firms, rather a trifecta of underperforming capital markets, regulatory constraints, and misaligned incentives that make it harder to scale and reward innovation at home," she told CNBC by email.

Trachet added that London-listed companies with a combined value in excess of $100 billion had already made the move to New York in recent years — and AstraZeneca's departure alone would more than double that figure.

"The potential move makes it painfully clear to global markets that the UK is losing its edge on the needs of world-class, scale-driven companies," she said. "This isn't an isolated story — and that's the biggest issue. It's part of a broader shift, where founders and boards are increasingly looking to the US for deeper capital, stronger support, and a more ambitious investor base."

Tom Bacon, a London-based partner at global law firm BCLP — which has a division dedicated to M&A and corporate finance — labeled reports of AstraZeneca's Soriot's desire to shift away from London "very worrying."

"I think this should sound the alarm for the UK government that they need to do more both to support the city and our stock market together with our critical industries like life sciences and pharmaceuticals," he said.

Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, on Wednesday said that AstraZeneca's reported plans appeared to be driven by business needs rather than chasing a higher valuation — but he added that moving the company's listing across the Atlantic "won't be an easy move to pull off."

"Unlike many other UK market 'defectors' with a dominant US shareholder base like CRH and Flutter, AstraZeneca has a more geographically diverse pool of investors," he explained in an email.  

However, Coatsworth noted that AstraZeneca generates around 42% of its sales from the U.S., and already has plans to increase its operational footprint in the country.

Earlier this year, CEO Soriot told CNBC AstraZeneca was "very committed to the United States," where the company has two large research and development centers.

AJ Bell's Coatsworth told CNBC that AstraZeneca's CEO could also see a full U.S. stock listing as a "stepping stone to receiving better treatment Stateside."

European pharmaceutical companies are facing uncertainty around their future in the American market, where U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose sector-specific tariffs on drug imports.

While the industry was exempted from Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs plans when they were unveiled in April, the White House leader has since placed the sector under investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department, warned tariffs on pharma are "coming soon," and signed an executive order directing medicine manufacturers to lower the price of some drugs in line with costs paid overseas.

Amazon announced Monday its millionth worker robot, and said its entire fleet will be powered by a newly launched generative artificial intelligence model. The move comes at a time when more tech companies are cutting jobs and warning of automation.

The million robot milestone — which joins Amazon's global network of more than 300 facilities — strengthens the company's position as the world's largest manufacturer and operator of mobile robotics, Scott Dresser, vice president of Amazon Robotics, said in a press release. 

Meanwhile, Dresser said that its new "DeepFleet" AI model will coordinate the movement of its robots within its fulfillment centers, reducing the travel time of the fleet by 10% and enabling faster and more cost-effective package deliveries.

Amazon began deploying robots in its facilities in 2012 to move inventory shelves across warehouse floors, according to Dresser. Since then, their roles in factories have grown tremendously, ranging from those able to lift up to 1,250 pounds of inventory to fully autonomous robots that navigate factories with carts of customer orders.

Meanwhile, AI-powered humanoid robots — designed to mimic human movement and shape — could be deployed this year at factories owned by Tesla.

But although advancements in AI robotics like those working in Amazon facilities come with the promise of productivity gains, they have also raised concerns about mass job loss.

A Pew Research survey published in March found that both AI experts and the general public see factory workers as one of the groups most at risk of losing their jobs because of AI.

That's a concern Dresser appeared to attempt to address in his statements. 

"These robots work alongside our employees, handling heavy lifting and repetitive tasks while creating new opportunities for our front-line operators to develop technical skills," Dresser said. He added that Amazon's "next-generation fulfillment center" in Shreveport, Louisiana, which was launched late last year, required 30% more employees in reliability, maintenance and engineering roles. 

However, the news of Amazon's robot expansion came soon after CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC that Amazon's rapid rollout of generative AI will result in "fewer people doing some of the jobs that the technology actually starts to automate."

Jassy said that even as AI eliminates jobs in certain areas, Amazon will continue to hire more employees in AI, robotics and elsewhere. But in a memo to employees earlier in June, the CEO had admitted that he expects the company's workforce to shrink in the coming years in light of technological advancements. 

The decline may have already begun. CNBC reported that Amazon cut more than 27,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023, and had continued to make more targeted cuts across business units. 

Other big tech CEOs such as Shopify's CEO Tobi Lutke also recently warned of the impact that AI will have on staffing. That comes as a vast array of firms investing in and adopting AI execute rounds of layoffs. 

According to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks technology industry layoffs, 551 companies laid off roughly 153,000 employees last year. And a World Economic Forum report in February found that 48% of U.S. employers plan to reduce their workforce due to AI.

In one move, Santander has silenced months of speculation over it's allegiance to the British high street – and complicated a year-long consolidation saga in Spain's banking sector.

On Tuesday, Spain's largest lender said it agreed to buy British high street lender TSB for £2.65 billion ($3.6 billion) from Catalonia's Sabadell in an all-cash deal subject to approval. The transaction will generate a return on invested capital of more than 20%, bringing its return on tangible equity in the U.K. from 11% last year to 16% by 2028, Santander said.

Acquisitions have been at the heart of Santander's British expansion after it entered the market in 2004 through the purchase of Abbey National. But the profitability of the U.K. branch has faltered — with pre-tax profit down by an annual 38% last year — sparking questions over Santander's long-term presence in Britain. A March announcement of potential layoffs and 95 branch closures did little to abate the rumors despite CEO Ana Botin's frequent denials.

"We never thought of leaving the U.K. The U.K. is very important for us," Santander Chief Financial Officer Jose Garcia Cantera told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Wednesday. "It's actually the largest balance sheet of all the countries [where] we operate. It's a high quality, low-risk business, predictable returns, in hard currency, in sterling, and this helps to stabilize our risk-return profile." 

He added that the U.K. has "always been a very important and core component of Santander's diversification strategy."

The TSB acquisition, meanwhile, "not only makes sense strategically, as I said, the U.K. helps with our risk-return profile, but it's also financially very, very compelling."

The deal could work as a defensive play from Sabadell, which only took over TSB from Lloyds in 2015 and seeks to stop a takeover bid from Spanish peer BBVA. The two banks have been locked at odds since Sabadell rejected BBVA's initial all-share merger offer in May last year, on grounds of it undervaluing the acquisition target.

Now entrenched in a potential 14-billion-euro hostile takeover, BBVA has decided to keep its bid alive despite a recent condition from the Spanish government that the takeover may only proceed if the two banks do not integrate their operations for at least three years.

Over this period, "both entities maintain [must] separate judicial identity and assets, as well as autonomy in the management of their activities," Spanish Economist Minister Carlos Cuerpo said during a press briefing, according to a CNBC translation.

Madrid — whose government under Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez depends on parties in Sabadell's home base of Catalonia — has long opposed the deal amid concerns over job losses, received a late-May caution from the European Commission against hindering the merger unduly.

"It is important that banking sector consolidation can take place without undue or inappropriate obstacles being imposed," said Olof Gill, the European Commission's spokesperson for financial services, according to Reuters. Spain's antitrust watchdog has already cleared the acquisition. 

It remains to be seen whether the TSB sale will dull BBVA Chairman Carlos Torres Vila's appetite to press ahead with submitting a merger offer to Sabadell shareholders once permissions come through.

RBC analysts on Wednesday assessed that Santander's acquisition of TSB "seems to be a last major effort to convince [Sabadell]'s shareholders to not accept BBVA's offer during the upcoming take-up period" and would "likely further complicate" BBVA's takeover.

"We are completely neutral on the Sabadell-BBVA transaction," Santander's Garcia Cantera told CNBC. "This is an asset that becomes available in one of the countries where we operate, and it's our fiduciary duty to look at all these opportunities and try to do our best for our shareholders."

Yet he recognized that competition in Spanish banking at present is "probably the toughest in Europe," citing the weak price of domestic mortgages.

"I don't think this is going to make banking in Spain more comfortable. Probably the opposite," Garcia Cantera said.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

Life in China these days is a story of stark contrasts.

If in one conversation, my counterparts are wringing their hands over a sluggish economy, the next reveals how quickly artificial intelligence is revamping industries.

Case in point: Chinese smartphone company Honor told CNBC its newest foldable set for release Wednesday will be the thinnest phone on the market to date at just 8.8 millimeters when folded — undercutting even the rumored thickness for Samsung's forthcoming foldable — thanks largely to its AI manufacturing tools.

Honor said it found the optimal combination of slimness and strength by using its "1-billion parameter AI industrial model" to simulate more than 125,000 options for device assembly. The company said AI-powered 3D scanning allowed it to achieve precision control of 0.003 millimeters, or about 1/20th of a human hair.

In all, that's a 1.1-millimeter slice off its first foldable launched in July 2023, when Honor made waves in the smartphone market with a device that folded up to be nearly as thin as an iPhone.

But it was also two summers ago when I recall that much of the post-Covid economic excitement was fading in China.

Conversations shifted from celebrating the end of lockdowns to bemoaning lackluster consumption. The pessimism also created a domestic market challenge for Honor's foldables, which typically start at the equivalent of over $1,000 each.

Looking back, Honor is not the only major Chinese company to have made strides over the last two years. Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi has launched two electric cars to directly compete with Tesla. DeepSeek was officially registered as a company in July 2023, according to records, before launching its breakthrough AI model in January this year.

AI's pervasiveness has also started to penetrate the "less flashy" parts of China's economy.

In July 2023, Huawei launched a dedicated AI model for commercial mining with mining company Yunding Technology and state-owned Shandong Energy Group. The model, based on its foundational "Pangu" model, allowed workers to operate mine equipment remotely from an office and develop other tech solutions more quickly.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the AI tech has been integrated in more than 100 mines, according to Huawei's annual report released in March. In May, the company's client in Inner Mongolia launched 100 self-driving electric trucks for a local coal mine.

Huawei last month revealed a new, 5.5 version of its Pangu foundation model, and on Monday, released an open source version for developers.

Foreign companies are also spurring technological innovation on the mainland, such as German industrial giant Siemens.

Out of 18 AI-integration related products Siemens just launched, 16 were developed in China in just nine months, Peter Koerte, the company's chief technology officer and chief strategy officer, said last week during the World Economic Forum conference in Tianjin. He described applications such as AI-powered energy savings systems for buildings.

These technological breakthroughs are the result of years or months of painstaking development, but it's only more recently that businesses are reaping the rewards.

"AI is transforming from isolated technological innovation into something that is core or embedded in the whole business process," Janet Tang, Hong Kong-based partner and managing director at AlixPartners, told me last week on the sidelines of the conference in Tianjin.

She stated that the significant integration of AI with business operations began roughly 12 months ago, following extensive trial and error over the past few years.

While China's biggest cities are yet to see a return to the pre-Covid boom days, there are signs that the rapid urban growth has instead spread to smaller cities and even rural areas.

Malipo, a Yunnan county once so poor it has received targeted assistance from the foreign ministry, started revamping its "Tianbao" land trading port on the border with Vietnam in 2023. The county even courted Hong Kong's Sunwah Group to invest 50 million yuan to open a tea processing plant in the same year.

The port has since seen a surge in durian trade, while plans are underway to open a tourist attraction with Sunwah in the county, allowing visitors to see tea trees that county head Xiao Changju claims are several hundred years old. She was speaking to reporters during a state-organized trip to the region in May.

Augmented reality glasses startup Xreal invested in its own factory in the southeastern "tier 2" city of Wuxi and earlier this year announced a new glasses product running Google's XR operating system.

The company is also moving its headquarters from Beijing to Shanghai this summer to be closer to its specialized factories in Wuxi that make optical parts and other components, CEO and founder Chi Xu told me on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's event in Tianjin last week.

Xu hopes that his products can reach consumers by the end of this year, while noting the U.S. remains the top market for Xreal.

"I'm always impressed by the level of energy, hardworking and openness of the enterprises here in China," AlixPartners' Tang said. Despite protectionism or other challenges, "everyone is still so motivated, so eager to learn new things and to connect with the rest of the world."

Grant Pan, Group CFO of Noah Holdings, said that investors are looking to diversify their assets away from just the U.S. and China markets.

Tolga Oncu, COO of Ingka Group, which manages IKEA, discussed the competition and opportunities he sees in China, especially in the 'silver' economy.

Aditi Rasquinha, CEO of DHL Global Forwarding Greater China, stated that the region's export growth has remained resilient despite a slowdown in U.S.-China trade.

Mixed signals on growth. The official purchasing managers' index for June showed a third-straight month of contraction in manufacturing, while one from Caixin and S&P Global unexpectedly rebounded into expansionary territory.

U.S. and China inch closer to a trade truce. The two sides signaled last week that they are making progress on conditional agreements to resume some exchanges of rare earths and advanced technology.

Xiaomi snags more than 200,000 EV orders in minutes. The Chinese smartphone company announced the pre-order figures shortly after it revealed Thursday that the YU7 SUV will sell for less than Tesla's Model Y. Xpeng announced it had in June delivered more than 30,000 vehicles for an eighth-straight month.

Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks inched higher amid mixed trading in the region, as investors digested the latest comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

The CSI 300 index, which tracks the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, closed flat at 3,943.68, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes major Chinese companies — gained 0.62%. The mainland benchmark is up 0.22% year to date, data from LSEG showed.

In this article

It's the what-could-have-beens that hurt the most. The childhood sweetheart who moved to a different country. The early opportunity to invest in a company designing graphics chips for games. The lower interest rates if not for tariffs.

On Tuesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that tariffs — and, specifically, their unexpectedly large "size" — are the chief reason the central bank hasn't lowered rates this year since it last cut them in December.

Imagine that. We could have been living in a world where the fed funds rate is at a range of 4% to 4.25%. If inflation was staying obediently below the Fed's 2% goal, the range could even be 3.75% to 4%, given that the central bank in June kept last year's projection of two rate cuts in 2025.

The thought stings. But it might help to think that if U.S. President Donald Trump hadn't slapped tariffs on partners and penguins, his other policies could have similarly pushed inflation forecasts higher.

Remember how all three major U.S. indexes surged and hit new records on Trump's election victory because Wall Street was anticipating tax cuts and looser corporate regulation. Without the dampening effect of tariffs, economic optimism might have spilled over into exuberance and higher inflation.

Better to play the cards we were dealt with than to lapse into imagined futures.

Tariffs are keeping U.S. interest rates high. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday the central bank would have lowered rates this year if not for Trump's tariffs, which caused inflation forecasts to go up "materially."

The S&P 500 dips from record. On Tuesday, the index slipped 0.11%. Tesla shares tumbled after Trump suggested DOGE take a look at the company's subsidies. Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Wednesday, but Singapore stocks hit a record high.

XPeng maintains steady sales in June. The electric car startup delivered 34,611 cars, the eighth straight month of breaking the 30,000 level. BYD remained the market leader, delivering more than 10 times the number of vehicles XPeng did.

Trump's megabill squeaks through the Senate. Vice President JD Vance cast a final, tie-breaking vote that sends the bill back to the U.S. House for approval. While the bill would increase the deficit, some banks think it'll give the U.S. economy a shot in the arm.

[PRO] Hedge funds are betting against the Swiss franc. The move is part of a "carry trade," a strategy in which investors borrow in a currency with a lower interest rate — the franc, in this case — to buy a currency with a higher rate and pocket the difference.

Germany's defense industry is booming. Here's where its weapons are going

The value of German military exports hit 13.2 billion euros ($15.5 billion) last year, according to preliminary figures — more than double 2020′s 5.82 billion euros. Related stocks have also boomed.

Where are the record orders going?

According to the German government's most recent export log, 80% of arms exports were to "close partner countries" in the first quarter of 2025.

Ukraine's intelligence directorate (GUR) has released footage of Kyiv's UJ-26 "Bober" drone being launched via catapult to attack Russian air defenses.

The video, published on Tuesday, shows the locally manufactured 8-foot-long loitering munition being slung into the air from a fixed ramp. GUR said its special forces launched the drones to attack targets in Russian-occupied Crimea.

The new launch method allows the fixed-wing Bober to enter combat without landing gear, which would likely improve its range or maneuverability. Traditionally, the Bobers take off from airstrips like traditional aircraft.

Given that the ramp would likely have to be set up in Ukrainian-held territory west of the Dnieper River, the drone would have to travel a minimum of roughly 60 miles to reach Russian targets in Crimea.

The drones also seem to be equipped with thermal cameras in several first-person view clips uploaded by the defense intelligence agency.

One montage appears to show a drone evading a missile and then flying into a $15 million Pantsir S-1 point air defense system. A second drone is also shown flying into the ground next to a Pantsir S-1 as the vehicle crew scrambles for cover.

GUR described the attack as the "successful defeat" of the Pantsir, but did not show footage of the results.

The intelligence agency also said it conducted similar successful attacks on three Russian radar systems — The Niobium-SV, the Pechora-3, and the Provotnik GE — as well as a fourth-generation Su-30 fighter.

It uploaded several first-person view clips of drones approaching these systems with thermal cameras, though many of them can only be seen flying close to their target.

Business Insider could not independently verify the damage caused.

Ukrainian media regularly describe the Niobium-SV as a $100 million system. Earlier Russian estimates from before the full-scale invasion indicated that the Kremlin was acquiring the Niobium-SV in 2016 for about $40 million per unit. However, these may have since been fitted with more expensive upgrades.

Meanwhile, one Bober, which translates to "beaver" in Ukrainian, reportedly costs around $110,000 to manufacture. The propeller drone is meant for long-range attacks and is known to carry the KZ-6 charge, a 6.6-pound demolition explosive designed to break through concrete or armor.

It's yet another example of how the war has increasingly featured cheaper systems being used to attack and, at times, destroy expensive high-end equipment, posing difficult questions for the traditional defense procurement model that heavily prioritized advanced technology.

For example, one of Ukraine's biggest community drone funds, run by activist Serhii Sternenko, reported to donors that its crowdfunded drones have damaged at least 11 Buk surface-to-air missile systems in 2025. The fund often publishes footage of such strikes.

Depending on whether they have the latest upgrades, these defenses can cost Russia between $10 and $100 million each. By comparison, Sternenko's fund said it receives roughly $6 million in donations a month for its entire budget.

The latest version of U.S. President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" could make it cheaper for semiconductor manufacturers to build plants in the U.S. as Washington continues its efforts to strengthen its domestic chip supply chain.

Under the bill, passed by the Senate Tuesday, tax credits for those semiconductor firms would rise to 35% from 25%. That's more than the 30% increase that had made it into a draft version of the bill. 

Companies eligible for the credits could include chipmakers such as Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Micron Technology, provided that they expand their advanced manufacturing in the U.S. ahead of a 2026 deadline. 

The new provisions expand on tax incentives under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which provided grants of $39 billion and loans of $75 billion for U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing projects. 

But before the expanded credits come into play, Trump's sweeping domestic policy package will have to be passed again in the House, which narrowly passed its own version last month. The president has urged lawmakers to get the bill passed by July 4.

Since Trump's first term, Washington has been trying to onshore more of the advanced semiconductor supply chain from Asia, support its domestic players and limit China's capabilities. 

Although tax provisions in Trump's sweeping policy bill expand on those in the Biden administration's CHIPS Act, his overall approach to the semiconductor industry has been different.

Earlier this year, the president even called for a repeal of the CHIPS Act, though Republican lawmakers have been reluctant to act on that front. Still, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month that the administration was renegotiating some of the Biden administration's grants.

Trump has previously stated that tariffs, as opposed to the CHIPS Act grants, would be the best method of onshoring semiconductor production. The Trump administration is currently conducting an investigation into imports of semiconductor technology, which could result in new duties on the industry.

In recent months, a number of chipmakers with projects in the U.S. have ramped up planned investments there. That includes the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, as well as American chip companies such as Nvidia, Micron and GlobalFoundries.  

According to Daniel Newman, CEO at tech advisory firm Futurum Group, the threat of Trump's tariffs has created more urgency for semiconductor companies to expand U.S. capacity. If the increased investment tax credits come into law, those onshoring efforts are only expected to accelerate, he told CNBC. 

"Given the risk of tariffs, increasing manufacturing in the U.S. remains a key consideration for these large semiconductor companies," Newman said, adding that the tax credits could be seen as an opportunity to offset certain costs related to U.S.-based projects.

TikTok and ByteDance employees are bracing for possible layoffs after the company informed staff it would announce "organizational and personnel changes" early Wednesday morning, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.

The changes would impact workers in the company's global e-commerce business, TikTok Shop, which has had several rounds of layoffs this year.

"Over the past month, we have assessed how we can best support our evolving Global E-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals in the market," the company wrote in the memo.

These changes come from "careful analysis of how to create more efficient operating models for the team's long-term growth," the company wrote.

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

TikTok's US e-commerce team has been under scrutiny from leadership at its parent company, ByteDance, this year. The division's top executive told staff in a February all-hands call that the country failed to meet its performance goals in 2024. The division has faced new obstacles in 2025 after Trump hiked tariffs on China, where many of TikTok's global sellers are based. Weekly US order volume fell in mid-May compared to mid-April after tariffs went into effect, BI previously reported.

The company has trimmed staff this year through a mix of layoffs and performance reviews, during which TikTok has offered some people a choice between performance-improvement plans or exits with severance. As US team members have left the company, leaders from China and Singapore with experience on TikTok's Chinese sister app, Douyin, have taken their place, staffers previously told BI.

The organizational changes come amid broader uncertainty for TikTok's US team members. The company is negotiating with the Trump administration over a 2024 law that required ByteDance to divest from TikTok's US assets or face a potential ban. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive orders amid discussions.

The uncertainty is taking its toll on one staffer who received the message Tuesday evening that their team would be impacted by the organizational changes. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak about the company, and their identity is known to BI.

"I think for many of us, we just want clarity," the employee said. "These eternal extensions make no sense for anyone who works here. How can we plan our jobs and lives if every 90 days we might get banned or sold?"

 Traders say Bitcoin will benefit from the proposed $5 trillion increase to the US debt ceiling, but data could suggest otherwise. 

Key takeaways:

Historical data fail to show a consistent link between Bitcoin price gains and US debt ceiling increases.

Bitcoin's resilience reflects investors' belief that the US dollar will continue to lose value due to US domestic fiscal policy. 

United States Senators successfully advanced President Trump's ‘One Big Beautiful Bill' on Tuesday, moving it one step closer to becoming law. The proposed $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling has stirred significant controversy, and many Bitcoin (BTC) advocates believe the move could be a catalyst for a new all-time high in 2025.

Although several solid analyses point to a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, past US debt ceiling increases and suspensions have generally led to bearish outcomes, at least in the six months that followed. In fact, the June 2023 event stands as the only instance where BTC posted gains afterward.

Some might argue that markets price in these developments in advance. However, that assumption weakens when looking at Bitcoin's flat performance. On Tuesday, Bitcoin held steady at $105,000, the same level as five months earlier.

Bitcoin's resilience occurred despite widespread expectations that the Trump administration would push through the debt ceiling increase. At that time, economists projected the government would run out of funds by mid-August.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposed legislation will add at least $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. The nearly 900-page bill passed in the Senate by a one-vote margin and now returns to the US House of Representatives.

Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, criticized US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's claims that the bill represents a step toward “controlling the US debt.”

According to Henrich, raising the debt ceiling while “running record deficits” and lowering interest rates aligns with “modern monetary theory”—an approach suggesting that governments can fund expenditures by creating money, rather than through taxes or borrowing.

Rather than focusing solely on lawmakers' decisions, attention should turn to how the central bank will respond. If the US Federal Reserve maintains higher interest rates, debt servicing costs rise. On the other hand, a shift toward looser monetary policy could undermine the US dollar's strength.

Generally speaking, higher US Treasury yields reflect reduced investor confidence, as buyers demand greater compensation for perceived risks. Historically, this indicator has shown a positive correlation with Bitcoin's price, meaning both tend to rise together, given the cryptocurrency's appeal as an alternative asset.

Therefore, Bitcoin holding above $105,000 while the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.25% from 4.50% on June 6 suggests early signs of a decoupling. Even so, it remains too early to declare Bitcoin a proven reserve asset, particularly as both gold and the S&P 500 approach their own all-time highs.

In effect, broader markets appear to be pricing in a weaker US dollar, as evidenced by capital flowing into assets that traditionally benefit from currency debasement, such as equities, commodities, and Bitcoin itself.

According to “The Kobeissi Letter,” the dollar's devaluation comes as investors react to tariffs, the US deficit spending crisis, and pressure on the Fed to cut rates.” 

Ultimately, while the debt ceiling increase may coincide with a Bitcoin rally above $110,000, historical patterns do not support a direct causal link between these events.

The crypto market is serving up a classic rotation play as meme coins steal the spotlight from their blue chip cousins.

Global crypto markets posted gains alongside traditional equities following geopolitical easing, with overall market sentiment shifting from fear to greed. Traditional markets are providing strong tailwinds—the S&P 500 inched higher to a fresh record this week, breaking above the psychologically important 6,000 level for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the geopolitical picture has improved dramatically as oil prices fell sharply Tuesday, returning to levels last seen before the Iran-Israel conflict, with Brent crude dropping 6% to $67.14.

As investors feel calm in the markets, and consider putting money on riskier bets, the cryptocurrency market as a whole grew 2.5% today to $3.33 trillion, with 98 of the top 100 coins in the green for the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin's modest 3.59% gain to $109,507 masks the underlying strength in the world's largest cryptocurrency, supported by a bounce after two days of correction, testing the resistance of a bearish channel in play since mid-May. The price action reflects healthy consolidation after the recent surge, giving the market time to digest gains.

Technical indicators paint a cautiously optimistic picture. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Bitcoin is at 60, suggesting BTC has momentum but isn't overheated. You can think of RSI like a temperature gauge where 70+ means the engine is running too hot and might need to cool down. This moderate reading suggests there's enough fuel in the markets for another leg higher.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, provides crucial support below current prices, acting as a safety net that institutions often use to add positions. This indicator measures the average price of an asset for a given period of time. The 200-day EMA sits further below, creating multiple layers of support that would need to break for any serious correction.

However, the Average Directional Index, or ADX, at 12 indicates weak trend strength, which is to be expected considering this small correction happens in the middle of what is a heavily bullish trend in play since at least before the last halving. ADX measures the strength of a trend, regardless of direction.

Key levels: Immediate support at $104,000 (psychological round number), strong support at $96,000 (200-day EMA). Immediate resistance at $112,000 (recent rejection zone), strong resistance at $115,000 (measured breakout target and new ATH zone).

Ethereum's 3.16% rise to $2,559 shows the smart-contract blockchain king refusing to go down without a fight, even as technical indicators flash warning signs. The network scored a major adoption win as Robinhood's deployment of 213 tokenized stock contracts on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 network, signals growing enterprise adoption, proving that real-world utility continues expanding despite price struggles.

The technical setup presents challenges that traders need to navigate carefully. The RSI at 54 sits right in the middle of its range—neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a market in equilibrium waiting for a catalyst. This neutral reading often precedes sharp moves once the market picks a direction. The ADX at 11 shows essentially no trend.

The elephant in the room is the bearish EMA configuration: the 50-day EMA currently trades above the 200-day EMA, still in bearish configuration. But the gap between those two price zones is very, very small, showing markets are basically trading sideways, with traders opening and closing positions with little margin.

The Squeeze Momentum Indicator confirms volatility is compressed, suggesting a significant move is imminent. With institutional adoption accelerating, the bias leans bullish, but a strong bullish breakout is needed in order to wake up the markets. During compression phases, it is easy to predict that a major movement will happen—but whether it is bullish or bearish is not always clear.

Key levels: Immediate support at $2,400 (round number psychology), strong support at $2,200 (previous accumulation zone). Immediate resistance at $2,600 (50-day EMA rejection zone), strong resistance at $2,800 (breakout target).

But enough about boring ol' Bitcoin and Ethereum: Welcome to the fun meme coin madness of the day.

Underdog meme coin SPX6900 just won't quit. The token's explosive 12% surge to $1.27 represents a textbook oversold bounce that's catching traders by surprise, being the best performing cryptocurrency in the entire top 100 coins by market cap.

The meme coin crashed 10% on July 1 due to aggressive shorting, creating a perfect storm for contrarian buyers. Smart money didn't waste time: on-chain data shows a greater number of net inflows to private wallets, suggesting whales accumulated at lower prices.

The technical picture is still bullish. The RSI for SPX6900 sits at 52, showing plenty of room to run higher without hitting exhaustion levels that typically trigger profit-taking. The ADX at 23 is approaching the critical 25 level, and is a good sign for traders considering the meme coin is set to break out of a triangle pattern that could be decisive for its longer term future.

The 50-day EMA at $1.10 now acts as a floor. When price stays above the 50-day EMA, it signals short-term bulls are in control. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows compression is "on," meaning volatility has tightened like a coiled spring and it could be potentially bullish if all the other indicators remain valid.

Key levels: Immediate support at $1.08-$1.17 (bounce zone), strong support at $0.92 (previous breakdown level). Immediate resistance at $1.40-1.50 (support/resistance wicks during June), strong resistance at $1.70 (June highs).

The crypto market is serving up a classic rotation play as meme coins steal the spotlight from their blue chip cousins.

Global crypto markets posted gains alongside traditional equities following geopolitical easing, with overall market sentiment shifting from fear to greed. Traditional markets are providing strong tailwinds—the S&P 500 inched higher to a fresh record this week, breaking above the psychologically important 6,000 level for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the geopolitical picture has improved dramatically as oil prices fell sharply Tuesday, returning to levels last seen before the Iran-Israel conflict, with Brent crude dropping 6% to $67.14.

As investors feel calm in the markets, and consider putting money on riskier bets, the cryptocurrency market as a whole grew 2.5% today to $3.33 trillion, with 98 of the top 100 coins in the green for the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin's modest 3.59% gain to $109,507 masks the underlying strength in the world's largest cryptocurrency, supported by a bounce after two days of correction, testing the resistance of a bearish channel in play since mid-May. The price action reflects healthy consolidation after the recent surge, giving the market time to digest gains.

Technical indicators paint a cautiously optimistic picture. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Bitcoin is at 60, suggesting BTC has momentum but isn't overheated. You can think of RSI like a temperature gauge where 70+ means the engine is running too hot and might need to cool down. This moderate reading suggests there's enough fuel in the markets for another leg higher.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, provides crucial support below current prices, acting as a safety net that institutions often use to add positions. This indicator measures the average price of an asset for a given period of time. The 200-day EMA sits further below, creating multiple layers of support that would need to break for any serious correction.

However, the Average Directional Index, or ADX, at 12 indicates weak trend strength, which is to be expected considering this small correction happens in the middle of what is a heavily bullish trend in play since at least before the last halving. ADX measures the strength of a trend, regardless of direction.

Key levels: Immediate support at $104,000 (psychological round number), strong support at $96,000 (200-day EMA). Immediate resistance at $112,000 (recent rejection zone), strong resistance at $115,000 (measured breakout target and new ATH zone).

Ethereum's 3.16% rise to $2,559 shows the smart-contract blockchain king refusing to go down without a fight, even as technical indicators flash warning signs. The network scored a major adoption win as Robinhood's deployment of 213 tokenized stock contracts on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 network, signals growing enterprise adoption, proving that real-world utility continues expanding despite price struggles.

The technical setup presents challenges that traders need to navigate carefully. The RSI at 54 sits right in the middle of its range—neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a market in equilibrium waiting for a catalyst. This neutral reading often precedes sharp moves once the market picks a direction. The ADX at 11 shows essentially no trend.

The elephant in the room is the bearish EMA configuration: the 50-day EMA currently trades above the 200-day EMA, still in bearish configuration. But the gap between those two price zones is very, very small, showing markets are basically trading sideways, with traders opening and closing positions with little margin.

The Squeeze Momentum Indicator confirms volatility is compressed, suggesting a significant move is imminent. With institutional adoption accelerating, the bias leans bullish, but a strong bullish breakout is needed in order to wake up the markets. During compression phases, it is easy to predict that a major movement will happen—but whether it is bullish or bearish is not always clear.

Key levels: Immediate support at $2,400 (round number psychology), strong support at $2,200 (previous accumulation zone). Immediate resistance at $2,600 (50-day EMA rejection zone), strong resistance at $2,800 (breakout target).

But enough about boring ol' Bitcoin and Ethereum: Welcome to the fun meme coin madness of the day.

Underdog meme coin SPX6900 just won't quit. The token's explosive 12% surge to $1.27 represents a textbook oversold bounce that's catching traders by surprise, being the best performing cryptocurrency in the entire top 100 coins by market cap.

The meme coin crashed 10% on July 1 due to aggressive shorting, creating a perfect storm for contrarian buyers. Smart money didn't waste time: on-chain data shows a greater number of net inflows to private wallets, suggesting whales accumulated at lower prices.

The technical picture is still bullish. The RSI for SPX6900 sits at 52, showing plenty of room to run higher without hitting exhaustion levels that typically trigger profit-taking. The ADX at 23 is approaching the critical 25 level, and is a good sign for traders considering the meme coin is set to break out of a triangle pattern that could be decisive for its longer term future.

The 50-day EMA at $1.10 now acts as a floor. When price stays above the 50-day EMA, it signals short-term bulls are in control. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows compression is "on," meaning volatility has tightened like a coiled spring and it could be potentially bullish if all the other indicators remain valid.

Key levels: Immediate support at $1.08-$1.17 (bounce zone), strong support at $0.92 (previous breakdown level). Immediate resistance at $1.40-1.50 (support/resistance wicks during June), strong resistance at $1.70 (June highs).

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is now generating more revenue than one of the asset manager's most iconic products, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Bloomberg data.



Despite having just $52 billion in AUM — a fraction of IVV's $624 billion in total assets — IBIT's higher fee structure has turned it into a bigger moneymaker for the world's largest asset manager. Bloomberg estimates that IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee.



By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. That means it generates around $187.1 million in annual fees, despite managing roughly nine times more in assets than IBIT.



IBIT launched in January 2024 as part of a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs approved by U.S. regulators. Since then, the fund has seen inflows every month except one, amassing $52 billion in assets to date. That makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market by a wide margin.



The rapid growth of IBIT highlights the ongoing demand for regulated bitcoin investment products, particularly those offered by established financial firms like BlackRock. For investors, the appeal lies in gaining exposure to bitcoin without the technical hurdles or security risks of holding the asset directly.



While IBIT's management fee is higher than more traditional ETFs, it reflects the added complexity, custody and regulatory requirements involved in offering exposure to a digital asset like bitcoin.

 Bitcoin's bullish outlook strengthens as the US dollar drops 10.8% in its worst H1 performance since 1973. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin could target $170K as global M2 money supply hits a record $55.48 trillion.

BTC price historically lags M2 breakouts, with past patterns suggesting imminent upside.

A weakening US dollar adds fuel for BTC bulls, with DXY down 10.8% in H1 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC) could be on track to reach $170,000 as global liquidity, measured by broad money supply (M2), hits a new record high of $55.48 trillion on July 2.

M2 aggregates US dollar-adjusted liquidity from the US, eurozone, Japan, the UK and Canada. 

When M2 rises, it indicates that more money is circulating in the economy, including in bank accounts, checking deposits, and other liquid assets. Such surplus liquidity can increase capital flowing into “riskier assets” like crypto.

Bitcoin has historically followed global and US M2 supply with a three- to six-month lag, especially during liquidity shifts. In some cases, like the April 2025 breakout above $100,000, the lag was just one to two weeks.

While BTC has rallied during low M2 growth, such moves often prove unsustainable.

In contrast, M2-driven rallies tend to produce longer, more stable uptrends, suggesting the current cycle may be supported by real liquidity, not speculation.

“As global money supply expands, Bitcoin's next target sits around ~$170K, following the flow,” says analyst Crypto Auris.

Multiple analysts have predicted the BTC price to reach the $150,000-$200,000 range by the 2025's end, owing to rising institutional demand via ETFs and corporations.

The growing demand for Bitcoin appears against a weakening US dollar.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen 10.8% in the first half of 2025, its worst H1 performance since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. 

In contrast, Bitcoin gained 13.25% in the same period, reflecting a negative correlation with the dollar. 

Historically, major divergences between Bitcoin and the dollar have signaled key trend reversals. 

In April 2018 and March 2022, rising DXY and falling BTC preceded bear markets, while the divergence in November 2020 marked the start of a major rally.

In the current cycle, BTC and DXY have moved almost in lockstep until early 2024. A clear divergence began in April 2025, as DXY fell below 100 for the first time in two years.

If past patterns repeat, this could mark the beginning of a new Bitcoin uptrend. Prolonged dollar weakness could amplify this move beyond Bitcoin's typical cycle behavior.

When M2 rises, it indicates that more money is circulating in the economy, including in bank accounts, checking deposits, and other liquid assets. Such surplus liquidity can increase capital flowing into “riskier assets” like crypto.

Bitcoin has historically followed global and US M2 supply with a 3–6 month lag, especially during liquidity shifts. In some cases, like the April 2025 breakout above $100,000, the lag was just 1–2 weeks.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Stocks tied to the price of ether, better known as ETH, were higher on Wednesday, reflecting renewed enthusiasm for the crypto asset amid a surge of interest in stablecoins and tokenization.

BitMine Immersion Technologies, a bitcoin miner that announced plans this week to make ETH its primary treasury reserve asset, jumped about 20%. It's gained more than 1,000% since the announcement. Betting platform SharpLink Gaming, which has also initiated an ETH treasury strategy, added more than 11%. Bit Digital, which last week exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans, jumped more than 6%.

"We're finally at the point where real use cases are emerging, and stablecoins have been the first version of that at scale but they're going to open the door to a much bigger story around tokenizing other assets and using digital assets in new ways," Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens.

On Tuesday, as bitcoin ETFs snapped a 15-day streak of inflows, ether ETFs saw $40 million in inflows led by BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust. ETH ETFs came back to life in June after much concern that they were becoming zombie funds.

The price of the coin itself was last higher by 5%, according to Coin Metrics, though it's still down 24% this year.

Ethereum has been struggling with an identity crisis fueled by uncertainty about the network's value proposition, weaker revenue since its last big technical upgrade and increasing competition from Solana. Market volatility, driven by geopolitical uncertainty this year, has not helped.

The Ethereum network's smart contracts capability makes it a prominent platform for the tokenization of traditional assets, which includes U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. Fundstrat's Tom Lee this week called Ethereum "the backbone and architecture" of stablecoins. Both Tether (USDT) and Circle's USD Coin (USDC) are issued on the network.

BlackRock's tokenized money market fund (known as BUIDL, which stands for USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund) also launched on Ethereum last year before expanding to other blockchain networks.

Tokenization is the process of issuing digital representations on a blockchain network of publicly traded securities, real world assets or any other form of value. Holders of tokenized assets don't have outright ownership of the assets themselves.

The latest wave of interest in ETH-related assets follows an announcement by Robinhood this week that it will enable trading of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs across Europe, after a groundswell of interest in stablecoins throughout June following Circle's IPO and the Senate passage of its proposed stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act.

Ether, which turns 10 years old at the end of July, is sitting about 75% off its all-time high.

It's looking to fortify its coffers with stablecoins.

Oculus VR founder and flip-flop evangelist, Palmer Luckey is part of a collective of tech billionaires who are founding a new crypto-focused U.S. bank called Erebor. This bank will focus on providing capital for technology start-ups, AI-ventures, defence and manufacturing industries, and cryptocurrency endeavours, as well as for individuals looking to invest in these spaces.

The Columbus, Ohio-based Erebor has applied for a national bank charter, and is pushing a digital-only model. It will be headed by co-CEOs Owen Rapaport and Jacob Hirshman, the latter of whom was a former adviser to stablecoin company Circle, as per Reuters.

While they'll be the face of the company, the money behind it is coming from billionaires like Luckey. He's joined by the Peter Thiel-backed Founders Fund, and Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded Palantir with Thiel. Both are cited as major donors to U.S. President, Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.

The bank is looking to fill the empty boots of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which collapsed in 2023 amidst an insolvency crisis. Before collapsing, SVB was the most popular bank for new technology ventures and was often seen as a source of capital for enterprises that wouldn't meet liquidity standards for more traditional banking organizations.

Like SVB, the filing suggests Erebor would look to “differentiate itself,” by doing business with entities and customers that are not as well served by traditional financial institutions. It would particularly look to serve those with “insufficient access to credit.”

In an effort to head off concerns of SVR-like liquidity issues at Erebor, the backing group has announced that they'll hold cryptocurrency stablecoins on its balance sheet. These crypto assets have their value pegged to traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which can provide more stability for their value than other, more volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

That hasn't proved foolproof in the past, though, as the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin and Luna cryptocurrency collapsed in 2022, destroying $45 billion in value overnight.

However, cryptocurrency assets have become increasingly common on the balance sheets of many financial organizations in recent years as a way to hold value and to accelerate cross-border payments which can be slow and fraught with fees.

Erebor said that it aimed to become "the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating stablecoin transactions", in its charter application.

It may have stiff competition, though. PYMNTS quotes Brett McLain, head of payments at cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken, ““Everybody's jumping into stablecoins right now [...] “All the big banks, they're talking about creating their own; others want to leverage existing ones.”

Regulation of this new banking space is expected to take some time, but the impetus is clearly there to make stablecoins a major component of modern finance and credit, and Erebor is looking to be at the forefront of that new endeavour.

AllUnity has received regulatory approval from German regulator BaFin as an E-Money Institution, the license needed to launch a stablecoin under the EU's MiCA regulations. AllUnity is a joint venture between Deutsche Bank's asset management arm DWS, Galaxy and Flow Traders. The company plans to launch its EURAU euro stablecoin imminently, 18 months after first announcing the initiative.

“This license is not just a regulatory hurdle cleared, it's a foundational step towards building a truly secure, transparent and compliant digital cross-border payment ecosystem for Europe and global markets,” said AllUnity CEO Alexander Höptner.

The 1:1 backed stablecoin will target fintech, enterprise and institutional use cases including cross border payments and corporate treasury usage.

“AllUnity's Euro stablecoin, EURAU, will enable frictionless, compliant, and transparent value transfer, unlocking real utility for institutions, fintechs, and enterprises across borders,” said Mike Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Galaxy. 

AllUnity will enter a relatively small but growing European stablecoin market.

Despite MiCA coming into force for electronic money tokens a year ago, to date the dollar still dominates stablecoins with 99% of the market. Circle's EURC is the sector leader with a market capitalization of €178 million ($210m), but that contrasts with its $61 billion USDC stablecoin. 

AllUnity is not the first euro stablecoin affiliated with a systemically important bank. Societe Generale FORGE issued its EURCV more than two years ago and was amongst the first wave of MiCA approvals. Its current market capitalization is €41 million. In recent months it has announced several new alliances. 

However, AllUnity's joint venture structure may give it distinct advantages over existing competitors. It brings the benefit of a variety of institutions to help promote the stablecoin. On top of that, Höptner  has an extensive network from his background at Börse Stuttgart and Börse Stuttgart Digital, one of the first institutional crypto offerings.

We plan to publish an article on AllUnity next week as part of our Ledger Insights Pro offering, following a recent interview with Höptner.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants the crypto industry to grow up fast — stressing that the industry is at an “inflection point.”

Speaking in front of a packed room at the Ethereum Community Conference, in Cannes, France, Buterin used his keynote to deliver a clear-eyed reality check: Decentralization, he argued, must evolve from a catchphrase to a concrete set of user guarantees — or risk becoming another hollow promise.

As the industry has gone mainstream with endorsements from major corporations and political figures, builders need to return to the ecosystem's key ideals surrounding decentralization and building for users' needs, Buterin said.

In his typical jeans and relaxed dark T-shirt uniform, Buterin laid out practical “tests” that he said every crypto project should pass. These include 1) the walk-away test. If the company behind an application disappears, do users keep their assets? And 2) the insider attack test: How much damage can rogue insiders or compromised front-ends cause? And 3) whether it has a trusted computing base: How many lines of code must be trusted to protect users' funds or data?

He warned that too many layer-2 networks, DeFi projects and “decentralized” front-ends rely on hidden backdoors, instant upgrade buttons or insecure interfaces that can be tampered with and hacked.

Even identity and privacy solutions came under his critical eye. Zero-knowledge proofs, he noted, can backfire if users still reveal their entire transaction history when they sign in with centralized providers. Privacy, he added, must flip from being treated as an optional feature to something that reduces data leaks by default. 

It will be 10 years this month since the Ethereum blockchain went live, and Buterin has come under pressure over the past few months from the community to address core protocol issues. If not, the blockchain could lose its edge to competitors.

For Buterin, this next phase in Ethereum's history means building systems that pass the walk-away test, shrink the trusted base of code and resist insider attacks. This includes balancing engineering with simple, robust solutions.

“If we lose that,” he concluded, “Ethereum inevitably just becomes a generational thing, and it inevitably passes like a lot of other things have passed before.”

Your AI policy sleuth, connecting dots between economic decisions and your portfolio's pulse—with a side of snark.

The voluntary carbon market, a critical tool for global climate action, has long been hamstrung by fragmentation, opacity, and skepticism. But a groundbreaking collaboration between S&P Global and JPMorgan's Kinexys unit is now positioning blockchain technology to transform this $200 billion sector into a transparent, liquid, and investor-friendly ecosystem. By tokenizing carbon credits, the partnership aims to unlock trillions in climate finance while addressing systemic inefficiencies that have stifled institutional participation. For investors, this represents a rare convergence of innovation, regulatory momentum, and existential demand.  

Voluntary carbon credits—financial instruments representing avoided or removed CO₂ emissions—are central to corporate net-zero pledges and climate accountability. Yet the market suffers from three critical flaws:1. Fragmentation: Over 30 registries and standards complicate comparability.2. Transparency Gaps: Fraudulent credits and double-counting erode trust.3. Liquidity Constraints: Illiquid markets deter institutional investors seeking scalable, tradable assets.  

These issues create a “greenwashing risk premium” that deters capital, even as demand for credible climate solutions surges. S&P Global and Kinexys' exploratory pilot, set to launch in July 2025, targets these pain points head-on.  

 

The collaboration leverages S&P Global's Environmental Registry—a trusted platform for carbon project data—and integrates it with Kinexys' blockchain infrastructure. The result? A system that turns carbon credits into programmable, tokenized assets, governed by smart contracts and recorded on an immutable ledger.  

Key Innovations:- Standardization: A unified data model ensures credits from reforestation, renewable energy, or carbon capture projects are comparable.- Fraud Prevention: Blockchain's “single source of truth” eliminates double-counting and ensures credits are retired upon purchase.- Streamlined Settlements: Cross-chain capabilities enable frictionless transfers, mirroring the efficiency of traditional financial markets.  

The pilot's success hinges on demonstrating interoperability with existing registries like EcoRegistry and the International Carbon Registry. If achieved, this could establish a global standard, enabling carbon credits to trade as seamlessly as stocks or bonds.  

For investors, the implications are profound:  

Tokenization creates an audit trail, enabling investors to verify a credit's origin, additionality, and permanence. This aligns with growing regulatory scrutiny—e.g., the EU's proposed Carbon Removal Certification Framework—and rising ESG accountability demands.  

By digitizing credits, the partnership taps into institutional demand for “real-world asset” (RWA) tokenization. The RWA market, projected to hit $18.9 trillion by 2033, is increasingly viewed as a bridge between physical assets and digital finance. Kinexys' prior success with tokenized U.S. Treasuries ($1.5 trillion in transactions since 2015) underscores its technical credibility.  

Tokenized credits directly support Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which mandates integrity and transparency in carbon markets. Institutional capital flowing into these instruments could accelerate the voluntary market's growth to over $2 trillion by 2030—a trajectory amplified by corporate net-zero commitments and sovereign climate bonds.  



While the partnership's vision is compelling, challenges remain. Regulatory divergence between regions like the EU and U.S. could fragment standards, while overhyping tokenization may lead to speculative bubbles. Investors should:- Focus on Infrastructure Players: Companies like S&P Global and JPMorgan, with established climate finance expertise, stand to benefit disproportionately.- Monitor Regulatory Developments: Track the EU's Carbon Removal Certification and U.S. SEC guidance on tokenized assets.- Prioritize Liquidity: Seek platforms offering tradable carbon credit tokens, akin to ETFs or futures contracts.  

The S&P-Kinexys collaboration is not just a tech upgrade—it's a paradigm shift. By digitizing carbon credits, they're creating a financial instrument that marries environmental impact with market discipline. For investors, this is a “first-mover” opportunity: a chance to align portfolios with climate goals while capitalizing on a nascent trillion-dollar market.  

The window to position portfolios is narrowing. As the pilot unfolds this summer, institutional investors should act decisively:- Buy SPGI and JPM: Their leadership in standard-setting and infrastructure will command premium valuations.- Explore Carbon Credit ETFs: Products like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) hint at future specialization.- Advocate for Policy Clarity: Lobby for global carbon accounting rules to solidify the market's foundation.  

Blockchain's green revolution is here. The question is no longer if tokenized carbon credits will reshape climate finance—but who will profit first.

PENGU Token, a Solana meme coin linked with the Pudgy Penguins project, surprised investors with a humongous 47% valuation jump in the past week, increasing its market capitalization by a staggering $300 million despite rampant crypto market fluctuations.

Currently trading at $0.01475, PENGU registered a marginal 1.86% appreciation over the preceding 24-hour trading period but is still dominant across top exchanges as a very highly traded token. This unwavering support is despite rising activity among so-called “whale” players, crypto wallets that hold over a million dollars in assets.

Most recent on-chain records indicate these whales have acquired a total of nearly 240 million tokens throughout the past week, evidencing growing optimism among veteran market players.

The token's rise coincides with a broader resurgence in the NFT sector. The NFT marketplace has increased 33.8% during the week and outperformed every other part of crypto, according to analytics firm Artemis. CryptoSlam data also records a massive 191% jump in volume traded over a single 24-hour day in Pudgy Penguins NFTs, a sign of a new sense of excitement around the brand's digital collectibles.

Following that momentum, the team behind Pudgy Penguins is set to introduce “Pudgy Party,” a mobile phone game that is intended to attract mainstream players and further expand the project's ecosystem beyond traditional ownership of NFTs to phone entertainment. The move is intended to increase community growth and usage over the long term.

For those not aware, @pudgypenguins is about to drop a mobile game called Pudgy Party.Gameplay looks fun AF, think Mario Party meets Fall Guys. I've talked to a couple people who've played (it's testing in select regions) and they said it's incredible.Built by Mythical Games,… pic.twitter.com/J2tDuoKerd

Even institutional demand is rippling out. Cboe BZX recently filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to trade shares of a potential PENGU exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by Canary Capital. The filing is a good indication that the meme coin is gathering mainstream acceptability and may be more attainable for mainstream investors shortly.

Analysts have pointed out the meteoric growth of the tokens and likened it to the explosive growth of a different meme coin, Pepe, last January. Notable crypto analyst “degengambleh” pointed out similarities in pricing behavior and foresaw a very bullish upside target of $0.1774, more than 10 times the spot level.

Meanwhile, trader Ali Martinez pointed out that a close above the resistance level of $0.015 to $0.017 per coin might ignite a very strong breakout and drive PENGU still further in the short term.

While PENGU basks in the limelight, a different budding project, Subbd, is silently gathering steam in the creator economy. Poised to disrupt a market worth a whopping $85 billion in content subscriptions,

Subbd is harnessing Web3 and AI technologies to offer a tokenized experience that lets creators programmatically deliver content and fans enjoy distinctive, interactive experiences.

Subbd's native Ethereum-based token, SUBBD, powers the ecosystem through granting premium access to content, staking rewards, and features enhanced through AI. Token holders who stake SUBBD gain access to more perks such as special livestreams, behind-the-scenes posts, and special releases of content, leading to a more active and loyal fan base.

The project has been able to raise a total of $465,670 via its ongoing presale, and there isn't much time left before the next pricing level is activated, showing strong early investor demand.

Crypto World News

July 2, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

Have you ever looked back at a missed crypto opportunity and realized the numbers were right in front of you the whole time? The cryptocurrency market is filled with moments that reward early adoption and punish hesitation. Some of the most recognizable tokens today started as unassuming projects trading for mere cents. OKB was one of them. It quietly gained traction post-ICO, only to become one of the most profitable exchange tokens on the market. Today, a new name is emerging in similar conversations. Qubetics is drawing increasing attention following its strong mainnet debut and may soon be viewed in the same tier of market relevance.

Qubetics has not only achieved a swift post-launch surge but also introduced a blockchain architecture that addresses longstanding issues in crypto. Its seamless interoperability, DPoS-based reward system, and real-world usability have positioned it among serious contenders. 

With solid technical metrics, rising market demand, and early analyst sentiment backing a price target of $10 to $15, Qubetics has emerged as a popular crypto coin to buy now. While the broader market weighs its next move, early participants are taking note of Qubetics' rapid progress, raising the question: could this be the next big project after OKB?

OKB's journey stands out in the history of digital assets. Launched by OKEx, one of the top global crypto exchanges, OKB began as a utility token within its ecosystem. Its initial price during the public sale was modest, with early supporters acquiring tokens at a low valuation. What followed was an impressive climb fueled by exchange-backed adoption, token burn mechanisms, and integration into broader trading services. Over the years, OKB evolved from a simple fee-discount utility into a multi-functional asset powering key services across trading, staking, and ecosystem governance.

What makes OKB's growth notable is the consistency of its upward momentum in response to real development and strategic integrations. It has managed to remain relevant through market shifts and regulatory cycles. Even though it started quietly, the coin has cemented itself among the top-tier exchange tokens by demonstrating utility beyond trading. Those who participated early experienced exponential returns. From its humble ICO entry to its highest point, OKB served as a case study in how platform-native tokens can deliver real returns when backed by infrastructure and adoption.

Qubetics integrates a Decentralized Virtual Private Network (dVPN) directly within its ecosystem, offering a privacy-focused infrastructure for blockchain users. The dVPN feature routes traffic through a decentralized network of nodes rather than centralized internet providers, shielding user metadata, wallet addresses, and transaction origins from surveillance or tracking. This model enhances both privacy and security, especially when moving assets across different blockchains.

For example, a user transferring assets between Bitcoin and Ethereum through the Qubetics Wallet benefits from dVPN encryption, which prevents their IP address and transaction activity from being exposed or intercepted. This eliminates the need to rely on third-party VPNs or external tools to maintain anonymity. The integration of dVPN into Qubetics' core structure provides end-to-end privacy, making it an attractive option for those prioritizing confidentiality in their digital activities. The privacy-first infrastructure adds another layer of value to the project, reinforcing its reputation as a popular crypto coin to buy for those focused on secure, decentralized functionality.

Qubetics launched at $0.40 and reached its all-time high of $4.20 within the first 60 minutes. That 950 percent increase or 10.5x return caught immediate attention across trading platforms. Trade volume on MEXC exceeded $700,000 within the first day, signaling strong entry demand. A support level has already formed at $2, showing that this was not a one-time spike but the start of a longer-term trend.

Participants who secured tokens during early distribution rounds at $0.01 saw extraordinary returns. A $10,000 allocation at that stage would have yielded 1 million tokens. At the all-time high, that position would have been worth $4.2 million. These early gains reflect the market's response to Qubetics' fundamentals rather than hype. Delegators with at least 5,000 tokens can begin earning passive rewards from validators, who themselves require 25,000 tokens to participate. With a 30 percent APY, the staking economy further incentivizes network contribution and token retention.

As a top altcoin to invest in this year, its system also introduces simplified cross-chain transfers without KYC requirements or complex bridge configurations. Participants can move between chains securely, cost-effectively, and without waiting for third-party confirmations. The combined utility of passive income, multi-chain support, and institutional-grade performance has made Qubetics a popular crypto coin to buy. Analysts now believe the $10 to $15 price target is realistic based on structural demand and transaction-level functionality.

OKB's rise from a modest exchange token to a widely integrated utility asset demonstrates what is possible when token design meets ecosystem strategy. It showed that a long-term commitment to usability and performance can transform an early investment into a market staple. Now, Qubetics is drawing similar attention, with its mainnet launch performance and wallet infrastructure revealing a blueprint for broad adoption.

With features like 30% staking APY, high-frequency trading volume, cross-chain privacy, and real-time stablecoin conversion, Qubetics is establishing itself not just as a new project but as a functioning ecosystem. Its governance model through DPoS further positions the network for sustained participation, while price levels at support show that early momentum is finding stability. For those tracking performance and real utility, Qubetics is proving to be a popular crypto coin to buy, and one of the top altcoins to invest in this year. As market sentiment turns toward substance over speculation, this project may hold a central role in what comes next.

Quick Summary

This article compared Qubetics and OKB to highlight missed crypto opportunities and emerging potential. OKB started modestly but became a top-performing exchange token through consistent development and ecosystem utility. Qubetics ($TICS), now being recognized as a popular crypto coin to buy, launched at $0.40 and reached $4.20 in its first hour, delivering a 950% return. Its wallet supports DVPN-based cross-chain interaction without KYC, stablecoin conversion at point-of-sale, and a 30% APY for staking via DPoS. With strong buy pressure at the $2 level and analyst targets of $10 to $15, Qubetics is shaping up to be a top altcoin to invest in this year.

A new Ethereum Community Foundation aims to fund tokenless projects and boost ETH burning, while criticizing the Ethereum Foundation's political inaction.

Ethereum core developer Zak Cole has launched the Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF), a new initiative aimed at funding “tokenless” projects and promoting ETH burning mechanisms to enhance the digital asset's economic value and institutional adoption.

Cole announced the initiative at the Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes, France, while taking aim at the Ethereum Foundation for its lack of lobbying efforts in Washington DC.

The ECF will only fund projects that are immutable and do not issue new tokens, enforcing a strict tokenless policy to ensure security, decentralization, and alignment with Ethereum's core values.

All supported projects must integrate mechanisms that contribute to the burning of ETH, directly reducing the circulating supply and supporting ETH's monetary integrity and value for holders.

“The Ethereum Foundation won't say it. So we did,” said Cole.

“ETH to $10k is a requirement. Not a meme.”

In a bold move similar to Strategy's $BTC playbook, DeFi Development (formerly Janover) announced a $100M convertible note offering yesterday to fund large-scale purchases of $SOL.

Such a move could significantly boost investor appetite for $SOL. It may also act as a powerful catalyst for top Solana-based altcoins.

A portion of the proceeds raised from the $100M will be allocated toward stock buybacks through a prepaid forward transaction.

Its crypto playbook is similar to Strategy in the sense that it'll sell equity to buy crypto. But the asset of choice isn't $BTC this time around, it's $SOL.

Known as the ‘Ethereum killer,' Solana remains popular among retail and DeFi users. However, it has so far lacked strong institutional backing compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Yet, the market's reaction to the big $SOL announcement wasn't glowing. Within thirty minutes of announcing its plans to accumulate more $SOL on X, DeFi Development's stock price dropped by 9% in after-hours trading.

This sharp decline reveals skepticism among investors who might be wary of $SOL's recent market volatility. Over the past 24 hours alone, its trading volume has dropped by over 40%.

That said, large institutional buy-ins, such as DeFi Development's, could be precisely what $SOL needs to find its footing.

The company's $100M approach, which came after the SEC rejected its earlier attempt to raise $1B $SOL via securities sales, suggests it's in it for the long haul.

If DeFi Development's plan pans out, it doesn't just suggest a rosy future for $SOL but also Solana-based coins like Snorter Token ($SNORT), Grass ($GRASS), and BIO Token ($BIO).

Reason being is that it could drive liquidity, visibility, and developer activity across the entire network.

Don't be fooled by the cartoon aardvark. Snorter Token ($SNORT) is more than just another meme coin; it powers Snorter Bot, an advanced Telegram-based trading assistant launching on Solana in Q3 2025.

Built for speed and precision, Snorter Bot sniffs out the best Solana meme coins, manage your crypto portfolio, and automates strategies seamlessly on a unified Telegram interface.

Boasting the highest speeds and lowest fees at 0.85% on Solana, it's built to outperform competitors like Maestro, Trojan, Banana Gun, and Bonk Bot.

Moreover, it's backed by MEV-protection and 85% accurate rug-pull detection, so you can rest easy knowing that your trades are safeguarded against frontrunning and scams.

It's also getting set to launch across major EVM-compatible chains, as part of its plan to become a multi-chain trading powerhouse.

To deploy the bot on day one, you can purchase $SNORT on presale for just $0.0969. With top exchange listings ahead, it's projected to reach 0.94%, and achieve possibly gains of up to 868%.

Also making waves in the Solana ecosystem is Grass ($GRASS), which is up by over 17% compared to yesterday.

$GRASS attracts the eyes of investors by building the first open, internet-scale web crawl.

In a nutshell, it leverages a network of over 3M users who run nodes to collect vast amounts of public web data for AI models.

It challenges the current landscape, where only a few large companies, such as Google (with Googlebot) and Microsoft (with Bingbot), control extensive web crawling capabilities. Instead, it relies on user participation instead of corporate control.

The initiative seeks to replace these centralized entities by creating a user-owned knowledge graph of the entire internet.

You can contribute by downloading and running the Grass application to share your unused internet bandwidth.

In return, you'll earn ‘Grass Points,' which track your contributions. These points will then be converted into $GRASS, typically through airdrops.

You can also boost your earnings by referring new users to the platform, partaking in community activities, and maintaining consistent uptime for your node.

Get involved by purchasing $GRASS for approximately $1.13 on some of the best crypto exchanges, including MEXC and Bybit.

BIO Token ($BIO) is a multi-chain asset held across Solana, Ethereum, and other major networks. As a result, it offers you broad access to the fast-growing decentralized science (DeSci) movement.

Following the news of DeFi Development's $SOL acquisition, its native token, $BIO, is up by roughly 10%.

Fueling its popularity is BioDAO, a community-governed initiative that funds early-stage biotech and scientific innovations.

Once you hold $BIO, you can vote on grant proposals and help fund promising scientific research. When a project is successful, it may generate valuable intellectual property (IP) or products.

Then, the proceeds flow back into the BioDAO treasury, creating a self-sustaining cycle that continuously funds the next wave of biotech innovation.

By doing so, it aims to challenge traditional, centralized models of scientific funding, which are dominated by governments, universities, and large corporations.

It'll also make science more transparent, efficient, and globally inclusive, unlocking innovation at scale that traditional systems often stifle.

Join the movement by purchasing $BIO on top exchanges like Binance and OKX for roughly $0.05196.

Another day, another company goes all in on crypto. But this time, it's not $BTC or $ETH in the spotlight, it's $SOL.

With DeFi Development pledging $100M toward $SOL purchases, the so-called Ethereum Killer may finally get the institutional attention that it has long been denied.

Despite an initially lousy market reaction following the move, this move could lay the groundwork for heightened buzz across the Solana ecosystem.

If that plays out, the biggest beneficiaries might not just be $SOL but also coins that leverage the Solana network, such as $SNORT, $GRASS, and $BIO.

Don't forget to DYOR and invest only as much as you can afford to lose. This is not financial advice.

Krown Technologies and Quantum eMotion (OTCQB: QNCCF) have announced significant progress in developing two quantum-secure cryptocurrency wallets: the Qastle Quantum Hot Wallet and the Excalibur Quantum Cold Wallet. Both wallets utilize QeM's proprietary Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) and Entropy-as-a-Service (EaaS) technologies.

The partnership has been strengthened by a strategic alliance with Esposito Intellectual Enterprises (EIE), announced on April 23, 2025, to accelerate commercialization. The Excalibur cold wallet reduces monetary loss risk by 98% compared to traditional wallets, while Qastle integrates advanced post-quantum algorithms for online transactions. Prototype testing for Qastle is scheduled for Q3 2025, with Excalibur's expanded availability expected in early 2026.

Krown Technologies e Quantum eMotion (OTCQB: QNCCF) hanno annunciato importanti progressi nello sviluppo di due portafogli di criptovalute sicuri contro la tecnologia quantistica: il Qastle Quantum Hot Wallet e l'Excalibur Quantum Cold Wallet.

Notabene has introduced Notabene Transact for real-time transaction authorisation for regulated entities managing complex digital asset flows.

Notabene Transact is a secure real-time transaction authorisation solution designed for regulated entities managing complex digital asset flows. It utilises the Transaction Authorisation Protocol (TAP) to transform transaction authorisation from a reactive obligation into a strategic growth tool. Specifically tailored for cryptocurrency transactions, Notabene Transact handles multi-party transactions, allowing institutions to scale in a compliant manner and accelerate their operations.

Clear regulatory guidelines are expected to drive institutional adoption; however, the increasing complexity of transactions necessitates robust compliance measures. Institutions will require a powerful authorisation infrastructure to facilitate simplified real-time transactions. Many existing tools fall short in managing today's digital asset flows. Notabene Transact addresses this gap by focusing on practical applications, streamlining multi-party transactions, and automating compliance across various jurisdictions, thereby enabling scalable and compliant real-time transactions.

One key feature of Notabene Transact is its integration of two capabilities: a discovery and verification system that identifies all counterparties within a transaction flow, and a customisable policy engine that automates decisions following an institution's risk appetite, regulatory responsibilities, and established business relationships. This trust-based system facilitates quicker approvals, reduces friction, and increases transaction throughput, thereby promoting growth across international borders.

The Transaction Authorisation Protocol (TAP) is an open-source, decentralised messaging system that, unlike traditional systems such as SWIFT, enables secure, policy-based data exchange across any blockchain or protocol without restricting institutions to closed infrastructures. TAP features an end-to-end encrypted data model, avoids central control, and ensures interoperability within varying regulatory environments. When paired with the Notabene Network, TAP allows businesses to authorise global transactions, scale operations, and adapt to future challenges.

Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen has argued that an ‘altcoin season‘ has failed to materialize due to monetary policy, liquidity and stubborn Bitcoin BTC/USD dominance.

What Happened: In a podcast published on June 28, Cowen stated, "Altseason has not happened yet." 

According to Cowen, a sharp drop in Bitcoin BTC/USD dominance and a relative surge in altcoin performance — the conditions that typically fuel altcoin rallies in coins like Ethereum ETH/USD, XRP CRYPTO: XRP), and Solana SOL/USD — aren't present.

"If you only followed Crypto Twitter, you'd think we're already in our 700th alt season," Cowen joked. "But the data tells a very different story."

Reviewing historical trends, Cowen noted that true altseasons in 2017 and late 2020 to early 2021 followed clear collapses in Bitcoin dominance, allowing altcoins to outperform BTC on a relative basis. 

"That hasn't happened this cycle. In fact, Bitcoin has continued to dominate," he said, referring to this phase as a persistent ‘Bitcoin Season.'

Cowen highlighted that before the last two major alt runs, altcoin-to-Bitcoin valuations dropped to roughly 25% of BTC's market cap. 

“We're nowhere near those levels now,” he explained, suggesting that a reset to those lows might be necessary to "rip the band-aid off" and set the stage for a true altcoin cycle.

Why It Matters: Cowen pointed to broader macroeconomic headwinds as the key suppressors of altcoin momentum. 

"We're still in a period of quantitative tightening, and the Fed is holding off on rate cuts," he explained. 

"Jerome Powell even acknowledged they're concerned about inflation risk from tariffs, which keeps the door shut on easing."

Historically, major altcoin rallies have aligned with aggressive rate cuts and liquidity injections, monetary easing that allowed speculative assets to flourish. 

Without that tailwind, Cowen believes altcoins are more likely to bleed lower through September to November, echoing patterns seen in prior cycles.

What's Next: According to Cowen, the setup for altcoins could improve only after a meaningful shift in U.S. monetary policy, especially if the Federal Reserve pivots to rate cuts or renewed liquidity support. 

Until then, Cowen advises caution: "You probably would have outperformed most of the altcoin market by simply staying Bitcoin-heavy this year."

Riyadh, Jul 2 (SPA/APP): The International Camel Organization (ICO) participated in the closing ceremony of the International Year of Camelids (IYC), organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) at its headquarters in Rome.
The global event marked the culmination of a year dedicated to highlighting the importance of camelids in enhancing food security, economic development, cultural heritage, and climate resilience across more than 90 countries.
As a full member of the International Year of Camelids' Steering Committee, the ICO has played an active role throughout the year by supporting awareness in the camel sector.
ICO Founder and Chairman Fahd bin Falah bin Hathleen stated: “Our involvement in the International Year of Camelids has been rooted in our mission to elevate the camel sector on the global stage. Camels are considered a symbol of cultural identity and supporters of rural communities' sustainability and livelihoods. We remain committed to supporting their role across all scientific, cultural, sport, economic, and welfare sectors.”
ICO Secretary General Abdulrahman Alieedan added: “The closing ceremony was an opportunity to reflect on a year of achievements and to look ahead. We are dedicated to ensuring that the momentum built during the IYC continues through international cooperation, knowledge exchange, and strategic partnerships to strengthen camel-based economies and communities.”

The European Central Bank (ECB) is planning distributed ledger technology (DLT) for financial settlement, which shows a good intention to modernize the Eurozone's financial infrastructure.

How will they do it? Through a ‘dual-track strategy' that explores immediate and long-term applications of DLT. While the developments will bring novel technology into traditional finance, the conversation around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) also intensifies.

It begs several questions, mostly regarding financial autonomy and privacy, especially when contrasted with solutions like Best Wallet.

The ECB's dual-track strategy involves two distinct initiatives, ‘Pontes' and ‘Appia'.

1. The Short-term Track (Pontes)

It links DLT platforms and existing TARGET Services for the settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money.

This approach seeks to leverage DLT to improve efficiency and security within the current financial framework.

2. The long-term vision (Appia)

It shapes a future-ready, innovative, and integrated financial ecosystem within Europe and eventually globally.

This long-term track suggests a more fundamental rethink of the market infrastructure. Which potentially invites tokenized assets and more sophisticated DLT applications.

The duality in approach shows a forward-looking perspective on digital assets.

Simultaneously, central banks (including the ECB) are actively investigating and developing CBDCs. The digital euro, for instance, wants to have a foundation by October 2025.

You might argue that CBDCs are more secure and efficient, and might replace cash in an increasingly cashless society. Their goal – to enable faster interbank settlements, improve cross-border payments, and strengthen monetary sovereignty, of course.

But. And there's a big but here.

The push for CBDCs comes with some significant privacy concerns. For one, centralized control from banks—they'll theoretically see all your transactions and potentially impose limitations on your account.

These contrast sharply with the inherent privacy and control offered by self-custody solutions like Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets).

CBDCs inherently allow for surveillance and potential control over your financial transactions. This doesn't happen with cash or decentralized crypto transactions. And it's also where Best Wallet's self-custody solution shines, offering true financial freedom.



Best Wallet is a non-custodial platform that puts the control back into your hands. No more third parties that can freeze or control your transactions, it's all you.

While the two appear similar, China's digital currency is quite different from the cryptocurrencies many economies are rushing to regulate

When South Korea reportedly halted its digital currency pilot programme this week in favour of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a reference asset, typically a fiat currency – it sent shock waves through central banks across the world.

At first glance, stablecoins appear to have similar qualities to the digital yuan or other digital currencies, but there are significant differences in their design, purpose and management.

First piloted in 2020, it had been used in 26 cities for transactions worth a total of 7 trillion yuan (US$977 billion) by June last year.

The digital yuan is largely intended for small domestic retail payments, and it cannot be exchanged for foreign currencies. Its cross-border use is being developed through the mBridge project, coordinated by the multinational Bank for International Settlements.

Unlike the digital yuan, which is entirely under the umbrella of a central bank, stablecoins are blockchain-based and privately issued cryptocurrency tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the United States or Hong Kong dollars. Issuers hold reserve assets, such as US Treasury bills, to back the total value of the tokens at a ratio of one to one.

The Bitcoin dominance remaining on the high side has been one of the major hindrances for the altcoin season. Going by past performances, the Bitcoin dominance would have to crash for altcoins to have a chance to rally, but with the dominance still climbing, the chances of an altcoin season remain slim. As this trend continues, a crypto analyst has predicted a possible turn in the tide for the Bitcoin dominance, predicting a crash that could give altcoins a chance.

Bitcoin Dominance Rejection From Trendline Is Key

Over the years, the Bitcoin dominance has been following a trendline that has often marked the point of resistance. This trendline rises from 2017 and has sloped down past 2021 and now into the year 2025. The significance behind this is the breakdown from the trendline and the Bitcoin dominance receding sharply from here.

Presently, the Bitcoin dominance is still sitting high above 65% at the time of this writing, but this recent rise has seen it touch the resistance trendline. According to crypto analyst CoreCrypto, this is a critical inflection point, especially on the weekly chart. More importantly, this is usually the point where dominance recedes, giving rise to altcoin dominance. 

Some major developments that the analyst tells investors to watch on the dominance chart include a rejection from the resistance trendline, where the dominance currently lies above 65%. There is also support for the dominance, as shown by the yellow line in the chart below. A break below this support is critical for the fall in the dominance.

Another development to watch out for is for rising Ethereum strength. In the past, the Ethereum price starting to outperform the Bitcoin price has often signaled the start of the altcoin season. So, as the ETHBTC chart begins to strengthen and Bitcoin succumbs to sideways movement, it opens the door for altcoins to rally into the next altcoin season.

In the event of a break from the resistance trendline, the analyst sees the possibility of a sharp decline. CoreCrypto predicts a 36.91% drop to the 42%-45% levels. This is lower compared to previous altcoin seasons, but follows the declining trend of a 50.79% drop in 2017 compared to a 45.10% drop in 2021.

“If BTC.D gets rejected from this resistance again, it could mark the start of the long-awaited Altseason 2025,” the crypto analyst explained. “A breakdown from this wedge would likely result in capital rotation from BTC into altcoins — just like in previous cycles.”

Prometheum Inc., a market infrastructure provider for blockchain-based securities, announced its subsidiary Prometheum Capital, a FINRA member firm and SEC-registered special purpose broker-dealer (“SPBD”), is now authorized to provide correspondent clearing services to third-party broker-dealers. Prometheum's FINRA member and SEC-registered broker-dealer network will support introducing broker-dealers seeking to transact in on-chain securities under federal securities laws.

Correspondent clearing allows Prometheum Capital to provide clearing, custody, execution, and recordkeeping services on behalf of other broker-dealers, enabling their clients to access and transact in on-chain securities.

Product issuers are increasingly distributing securities on-chain, with more than $24 billion of securities products already issued on blockchain networks, according to RWA.xyz. Correspondent clearing is a critical gateway for broader market participation with these assets, supporting the modernization of U.S. capital markets and accelerating institutional and retail access to on-chain securities.

“Financial markets are evolving from electronic to digital, blockchain-enabled infrastructure, facilitating the migration of the $130 trillion securities industry on-chain,” said Aaron Kaplan, founder and co-CEO of Prometheum. “Broker-dealers require a turnkey solution to access these products and offer on-chain securities alongside traditional securities products. Prometheum Capital is excited to support the broker-dealer community's growth by offering a pathway into digital markets.”

This development expands Prometheum's role as a leading on-chain securities infrastructure provider, allowing broker-dealers—who currently cannot custody or directly transact in on-chain securities—to access these products and expand their offerings into digital assets.

While the majority of coins, including Bitcoin (BTC), are in the red following the Senate's passage of President Donald Trump's ‘Big, Beautiful Bill' and escalating tensions between Trump and Elon Musk, PENGU has bucked the trend.

Over the past week, it has risen 56.2%, outperforming the broader market. This has led analysts to speculate that PENGU could be on the verge of a rally similar to what happened with Pepe (PEPE).

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), a Solana-based meme coin tied to the popular Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, has been on a notable rally for over a week. According to data from BeInCrypto, it was trading at $0.015 at press time. This represented an appreciation of 8.58% over the past day alone. 

At the same time, the total crypto market capitalization has dipped 3.18%, highlighting PENGU's strength in a market otherwise in decline. Moreover, the altcoin has also secured a spot among the top trending coins on CoinGecko.

But what's causing this massive rise? Several factors could be contributing to PENGU's performance. First, the NFT market is showing strong growth overall. According to Artemis data, NFT has been the top-performing sector over the last week, with a 33.8% uptick. 

Additionally, interest in Pudgy Penguins is notably high. As per Cryptoslam, the trading volume of Pudgy Penguins NFTs is up 157% over the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, institutional interest in the meme coin is also growing. Last week, Cboe BZX filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC to list and trade shares of Canary Capital's proposed PENGU ETF.

“With this filing, the PENGU and Pudgy Penguins NFTs ETF becomes only the second meme coin-style ETF, after DOGE, and first filing with NFTs to enter the SEC's formal review process, joining coins such as BTC, SOL, XRP, and DOGE,” an analyst wrote.

Additionally, PENGU's availability on RevolutApp has significantly increased its accessibility. The mascot's appearance at NASDAQ alongside VanEck, a major asset management firm, has also amplified its visibility. 

Furthermore, the team is preparing to launch a mobile game, Pudgy Party, which could again draw substantial interest.

“Real studio. Real game. Built for a mainstream audience. Penguins everywhere. Don't be surprised when it tops the App Store,” a product designer, Steve, stated.

But that's not all. This increased attention has translated into actual accumulation. On-chain data from Nansen indicated significant whale activity. Over the past week, wallets holding over $1 million in tokens have acquired 240 million PENGU tokens. This is a bullish signal that suggests large investors anticipate further gains.

Amid these catalysts and strong price growth, analysts are drawing parallels to the explosive rally of PEPE, another meme coin that experienced a dramatic surge in 2024.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) highlight optimism, with some market watchers suggesting PENGU's viral potential could mirror PEPE's trajectory. 

“Many aren't ready for what PENGU is about to pull. The similarities with PEPE chart is uncanny. The narrative and momentum is there. The stars have never been so aligned,” an analyst posted.

$PENGU WILL PUMP LIKE $PEPE DID pic.twitter.com/tRcDgInqyL

Another analyst highlighted that the conditions for a short squeeze on PENGU are aligning. This could drive the price of the meme coin even higher.

“Chart looks amazing & funding flipping super negative. Think this rips soon,” he said.

Thus, while the current conditions appear favorable, whether PENGU can sustain its upward trend or replicate PEPE's success remains to be seen.

The Ethereum Community Foundation will champion projects enforcing ETH burning mechanisms to support network's economic integrity without new token issuance.

Ethereum developer Zak Cole is spearheading a new initiative called the Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF), which will primarily work to enhance the digital asset's economic value.

The initiative was announced during the Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes, France.

Founded by Cole and a group of ecosystem supporters, the ECF has reportedly already raised “millions” and intends to allocate its treasury to projects that enforce immutability, avoid issuing new tokens, and implement mechanisms to burn Ethereum (ETH).

These requirements align with the foundation's mission to reduce circulating ETH supply and strengthen the network's monetary policy.

The ECF's initial initiative, known as the Ethereum Validator Association (EVA), will give validators greater influence in protocol development by enabling them to signal preferences using their staked ETH.

The EVA will also invest in validator infrastructure to improve decentralization and network security.

Beyond validator initiatives, the ECF aims to fund real-world asset integrations that bring traditional financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and real estate onto Ethereum's blockchain. The foundation views these integrations as critical to institutional adoption, which it sees as a key driver of long-term network value.

Additionally, the ECF will prioritize funding for public goods that address technical challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem, including adjustments to mispriced blob space used in data availability layers.

Funding decisions will be governed by coin voting, allowing the broader Ethereum community to participate in determining grant allocations. The ECF has emphasized that all funding decisions, treasury movements, and project milestones will remain publicly transparent to ensure accountability and alignment with the community's goals.

The launch of the ECF comes at a pivotal time for Ethereum, as the network undergoes a reorganization following executive changes at the Ethereum Foundation.

The ECF's mandate extends to engaging with governments, regulators, and policymakers to promote Ethereum as a trusted institutional infrastructure layer. While specific backers of the foundation have not been publicly disclosed, further announcements regarding its supporters and upcoming funding rounds are expected in the coming weeks.

By focusing on projects that reinforce ETH's economic integrity without introducing new tokens, the ECF is positioning itself as an alternative funding avenue within the ecosystem. It aims to complement but also differentiate from the Ethereum Foundation's current priorities.

Acute inflammation is an essential response that our bodies use to combat infections1. However, in the absence of infections, chronic inflammation can have a pivotal role in the onset and progression of chronic diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, autoimmune disorders, metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and most ageing-associated pathologies2,3. The underlying mechanisms that distinguish chronic inflammation from its acute counterpart remain unclear, posing challenges to the development of targeted therapies for these major diseases. Here we identify a mechanism that separates the two responses: during chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy, in which the WSTF protein of the ISWI chromatin-remodelling complex interacts with the ATG8 autophagy protein family in the nucleus. This interaction leads to WSTF nuclear export and subsequent degradation by autophagosomes and lysosomes in the cytoplasm. Loss of WSTF leads to chromatin opening over inflammatory genes, amplifying inflammation. Cell-penetrating peptides that block the WSTF–ATG8 interaction do not affect acute inflammation but suppress chronic inflammation in senescence as well as in MASH and osteoarthritis in mouse models and patient samples. The ability to specifically target chronic inflammation without blunting acute inflammation offers an approach for treating common chronic inflammatory diseases.

The North Eurasian forest and forest-steppe zones have sustained millennia of sociocultural connections among northern peoples, but much of their history is poorly understood. In particular, the genomic formation of populations that speak Uralic and Yeniseian languages today is unknown. Here, by generating genome-wide data for 180 ancient individuals spanning this region, we show that the Early-to-Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers harboured a continuous gradient of ancestry from fully European-related in the Baltic, to fully East Asian-related in the Transbaikal. Contemporaneous groups in Northeast Siberia were off-gradient and descended from a population that was the primary source for Native Americans, which then mixed with populations of Inland East Asia and the Amur River Basin to produce two populations whose expansion coincided with the collapse of pre-Bronze Age population structure. Ancestry from the first population, Cis-Baikal Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Cisbaikal_LNBA), is associated with Yeniseian-speaking groups and those that admixed with them, and ancestry from the second, Yakutia Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Yakutia_LNBA), is associated with migrations of prehistoric Uralic speakers. We show that Yakutia_LNBA first dispersed westwards from the Lena River Basin around 4,000 years ago into the Altai-Sayan region and into West Siberian communities associated with Seima-Turbino metallurgy—a suite of advanced bronze casting techniques that expanded explosively from the Altai1. The 16 Seima-Turbino period individuals were diverse in their ancestry, also harbouring DNA from Indo-Iranian-associated pastoralists and from a range of hunter-gatherer groups. Thus, both cultural transmission and migration were key to the Seima-Turbino phenomenon, which was involved in the initial spread of early Uralic-speaking communities.

This map displays all the sites which are the sources of the samples in the major populations that are the focus in this paper. These include all sites 1) whose samples fall on the NEAHG cline, 2) whose samples fall in the Cisbaikal_LNBA cluster or are admixed with it, 3) whose samples fall in the Yakutia_LNBA cluster or are admixed with it, 4) whose samples are a part of the ten-population East Siberian transect described in our qpAdm modelling, and 5) whose samples are from Seima-Turbino period individuals. Each site is represented by a pie chart, whose size is proportional to the number of individuals from that site; the white fraction represents previously-published samples, and the black newly-published samples. Our sampling fills geographic and temporal lacunae.

Temporal and geographic disposition of cultures from the Mesolithic to the Late Bronze and Iron Ages across Northern Eurasia. Sites whose samples are analyzed in our paper are highlighted in darker boxes, within containing boxes indicating archaeological cultures. Sites whose colors are darker are those that we believe are most securely dated (based on radiocarbon, isotopic, and archaeological evidence).

To illuminate the role that levels of ANE ancestry plays in generating variation among the populations we analyze, we use as a basis for another projection 71 shotgun-sequenced ancient individuals from across Eurasia, of which a large proportion are enriched in ANE ancestry and fall outside the range of present-day variation (e.g. individuals from populations like Tyumen_HG.SG or Kazakhstan_Botai.SG; for full list, see Supplementary Information section 4). The North Eurasian Hunter-Gatherer cline forms a curved arc stretching from EHG populations to present-day East Asians; the center of the arc dominated by populations rich in ANE ancestry is moved toward the positive direction in PC2. The individual furthest along the positive direction in PC2 is AG3. Clines formed by later Inner Asian populations, such as present-day Uralic, Turkic, and Mongolic speakers, as well as Late Bronze Age and Iron Age steppe populations such as Scythians and Sarmatians, are distinguished from the NEAHG cline by their much lower values along PC2, suggesting a much lower level of ANE ancestry. This PCA shows that populations along the NEAHG cline, remaining stable for many millennia, were substantially outside the range of present-day genetic variation in Northern Eurasia.

To further uncover possible structure among the East Asian ancestries within the populations that we analyze, we constructed a third PCA, using as a basis 37 East Asian present-day populations that have minimal West Eurasian admixture, and a single West Eurasian population (Norwegian), all genotyped on the Affymetrix Human Origins array (for a full list of populations analyzed, refer to Supplementary Information section 4). We projected all other shotgun-sequenced and hybridization-captured ancient and present-day individuals onto this basis. Once again, the North Eurasian Hunter-Gatherer cline forms a curved arc stretching from West Eurasian populations to present-day East Asians, with the center of the arc deflected toward the AG3 individual. East Asian populations are now differentiated along PC2, with Southeast Asians and East Asian agriculturalists taking on especially negative values along that dimension; populations from the Amur River Basin taking on intermediate values; then populations on the Mongolian Plateau and surrounding areas. A large gap separates these populations from Yakutia_LNBA and Russia_Tatarka_BA, which take on very positive values along PC2, close to present-day Nganasans and a genetically very similar Iron-Age individual from Yakutia who clusters with Nganasans in the previous two PCAs (Yakutia_IA.SG; also see Extended Data Fig. 9). As one moves East along the NEAHG cline, their positions along PC2 tend to converge to the values found among populations of the Mongolian Plateau. In contrast, the Dzhilinda1_M_N_8.4 kya and Kolyma_M_10.1 kya individuals, and the Syalakh_Belkachi, Yakutia_LNBA and Russia_Tatarka_BA populations do not fall on the NEAHG cline and are shifted in the positive direction on PC2, toward the positions occupied by Nganasans, Beringian populations, and Native Americans. Lastly, Uralic populations possess the most positive values among PC2 when compared to Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic populations.

To understand structure among NEAHG populations and non-NEAHG Siberians, we constructed two PCAs with ancient individuals including all individuals from the NEAHG cline, ancient non-NEAHG Siberians, and a selection of ancient Beringians and Native Americans. Notably, all these populations possess combinations of only WHG, EHG, ANE and East Asian ancestries. No individuals were projected in these PCAs. The first PCA (Extended Data Fig. 6a) includes all individuals in the set, and the second (Extended Data Fig. 6b) includes only individuals East of the Altai mountains. (A) In the first PCA we highlight several patterns. 1) the North Eurasian Hunter-Gatherer cline forms a curved arc stretching from West Eurasian populations to East Asian populations along PC1 and PC2. Populations rich in East Asian ancestry are differentiated along PC3, with individuals and populations within or closely related to the Cisbaikal_LNBA cluster having the most positive values, followed by those in the Transbaikal_EMN cluster and populations of the Mongolian Plateau, followed by individuals and populations in the Yakutia_LNBA cluster, followed by those from the Amur River Basin, followed by populations from the Bering Straits and the Americas. Notably, all individuals along the NEAHG cline, including individuals rich in East Asian ancestry (e.g. Cisbaikal_EN, Transbaikal_EMN, and all NEAHG individuals from the Krasnoyarsk region) form a straight line in PC3, suggesting a constant source of East Asian ancestry at the East Asian terminus of the NEAHG cline. 2) Khaiyrgas_16.7 kya occupies a central position among the other groups rich in East Asian ancestry in East Siberia, Beringia and the Americas, suggesting a lack of shared drift with later populations of the Bering region or the Americas. The situation is different for later populations: Kolyma_M_10.1 kya falls among ancient Beringian populations, while the more East Asian-admixed Ust-Kyakhta_14 kya and Dzhilinda1_M_N_8.4kya occupy a position in between Syalakh-Belkachi and ancient Bering Straits populations, with the even more East Asian-admixed Syalakh-Belkachi population showing even less of this displacement towards ancient Bering Straits populations. (B) We find a similar pattern in the second PCA, except with an opposite ordering of the clusters along PC3. Our results suggest that the distinctions we discover between groupings produced by the clustering analyses in Supplementary Information Section 6 can be recovered in PCA analyses aimed at recovering fine-scale structure, despite underlying similarities in deep ancestry in populations in East Siberia, Beringia, and the Americas—all the products of admixture between ANE and East Asian ancestry.

Panel A shows the widespread distribution of individuals with Ancient Paleosiberian (APS) ancestry in Siberia before the Holocene, >10 kya. Panel B shows the formation of the NEAHG cline by ~10 kya, and the formation of the population on its eastern terminus (Transbaikal_EMN) through admixture between Amur River and Inland East Asian ancestries. Panel C shows the emergence of Cisbaikal_LNBA and Yakutia_LNBA in genetic turnovers in the Cis-Baikal and Northeastern Siberian regions in the Mid-Holocene, and the genetic diversity of Seima-Turbino period individuals ~4.0 kya. Panel D shows the genetic gradient between West Eurasian ancestry and Yakutia_LNBA formed by present-day Uralic populations, along with all locations from which present-day populations with Cisbaikal_LNBA ancestry were sampled (grey dots ringed with black), alongside the geographic locations of two late Bronze Age/early Iron Age individuals (grey dots ringed with yellow) with >90% Cisbaikal_LNBA ancestry.

Details of populations created by the grouping procedure applied to individuals in Northeastern Siberia.

Central Siberian populations from the Yenisei Basin (including Kets and South Siberian Turks) are highlighted in brown, while Arctic North American and Asian populations on either side of the Bering Straits populations are highlighted in blue. Bering Straits populations that are heavily European-admixed (Aleut and Yukagir_forest) are colored dark blue, while Samoyedic populations (Enets, Selkup, and Nganasan) are colored violet. Despite the similarity of the APS-rich populations in this comparison (all being admixtures between APS ancestry and East Asian ancestry), present-day groups of the Bering Straits are always closer to groups with “Route 2” APS ancestry (i.e., Kolyma_M_10.1 kya → Dzhilinda1_8.4 kya → Syalakh-Belkachi → Yakutia_LNBA), while Central Siberian populations of the Yenisei Basin are always closer to Cisbaikal_LNBA.

China_Paleolithic includes the Tianyuan and Amur_River_33K genomes, “East Eurasian Population” is some population grouping in Siberia or Northeast Asia other than Yakutia_LNBA, and X are Admixed Inner Eurasian populations (AIEA populations) including ancient Central Asian nomads from the Late Bronze to Iron Age down to the Scytho-Sarmatian period, as well as modern or ancient populations that speak languages from the Yukaghiric, Yeniseian (Kets), Uralic, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and Nivkh language families. Modern Uralic-speaking populations, and ancient putatively Uralic-speaking populations uniformly prefer Yakutia_LNBA to other East Asian ancestries no matter the other population used in the comparison. Furthermore, at any level of admixture between East and West Eurasian ancestries, the population with the greatest affinity to Yakutia_LNBA is always a Uralic-speaking population. f4-statistics therefore highlight the connection between Uralic populations and Yakutia_LNBA ancestry over other sources of East Asian ancestry.

Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) accounts for around 25% of all lung cancers1,2 and has been associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and air pollution in observational studies3,4,5. Here we use data from the Sherlock-Lung study to evaluate mutagenic exposures in LCINS by examining the cancer genomes of 871 treatment-naive individuals with lung cancer who had never smoked, from 28 geographical locations. KRAS mutations were 3.8 times more common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe than in those from East Asia, whereas a higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was observed in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, with unknown cause6, contributed the largest proportion of single base substitutions in adenocarcinomas, and was enriched in cases with EGFR mutations. Signature SBS22a, which is associated with exposure to aristolochic acid7,8, was observed almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan. Exposure to secondhand smoke was not associated with individual driver mutations or mutational signatures. By contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution were more likely to have TP53 mutations and shorter telomeres. They also exhibited an increase in most types of mutations, including a 3.9-fold increase in signature SBS4, which has previously been linked with tobacco smoking9, and a 76% increase in the clock-like10 signature SBS5. A positive dose–response effect was observed with air-pollution levels, correlating with both a decrease in telomere length and an increase in somatic mutations, mainly attributed to signatures SBS4 and SBS5. Our results elucidate the diversity of mutational processes shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never smokers.

Normal and tumour-paired CRAM files for the WGS data for the individuals in the Sherlock-Lung study and the EAGLE study have been deposited in dbGaP under the accession numbers phs001697.v2.p1 and phs002992.v1.p1, respectively. Detailed access information for the publicly available datasets is available in Supplementary Table 13. Data from the rnaturalearthdata v.1.0.0 (https://github.com/ropensci/rnaturalearthdata) were used to generate maps. Data on passive smoking and PM2.5 estimates of outdoor air pollution are available in Supplementary Table 14. Human reference genome GRCh38 was downloaded from the GATK resources at https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/blob/master/src/test/resources/large/Homo_sapiens_assembly38.fasta.gz.

a, DBS, ID, CN and SV mutational signatures enrichment analysis with geographical regions. Horizontal lines marking statistically significant thresholds were included at 0.05 (dashed orange line) and 0.01 FDR value levels (dashed red line). Blue-coloured signatures were enriched in North American and European patients, whereas red-coloured signatures were enriched in East Asian patients. Statistical significance was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models for geographical regions and adjusted by age, sex, and tumour purity. b, SBS, DBS, ID CN, and SV mutational signatures enrichment analysis with biological sexes. Blue-coloured signatures were enriched in males, whereas red-coloured signatures were enriched in females. Statistical significance was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models for biological sex and adjusted by age, genetic ancestry, and tumour purity. c–e, Detail of the enrichment of EGFR (c), TP53 (d) and KRAS (e) driver mutations in North American and European versus East Asian LCINS adenocarcinoma cases. f, Driver mutations enrichment analysis with biological sexes. Blue-coloured genes were enriched in males, whereas red-coloured genes were enriched in females. Statistical significance was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models for biological sex and adjusted by age, genetic ancestry, and tumour purity. g, Quantification of the tumour mutational burden for TP53 wild-type and mutant tumours across EGFR mutation status (n = 271 TP53 wild-type EGFR wild-type, n = 241 TP53 wild-type EGFR mutant, n = 81 TP53 mutant EGFR wild-type, n = 144 TP53 mutant EGFR mutant). Statistical significance was evaluated using a multivariable linear regression model for EGFR mutation status and adjusted by age, sex, ancestry, and tumour purity.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is effective against many cancers, although resistance remains a major issue and new strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes1,2,3,4,5. Here we studied ICB response in a cohort of patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma—a cancer type that poses considerable clinical challenges and lacks effective therapies6,7,8. We observed significantly prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with tumours with PPP2R1A mutations. Importantly, our findings were validated in additional ICB-treated patient cohorts across multiple cancer types. Translational analyses from tumour biopsies demonstrated enhanced IFNγ signalling, and the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures at the baseline, as well as enhanced immune infiltration and expansion of CD45RO+CD8+ T cells in the tumour neighbourhood after ICB treatment in PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. Parallel preclinical investigations showed that targeting PPP2R1A (by pharmacological inhibition or genetic modifications) in in vitro and in vivo models was associated with improved survival in the setting of treatment with several forms of immunotherapy, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and ICB. The results from these studies suggest that therapeutic targeting of PPP2R1A may represent an effective strategy to improve patient outcomes after ICB or other forms of immunotherapy, although additional mechanistic and therapeutic insights are needed.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the management of many solid tumours but, disappointingly, have shown minimal efficacy in both advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer. Response rates to single agent programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in recurrent ovarian cancer are low1,2,3, ranging from 5% to 15%. Unfortunately, biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression, tumour mutation burden, BRCA1/2 mutation status and homologous recombination deficiency, have not been significantly associated with response or clinical benefit in patients with ovarian cancer treated with ICB therapies3,4,5.

Some data suggest that combination ICB targeting both PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 may be more effective in recurrent ovarian cancer. A randomized trial demonstrated a response rate of 31.4% in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer who received nivolumab (anti-PD1) plus ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), compared with 12.2% in those who received nivolumab alone4. Furthermore, patients in this trial with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC; a rare histological subtype associated with a worse prognosis compared with the more prevalent high-grade serous ovarian cancer, HGSOC6,7,8) demonstrated a fivefold greater odds of response compared with those with HGSOC4. Thus, patients with recurrent OCCC may especially benefit from ICB; however, the response rate in this group remains around 15%, suggesting that only a subset of patients with OCCC derive clinical benefit. On the basis of these observations, we prospectively enrolled patients with OCCC into a trial investigating the efficacy of dual ICB in the platinum-resistant setting (NCT03026062). During the course of this trial, we observed that patients whose tumours had inactivating somatic mutations in PPP2R1A—a gene encoding the most common scaffold component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex—demonstrated significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Critically, this finding was validated in external cohorts of patients treated with ICB. We also performed translational investigation of paired pretreatment and on-treatment tumour biopsies, revealing enhanced antitumour immune responses in those with PPP2R1A mutations. Beyond this, we conducted concurrent studies in several different preclinical models, which suggested that targeted inhibition of PPP2R1A enhanced anti-tumour immunity and treatment response in the setting of immunotherapy.

To better understand the biological correlates of the enhanced response to ICB, we investigated a cohort of 34 patients with platinum-resistant OCCC who were treated with a combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (Fig. 1a). All except one were enrolled on an investigator-initiated clinical trial of tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) treatment in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (NCT03026062). The remaining patient (patient 0) was treated on a separate clinical trial of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1; NCT01928394; Extended Data Fig. 1a). A summary of demographic and clinicopathological information for all patients is shown in Table 1. The median age at the time of study consent was 56.0 years (range, 36.0–78.0 years), and most of the patients were white (79.4%). The patients received a median of two previous lines of therapy (range, 1–9), with no previous ICB. The median follow up was 13.7 months (range, 1.0–70.3 months; Fig. 1b). In the overall cohort, the median OS was 14.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.8–22.9 months). The 6-month and 1-year survival probabilities were 0.68 (95% CI 0.54–0.85) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.41–0.75), respectively.

Source Data

Next-generation sequencing analysis of tumour biopsies identified ARID1A and PIK3CA somatic mutations or alterations in the majority of patients (73.5% and 55.9%, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In this cohort, 11 patients (32.4%) had somatic mutations in the PPP2R1A gene, which encodes the predominant scaffold subunit of the PP2A complex—a major cellular serine/threonine heterotrimeric phosphatase9. Most PPP2R1A mutations (n = 9; 81.8%) were located at the hotspot codon Arg183, with five patients carrying the R183W mutation and four carrying the R183Q mutation. The remaining two patients had S256F and W257G missense mutations, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1c). All of the observed mutations are known to impair the binding of the major scaffold A subunit (encoded by PPP2R1A) to the regulatory B subunits of PP2A, therefore conferring a loss of function9. Only one case of mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability (MSI) was identified among the evaluable tumours, and it was present in a patient with wild-type PPP2R1A, consistent with published literature demonstrating a low likelihood of mismatch repair deficiency or MSIhigh status in patients with OCCC10. Four patients (11.8%) had tumours with wild-type PPP2R1A but alterations in AKT genes: three of these had pathogenic single-nucleotide variants in AKT1 (E17K in patient 152, and both C77F and E151Q in patient 163) or AKT3 (R249H in patient 69), and one patient (patient 121) had an amplification in AKT2 (19q13.2) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Previous studies have found that E17K and C77F are activating oncogenic AKT1 mutations in solid tumours, and AKT2 amplification is a known driver of ovarian cancer pathogenesis11,12. We sought to specifically evaluate the impact of ARID1A, PPP2R1A and AKT mutations on the outcomes in this cohort based on observations in three ‘exceptional responder' patients with platinum-resistant OCCC who were treated with combination ICB and lived for over 5 years from the start of treatment. A brief clinical course of these patients is provided below.

The first patient (patient 0), who had a somatic PPP2R1A mutation (R183Q), received ipilimumab and nivolumab for 15 months and lived for 5.5 years (with disease) after her first dose of ICB. The other two exceptional responders (patients 31 and 69), who had PPP2R1A (R183W) and AKT3 (R249H) mutations, respectively, both received the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab and remain alive 5.8 and 5.1 years since the ICB treatment start, at the time of data cut-off. To put these outcomes in perspective, the median OS in patients with platinum-resistant OCCC after progression on frontline therapy is only 10.9 months13. All three of these patients also had somatic ARID1A mutations, which are associated with improved response to immunotherapy in several cancer types, yet such associations have not been reported for loss-of-function mutations in PPP2R1A or activating alterations in AKT14,15,16,17. These observations led us to hypothesize that somatic mutations in one or both of these genes may correlate with improved survival in other patients with OCCC treated with ICB.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the outcomes of patients with OCCC based on ARID1A and PPP2R1A mutation status to see whether these alterations are correlated with OS in the setting of ICB treatment. The small number of patients with AKT alterations (n = 4) limited specific analysis of this cohort individually. We observed a significantly longer OS in patients whose tumours had a PPP2R1A mutation compared with those without a PPP2R1A mutation (median OS 66.9 versus 9.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI 0.15–1.08; one-sided log-rank P = 0.031; Fig. 1c). There was also a significant difference in PFS, with PPP2R1A-mutation carriers having a median PFS of 3.0 months compared with 1.8 months for non-mutation carriers (one-sided log-rank P = 0.034; Extended Data Fig. 2). As 9 of the 11 patients with PPP2R1A mutations had concurrent ARID1A mutations, to discriminate between the prognostic effects of ARID1A and PPP2R1A mutations, we first evaluated the prognostic effects of ARID1A mutations in patients whose tumours were wild-type for PPP2R1A (n = 23; Fig. 1d). The wild-type and mutated ARID1A groups did not show a statistically significant difference in survival, with a median OS of 9.2 versus 5.1 months (one-sided log-rank P = 0.055; Fig. 1d). Next, we examined the OS in patients with PPP2R1A mutations within the subset of patients with mutated ARID1A (n = 25; Fig. 1e). In these cases, we still observed a trend toward longer survival after ICB in patients with OCCC with concurrent PPP2R1A mutations (OS, 66.9 versus 9.2 months; one-sided log-rank P = 0.047; Fig. 1e). In summary, these data suggest that PPP2R1A mutations may have a dominant effect in association with longer survival of patients with OCCC treated with ICB, although, due to the limited sample size in each subgroup, we cannot rule out the possibility that ARID1A mutations may also have independent prognostic value.

Examination of clinical course and responses in our cohort of patients with PPP2R1A mutations provided a key insight that the observed survival benefit was associated with delayed responses that sometimes followed a period of initial progression or stable disease (Fig. 1f–h). Note that, to guard against pseudoprogression, all of the patients in this study were enrolled on clinical trials that allowed for continuation of immunotherapy beyond apparent progression of disease as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v.1.1, which may have contributed to durable disease control in patients with PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. Moreover, higher rates of grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events were noted in PPP2R1A mutation carriers (45.5% versus 13.0% for non-carriers; P = 0.079; Table 1), which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating a positive correlation between immune-related adverse events and favourable outcomes in patients treated with ICB18.

The pretreatment tumour samples from 29 patients in the clinical cohort were obtained and profiled using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq); among these, 14 paired on-treatment samples were also analysed (Supplementary Table 1). In comparing the transcriptional profiles of pretreatment samples from patients with PPP2R1A mutations to those with wild-type PPP2R1A, we observed significant enrichment of the IFNγ response pathway in PPP2R1A-mutant samples, indicating activation of adaptative immune responses (Fig. 2a). The enhanced antitumoural immune responses in PPP2R1A-mutant cases were even more accentuated after ICB treatment, as revealed by the enrichment of multiple additional immune-response-related pathways, including inflammatory response, complement pathway, allograft rejection, IFNα response and IL-2 signalling (Fig. 2b). Notably, these differences in antitumoural immune responses remained significant even after accounting for potential confounding from AKT alterations (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).

Source Data

In longitudinal comparisons within the PPP2R1A-mutant group, significant upregulation of the IFNγ and IFNα response pathways was observed in the on-treatment samples compared with the baseline, indicating further immune activation with combined ICB therapies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistently, when comparing the composition of tumour-infiltrating immune cells based on immune cell deconvolution, increases in the relative and absolute proportions of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and activated natural killer (NK) cells were observed, along with a trend of upregulation in total T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) richness. This was also accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of resting NK cells (Fig. 2c–h, Extended Data Figs. 3d–i and 4). Conversely, these changes were not significant in the wild-type PPP2R1A group in longitudinal comparisons (Fig. 2c–h, Extended Data Figs. 3d–i and 4).

Given the inherent limitations of bulk RNA-seq data in revealing detailed immune cell phenotypes and the lack of spatial information, we further performed highly multiplexed spatial phenotyping of pretreatment and on-treatment samples using CODEX with a 26-antibody panel (Fig. 3a). A total of 378,868 high-quality cells from 28 samples was obtained for downstream analysis (Supplementary Table 1 and Methods). In the baseline tumours, PPP2R1A-mutant cases exhibited higher levels of intratumoural infiltration of MHC-II+ immune cells compared with the wild-type cases (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Furthermore, B cells (CD20+), particularly proliferating B cells (CD20+Ki-67+) and germinal centre B cells (CD20+CD21+Ki-67+), showed a trend of higher densities in PPP2R1A-mutant samples, despite the small cohort size (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Consistent with this finding, peritumoural secondary follicle-like tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were observed in three of these samples (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). As TLSs have recently been linked to favourable response to ICB19,20,21, our preliminary observations shed light on the importance of further evaluating the potential association between TLSs and PPP2R1A mutations in future studies based on larger cohorts. Finally, at the on-treatment timepoint, PPP2R1A-mutant samples also exhibited significantly higher densities of tumour-infiltrating immune cells, including CD45+CD56+ NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 5f,g).

To further examine the spatial relationships between tumour and immune cells, we conducted a multicellular neighbourhood analysis. A multicellular neighbourhood was defined as a collection of cells with centroids within 80 μm of a centre cell22,23,24 (Fig. 3e). Notably, we observed a significant upregulation of PD-1+CD8+ T cells in the neighbourhoods of tumour cells after ICB treatment in both PPP2R1A-mutant and wild-type cases (Fig. 3f–i, Extended Data Fig. 5h and Supplementary Table 2). PD-1 expression is known to be induced on T cells after activation and can persist until they reach a terminally exhausted state25. Furthermore, PD-1+CD8+ T cells have been shown to be increased in response to ICB therapies26,27. These findings suggest that ICB drugs were delivered to the tumour sites in both groups and elicited effective T cell responses. Nevertheless, CD45RO+PD-1−CD8+ memory T cells were uniquely upregulated in the tumour neighbourhoods of PPP2R1A-mutant cases after treatment, particularly around MHC-I+ tumour cells (Fig. 3f–i, Extended Data Fig. 5h and Supplementary Table 2). CD45RO+ memory T cells, which could serve as a replenishing pool for effector T cells, have been shown to mediate sustained responses to ICB therapy across multiple cohorts28,29,30. Thus, the lack of this population in wild-type PPP2R1A cases may account for the shorter duration of disease control and inferior outcomes. Finally, we observed an enrichment of NK cells in tumour neighbourhoods in PPP2R1A-mutant cases at both the pretreatment and on-treatment timepoints (Extended Data Fig. 5i,j). These results further complemented the RNA-seq analysis showing that activated NK cells were upregulated after ICB treatment in PPP2R1A-mutant cases. Together, these findings provided further evidence supporting the superior outcomes after ICB therapy in PPP2R1A-mutant OCCC.

When further examining the differences between long-term and short-term survivors within the PPP2R1A-mutant group, as dichotomized by median OS (Extended Data Fig. 6), enhanced antitumoural immunity was more evident in long-term survivors after ICB treatment. This was indicated by the enrichment of multiple immune signalling pathways, as well as upregulation of T cell and B cell lineage markers (such as CD3E, CD4 and CD79A/B), MHC class II molecules (such as HLA-DRA, HLA-DQA2 and CD74), lymphocyte activation or function markers (TNFRSF13B and GZMB), co-stimulatory molecule (CD86), immune checkpoint (PDCD1) and chemotaxis chemokines (CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4) (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).

Finally, we sought to further understand the role of AKT alterations, as several patients with tumours containing AKT alterations (wild-type PPP2R1A) in the study cohort exhibited responses to ICB. Notably, our preclinical data indicate that phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) was downregulated in the HEC50B cell line after CRISPR correction of PPP2R1A from mutant (R183W) to wild-type and upregulated in OVCAR429 cells after CRISPR editing of PPP2R1A from wild-type to mutant (R183Q) (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). These findings suggest that AKT activation is closely associated with PPP2R1A mutational status. Consistently, as described above, the AKT-altered cases in our clinical cohort exhibited multiple known genetic alterations that would lead to AKT activation. Next, we characterized the transcriptional profiles of these cases. RNA-seq data from pretreatment samples of three AKT-altered cases revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to IFNγ response, IFNα response and allograft rejection compared with those with wild-type AKT and PPP2R1A, providing a potential explanation for the efficacy of ICB treatment in this subpopulation (Extended Data Fig. 7e).

To further validate the immune-related phenotype of PPP2R1A-mutant tumours identified in our discovery clinical cohort, we used a series of in vitro and in vivo models. First, by reviewing previously published data31,32,33, we observed that PPP2R1A consistently ranked among the top hits in genome-wide CRISPR immune screens comparing T cell-treated and control groups, indicating that PPP2R1A knockout increased tumour cell sensitivity to T cell-mediated killing (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, we constructed PPP2R1A-knockdown SKOV3 cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 8a and Supplementary Fig. 1c). When exposed to tumour-reactive B7H3 CAR-T cells, the apoptotic rate of PPP2R1A-knockdown cells was significantly higher than the negative control (Fig. 4b). Similarly, treatment of the wild-type SKOV3 cell line with the PP2A-specific inhibitor LB-100 enhanced cancer cell killing by B7H3 CAR-T cells (Fig. 4c). However, these observations primarily reflect the influence of a reduction in normal PPP2R1A protein levels. To directly assess the impact of PPP2R1A mutation and align with our clinical observations, we established SKOV3 cell lines with stable overexpression of wild-type PPP2R1A and the P179R mutant (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). Consistent with the results above, cancer cells with the PPP2R1AP179R mutant showed increased sensitivity to CAR-T-cell-mediated killing (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, using CRISPR editing, we corrected the PPP2R1A gene from the R183W mutant in parental HEC50B cell line to the wild-type and, conversely, introduced the R183Q mutation in the OVCAR429 cell line which had wild-type PPP2R1A. We next engineered the parental and CRISPR-edited cell lines to overexpress human CD19 (hCD19) (Extended Data Fig. 8d), and exposed them to hCD19 CAR-T cells at varying effector:target ratios. Consistently, hCD19 CAR-T cells exhibited higher killing efficacy against PPP2R1A-mutant cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4e–g).

Moreover, endometrial cancers have the highest rates of PPP2R1A mutations among all cancer types. Thus, to further validate the role of PPP2R1A mutations in ICB response in vivo, we collected human endometrial cancer samples with and without PPP2R1A mutations and established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models on humanized BLT mice. The PPP2R1A mutational status of the PDX tumours was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Mice were randomized into two groups, receiving either anti-PD-L1 therapy or human IgG isotype control (Fig. 4h). After 3 weeks of treatment, significant reductions in tumour size and weight were observed in the anti-PD-L1 treatment group compared with the control group in PPP2R1A-mutant PDX models (Fig. 4i,j). By contrast, no therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 treatment was observed in wild-type PPP2R1A PDX models (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g), suggesting that PPP2R1A mutations specifically confer sensitivity to ICB treatment in this setting.

Notably, PPP2R1A-mutant OCCC cases often had concurrent ARID1A mutations (Extended Data Fig. 1b). To further rule out the potential confounding effect of ARID1A mutations on immunotherapy response and validate our clinical findings, we generated an isogenic Ppp2r1aR183Q mutant in an OCCC cell line derived from a conditional Arid1aflox/flox(Gt)Rosa26Pik3ca*H1047R genetic OCCC mouse model in the C57BL/6 background34 (Extended Data Fig. 8h). This set of mutations was based on the co-occurring mutations in PPP2R1A, ARID1A and PIK3CA seen in 15% of the overall cohort and 45% of PPP2R1A-mutant OCCCs in the trial (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These isogenic cells enabled us to establish syngeneic immunocompetent mouse models. After establishment of tumours to around 100 mm3, mice were randomized and treated with anti-PD-L1 or IgG control antibodies (Fig. 4k). As ARID1A inactivation also sensitizes tumours to ICB15,35, we reduced the dose of anti-PD-L1 to 2.5 mg per kg weekly based on the response in syngeneic tumours formed by Arid1a−/−Pik3ca*H1047R cells (Fig. 4l). This enabled us to show that tumour burdens, as measured by tumour size during treatment and tumour weight at the end point, were reduced by the anti-PD-L1 treatment in tumours formed by Arid1a−/−Pik3ca*H1047RPpp2r1aR183W cells compared with the IgG controls (Fig. 4m,n). Furthermore, in both models, anti-PD-L1 treatment was not associated with significant changes in mouse body weight, indicating that the treatment was well tolerated (Extended Data Fig. 8i).

On the basis of our findings in OCCC, we hypothesized that PPP2R1A loss-of-function mutations in other tumour types may also be associated with improved outcomes in patients treated with ICB. To test this hypothesis, we used cBioPortal36,37 to analyse two independent datasets: one cohort of 1,661 patients treated with ICB, and another cohort of 7,564 patients undergoing various treatments for advanced cancer. Patients with PPP2R1A mutations treated with ICB showed significantly longer OS (median OS not reached versus 18.0 months (95% CI 16.0–21.0 months), P = 0.033; Extended Data Fig. 9a). By contrast, no significant differences in OS were observed in patients with PPP2R1A mutations who received other therapies (Extended Data Fig. 9b; P = 0.638). Notably, the group with PPP2R1A mutations in the immunotherapy cohort encompassed a variety of cancer types and heterogenous concurrent mutations (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), therefore making it unlikely that the observed survival difference was driven by cancer-type-specific factors or by other mutations. Furthermore, the survival benefit associated with PPP2R1A mutations was also revealed in two additional cohorts including a total of 286 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma who were treated with ICB (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). However, the limited number of patients with PPP2R1A mutations in these cohorts precluded robust statistical analyses. Nonetheless, these aggregated data suggest that the correlation between PPP2R1A mutations and survival is not merely prognostic of better cancer treatment outcomes but, rather, is specific to patients treated with ICB, with potential relevance in cancers beyond OCCC.

Moreover, given the high prevalence of PPP2R1A mutations in endometrial cancer, and the fact that immunotherapy with the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab (len–pem) is an approved standard second-line therapy, we investigated the relationship between PPP2R1A-inactivating mutations and outcomes in a cohort of these patients. We identified 101 patients with high-grade endometrial cancer, comprising serous (n = 49; 48.5%), clear cell (n = 8; 7.9%), carcinosarcoma (n = 25; 24.8%), mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (n = 2; 2.0%) and mixed high-grade tumours (n = 17; 16,8%), who had undergone tumour somatic mutation analysis and were treated with len–pem. Among this cohort, 24 patients (23.8%) had endometrial cancers with PPP2R1A mutations. The patients were followed up for as long as 3.8 years. Patients with PPP2R1A-mutated tumours treated with len–pem had a longer OS compared with those with wild-type PPP2R1A tumours (median OS not reached versus 20.5 months; log-rank P = 0.051; Extended Data Fig. 10a). However, the median PFS was not significantly different between the two groups (7.5 versus 5.5 months; P = 0.246; Extended Data Fig. 10b). Analysis of only the TP53-mutated uterine tumours treated with len–pem revealed similar trends: the median OS was not reached in PPP2R1A-mutated patients versus 16.0 months in those without somatic PPP2R1A mutations (P = 0.027), and the median PFS was 7.5 versus 4.8 months, respectively (P = 0.199; Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). Finally, we also performed an analysis of wild-type ARID1A cases, and again observed a better OS, despite a similar PFS, in the PPP2R1A-mutant group (Extended Data Fig. 10e–h). Reminiscent of the results in OCCC cohort (Fig. 1e), these data further corroborated that PPP2R1A mutations could confer prognostic values independent of ARID1A status.

We identified a significant correlation between loss-of-function PPP2R1A mutations and improved OS in patients with OCCC, and possibly other cancers, who were treated with ICB. Although the exact mechanisms through which these somatic genetic changes improve the outcomes after ICB await further investigation, our data suggest that the presence of these mutations is associated with enhanced immune activation in the tumour microenvironment, and these effects are further boosted after treatment with ICB. Importantly, PPP2R1A mutations are not associated with improved survival of patients with OCCC in the setting of treatment with standard chemotherapy38; thus, this effect appears to be ICB specific, suggesting that these mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers for ICB response in this cancer type. With the use of in vitro and in vivo models, publicly available datasets and a retrospectively analysed endometrial cancer cohort, we were able to extend the positive correlation between PPP2R1A mutations and ICB sensitivity as well as the survival benefits brought by ICB to other cancer types.

In addition to serving as a potential biomarker for improved survival after ICB in OCCC and other cancers, the association between PPP2R1A mutations specifically and anti-cancer immunity probably has broader therapeutic significance for improving ICB outcomes. In this regard, there is compelling preclinical evidence that pharmacological inhibition of PP2A (the multimeric phosphatase of which the major scaffold component is encoded by PPP2R1A) improved the efficacy of ICB in syngeneic mouse models39. This study showed induction of synergistic anti-cancer immunity (including immunologic memory) by the combination of a PP2A inhibitor (LB-100) and anti-PD-1 ICB. The therapeutic role of LB-100 was mostly attributed to its direct influences on T cells, with enhanced CD8+ T cell activation, proliferation and trafficking to the tumour after treatment. Notably, these immunological effects were independent of changes in expression of TIM-3, OX40, CTLA-4 and LAG3, suggesting that there may be therapeutic opportunities for combining LB-100 with other immunomodulatory drugs beyond anti-PD-1 antibodies. Indeed, PPP2R1A genetic alterations in T cells were also proven to directly influence their functionalities. In a previous study, a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrated that downregulation of a PP2A regulatory subunit inhibited T cell apoptosis and enhanced T cell proliferation and cytokine production40. Lastly, knockout of PPP2R1A in regulatory T cells in mice leads to a severe and widespread lymphoproliferative autoimmune disorder, due to inability to suppress effector immune responses41.

Consistent with previously reported results39, our data also revealed that LB-100 could sensitize SKOV3 cells to CAR-T cell killing. Furthermore, as a complement, we also extended the cell killing assays to PPP2R1A knockdown and PPP2R1A-mutant cancer cell lines, so that the effects of altered PPP2R1A downstream pathways were fully attributable to cancer cells. Our results suggest that alterations in the cancer cell PPP2R1A pathway may also indirectly enhance T cell function. On the basis of previous studies, potential mechanisms include increased tumour DNA damage and enhanced neoantigen expression42. For example, PP2A inactivation has been shown to induce MSI in tumour cells or, through the production of cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), activate tumour-intrinsic type I IFN signalling in preclinical models of other tumour types43,44. Importantly, here we provide direct evidence of enhanced sensitivity of PPP2R1A-mutant human cancer to ICB by using humanized PDX models. The humanized immune system in the model could better mimic the potential effect of ICB in patients with somatic PPP2R1A mutations, and these data aligned well with our clinical findings.

Taken together, these preclinical studies support a functional link between PP2A loss/inhibition and enhanced anti-tumour immunity and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PP2A may represent a robust strategy for activating antitumour immunity due to its impact on both the tumour and microenvironmental cell compartments and the potential to provide benefit in patients without PPP2R1A mutations. It is tempting to hypothesize that the boosted immunological response observed in the PPP2R1A-mutation carriers in our study may be related to the loss of PP2A function in the tumour compartment alone. In the aforementioned preclinical studies, PP2A inhibition in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and loss of function in regulatory T cells were demonstrated to have important roles in immune activation; thus, systemic administration of a pharmacological inhibitor of PP2A may be associated with more rapid tumour regression by accelerating immune responses in both the tumour and immune cell compartments. Consistent with these observations, we have recently activated a phase Ib/II clinical trial of ICB and LB-100 in patients with OCCC who do not have somatic PPP2R1A mutations (NCT06065462). Finally, in this study we also observed an enrichment of NK cells, as well as their phenotypic transition to an activated state, in PPP2R1A-mutated OCCC after ICB treatment. Indeed, the vital roles of NK cells in mediating ICB efficacy and predicting ICB responses have been reported in recent preclinical and clinical studies45,46,47. Our findings further supported these observations and highlighted the potential for NK-cell-based immunotherapies in treating PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. However, further studies are warranted to provide deeper mechanistic insights and assess therapeutic efficacy.

Although these findings are provocative, limitations exist with regard to sample size and to the potential contribution of other mutations (such as those of ARID1A) on response to ICB in this cohort. Nonetheless, this study examined a rare cancer with translational analyses performed on unique clinical samples, and these data therefore represent a valuable contribution to the literature. Furthermore, this investigation provides evidence in support of the potential use of PPP2R1A as a predictive biomarker for prognosis after ICB and as a target to improve clinical outcomes in the setting of ICB therapy. Confirmatory studies in larger cohorts and deeper mechanistic studies with additional preclinical models are warranted.

The patients included in this analysis were identified through a retrospective review of all patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant or refractory OCCC (including clear cell carcinomas arising from peritoneal and fallopian tube origins), defined as progression within 180 days of a previous line of platinum-containing therapy, treated with ICB (MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) 2020-1098). The patients included in this analysis were treated on two different clinical trial protocols, both IRB approved by MD Anderson, in which combination CTLA-4 and PD-1/L1-targeting ICB was administered (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03026062 (n = 33) and NCT01928394 (n = 1)). Informed consent was obtained from all of the patients enrolled in the two trials before starting treatment. NCT03026062 was an open-label, adaptively randomized phase II trial of tremelimumab and durvalumab administered in combination or sequentially. Sequential therapy included tremelimumab 3 mg per kg every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses, followed by durvalumab 1.5 g every 4 weeks for up to 9 doses after progression. Combination therapy consisted of tremelimumab 1 mg per kg plus durvalumab 1.5 g every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses followed by durvalumab monotherapy (1.5 g for up to 9 doses or until progression). The outcomes for the non-OCCC histology cohorts were reported previously48. Notably, enrolment on this trial was amended, initially limiting it to patients with OCCC, and later further restricting participation to those with OCCC with inactivating PPP2R1A or activating AKT alterations. An additional patient included in this study received treatment on NCT01928394, an open-label phase II trial in which the patients were stratified by platinum-free interval and then randomized to different dosing schedules of nivolumab and ipilimumab. The participant included in this study received ipilimumab 1 mg per kg every 6 weeks plus nivolumab 3 mg per kg every 2 weeks until progression.

Demographic and clinicopathological information, including tumour somatic mutation testing and mismatch repair/microsatellite stability status, was collected from the medical record. Tumour mutation testing using next-generation sequencing was obtained as part of the patients' standard care either at MD Anderson Cancer Center or through a commercial lab (typically Caris or FoundationOne). Clinical DNA mutation testing was not available for two participants; in these cases, T200 next-generation sequencing was performed on their pretreatment biopsies as previously described49.

RECIST v.1.1, modified for immunotherapy50, was used according to the respective clinical trial protocols to assess the response. Independent radiology assessment was performed by experienced radiologists at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and progressive disease was determined on the basis of both the target lesion size as well as non-target lesion equivocal progression. The patients in the study were allowed to continue treatment beyond progression based on risk–benefit considerations. A swimmer plot was used to describe patient overall responses and outcomes. Spider plots and waterfall plots were used to describe target lesion responses, as revealed by the sum of tumour diameters, during the on-trial period. OS was calculated from the time of study registration to the earliest date of death or data cut-off (29 January 2024). PFS was calculated from the time of study registration to the date of disease progression or death or the last time of clinical evaluation. For patients 44, 115 and 126, owing to rapid disease progression leading to the patients' death, no tumour measurements were performed based on CT scan, and PFS was determined based on clinical criteria. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by variables of interest using one-sided log-rank rest. Within the cohort of patients with somatic PPP2R1A mutations, the patients were further dichotomized into long-term versus short-term survivors on the basis of the median OS for further translational analyses. Clinical data analysis was performed in R statistical environment (v.4.3.1; https://www.r-project.org/).

Pretreatment image-guided core biopsies, stored as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, were collected before the first dose of the study drug. On-treatment biopsies, also stored as FFPE samples, were performed when there was a lesion amenable to biopsy as assessed by the cycle 2 imaging study by an MD Anderson Cancer Center radiologist. When possible, on-treatment biopsies were obtained from the same area of tumour as the pretreatment biopsies. Samples were collected, labelled, processed and stored by the MD Anderson Cancer Center Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Bank for translational studies. Sample identification and associated patient-level data were entered into a secure database.

Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared using the KAPA Stranded mRNA-seq Kit (Roche). In brief, poly(A) RNA was captured from 10–250 ng of total RNA using magnetic oligo-dT beads. After bead elution and clean-up, the resultant poly(A) RNA was fragmented using heat and magnesium. First-strand synthesis was performed using random priming followed by second-strand synthesis with the incorporation of dUTP into the second strand. The ends of the resulting double-stranded cDNA fragments were repaired, 5′-phosphorylated, 3′-A-tailed and Illumina specific indexed adapters were ligated. The products were purified and enriched for a full-length library with 9–16 cycles of PCR. The strand labelled with dUTP is not amplified, resulting in a strand-specific library. The libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and assessed for size distribution using the 4200 Agilent TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equimolar quantities of the indexed libraries were then multiplexed 28 libraries per pool. The library pool was quantified by quantitative PCR, then sequenced on one lane of the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) S4 flow cell using the 100-nucleotide paired-end run format.

RNA-seq FASTQ files were processed through FastQC (v.0.11.5), a quality-control tool to evaluate the quality of sequencing reads at both the base and read levels, and RNA-SeQC (v.1.1.8) to generate a series of RNA-seq-related quality-control metrics51. All of the samples passed the quality checks for this study. STAR 2-pass alignment (v.2.7.0 f)52 was performed with the default parameters to generate RNA-seq BAM files. HTSeq-count (v.0.11.0)53 was applied to aligned RNA-seq BAM files to count for each gene how many aligned reads overlap with its exons. In the initial assessment of transcriptomic-level similarity and distinctions of all of the samples, two samples shown as significant outliers were removed from further analysis. Differential gene expression analyses were then performed using the R package DESeq2 (v.1.42.1)54, with raw count data as input. A ranked list of coding genes was generated based on the Wald statistic in DESeq2, and subsequently processed by GSEA55 using the R package clusterProfiler (v.4.6.2)56 against the Hallmark gene sets from Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB)57 to identify significantly enriched pathways. The false-discovery-rate-corrected q values were used for multiple-hypothesis-testing adjustment58. The HTSeq raw count data were then normalized to transcripts per kilobase million (TPM), and the TPM expression values were used as an input to the software CIBERSORTx59 (https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/) for immune cell deconvolution in each sample, using the default signature matrix LM22. Next, intergroup comparisons of the abundance of certain immune cell populations were performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed-rank tests. The results from above analyses were visualized using the R package ggplot2 (v.3.4.2). All of the downstream analyses were performed in the R statistical environment (v.4.3.1; https://www.r-project.org/).

The T cell and B cell receptor repertoires were reconstructed using TRUST4 (v.1.0.5.1)60 on the aligned RNA-seq BAM files. Repertoire richness was calculated as the total number of unique receptor sequences with >1 mapped reads, to account for singletons. Downstream data analysis was performed with the R package immunarch (v.1.0.0; https://immunarch.com/). The TCR and BCR richness was compared between PPP2R1A-mutant and wild-type samples. Only samples with detectable TCR/BCR were used for comparisons. Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were performed for comparing paired samples and the entire cohort, respectively.

A multiplexed barcoding image analysis platform was performed using methods and reagents similar to those previously described61. Using the PhenoCycler Fusion platform (Akoya Biosciences) staining kit (Akoya, 7000008), the antibody cocktail was prepared by combining staining buffer, N blocker, G blocker, J blocker, S blocker and all barcoded antibodies, including pan-cytokeratin, CD45, CD3e, CD8, CD4, CD45RO, granzyme B, CD56, CD20, CD19, CD21, FOXP3, PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, OX40, CD73, CD39, CD68, ARG1, CD206, CD31, HLA-DR, Ki-67, CD33, MHC-I and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (detailed information of the antibody panel is provided in Supplementary Table 5). The slides were placed in a plastic humidity chamber, and 190 µl of antibody cocktail, including all of the markers above, was dropped onto the sample and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Next, a 96-well reporter plate (Akoya, 7000006) was prepared containing barcoded fluorophores according to custom-designed multiplex barcoding experiments. Each well was filled with 245 µl of a solution containing the reporter and specific barcode fluorophores for that cycle and placed into the PhenoCycler Fusion instrument (Akoya Biosciences). Each cycle will have 2 or 3 antibodies plus their specific barcode fluorophores and DAPI. At the end of each cycle, each image from the tissue sample was captured at a high magnification of ×20 using the PhenoCycler Fusion fluorescence microscope (Akoya Biosciences). Then, the signal was erased to start a new cycle until the desired antibody image panel was complete. Experienced pathologist analysed each tissue sample using image analysis software (QuPath v.0.4.4)62. For image analysis, the whole section of the tissue was divided into a tumour compartment, characterized by the nets of tumour cells, and the stroma compartment, the tissue between the tumour nets; and then the individual cell boundaries were determined using the pretrained StarDist algorithm within QuPath63. Marker co-expression was used to identify specific cell phenotypes in the tumour and stroma compartments. The data were preprocessed to be consolidated using the R package phenoptr (v.0.2.2, Akoya Biosciences). The densities of cell phenotypes (marker co-expression) were expressed as the number of cells per mm2. The cell densities were then compared between PPP2R1A-mutant and wild-type PPP2R1A samples using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Multicellular neighbourhood analysis was performed, with each multicellular neighbourhood defined as a collection of cells of which the centroids were within 80 μm of the centre cell. The majority of multicellular neighbourhoods contained 50–200 cells (mean, 116 cells; median, 99 cells), which aligns with recent studies22,23,24. Each cell in the images was taken as the centre iteratively to obtain a neighbourhood composition vector. In such a way, a neighbourhood composition matrix was constructed for the whole dataset. The neighbourhood compositions of certain cell types were then compared between different timepoints or sample groups using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

To generate PPP2R1A knockdown cell lines, SKOV3 cells were transduced with retrovirally expressed shRNAs. Fully synthesized dsDNA fragments (Twist Bioscience) encoding gene-specific shRNAs were inserted into the pSuper.retro.puro (VEC-PRT-0002, OligoEngine) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To generate retroviral supernatants, HEK293T cells were seeded 16 h before transfection and transfected with the retroviral vectors encoding different shRNAs (Supplementary Table 6), along with lentiviral packaging plasmids, pCMV-VSV-G and pBS-CMV-GagPol (8454 and 35614, Addgene) by the jetPRIME transfection reagent (101000046, VWR) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Viral supernatants were collected at 48 h after transfection and filtered by 0.45 μm PVDF Syringe Filter Unit (SLHV033NK, Millipore-Sigma) to remove cell debris. Designated titres of retrovirus were used to infect cells in the presence of 8 μg ml−1 hexadimethrine bromide (107689, Sigma-Aldrich). A series of genetic modified cell lines was generated by sorting GFP+ cells 72 h after retrovirus transduction. Cells transduced with shRNA with the non-target control were used as negative-control cells. Subsequent immunoblot assays were performed to assess the knockdown efficacy.

To ectopically express wild-type PPP2R1A and the P179R mutant in SKOV3 cells, dsDNA fragments encoding human open reading frames (ORFs) of wild-type PPP2R1A (NM_014225.6) and the P179R mutant were inserted into the lentiviral vector, pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 (PT4064-5, Takara Bio). To generate lentiviral supernatants, HEK293T cells were seeded 16 h before transfection and transfected with the lentiviral vectors encoding wild-type PPP2R1A and P179R mutant, along with the lentiviral packaging plasmids pCMV-VSV-G and psPAX2 (8454 and 12260, Addgene), using the jetPRIME transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The viral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and filtered as previously described. Designated titres of lentivirus were used to infect cells in the presence of 8 μg ml−1 hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma-Aldrich). Stable cell lines were generated by sorting GFP+ cells 72 h after lentivirus transduction. Cells transduced with empty vector pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 were generated and used as control cells.

To perform adenine base editing (ABE) targeting the c.547C>T mutation of the PPP2R1A gene in HEC50B cells, the primer for the single guide RNA (sgRNA) was designed as TGCGGCCCGCCGCACCATGG and was synthesized by IDT. The sgRNA was cloned into pLentiCRISPR V2 (Addgene, 83480). ABE8e (Addgene, 138489) was used for ABE64. To remove Cas9 from the vector, the pLentiCRISPR V2 vector was digested with XbaI and BamHI. A PCR fragment for ABE8e containing an overlapping cloning site with the digested vector was inserted into the vector using the ClonExpress Ultra One Step Cloning kit (Cellagen C115-01). The following oligonucleotides were used for PCR: forward, 5′-GAACACAGGACCGGTTCTAGAGCCACCATGAAACGGACAG-3′; reverse, 5′-AAGTTTGTTGCGCCGGATCCGACTTTCCTCTTCTTCTTGGGCTCGA-3′. The resulting plasmid was used for lentivirus packaging and infection. Single clones were then selected and validated for editing efficiency by Sanger sequencing. To introduce R183Q (c.548G>A mutation) targeting the PPP2R1A gene in OVCAR429 cells, cytosine base editing (CBE) was used. The primer for the sgRNA was designed as CTGCGGCCCGCCGCACCATG and was synthesized by IDT. The sgRNA was cloned into lentiGuide-puro (Addgene, 52963). For CBE, hyBE4max (Addgene, 157942)65 was used and cloned into pLentiCas9-blast (Addgene, 52962) using the same cloning protocol mentioned above. The resulting plasmids were used for lentivirus packaging and infection. Single clones were then selected and validated for editing efficiency by Sanger sequencing. Notably, the CBE induced two mutations, c.548G>A and c.549G>A, ultimately leading to the amino acid change from Arg (CGG) to Gln (CAA).

Furthermore, we also generated HEC50B and OVCAR429 overexpressing hCD19 for downstream cytotoxicity assays using a similar approach to that described previously66. In brief, the hCD19 ORF was obtained from the Wistar Institute Molecular Screening and Protein Expression Facility, and then PCR-amplified and cloned into pLVX-M-puro vector (Addgene, 125839). HEK293T cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 for lentivirus packaging. Lentivirus was collected and filtered with 0.45 mm filter 48 h after transfection. Cells infected with lentivirus were selected in 1 μg ml−1 puromycin or 1 μg ml−1 blasticidin 48 h after infection. The cells were then analysed using flow cytometry. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA (PBS/BSA). APC anti-human CD19 antibody (BioLegend, 302212) was used at a 1:20 dilution. After staining, cells were then washed twice with cold PBS/BSA buffer, resuspended in this buffer and analysed using flow cytometry.

To generate R183Q (c.548G>A mutation) targeting the Ppp2r1a gene in Arid1a−/−Pik3caH1047R mouse ovarian clear cell cancer cells, CBE was performed using the sgRNA 5′-CAGCGGCCCGCCGCACCATG-3′ synthesized by IDT. In brief, the sgRNA was cloned into sgRNA-expressing vector containing a mCherry marker (Addgene, 210212). hyBE4max-eGFP (Addgene, 157942) and sgRNA expressing plasmid (10 μg) were co-transfected into 6 cm dish using polyethylenimine (MedChemExpress, HY-K2014). After 72 h, transfected cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting through the selection of positive eGFP and mCherry expression. Single clones were then selected and validated for editing efficiency by Sanger sequencing.

Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89901) with protease/phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32959) on ice for 30 min. Proteins were denatured using SDS loading buffer (Bio-Rad, 1610747) at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were then separated by SDS–PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, 1620115). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-AKT1 (Cell Signaling, 4691, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-phospho-Thr308-AKT1 (Cell Signaling, 4056, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 5174, 1:3,000), rabbit anti-PPP2R1A (Cell Signaling, 2041, 1:1,000) and mouse anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling, 3700, 1:3,000). Objective signals were amplified with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling, 77074) and detected by chemiluminescent substrate (Bio-Rad, 34094). The intensity of protein bands was detected using the ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and quantified using the Image Lab software (v.5.2.1 build 11).

Human T cells were activated by priming human CD3+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of the healthy donor with human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (11161D, Gibco) and 200 U ml−1 IL-2 (rhIL-2; Prometheus Laboratories, NDC Code 65483-116-07) for 24 h. During the activation, T cells were transduced with human B7H3-(SS1)-hBBZ-CAR encoding g-retrovirus to make T cells targeting human B7H3 in the presence of 10 μg ml−1 protamine sulfate (P3369, Millipore-Sigma) by centrifugation for 2 h at 1,800 rpm at room temperature. Transduction rates of CAR vectors were >85%.

The construction of hCD19 CAR-T was performed similarly to as described previously66. In brief, the FMC63 mouse-derived anti-human CD19 single chain variable region67 was synthesized by Genscript and cloned into the pTRPE lentiviral expression plasmid backbone68. An EF1a promoter drives the expression of a GFP reporter upstream of a T2A cleavage site, followed by the chimeric antigen receptor consisting of the FMC63 mouse anti-human single chain variable region followed by the CD8a hinge, CD28 transmembrane domain, the CD28 intracellular costimulatory domain and the CD3z chain.

SKOV3 cells were prestained with CFSE (565082, BD Bioscience) according to the manual and seeded into the 96-well plate with round-bottom wells before the LB-100 (S7537, Selleck Chemicals) treatment. Tumour cells were mixed with paired B7H3 CAR-T cells at an effector:target ratio of 1:1 at 37 °C for 3 h. The percentage of activated caspase-3+ cells in tumour cells, stained with active caspase-3 antibody (C92-605, 560626, BD Bioscience), was assessed using LSRFortessa X-20 Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences) and used to determine the tumour apoptosis rate induced by tumour-reactive T cells.

A set of genetically modified SKOV3 cell lines was plated into six-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well in completed medium). The next day, the 6-day cultured B7H3 CAR-T cells were co-cultured with SKOV3-derived cells at an effector:target ratio of 1:1 overnight. Next, dead cells and T cells were gently washed twice with prewarmed PBS. Adherent cells were collected using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and stained with Trypan Blue for manual cell counting. The killing efficiency was calculated as (1 − number of live cells in T cell treated group/number of live cells in control group) × 100%.

For the cytotoxicity assay of the HEC50B and OVCAR429 cell lines, 10,000 target cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates. hCD19 CAR-T cells were co-cultured with target cells at each effector:target ratio in RPMI 1640 fully supplemented in the absence of cytokines. For treatment, the cell medium was changed every 2 days with appropriate CAR-T cells for a total of 4 days. Next, colonies were stained with 0.05% crystal violet and the integrated density was measured using NIH ImageJ (v.1.54g).

The generation of humanized-bone marrow, liver and thymus (Hu-BLT) mice69,70 was performed at The Wistar institute in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved protocols (201360 and 201533). In brief, 6-to-8-week-old female NSG mice (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, Jackson Laboratory) were housed and maintained in individual microisolator cages in a rack system capable of managing air exchange with filters. The room temperature, humidity and pressure were controlled. Mice were maintained at 22–23 °C with 40–60% humidity and under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle. All of the mice were pretreated by busulfan at 30 mg per kg and were then implanted with human fetal thymic tissue fragments and fetal liver tissue fragments under the mouse renal capsule. After surgery, the mice were injected through the tail vein with CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells isolated from human fetal liver tissues. Human fetal liver and thymus tissues were procured from Advanced Bioscience Resources with The Wistar Institute IRB 21809310.

PDXs were generated using human endometrial tumour samples obtained from Christiana Care under IRB CCC-41045. HLA-A genotyping was performed with fetal liver and PDX tumour. In brief, genomic DNA of human tumour and fetal tissues was extracted using the Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (NEB, T3010S). The HLA-A locus sequence was determined using the Olerup SSP HLA-A genotype kit (CareDx, 101.401-48). The third passage of the collected PDX tissue was transplanted subcutaneously into the Hu-BLT mice under aseptic conditions. Tumour samples were prepared by cutting endometrial PDX tumour chunks into small pieces of around 1 × 2 × 2 mm. Then, 2 weeks after PDX implantation, the mice were randomly assigned into two treatment groups: anti-PD-L1 antibody (Selleck, A2013) and human IgG1 isotype control (Syd Lab, PA007125) (4 mg per kg body weight in 100 μl PBS intraperitoneally, twice a week). After 3 weeks of treatment, the mice were euthanized 1 week later, and the tumours were surgically dissected. The tumour burden was assessed based on tumour weight.

The study protocol was approved by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (protocol number, 00002399-RN00). For syngeneic models, 2 × 106 mouse OCCC cells were subcutaneously injected into 6-to-8-week-old female immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (027, 2159769, Charles River Laboratories). Mice were maintained under the same housing conditions as the PDX models, as described above. Then, 9 days after injection, the mice were randomly assigned into two treatment groups: anti-mouse PD-L1 antibody (BioXcell, BE0101) or an IgG2b isotype control (BioXCell, BE0090) (2.5 mg per kg body weight in 100 μl PBS intraperitoneally, once a week). The body weight and tumour size were measured twice a week. After 2 weeks of treatment, the mice were euthanized and the tumours were surgically dissected. The tumour burden was assessed based on tumour weight.

IACUC guidelines of The Wistar Institute and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were followed in determining the time for ending survival, such as when the tumour burden exceeded 10% of the body weight or the tumour size exceeded 2 cm in any direction. The limits were not exceeded in both the PDXs and the syngeneic mouse models.

Pharmacy records were queried in November 2023 to identify patients with uterine or endometrial cancer who received len–pem combination therapy over the past four years (from September 2019 to November 2023). Demographic and clinicopathological data, including cancer histology, mismatch repair/microsatellite stability status and tumour somatic mutation testing, were abstracted from the medical record under MD Anderson IRB approved protocol 2020-1098. The following histologies were included: serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma and mixed high-grade carcinoma, given the relatively higher prevalence of PPP2R1A mutations in these high-risk histologies. The patients were also stratified by TP53 status, given that most OCCCs are wild-type TP53, while most high-grade endometrial carcinomas are TP53-mutated. Patients who never actually received len–pem, those with MSI-H/dMMR tumours and those who had no available imaging after starting treatment were excluded. PFS was calculated from the treatment start date to date of radiographic progression or last imaging study (if no progression). Patients who stopped treatment owing to toxicity were censored at the time of initiation of a new line of therapy. OS was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by PPP2R1A mutation status using two-sided log-rank tests.

Mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data of tumour patient plasma samples present opportunities for improving cancer detection. Here we generate plasma proteomic profiles from 2,251 pan-cancer patient samples and investigate potential diagnostic biomarkers. Proteomic subtyping with different dominant tumour types links proteomic features and clinical indicators such as tumour stage. The highly immune-activated subtype, consisting of renal and bladder cancers, shows elevated glucose–insulin metabolism and reduced lipid metabolism. Comparison of the plasma proteome before and after surgery indicates that proteome patterns could be used to monitor post-surgery therapeutic effects. We also develop a binary classified model that distinguishes between tumour types and healthy controls, as well as a multicancer model for pan-cancer classification of proteins that could be useful biomarkers, and validate their performance in an independent cohort. In addition, we find that the plasma proteome, along with clinical indicators, whole blood cells and so on, can distinguish the pathological subtypes of specific tumour types. This study portrays a pan-cancer plasma proteomic landscape, providing information on plasma biomarkers that could help in discovering diagnostic opportunities.

Researchers have discovered a dramatic and unexpected shift in the Southern Ocean, with surface water salinity rising and sea ice in steep decline.

Since 2015, Antarctica has lost sea ice equal to the size of Greenland -- the largest environmental shift seen anywhere on Earth in the last decades. The Southern Ocean is also getting saltier, and this unexpected change is making the problem worse.

For decades, the ocean's surface freshened (becoming less salty), helping sea ice grow. Now, scientists say that trend has sharply reversed.

Using European satellite data, research led by the University of Southampton has discovered a sudden rise in surface salinity south of 50° latitude.

This has coincided with a dramatic loss of sea ice around Antarctica and the re-emergence of the Maud Rise polynya in the Weddell Sea - a huge hole in the sea ice nearly four times the size of Wales, which hadn't occurred since the 1970s.

The findings were published on June 30 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Dr Alessandro Silvano from the University of Southampton who led the research said: "Saltier surface water allows deep ocean heat to rise more easily, melting sea ice from below. It's a dangerous feedback loop: less ice leads to more heat, which leads to even less ice.

"The return of the Maud Rise polynya signals just how unusual the current conditions are. If this salty, low-ice state continues, it could permanently reshape the Southern Ocean -- and with it, the planet. The effects are already global: stronger storms, warmer oceans, and shrinking habitats for penguins and other iconic Antarctic wildlife."

In these polar waters, cold, fresh surface water overlays warmer, saltier waters from the deep. In the winter, as the surface cools and sea ice forms, the density difference (stratification) between water layers weakens, allowing these layers to mix and heat to be transported upward, melting the sea ice from below and limiting its growth.

Since the early 1980s, the surface of the Southern Ocean had been freshening, and stratification had been strengthening, trapping heat below and sustaining more sea ice coverage.

Now, new satellite technology, combined with information from floating robotic devices which travel up and down the water column, shows this trend has reversed; surface salinity is increasing, stratification is weakening, and sea ice has reached multiple record lows -- with large openings of open ocean in the sea ice (polynyas) returning.

It's the first time scientists have been able to monitor these changes in the Southern Ocean in real-time.

Contrary to the new findings, man-made climate change was generally expected to sustain Antarctic Sea ice cover over the coming years.

Aditya Narayanan, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Southampton and co-author on the paper, explains: "While scientists expected that human-driven climate change would eventually lead to Antarctic Sea ice decline, the timing and nature of this shift remained uncertain.

"Previous projections emphasized enhanced surface freshening and stronger ocean stratification, which could have supported sustained sea ice cover. Instead, a rapid reduction in sea ice -- an important reflector of solar radiation -- has occurred, potentially accelerating global warming."

Professor Alberto Naveira Garabato, co-author of the study and Regius Professor of Ocean Sciences at the University of Southampton added: "The new findings suggest that our current understanding may be insufficient to accurately predict future changes."

"It makes the need for continuous satellite and in-situ monitoring all the more pressing, so we can better understand the drivers of recent and future shifts in the ice-ocean system."

The paper Rising surface salinity and declining sea ice: a new Southern Ocean state revealed by satellites is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and is available online.

The project was supported by the European Space Agency.

How China Could Win the Race to Return Rocks from Mars

Launching in 2028, China's Tianwen-3 Mars sample return mission could bring Red Planet rocks back to Earth as early as 2031—years ahead of competing U.S.-European efforts

By Andrew Jones edited by Lee Billings

China's first Mars rover, Zhurong, with its Tianwen-1 landing platform, which touched down on the Red Planet in May 2021. The mission's success aided China's development of the more ambitious Tianwen-3, which is a Mars-bound sample-return mission slated to launch in 2028.

On May 14, 2021, China's Tianwen-1 lander plummeted from space to streak through the skies above Mars's vast plain of Utopia Planitia, with an aeroshell protecting it from the heat and plasma of its high-speed atmospheric entry. After unfurling its parachutes and pulsing its engines to zero in on an amenable landing site, the spacecraft touched down safely onto the Red Planet, where it deployed a rover, Zhurong, to explore the surrounding alien landscape. This engineering feat was hugely significant, confirming China as a major player in planetary exploration. With Tianwen-1's touchdown, China became the only other nation ever to successfully land on Mars besides the U.S. Moreover, the mission also paved the way for a far more ambitious and unprecedented project.

That project, Tianwen-3, is set to launch via two Long March 5 rockets from Wenchang spaceport on the Chinese island of Hainan in late 2028. One launch will carry Tianwen-3's lander, while the other will transport the mission's Mars orbiter, which is also an Earth-return vehicle. The mission aims to collect samples of Martian rock and soil for delivery back to Earth, where subsequent studies could, potentially, redefine our understanding of life itself and our place in the cosmos.

“Tianwen-3 will be the first mission aiming to bring back material from another planet to search for signs of life,” says Li Yiliang, a professor of astrobiology at the University of Hong Kong and one of the authors of a paper published in Nature Astronomy on June 19 that offers new details on the mission. (Tianwen-2, another Chinese sample return mission, launched in May 2025 but is bound for a near-Earth asteroid as well as a comet; China has also pulled off two successful lunar sample return missions, Chang'e 5 and Chang'e 6.)

Tianwen-3 will use the same approach as Tianwen-1 to make planetfall in a yet-to-be-selected landing area. The vagaries of spacecraft engineering, however, demand the site should be somewhere in the midlatitudes of the planet's northern hemisphere; it also must be at an altitude of at least three kilometers below the planet's average elevation so that more of Mars's thin air can serve to slow Tianwen-3's descent. The lander will use proven tech from China's lunar explorations, drilling as deep as two meters for subsurface samples and scooping up material from the surface. Additionally, a helicopter drone—following the lead of NASA's pioneering Ingenuity flights—will collect selected additional rock and loose particle samples from within around 100 meters of Tianwen-3's landing site.

The lander will operate for around two months on the surface, in which it will use scientific payloads such as a ground penetrating radar and a Raman spectrometer to gather more data on the broader geological context for collected samples. When the time comes, it will fire off a solid rocket booster to send a canister containing at least 500 grams of material into Mars orbit to dock with the waiting orbiter-returner spacecraft. The eventual return trip should bring Tianwen-3's samples home sometime in 2031.

Once on Earth, the samples will be swiftly secured and transported to a custom-built Mars sample laboratory, where they'll be extensively analyzed while carefully following “planetary protection” policies meant to prevent any potential otherworldly cross-contamination.

Although Tianwen-3's objectives range from investigating Mars's interior to studying its wispy atmosphere, scientists working on the mission are most eager for what it might reveal about the planet's possible former or even extant life. If, in fact, anything ever dwelled on the Red Planet, then Tianwen-3's samples could conceivably contain various telltale signs of its presence—so-called biosignatures.

A convincing biosignature could come in different types, Li says. For example, Tianwen-3's scientists will be seeking molecules directly produced by Martian organisms to fulfill known biochemical functions, akin to the DNA and RNA molecules that life-forms on Earth rely on to store and transmit genetic information. Another biosignature is biogenic isotope fractionation—the distinctive way that living organisms alter the natural ratios of stable isotopes in their ecosystems; on Earth, for instance, biochemical processes such as photosynthesis prefer the lighter carbon-12 rather than heavier carbon isotopes, leading to detectable shifts in the proportions of these isotopes with respect to the surrounding environment. A third approach, Li adds, would be to look for fossil evidence, such as the imprints that microbes may leave behind in mudstones and other fine-grained sedimentary rocks.

China's astrobiological focus for its Martian explorations is “a laudable, ambitious goal,” says Mahesh Anand, a professor of planetary science and exploration at the Open University in England. “This is exactly what we have been recommending over the years: to look for any signs of biogenic activity or even just to understand that there was a habitable environment. The rest of the global planetary science community would love to get answers to these questions.”

China's approach is simpler in many ways than the U.S.-led Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, which is a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). MSR's workhorse, NASA's Perseverance rover, is already on Mars, where it has spent more than four years collecting dozens of carefully selected samples from Jezero Crater, a diverse site harboring an ancient river delta and other complex geological features that may preserve evidence of past life. In contrast, Tianwen-3's sampling will be limited to its immediate surroundings, which will probably be more drab—because although a boring, flat landscape may be of less astrobiological appeal, it is far easier to land on. And the spacecraft's landing ellipse—the area within which Tianwen-3 is most likely to touch down—spans some 50 by 20 kilometers, meaning a precision touchdown to visit any especially alluring targets is highly unlikely.

But, largely because of its greater complexity and cost, MSR is under threat of cancellation from the Trump administration following years of delays and cost overruns. The project's potential elimination, however, would be only one of many grievous blows to NASA's science, the funding for which the Trump administration has proposed to cut by nearly half.

“The reason why NASA went with Perseverance as this first step was so that you would have this curated, intentionally selected and well-recorded process and contextual process of where these rocks came from,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a U.S. space science advocacy group. “This isn't intended in any way to denigrate the achievements of the Chinese robotic program, but in general I think you can characterize a lot of [its] framing as symbol-driven and capability-focused over the direct science return.”

China's more basic engineering-led plan, with the science trailing after, may put limits on the questions Tianwen-3 can realistically answer. But this methodical, step-by-step approach to progressively building and demonstrating critical capabilities is exactly what has now positioned China to take the lead in the race to return rocks from Mars. Meanwhile, the far more elaborate MSR has floundered.

Dreier says that this moment, in which the U.S. appears to be ceding leadership in this area to China, will have implications for global space exploration.

“The U.S. needs to lead and work with its allies to continue to invest in these big, bold efforts to make potentially historic discoveries,” Dreier says. If the White House has its way, he adds, then Perseverance's samples might only find their way back to Earth after an even more complex, expensive and distant human spaceflight program led by SpaceX lands astronauts on Mars. Which means, for now, China will get its shot at a major first in space exploration.

“The way I look at it is that China is starting to explore Mars,” Anand says. The richer science on offer from a complex MSR-style plan is enticing, he says, but sticking to simplicity and clearly achievable near-term results “probably has a higher chance of returning science than planning on something that might take decades.”

U.S. and European scientists have for generations seen obtaining samples as a “holy grail” for Mars exploration. For China, retrieving Martian material fits into the strategic framework of its broader, solar system-encompassing Tianwen program, the name of which translates to “heavenly questions.” Beyond Tianwen-3 and its already-launched asteroid-and-comet-bound sibling Tianwen-2, there is also Tianwen-4, slated for liftoff around 2029, which will target the Jupiter system and its intriguing Galilean moon Callisto. Future missions in the Tianwen series, including to the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, are also under consideration.

For Li, Tianwen-3 remains the Tianwen program's most compelling project, in part because its path to Mars and back is so straightforward; although lofty, its objectives still appear eminently within reach. “It is important for humanity to understand its position in the solar system and the universe,” he says, because this would mark a profound milestone in human history. And, on the threshold of attempting to bring back the first samples from Mars—with the possibility of finding the first-ever evidence for alien life within them—China is now uniquely poised to achieve this milestone.

Gene therapy for congenital deafness has shown promising results in children but lacks data in older populations. We conducted a single-arm trial of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-OTOF gene therapy using the Anc80L65 capsid in ten participants with autosomal recessive deafness 9 aged 1.5 to 23.9 years at five sites in China. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability within 5 years, and secondary endpoints assessed auditory function. Initial findings from the ten patients with 6–12 months of follow-up, including one patient who received two injections, revealed that the therapy was well tolerated, with 162 grade I/II adverse events. Decreased neutrophil percentage was the most common event (16 of 162). All ten participants had at least 6 months of follow-up and improved their pure-tone-average hearing level from baseline 106 ± 9 (mean ± s.d.) to 52 ± 30 decibels (dB). Other secondary endpoints showed similar improvements, including the average click auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold, the tone-burst ABR threshold and the auditory steady-state response (101 ± 1 to 48 ± 26 dB, 91 ± 4 to 57 ± 19 dB and 80 ± 14 to 64 ± 21 dB, respectively). Post hoc analyses were conducted to evaluate the timecourse and factors contributing to the hearing improvement. Therapeutic effect was rapid, taking 1 month to achieve most of the overall hearing improvement. On an individual level, click and tone-burst ABR thresholds, but not the auditory steady-state response, reliably predicted the behavioral pure-tone-average thresholds after 4 months (R2 = 0.68, 0.73 and 0.17, respectively). An age-dependent therapeutic effect was observed, with optimal outcomes in 5- to 8-year-olds. These preliminary results show that AAV-OTOF was safe and well tolerated in patients ranging from toddlerhood to adulthood. The trial remains ongoing and requires extended follow-up to confirm the long-term safety and efficacy. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05901480.

For Dolphins, Echolocation May Be More Like ‘Touching' Than ‘Seeing'

Dolphins seem to “feel” their way across the sea with narrow, sweeping beams of sonar

It's midnight in a pitch-dark parking lot. Trying to unlock your car, you fumble and drop the keys. You squat down and run your hand across the invisible pavement. To the left, you feel a firm, rubbery tire. Reversing course, you pass over jagged pebbles and papery leaves. Finally your fingers discover—and instantly close around—a notched piece of metal. This kind of tactile exploration may be the closest we can get to imagining the experience of dolphin echolocation, say the authors of a study on dolphin brains that was recently published in PLOS ONE.

We typically imagine echolocation as “seeing” with sound—experiencing auditory signals as a world of images like the ones our brains typically create with light from our eyes. Like sonar, which turns sonic waves into visual representations, echolocators emit sounds and then decode spatial and textural information in the echoes that bounce back. And when Russian scientists inserted electrodes into the heads of dolphins and porpoises in the 1970s and 1980s, they reported detecting brain activity in the visual cortex while the animals heard sounds. “It made a neat little story because you have visual and auditory [brain regions] right next to each other,” says Lori Marino, a neuroscientist and president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, who was not an author of the new study but is mentioned in its acknowledgments section. She adds, however, that thanks to today's more precise technology, “the whole [research] landscape is changing.” Although we still can't translate echolocation perfectly into human terms, the new findings suggest a better metaphor: “touching” with sound.

Dolphin echolocation functions in the brain differently than human echolocation, which, for those who learn the skill, is primarily processed in the visual cortex. To pinpoint the neural mechanisms behind the dolphin variety, the researchers compared preserved brains from three echolocating dolphin species with that of a sei whale, which is closely related but doesn't echolocate. They measured the diffusion of the movement of water molecules along nerve fibers—like cars along a highway, as Marino puts it—to better understand which parts of the brain interact in living dolphins and in sei whales. Contrary to the earlier Russian research, there seemed to be nothing exceptional occurring in the dolphins' visual cortex. Instead an entirely different stretch of neural highway caught their attention: the one linking the inferior colliculus to the cerebellum.

In dolphins, as in humans, the inferior colliculus is a relay point for auditory input after it enters the ear, and the cerebellum is where information from senses and bodily movements gets combined to rapidly calculate the body's next best move. “Anytime you need to move quickly, decisively, and without consciously deliberating, your cerebellum comes alive,” says Peter Cook, a comparative neuroscientist at the New College of Florida and senior author of the new study. He and his colleagues found a strong connection between these two brain structures in the dolphins but not in the sei whale. So just like touch does in humans, echolocation seems to rely heavily on the cerebellum's precise motor control and the tight feedback loop it promotes between sensation and motion—and less so on the visual cortex. “Every time you move, you get different feedback,” Cook says. “And every time the feedback changes, you change how you're moving. It's like this constant circle of sensory, motor, motor, sensory.”

This makes sense to lead author Sophie Flem, a master's student at the New College of Florida. If you need to constantly fine-tune your movements to home in on prey, Flem says, “it does seem intuitive that something like a cerebellum would really help.” And there's another way in which echolocation seems more like touch than vision: a dolphin's sonar beam is far narrower than our visual field. Whereas we take in 180 degrees at a glance, dolphins move their beam around and build spatial understanding gradually—like a human groping for dropped keys in the dark. Still, it would be hubris to presume we know for certain what an animal's echolocation actually feels like. “There may be things other animals do for which there is no model in our sensory system,” Marino says. “We just have to realize that.”

The Permian–Triassic Mass Extinction (PTME), the most severe crisis of the Phanerozoic, has been attributed to intense global warming triggered by Siberian Traps volcanism. However, it remains unclear why super-greenhouse conditions persisted for around five million years after the volcanic episode, with one possibility being that the slow recovery of plants limited carbon sequestration. Here we use fossil occurrences and lithological indicators of climate to reconstruct spatio-temporal maps of plant productivity changes through the PTME and employ climate-biogeochemical modelling to investigate the Early Triassic super-greenhouse. Our reconstructions show that terrestrial vegetation loss during the PTME, especially in tropical regions, resulted in an Earth system with low levels of organic carbon sequestration and restricted chemical weathering, resulting in prolonged high CO2 levels. These results support the idea that thresholds exist in the climate-carbon system whereby warming can be amplified by vegetation collapse.

The latest Permian to Early Triassic (~252–247 million years ago; Ma) was a period of intense environmental and biotic stress1,2. During the Permian–Triassic Mass Extinction (PTME) at ~252 Ma, around 81–94% of marine invertebrate species and 89% of terrestrial tetrapod genera became extinct2. It is generally agreed that the PTME was driven by volcanogenic carbon emissions from Siberian Traps volcanism, potentially coupled with additional thermogenic releases, resulting in intense greenhouse warming3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. A major negative excursion in carbonate δ13C ratios, over a time interval of about 50–500 thousand years (kyrs), supports the notion of a major carbon cycle perturbation4,5,6. However, it is not well understood why the extreme hothouse climate persisted throughout the 5 million years (Myrs) of the Early Triassic. The precise time interval of Siberian Traps degassing is uncertain, although the main phase of volcanism occurred around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB), possibly with a further pulse about two million years later, during the Smithian Substage of the Early Triassic8. Nevertheless, it would normally be expected that atmospheric CO2 and global surface temperature should have declined to pre-volcanism levels within ~100 kyr of the volcanic pulses, due to amplified global silicate weathering and/or increased burial of organic carbon2.

The unusual multimillion-year persistence of super-greenhouse conditions has sparked considerable debate, and it has been suggested that it may be linked to a change in the silicate weathering feedback, such that CO2 could not be efficiently removed from the surface system11. This could potentially have been due to reduced availability of weatherable material from erosion11, which would limit global silicate weathering rates12,13. Alternatively, continental weathering may have been rapid and accompanied by high rates of reverse weathering in a silica-rich ocean, removing silicate mineral-derived cations into clays instead of forming carbonate minerals, and thus limiting overall CO2 drawdown14,15. These are intriguing hypotheses, but it remains unclear why a severe reduction in global erosion, and/or an episode of high ocean silica levels, would necessarily persist for ~5 Myrs and then recover during the Middle Triassic. Although uncertain, existing compilations of sedimentation rates16,17 and the maintenance of sporadic siliceous rock records across and after the PTME18 (see Supplementary Fig. S1) are not clearly supportive of these timings, and suggest that while these processes likely contributed to climate regulation, our understanding of the timeframe of super-greenhouse conditions remains incomplete.

Here, we explore a further mechanism for elevated Early Triassic temperatures that is closely tied to the timeframe of extreme warmth. This approach is based on the concept of an ‘upper temperature steady state', in which a change in the Earth system caused the climate-carbon cycle to stabilize at a much higher global temperature for millions of years19. Specifically, we investigate the hypothesis that the key driver of the transition to a super greenhouse Earth was the dramatic and prolonged reduction of low-latitude terrestrial biomass caused by the PTME20,21 and its delayed recovery22. Tropical peat-forming ecosystems are responsible for substantial drawdown of CO2, but these extensive biomes were lost at the end of the Permian20,23,24,25. Indeed, plant species richness and abundance dropped significantly during the Permian–Triassic transition, which is the only genuine mass extinction level event of land plants through the whole Phanzerzoic26, leaving a multimillion year “coal gap” in the Early to Middle Triassic where terrestrial plant materials did not build up as peat20,23,25. To test this hypothesis, we quantify the distribution of terrestrial plant productivity across the PTME and Early-to-Middle Triassic from the plant fossil record and use this information to guide a linked climate-biogeochemical model of the Early Triassic hothouse, testing whether these biotic changes may have resulted in a higher temperature steady state.

Our plant fossil database, including macrofossil and palynology data from the latest Permian to the Middle Triassic, is summarized in Fig. 1 and further detailed in Supplementary Tables S1–S3. Non-marine chronostratigraphy comes from recently published data (Fig. S3, “Methods” 1), with lithological, sedimentary features, and clastic strata thickness in each basin evaluated for the influence of taphonomy on plant fossil and biomass preservation (see SI text 1 for details). Considering the correlation resolution achievable for terrestrial strata, this study uses a stage-level resolution as used in previous studies on the Permian-Triassic transition20. Having correlated localities using carbon isotope stratigraphy and mercury peaks, we show, using plant biomarker data from many localities, the collapse of terrestrial floras occurred around the Permian-Triassic Boundary, with most losses in the latest Permian27,28. Statistical methods, including Squares and interpolation diversity testing, were used to evaluate the influence of fossil sampling intensity, and demonstrate that our approach is robust to variation in fossil density at the global scale (see “Materials and Methods” 4 for details) (Fig. 2).

A Trees show clustering of flora in each area by plant family composition, with the corresponding climate zone abbreviation listed on the branches. The climate zones are highlighted by color bar. The name of the late Permian Changhsingian climatic group from previous studies is listed after the climate zones in brackets. Areas lacking macro plant fossil records do not have associated branches and are classified using palynological data. B Floras indicated by plant macrofossils, microfossils and tetrapod fossils. The small pie charts represent the floras studied, showing the plant composition, with the number of species shown by the size of the pie chart. Legend abbreviation: gymno. (gymnosperm), pelta.

This plant classification is only applicable to the late Permian to Middle Triassic and cannot be directly applied to other time intervals. The palaeogeographic reconstructions are from the PALEOMAP Project (http://www.scotese.com/Default.htm).

Plotted in 15-degree latitude bins for each stage. Horizontal coordinates show taxa number and vertical coordinates show latitude. Shading shows ‘high latitudes' (-45°–−90° and 45°–90°) and ‘low-middle latitudes' (−45°–45°). Bins with less than three species have been plotted as ‘0', while missing points indicate an estimated diversity of more than three times the observed value. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

As fossil plants are typically fragmented prior to fossilization, all plant fossil records were normalized20,29 to reduce artefacts of palaeobotanical nomenclature (see “Methods” 2 for details). Normalization compensates for the palaeobotanical practice of assigning different plant organs (e.g., roots, stems, leaves, cones and seeds) of the same plant to separate fossil genera and species20. We selected a plant organ whose fossil taxonomy is most likely to reflect the whole plant taxonomy and omitted other organs that belong to the same plant group, to avoid duplication29. As an example, normalization removed ~20% of the South China Changhsingian macro plant species as duplicates20. We identified parent plants of plant microfossil (spore and pollen) data where known, to supplement plant macrofossil records. Plant macrofossils mostly recorded the lowland vegetation landscape, while plant micro fossils also record upland plant species richness information20,29,30.

Diversity estimates and inferences from plant morphological traits were used to construct climate-linked plant biomes, then this information was collectively used to extrapolate biomes across corresponding climate zones (see “Methods” 5 for details). The analysis of plant character and function across palaeogeographic regions involved three steps. First, plant morphological traits related to physiological functions were extracted from plant fossils. Among all plant functional traits, whole plant height and shape, position in the flora, leaf size, vein type, vein density and relative cuticle thickness, which are related to plant productivity, biomass and water requirements/resistance to drought, were measured or semi-quantitatively estimated in late Permian to Middle Triassic plant fossils (Table S5)31,32. Floras were assigned using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system according to their habitat information within the plant functional traits (see “Methods” 5 for details, Table S6). For example, gigantopterids are assigned to the rainforest group with giant leaves, ‘drip tips' and intricate vein networks, indicating their high moisture requirements and high efficiency of carbon and nutrient transport, similar to recent angiosperm dominant rainforest20,31,33,34. The Cathaysian flora with a high proportion of gigantopterids is of high spatial complexity, including a canopy of tall Lepidodendron lycopod trees, diverse understory tree ferns and sphenophytes, and gigantopterids and ferns, supporting the presence of widespread late Permian rainforests in the South China Lowland (see Supplementary Table S5, S6). Secondly, the floristic information from the known floras and fossil plants was assigned to the less known floras by comparing the similarity in plant taxon composition (see “Methods” 6 for details). The floral comparison is partly based on macrofossil family level clustering, and partly on the species richness in each morphological category. Thirdly, we expanded our reconstructed plant distributions beyond the fossil evidence by assuming they would colonize any regions of tolerable climate—aiming to capture ‘hidden' communities such as the upland gymnosperms recorded in the palynological record20,25,29,35 (see “Methods” 7 for details). Plant fossil records combined with lithological indicators of local climate (e.g., coals, evaporites, tillites), were transferred onto a palaeogeographic grid map with a resolution of 40 × 48 (Fig. 3). These local (i.e., per grid box) data were then used collectively to extrapolate biomes across corresponding climate zones. Terrestrial tetrapod fossil occurrences served as an indicator for the existence of vegetation to aid in extrapolation, whereas lithological indicators of aridity are used to prevent extrapolation into desert regions (see “Methods” 8 for details) (Fig. 3).

See Methods for details. ‘Plant fossil occurrence' represents raw plant fossil data (Supplementary Table S1 and S2), ‘Land tetrapod+Plant fossil' represents terrestrial tetrapod occurrence data superimposed on land plant fossil data (Supplementary Table S3), ‘Vegetation Zone' is the interpolation of that data using lithological indicators of climate zonation (Supplementary Table S5), and NPP is reconstructed based on the present day (Supplementary Table S6 and S7). End Permian Changhsingian: M, N, O, P; Early Triassic Induan: I, J, K, L; Early Triassic Olenekian: E, F, G, H; Middle Triassic Anisian: A, B, C, D; Modern world: Q. All maps are centered around 0,0. Tetrapod data is from Allen et al.36 The palaeogeographic reconstructions are from the GEOCLIM model.

Figures 1 and 2 highlight the more substantial extinction of low–middle latitude (−45°N–45°S) tropical–subtropical vegetation, especially lowland forests, during the PTME, with 86% macrofossil species extinction in low–middle latitudes, as opposed to 66% in high latitudes (see Table S5). The published local sedimentological and lithological surveys from Siberia, Xinjiang, NW China, SW China, Utah, western Europe, South Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and Argentina, spanning a broad spectrum of latitudes from north to south, show that the ‘coal gap' after the PTME was not associated with a significant loss of river or delta sediments in these areas (Figure S3, see “Methods” 9 for details). The existence of low diversity pioneer floras in South China indicates that the preservation window was not closed even in some Early Triassic low-latitude areas with the highest post-PTME temperatures and extinction magnitude20. Therefore, it appears that the removal of vegetation (especially lowland plants), rather than taphonomy, was likely the main cause of the low plant abundance, low sedimentary organic carbon contents, and general lack of other plant-related chemicals such as biomarkers in sediments during the Early Triassic20. Before the PTME, plant macrofossil species richness was greatest in low–mid latitude areas, while after the crisis, high latitude richness was much higher (Figs. 1B, 2). Although we compiled all published fossil data known to us, and investigated the sedimentary facies and thickness of documented sections to minimize the influence of taphonomic bias, the complexity of the Earth system remains challenging to fully reconstruct. Nevertheless, we believe that this study offers valuable approaches to addressing this issue and represents a significant step toward improving our understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of flora during the PTME and its aftermath.

The reversal of the modern latitudinal diversity gradient is also seen in terrestrial tetrapods after the PTME36, suggesting that this biogeographic transition may have been ubiquitous across ecosystems on land. The tetrapod “Dead Zone” between 30°N and 40°S may reflect the extinction of terrestrial primary producers in low–middle latitude lowland areas with limited upland survivors37 (Figs. 1B, 2). The latitudinally symmetric pattern of the terrestrial biosphere suggests that the primary extinction mechanism had a similarly distributed spatial impact. Evidence suggest that the various potential factors related to volcanism, including acid rain, heavy metals, toxic gases, UVB radiation, and climate change, may have possibly contributed to the terrestrial extinction2,9,24,38,39,40,41. Among these, climate change induced by LIP activity stands out for its global and latitudinal effects22. Application of the HadCM3 climate model suggests that extreme climatic consequences—such as El Niño-driven intensified heat stress and seasonal aridity—were prevalent in low- to mid-latitude regions9. These regions notably lack plant and tetrapod fossils after the PTME, suggesting that these climate changes likely served as a primary driver of terrestrial extinctions9.

Figure 1A and S2 show that the global terrestrial palaeophytogeographical feature of the Permian–Triassic interval is the replacement of the low-latitude tropical Cathaysian flora, the low–middle latitude temperate–subtropical Euramerica flora, the high-latitude boreal Angara flora, meridional Gondwana flora, and mixed floras, by a uniform herbaceous lycopod-dominated flora in the Early Triassic, in general accord with previous studies with more limited global coverage20,21,42,43. During the PTME, high latitude areas such as Siberia, and high-altitude areas at low to middle latitudes including parts of China, the Middle East and Euramerica, provided a refuge, while the expansion of high temperatures and seasonal aridity saw the loss of most lowland and marsh plants in the lower latitudes of the Early Triassic20,25,30,35,44,45,46. According to the plant functional traits recorded in macrofossils, the pre-extinction lowlands from low to high latitude around the Tethys Ocean were covered by arborescent forests with a canopy layer possibly reaching 50 m high, which were replaced by herbaceous ground covers with heights from 0.05 to 2 m in most low to middle latitude areas (Fig, 2; Table S5). In parallel to the reduced plant height and floral spatial complexity, leaf size also decreased in both compound and simple leaf groups, inferring that high productivity forests were replaced by smaller biomass communities with lower productivity in lowlands20,30,35 (Table S5). Thus, while plant global diversity may not have suffered a catastrophe at the PTME in upland areas45, the diversity and biomass in low-middle latitude lowland areas was substantially reduced20,23,25. After the inhospitable Induan stage (251.9–249.9 Ma), plants gradually migrated out from refuge areas during the Olenekian stage (249.9–246.7 Ma). Further recovery in the Middle Triassic Anisian stage (246.7 ~ 241.5 Ma) saw tropical biomes reappear at low latitudes, as well as the resumption of coal deposition20,23 (Fig. 1).

To produce a map of palaeo-productivity from our distribution of biomes, we rely on evidence from the present47. Key Carboniferous plants likely had growth and transpiration rates similar to modern angiosperms47. Therefore, we assume that Permian to Triassic plants, either related or analogous to these Carboniferous species or resembling modern plants, functioned like today's angiosperms and gymnosperms47,48,49 (see “Methods” 8). The Net Primary Productivity on Land (NPPL) of each grid cell in our palaeogeographic reconstructions (Fig. 3) was determined using these nearest living plant functional type that shares a similar plant size and form, basic spatial structure, function, diversity, geographic location and climate zone. Within each plant functional type, there is normally more than one recent flora that fits the requirement of each palaeo flora, and these recent floras are arranged from high to low NPPL to run the sensitivity tests, with only the highest and lowest members shown in Table S7. Here, we aim to generate the general land vegetation productivity trend across the PTME in a consistent comparative system within the palaeo- and modern plant functional types rather than using vegetation modeling. This is because although dynamic vegetation models have simulated similar NPPL to our Changhsingian estimates, they do not yet incorporate experimental data on plant response to extreme hothouse conditions like those of the Early Triassic49,50.

Our NPPL estimates based on these palaeogeographic reconstructions show fluctuations from ~54.4–62.5 Pt C/yr in the latest Permian Changhsingian, to a low of ~13.0–19.7 Pt C/yr in the Early Triassic Induan (a loss of ~70%), followed by Olenekian values of ~25.0–32.2 Pt C/yr, with ~53.8–63.5 Pt C/yr in the Anisian. Before the PTME, the global terrestrial productivity gradient correlated with latitude, with the highest values in the tropics, similar to the modern world48,51. However, this trend dramatically reverses after the PTME, as regions of high productivity migrated from low-to-high latitudes, before gradually re-establishing the previous gradient during the Olenekian and Anisian stages (Fig. 3). Comparison of fossil-based reconstructions are broadly consistent with simplified plant thermal adaption modeling22,48 and show loss of low to -mid latitude forests, survival at higher latitudes, and a major productivity collapse post-extinction.

Our fossil-based reconstructions thus far represent ‘biogeographic productivity', which we define as a productivity metric that does not consider the effects of CO2 fertilization. This mechanism would be expected to increase productivity, given generally higher CO2 in Earth's past19,51,52 and especially in the Early Triassic7. To test the biogeochemical and climatic effects of these shifts in plant biogeography while also taking CO2 fertilization into account, we use our palaeobiogeographic reconstructions as inputs to the SCION Earth Evolution Model52,53. SCION is a global climate-biogeochemical model that links steady-state 3D climate54 and surface processes to a biogeochemical box model55. It calculates continental weathering rates at each grid point on the land surface based on local temperature, runoff and erosion rates, as well as an assumed biotic enhancement factor (fbiota). In order to calculate Net Primary Productivity on Land (NPPL) in SCION, we used the biogeographic productivity estimates from our maps (Fig. 3), and then added an established function for the CO2 fertilization effect56 (see “Methods” 10), based on the modeled CO2 concentration at the current model timestep. The land vegetation productivity after the CO2 fertilization effect has been applied is named NPPLf.

We then modified the biotic weathering enhancement factor (fbiota) based on the fossil-based NPPLf in each grid cell, allowing for a 4-fold enhancement between the most and least productive grid cells as a conservative estimate (see refs. 57,58,59 for a range of estimates of this factor, and Methods 10 and 11 for model runs with different factors). In order to modify the global rate of organic carbon burial, we summed the total fossil based NPPLf for each time period and used this to scale the flux of terrestrially derived organic carbon burial (see Methods 10 for details). Marine productivity and organic carbon burial is also calculated in the model based on limiting nutrient availability52. Aside from these biotic changes, the SCION model retains the Phanerozoic scale forcing information from previous standard runs52, including background tectonic CO2 degassing. The only abiotic alteration to the model was to include additional CO2 degassing from the Siberian Traps60, which accurately reproduces the shorter term (~500 kyr) carbon isotope perturbations across the PTME (Fig. 4D). The model is initialized at 300 Ma with present day CO2 concentration, but quickly achieves a long-term steady state equivalent to the Phanerozoic-scale model52.

The vegetation NPP is prescribed onto the land surface in the SCION model (A) and affects the model calculations for organic carbon burial and the biotic enhancement of continental weathering (B). The model is run with (green solid line) and without (black dashed line) the fossil-prescribed NPP, where both models include the Siberian Traps degassing. C Ocean 87Sr/86Sr compared to McArthur et al.116 (blue solid line). D Carbonate δ13C compared to the dataset of Sun et al.10 (blue solid line with points). E Atmospheric CO2. F Surface air temperature at chosen timepoints. G Equatorial surface air temperature (SAT) compared to the equatorial SSTs of Sun et al.10 (blue solid line with points). All the geological records have been correlated based on chronostratigraphic correlation with the GTS (2020). The palaeogeographic reconstructions are from the GEOCLIM model.

Figure 4 shows the SCION model results through the latest Permian, and the Early and Middle Triassic, both with and without the inclusion of our palaeo-vegetation constraints. In the control run (dashed black line), the biogeographic NPP of each continental grid cell is kept constant at 420 g C/m2/yr to produce an overall productivity similar to our late Permian fossil-constrained vegetation map, and all changes in the model environment are driven by abiotic forcings, such as background tectonic degassing rates and Siberian Traps degassing. The major features of this default run are the spikes in CO2 concentration and temperature (Figs. 4E, 4G), and the accompanying δ13C excursion (Fig. 4D), driven by Siberian Traps degassing. The magnitude of the isotope excursion is consistent with the geological record and previous modeling5,60, and CO2 concentration rises from about 1,500 to 3,000 ppm, with a corresponding increase in equatorial surface temperature of about 2°C. The high background CO2 level and relatively small temperature increase are both features of the low climate sensitivity in the FOAM climate model61, which provides the steady state 3D climate emulator for SCION. Thus, we expect that a more complex model might allow for a more dramatic temperature increase and lower overall CO2 levels, as suggested by some proxy data7,10. However, no amount of climate model complexity can account for the data-model mismatch during the Early Triassic, where model temperatures decline immediately after the cessation of Siberian Traps emissions. Because SCION has a single-box ocean, it does not balance sub-million-year alkalinity and shallow sea carbonate deposition as accurately as multi-box models, in which CO2 levels decline even more rapidly60.

When included in the model, the loss of vegetation productivity from the end Permian through the Early Triassic, and the related effects on continental weathering, result in a sustained high atmospheric CO2 content7 and high Early Triassic temperatures10 (green line in Fig. 4C). In these model runs, the reduction in terrestrial organic carbon burial and nullification of silicate weathering result in CO2 levels stabilizing at around 7000 ppm, with maximum equatorial surface temperatures of up to 33–34 °C over a ~ 5 Myr period, which is consistent with proxy inferences (Fig. 4)7,10. As before, low climate sensitivity in our model results in predictions of high CO2 concentrations, although the magnitude of predicted increase (~4 fold) is broadly equivalent to that suggested by proxies7. The modeled Early Triassic δ13C level (green line in Fig. 4D) is also around 2–3‰ lower than the control run (black dashed line in Fig. 4D), generally improving the fit to the geological record10 (blue solid line with dots in Fig. 4D). Two exceptions to the data-model fit are the Induan–Olenekian (Dienerian–Smithian) boundary and the late Olenekian (early Spathian), which are marked by transient positive carbon isotope excursions that may have been driven by increasing marine productivity, transgression, or marine anoxia8,10, none of which are considered in our stage level study. Model strontium isotope ratios, which are influenced by continental weathering fluxes and source lithologies, are not greatly affected by the inclusion of vegetation collapse, but show a slightly greater rise between the Changhsingian and Anisian as weathering migrates to higher latitudes and away from low latitude suture zones with low 87Sr/86Sr values62 (Fig. 4C, see Supplementary Fig. S4 for lithological map, and Methods 11). Our SCION model demonstrates how the prolonged hothouse environment could have been terminated by progressive terrestrial ecosystem recovery, starting in the Olenekian but accelerating in the Anisian, which is also consistent with the observed uptick in δ13C values across the Olenekian–Anisian boundary and the cooling which occurred during this time10. This dynamic fits with broader evidence for a more benign environment during the re-establishment of diverse ecosystems in Middle Triassic terrestrial settings20,35. A ‘CO2 fertilization' effect occurs in the model in the early stages of warming, before atmospheric CO2 and land surface temperatures reach saturation point for C3 plant photosynthesis. However, this increased local productivity in some areas was insufficient to offset the global decline in biomass abundance.

In our model scenario, the reduction in continental silicate weathering intensity caused by decreased plant productivity had a greater impact on increasing atmospheric CO2 than the direct effect of a decline in organic carbon burial (see Fig. S6). This is because while the large reduction in terrestrially derived organic carbon burial acts to increase CO2 levels, it also decreases atmospheric oxygen levels and redistributes nutrients to the ocean, meaning that more marine organic carbon is produced and preserved, and less fossil organic carbon is weathered. Several limitations of our approach may be responsible for under-predictions of the magnitude of temperature rise. The negative feedback on the organic carbon cycle may be too strong, which may be why SCION fails to replicate more rapid variation in Phanerozoic atmospheric O252. Additionally, the weathering of sedimentary organic carbon likely increases with temperature63, which is not accounted for in the model, and may nullify these negative feedbacks further. A further uncertainty in our modeling is the degree to which plants amplify continental weathering, as shown in Figure S6, with the ‘best guess' values from Phanerozoic-scale models of plant weathering strength (being a 4–7 fold enhancement52,57.) producing different magnitudes of warming. Previously suggested mechanisms for Early Triassic warmth, such as limited erosion rates or amplified reverse weathering, also potentially played a part in the extreme warmth11,14. They are not included in our model due to the difficulty in quantifying their magnitudes and their timeframes of operation, but they could feasibly raise CO2 and surface temperature further.

Our study provides a quantitative estimation of changes to global palaeo-plant biomass and corresponding long-term environmental impacts. Through our modeling, we show that the large and prolonged decrease in tropical plant productivity in the Early Triassic likely resulted in a world that was lethally hot by Phanerozoic standards, a consequence of substantially weakened terrestrial carbon sequestration rates. These conditions persisted for nearly five million years and cooling was only achieved as plant productivity began to increase in the Middle Triassic. We believe this case study indicates that beyond a certain global temperature, vegetation die-back will occur, and can result in further warming through removal of vegetation carbon sinks. Our study demonstrates that thresholds exist in the Earth system that can accelerate climate change and have the potential to maintain adverse climate states for millions of years, with dramatic implications for global ecosystem behavior.

The geological timings used in this paper are from the Geological Time Scale (GTS) 2020. Selected study areas (and sites) are the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia, Junggar Basin (Dalongkou section) in Xinjiang, NW China, eastern Yunnan and western Guizhou in SW China, Utah in USA, Germanic Basin in western Europe, small Tethyan continents, now incorporated in southeastern Asia, Turkey in the Dead Sea area, Kashmir in NW India, Karoo Basin in South Africa, Sydney Basin in Australia, Prince Charles Mountains in Antarctica, and Argentina, covering the published plant fossil bearing areas from various latitudes (Fig. S2). We reviewed the published chronostratigraphic correlations between the floral records, other environmental events, and the lithological Permian-Triassic Boundary in each area to determine the global pattern of plant evolution. Chronostratigraphy of the non-marine strata is correlated by fossil assemblages including animals and plants, detrital zircon ages, and geological events recorded by geochemical proxies. The detailed records and analysis of each location are provided in the Supplementary Information text 1.

From the evidence noted in the SI part 1, it is clear that end-Permian terrestrial crisis happened in the late Changhsingian over an interval starting 750 kyrs before the PTB up to shortly after the boundary20,64,65,66,67. In high latitudes, the macrofossil records show Cordaites in Siberia and the Glossopteris flora in Gondwana disappeared in the mid to late Changhsingian68,69. An abundant flora of ferns, seed fern peltasperms, cycadophytes and conifers survived through the PTB in the high latitudes20,68,69. In our analysis, plant fossil occurrences were noted at the stage level giving the impression that all the plant changes were near the PTB.

Plant macrofossils are typically fragmented into different parts (organs) prior to fossilization, with each part often named separately using Linnean binomials29,70. We normalized the dataset to correct for duplications in which different parts of the same plant are included under different species or genus names, and ensured the same taxa with different morphological names could be linked. In normalization, organs such as species or genera of seeds, trunks, roots and leaves are removed from the dataset if another organ from that plant group is more likely to reflect the whole plant taxonomy, so that each whole plant is counted only once29,70. An example is the diverse trunk group of tree lycopods, where species of Lepidodendron are used as they are abundant and systematically informative29,70, rather than other organs produced by the same plant, including cones, sporophylls (fertile leaves) or roots (see ref. 20 for detail). For diverse leaf groups, for example, ferns and sphenophytes, leaf species or genera are used, as these fossils typically lack more distinctive organs with suitable preservation. Indeterminate species denoted as “sp.” of an existing genus are regarded as likely to be poorly preserved examples of the existing species of that genus, and are deleted. If the indeterminate species denoted as “sp.” is the only species in that genus, they are counted as a single, unnamed species. Normalized plant macrofossil species data is listed in Table S4. In addition to these, palynological occurrences are also considered. Most of the palynological data are linked with plant macrofossils at family level, with a few spore and pollen taxa preserved in-situ within their parent plant for which the genus and species names of the parent plants are used.

All the species occurrences presented are based on the normalized data (Table S1). Longitude and latitude for each fossil location are listed in Table S2 and S3. The high latitude area is defined to be >45 degrees north and south of the equator, while low-middle latitude area is <45 degrees north or south. This definition is for this study only and is not climate specific. The range of plant fossils in each stage was checked and extended for calculating the extinction magnitude over a global high-latitude and low–middle latitude area. The extinction magnitude for each stage is the extinct species number compared to a later stage, minus the total normalized species number of this stage20. See the extinction magnitude results in Table S4. The extinction magnitude of the Anisian is not estimated.

To investigate the influence of plant fossil sampling completeness on our estimates of diversity, squares and interpolation methods were applied to our normalized plant macrofossil occurrence data. As for the raw data, squares and interpolation were applied to 15° latitude bins for the Late Permian (Changhsingian) to Middle Triassic (Anisian). Coverage-based interpolation uses the abundance structure present within samples, to either subsample or extrapolate diversity estimates to particular levels of sampling completeness, known as quorum levels36,71,72. This was applied using the R package iNEXT36. Squares is an extrapolator based on the proportion of singletons in a sample and is thought to be more robust to biases associated with small sample sizes and uneven abundance distributions73,74.

Throughout the interval, the raw, squares and interpolated diversity estimates generally show similar latitudinal patterns, suggesting that sampling is not a strong influence on our inferred latitudinal diversity gradients (Fig. 2). However, many of the points in the interpolated curves were removed due to over-extrapolation, which indicates that many of the spatio-temporal bins may be under-sampled. Our results indicate that during the Induan, the highest plant diversity was found in the high latitudes, particularly in the northern hemisphere. However, during the Changhsingian, Olenekian and Anisian, we see higher diversity levels at tropical latitudes, suggesting that the latitudinal diversity gradient had reverted to a situation similar to that of the present day one to two million years after the PTME.

Plant functional traits are stable morphological, anatomical, and compositional characters that have evolved under specific climates and environments, linking plant physiological processes to the Earth's biogeochemistry and physical evolution31,32,75,76. The plant functional traits of late Permian to Middle Triassic fossil plants are not well studied. Here, we aimed to determine the habitat of the fossil plants, the climatic zone in which they lived and to semi-quantify the biomass of the flora. We selected plant traits including plant growth form, reconstructed plant height, which indicates the spatial structure of the flora, and leaf size, which indicates the potential biomass of the flora. For water, carbon and nutrient cycling in the plant, leaf shape, vein pattern and density, and cuticle thickness are considered, which determines the plant's moisture preference, drought resistance, and productivity31,32. Cuticle thickness of present Ginkgo is positively related to productivity, although this is not further explored in our dataset due to the lack of experiments on these Permian-Triassic plant's recent analogs31.

Leaf size and vein density were measured using ImageJ, and only the largest and most complete leaves of each taxon are listed in the table S5, with fossil plant data collected from references in the supplementary table references. Other traits, including plant form, whole plant height, vein type, and cuticle thickness, are semi-quantified and are based partly on the reconstructed fossil plant, including Lepidodendron, Triassic herbaceous lycopods, sphenophytes including Calamites, gigantopterids, glossopterids, and ginkgophytes. Features of plants from which reconstructions are unknown are inferred from reconstructed relatives in the same genus or family; these plants should be further investigated in the future to characterize them more accurately.

Fossils with measurable leaf size are listed in Table S5 which covers low to high latitudes. Interpretation of the floral climate zone and vegetation landscape information are based on all the micro and macro plant fossils, including those without measurable leaf size. The general concept is that plants with higher height, larger leaf size, higher vein density, and more complicated vein system are of higher biomass and relied on greater humidity for transpiration. Floras with a higher proportion of these plants normally have higher species diversity and spatial structure complexity, which suggests higher productivity. Details of the plant trait relationships are outlined by ref. 31.

To analyse the character of floras from the late Permian (Changhsingian) to the Middle Triassic (Anisian) for comparison and matching between floras with certain functional analysis and missing information, family level clustering was used to group the floras with the normalized plant fossil data. The clustering result is based on the Euclidean method. The plant systematic information comes from the listed literature, with additions from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) https://www.gbif.org/ database which were checked against the literature to ensure their accuracy. The taxonomic affinity of most spore and pollen taxa are unknown, and so only plant macrofossil data was used in clustering, and the palynology data was only used in the morphological group diversity analysis. To show the uncertainty of the clustering results, we list the plant species number after each flora in Fig. 1B. Unsurprisingly, the clustering results for flora with fewer taxa were less reliable and more crowded together. As an auxiliary method to clustering, we counted the plant species number in each morphological group (see the fourteen morphological group classifications below), then calculated the proportion of the species number in each morphological group within floras to directly show the character and to construct a representative pie chart for each flora. For floras with fewer taxa, we adjusted the location of each flora in the clustering tree manually, according to the character shown by the morphological group diversity.

Plants were divided into six habitats and fourteen groups, including four arid upland types: conifer, gymnosperm (for seed plants where systematic class/group is uncertain), peltasperm and seed fern; three humid upland types: cordaitalean, ginkgophyte, cycadophyte; one rainforest type: gigantopterid; two humid types: fern and ‘fern2' (for taxa that could be either ferns or seed fern); two marsh types: sphenophyte and lycopod; one cold type: glossopterid – normally reported in boreal Gondwana; and one arid lowland type: herbaceous lycopod. This classification is only for the plants included in this study and must be carefully applied to other time intervals by checking the habitat of the fossil plants in detail. Flora dominated by one habitat group was classified into the corresponding climate zone, and flora with more than one habitat group was defined as a mixture. In this step, we also took palynology data into account. The group information of the in-situ spore and pollen producing plant were counted77. For flora with both plant macrofossil and palynology data, we chose the dataset which contains more information. In Fig. 1B, flora with more than 150 taxa, such as the Changhsingian South China flora, have the biggest pie chart area, while flora with less than 10 taxa, like the German flora, have the smallest pie chart. After the plant function traits, habitat, and clustering analysis, the character of the flora from the End Permian to the Middle Triassic was systematically studied and classified into climate zones as shown in Table S5 and S6.

To reconstruct the spatial vegetation map, we assembled a database of fossil locations, plant macrofossil, palynology, and terrestrial tetrapod data for our time periods (Table S1–S3). To account for plant refuges or Mesozoic gymnosperm cradles that may not be represented in the fossil database, we first extended the plant megafossil range in each basin. For example, voltziales and peltasperms were found in North China and Euramerica before the PTME and reappeared in the Middle Triassic but were absent in Early Triassic strata, so we extended the ranges of those surviving gymnosperms78,79,80. Plants that were dominant after the Early Triassic but had already appeared in end Permian strata in Argentina, India and Northeast China have all had their ranges extended through the Early Triassic69,81,82,83. Secondly, the palynological data tends to better record information on upland floras, while the plant megafossil data records primarily lowland taxa20,30. We detected hidden upland floras in South China, China Xinjiang, South Africa, Antarctica, and Australia based on gymnosperm pollen evidence after the PTME21,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91. Our analysis included all the plant data from macro and micro floral records in all sedimentary facies, to avoid using the local information and to represent information from the whole basin. Thirdly, terrestrial tetrapod data was used to infer the occurrence of plants in regions without a plant fossil record24,36. Generally, terrestrial tetrapod occurrences in our study coincided with occurrences in the plant fossils, except for the Olenekian record in America and Canada. Therefore, vegetation type in those areas at this time was partly inferred from the tetrapod information alone on the presumption that plant primary producers were necessary in these regions to support vertebrate communities.

The fossil locations were then reconstructed to their time of deposition using GPlates92. Because the older palaeogeographic reconstruction used in SCION93 has no available set of rotation files, we used the reconstruction files of ref. 62, whose reconstruction at ~250 Ma is very similar to that of ref. 93 This allowed us to place fossil locations in an internally correct position at 250 Ma. However, minor manual manipulation was needed to then map some of these locations to their correct corresponding positions in the SCION land-sea maps.

Global vegetation was reconstructed by extension of fossil flora data across appropriate climate zones indicated by a sedimentary climate map94. In arid areas, plant fossil extrapolation is not applied95. Extrapolation was not carried out at the boundaries of humid and arid environments in places that lacked supporting mineralogical data. For example, the Early and Middle Triassic low-latitude inner Pangea continent is inferred to have been arid savanna or steppe, based on the available fossil record and lithological climatic indicators. Fossils from more productive biomes which are found nearer the coast are restricted to this setting and not extended far into the continental interior where climate is arid (Fig. 3).

Three principles are used for functional comparison between ancient and recent floras to estimate palaeo-productivity: firstly, recent floras must have a similar structure to the ancient flora we wish to imitate, so we compare the reconstructed size of the fossil plants including height and leaf size of the individual plant and the spatial structure of the flora with the recent analog. For example, the end-Permian tropical South China floral canopy is dominated by tree lycopods Lepidodendron and sphenophytes, fern and gigantopterid understory, showing the highest complexity in forest spatial structure among all the floras from the late Permian to Middle Triassic. The dominant gigantopterids have giant leaves with typical rainforest drip-tip structure, complicated vein systems and high vein density, and thus recent rainforest is chosen as an analog for the late Permian South China area, Southeast Asia, China Xizang, and Turkey which shared high similarity in taxa composition33. Secondly, the recent and ancient floras should be in the same climate zone. For example, the latest Permian South China tropical forest was a large, low-latitude island, and so present-day, large tropical islands like Indonesia and Thailand were chosen over (for example) continental Brazil. Each palaeo flora has suitable recent floras sharing similarity in plant function, climatic and geographic zone. Thirdly, the chosen flora should fit in the global diversity and NPP gradient at a similar place to the ancient flora. For ancient floras with clear functional trait records, we compare the NPP between floras from the late Permian to Middle Triassic by the traits mentioned above. We also use present-day data to confirm the hypothesis that plant diversity has a positive correlation with productivity, which generally fits with our normalized fossil results96,97. For instance, the late Permian (Changhsingian) tropical South China flora is matched with a present day high-diversity and highest-productivity biome in the chosen recent non-continental tropical rainforest functional group range, that of present-day Thailand. The late Permian to Middle Triassic fossil plants' inferred habitat, climate zone and landscape are shown in Table S5. The calculated NPP of each ancient flora is listed in Table S6 and details of corresponding recent flora are in Table S7. The reconstructed NPPL is marked as NPPLfossil.

Although this study makes progress in comparing the physiological and functional difference between palaeo- and recent plants, more detailed studies are still required. For example, the influence of the interaction between plants and other organisms including mycorrhiza and insects are not considered, neither are soil texture differences between the Permian-Triassic and present day. Although our results have associated uncertainties, the very large change in biomass over the PTME is very likely much larger than these potential errors. Nevertheless, without detailed study on palaeo plant physiology in other deep time periods, the methods mentioned above should not be directly applied to other timeframes.

In our initial steps to reconstruct land biomes and productivity, we did not extend the distribution of land plants to regions lacking climatic or mineral records of hospitable environments. For instance, the central areas of the Pangea supercontinent, characterized by evaporites rather than coal deposits, were identified as deserts or barren lands where plant growth was presumed unlikely. However, while the absence of fossil records in some areas may result from local biome extinctions, it could also be due to poor preservation conditions caused by insufficient water availability98. To assess the influence of taphonomic bias on our reconstructions—essentially, whether areas without fossil records truly lacked local biomes or merely lacked preservation conditions—we employed two different approaches.

First of all, we assessed the sedimentary facies and strata thickness of basins from various latitudes and locations99 (Fig. S3). For example, in low latitude South China, the fossil-plant-absence zone occurs in the Kayitou Formation, formed in a shallow lake or floodplain environment100. The central European basin recorded a warm seasonal humid climate in the Early Triassic, which is likely a response to global warming after the PTME in inner Pangea101. In high latitude South Africa and Australia, sedimentation patterns and occurrences of green algae indicate widespread ponding environments through the plant ‘dead zone'85,102,103,104. While these are strictly local examples, they indicate the presence of waterlogged, swampy environments suitable for plant preservation in the Early Triassic, suggesting that taphonomy is not the primary cause of the absence of fossils, and that this may reflect a genuine reduced abundance of plants after the PTME in these areas20. Additionally, frequent wildfires point to intensified seasonality or seasonal aridity, likely reducing lowland plant habitats and contributing to the sparse record of “hidden” upland plants2,20,21,67,85.

Second, we explored the potential existence of hidden “refuges” or “cradles” using our climate model, assuming plants could survive in grid cells with land surface temperatures below 40 °C and runoff above 0 mm/yr, similar to the conditions required by most modern plants105,106. The results suggest that suitable environments for plant survival existed in high-altitude and coastal areas, even in some low-latitude regions, such as South China, North China, Xinjiang, Europe, and Central Asia. These findings are consistent with our reconstructions based on fossil records. For example, the South China Induan plant macrofossil record is dominated by the herbaceous lycopod Tomiotrobus with a maximum height of 0.2 meters, while coeval palynological data suggests a hidden upland gymnosperm flora20,21,107. Therefore, the Induan flora in South China is compared with recent Australian shrubs or the seasonal dry subtropical forest in China Yunnan Province which is herbaceous and shrub-dominated with sparse tree cover.

To investigate the effects of vegetation change on Early Triassic climate, we ran the SCION Earth Evolution Model52. We removed the equation which calculates terrestrial vegetation biomass (as a single global number) and replaced this with values based on our reconstruction, mapped onto the model continental surface. To calculate NPPLf we multiplied the reconstructed NPPLbiogeographic by a factor representing CO2 fertilization. This follows the Michaelis-Menton formulation used in the GEOCARB biogeochemical models56,108:

where RCO2 is the atmospheric CO2 concentration relative to the preindustrial 280 ppm.

Plants play a crucial role in terrestrial weathering109. Present-day global-scale observations show that silicate weathering is linearly related to plant NPPLf (Fig. S5)48,110,111. We altered the model parameter fbiota, which represents the biotic enhancement of continental weathering (again a single global average in SCION), to make this dependent on the local vegetation in the following way:

Functionally, this returns a value tending towards 0.25 when NPPLf is very low, and a linear scaling with NPPLf when NPPLf rises. The choice of 0.25 relates to the four-fold enhancement between simple ground covers and higher plants used in first-generation long-term carbon cycle models like GEOCARB56,108, and based on field and laboratory studies53. We vary this ‘preplant' factor between 0.15 – 1 and modify the linear scaling to run sensitivity tests for various plant weathering abilities (Fig. S6). In all formulations, the scaling factor for NPP is chosen to return present day global weathering rates for the model present day integration.

The strontium isotope composition of river water has a strong local lithological control, so to simulate the Sr isotope record we imposed basic lithological classes on the model continental surface using the locations of continental arcs, LIPs and suture zones from the literature62,63,112 (Fig. S4). These zones were then prescribed representative Sr isotopic values52,57,113,114,115.

A widely-used agricultural chemical sprayed on American and Australian fruits and vegetables to prevent fungal disease is killing beneficial insects critical for pollination and ecosystem health, new Macquarie University research shows.

The study, published in Royal Society Open Science, found chlorothalonil - one of the world's most extensively used fungicides - severely impacts insect reproduction and survival, even at the lowest levels routinely detected on food.

"Even the very lowest concentration has a huge impact on the reproduction of the flies that we tested," says lead author Darshika Dissawa, a PhD candidate from Macquarie's School of Natural Sciences.

"This can have a big knock-on population impact over time because it affects both male and female fertility."

The researchers exposed fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to chlorothalonil levels matching those typically found in produce from cranberries to wine grapes. Even at the lowest dose, flies showed a 37 percent drop in egg production compared with unexposed individuals.

Chlorothalonil is a widely applied broad-spectrum fungicide in American agriculture, used on crops like:

Supervising author Associate Professor Fleur Ponton says the dramatic decline was unexpected.

"We expected the effect to increase far more gradually with higher amounts. But we found that even a very small amount can have a strong negative effect," Associate Professor Ponton says.

Although banned in the European Union, chlorothalonil is extensively applied to Australian crops including orchards and vineyards, often preventatively when no disease is present.

The findings add to mounting evidence of global insect population decline, with some regions reporting drops exceeding 75 percent in recent decades.

"We need bees and flies and other beneficial insects for pollination, and we think this is an important problem for pollinator populations," Associate Professor Ponton says.

The research highlights a critical knowledge gap in pesticide regulation, with fewer than 25 scientific papers examining chlorothalonil's effects on insects despite its widespread use.

The researchers recommend more sustainable practices, including reduced application frequency to allow insect population recovery between treatments.

A national study published in Environmental Science & Technology finds children aged 2 to 4 years in the United States are routinely exposed to a broad range of potentially harmful chemicals. Many of the chemicals the researchers identified are not routinely monitored and may pose health risks.

The research was conducted by multiple institutions across the United States in coordination with the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO), a program supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The researchers analyzed urine samples from 201 children aged 2 to 4 years. They tested for 111 chemicals. Their study found:

"Our study shows that childhood exposure to potentially harmful chemicals is widespread. This is alarming because we know early childhood is a critical window for brain and body development," said Deborah H. Bennett, lead author and UC Davis professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences. "Many of these chemicals are known or suspected to interfere with hormones, brain development and immune function."

Children exposed to chemicals through everyday activities

The NIH-funded ECHO Cohort combines data from pregnancy and pediatric cohorts to examine the impacts of early environmental exposures on child health and development. This study looked at samples of 201 children from four states (California, Georgia, New York and Washington).

The researchers looked for childhood exposure to common environmental chemicals, including:

Children are exposed to these environmental chemicals through everyday activities, such as eating, drinking, breathing indoor and outdoor air and touching contaminated surfaces.

Frequent hand-to-mouth contact, playing close to the ground, and higher intake rates relative to their smaller body weight make kids especially vulnerable to chemical exposure.

Trends and disparities

In addition to the widespread exposure, the researchers noted some trends.

Most of the children's mothers had provided urine samples during pregnancy. This allowed the researchers to analyze the chemicals in the mother's urine with the chemicals in the children's urine.

They found the children had higher levels of several chemicals than their mothers did during pregnancy. These included two phthalates, bisphenol S (often used as a BPA replacement) and the pesticide biomarkers 3-PBA and trans-DCCA.

Need for more monitoring and regulation

The researchers emphasize that further studies are necessary to comprehend the long-term health implications of these chemicals.

"Exposure to certain chemicals in early childhood -- such as pesticides, plasticizers and flame retardants -- has been linked to developmental delays, hormone disruption and other long-term health issues," said Jiwon Oh, first author of the study and a postdoctoral scholar in the UC Davis Department of Public Health Sciences. "This new study highlights the urgent need for expanded biomonitoring and stronger regulations to protect children from harmful exposures."

A complete list of authors and funders appears in the paper.

How to limit chemical exposure

It is impossible to eliminate all chemical exposures. Yet, there are many simple steps parents can take to help reduce their children's contact with harmful chemicals.

A new technology that uses clinical MRI machines to image metabolic activity in the brain could give researchers and clinicians unique insight into brain function and disease, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign report. The non-invasive, high-resolution metabolic imaging of the whole brain revealed differences in metabolic activity and neurotransmitter levels among brain regions; found metabolic alterations in brain tumors; and mapped and characterized multiple sclerosis lesions -- with patients only spending minutes in an MRI scanner.

Led by Zhi-Pei Liang, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and a member of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I., the team reported its findings in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering.

"Understanding the brain, how it works and what goes wrong when it is injured or diseased is considered one of the most exciting and challenging scientific endeavors of our time," Liang said. "MRI has played major roles in unlocking the mysteries of the brain over the past four decades. Our new technology adds another dimension to MRI's capability for brain imaging: visualization of brain metabolism and detection of metabolic alterations associated with brain diseases."

Conventional MRI provides high-resolution, detailed imaging of brain structures. Functional MRI maps brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow and blood oxygenation level, which are closely linked to neural activity. However, they cannot provide information on the metabolic activity in the brain, which is important for understanding function and disease, said postdoctoral researcher Yibo Zhao, the first author of the paper.

"Metabolic and physiological changes often occur before structural and functional abnormalities are visible on conventional MRI and fMRI images," Zhao said. "Metabolic imaging, therefore, can lead to early diagnosis and intervention of brain diseases."

Both MRI and fMRI techniques are based on magnetic resonance signals from water molecules. The new technology measures signals from brain metabolites and neurotransmitters as well as water molecules, a technique known as magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. These MRSI images can provide significant new insights into brain function and disease processes, and could improve sensitivity and specificity for the detection and diagnosis of brain diseases, Zhao said.

Other attempts at MRSI have been bogged down by the lengthy times required to capture the images and high levels of noise obscuring the signals from neurotransmitters. The new technique addresses both challenges.

"Our technology overcomes several long-standing technical barriers to fast high-resolution metabolic imaging by synergistically integrating ultrafast data acquisition with physics-based machine learning methods for data processing," Liang said. With the new MRSI technology, the Illinois team cut the time required for a whole brain scan to 12 and a half minutes.

The researchers tested their MRSI technique on several populations. In healthy subjects, the researchers found and mapped varying metabolic and neurotransmitter activity across different brain regions, indicating that such activity is not universal. In patients with brain tumors, the researchers found metabolic alterations, such as elevated choline and lactate, in tumors of different grades -- even when the tumors appeared identical on clinical MRI images. In subjects with multiple sclerosis, the technique detected molecular changes associated with neuroinflammatory response and reduced neuronal activity up to 70 days before changes become visible on clinical MRI images, the researchers report.

The researchers foresee potential for broad clinical use of their technique: By tracking metabolic changes over time, clinicians can assess the effectiveness of treatments for neurological conditions, Liang said. Metabolic information also can be used to tailor treatments to individual patients based on their unique metabolic profiles.

"High-resolution whole-brain metabolic imaging has significant clinical potential," said Liang, who began his career in the lab of the late Illinois professor Paul Lauterbur, recipient of the Nobel Prize for developing MRI technology. "Paul envisioned this exciting possibility and the general approach, but it has been very difficult to achieve his dream of fast high-resolution metabolic imaging in the clinical setting.

"As healthcare is moving towards personalized, predictive and precision medicine, this high-speed, high-resolution technology can provide a timely and effective tool to address an urgent unmet need for noninvasive metabolic imaging in clinical applications."

This work was supported by the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation.

Even Tesla's energy storage business, which has been a small, yet notable bright spot, can't escape the cloud that's hanging over the company.

For the second consecutive quarter, deployments of its Powerwall and Megapack stationary storage products have declined, according to stats released by Tesla. In the second quarter of this year, the company installed 9.6 gigawatt-hours of storage, down 0.8 gigawatt-hours from the first quarter.

Tesla's energy storage division peaked in the fourth quarter of 2024, a three-month period that saw 11 gigawatt-hours deployed. In all, Tesla deployed 31.4 GWh of energy storage products in 2024.

Until this year, the sector has been a bright spot for Tesla, posting consistent year-over-year growth. Revenue from energy storage and solar installations grew from $2 billion in 2020 to $10.1 billion last year. Tesla's poor start to the year suggests that streak is about to come to an end.

By contrast, the broader market for energy storage has been growing recently. Analysts at Wood Mackenzie said new installations hit a record high in Q1, the most recent period for which data is available, growing by 57% year-over-year.

Such growth is unlikely to continue, though, as tariffs on Chinese-made goods coincide with the ill-effects of a Trump-backed reconciliation bill currently being hashed out in Congress. There, Republicans have been working to eliminate key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. 

While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim. The vast majority of minerals used in batteries are refined or processed in China.

If I've called a meeting it's because there's a benefit to the instant vocal communication. If you're not there, you've not attended the meeting, no matter which tools you use to record, transcribe or translate.Conversely, if I thought I didn't need to be in a meeting, then I wouldn't send a tool to gather stuff for me to then just ignore the tool output - because I don't need it.These tools are a sign of cultural rot from both participants and the fact people are even making them shows deep flaws in how we communicate in the modern workplace.

I've routinely seen people attending a meeting from the office on Zoom camera, all gathered in a single big conference room, all looking and typing on their laptops for the entirety of the meeting, saying something maybe once or twice. I suppose they were simply working on their assigned tasks, listening to others in the background. How effective is that - I don't know.These days I don't care. I'm 100% "at work" when I'm in the office, so whatever. I just pull up my phone and plan my next vacation trip or whatever. When I'm remotely I take my laptop to the kitchen and start preparing stuff for dinner. Life is too short for this mess.

Skipping meetings because they aren't organized the way you like is pretty passive aggressive.

Oh, if only that had been true, but pointless, aimless meetings have been a plague forever. Maybe less so the no-peeing.But "no agenda, no attenda" only works if you're in a position to refuse. Often attending meetings is seen as part of the job, either formally or in the managers' eyes, so ignoring them without good reason isn't allowed without repercussions.

Major layoffs are rolling across Microsoft today, impacting game developers within Xbox across several studios and the projects they're working on, even as an executive at the company told staff more gamers are playing Xbox than ever before.

According to The Seattle Times, 9,000 employees, or 4 percent of Microsoft's workforce, are affected by the cuts, which started Wednesday morning. The full scope of layoffs within Microsoft's gaming divisions are still unknown.

“We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” Microsoft spokesperson Emily Pirt told WIRED. The company says that although gaming is impacted, it does not make up the majority of layoffs, and these cuts will affect people in different regions, tenure, and teams.

In a message to staff seen by WIRED, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said Xbox is following “Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness … I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before.” Employees whose roles are being eliminated are being encouraged to apply for other positions across Microsoft gaming, “where their applications will be given priority review.”

Spencer added that the company will “protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business.” Gaming teams across Microsoft are still learning how their roles will be affected, with some sources saying they have staff meetings scheduled later today.

Windows Central reports that Perfect Dark developer The Initiative will close as part of the reductions sweeping the company, and its revival of the 2000 first-person shooter game has been canceled. VGC reports that Rare's Everwild, an action-adventure game that's been in development for over a decade, has been canceled, as employees continue to be informed of layoffs across other studios such as ZeniMax and King.

Everwild, which was expected to launch with Game Pass for Xbox Series X/S and PC, was a new, original title from Rare. Few details about the game were available, though development had been troubled; in 2021, the project was “restarted from scratch.” The game was officially announced in 2019 with a brief trailer. In February, during an interview with XboxEra, Spencer cited Everwild as a game release he was looking forward to. “It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making,” Spencer said at the time.

According to Bloomberg, The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios is canceling a new MMORPG project due to the cuts. The outlet also reports layoffs of roughly 200 people at Candy Crush maker King and that layoffs are also taking place at Call of Duty developer Raven Software.

Spencer's full message to employees is below:

Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today's notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.

I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.

Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.

HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.

Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.

Amazon Prime Day is the name of Amazon's July sales event. Often referred to as Prime Day. Amazon Prime Day is the biggest sales event of the summer, and this year, for the first time, has expanded to four days in length. During the event (July 8-11, 2025), Amazon Prime members can view and purchase discounted products featured in the Prime Day sales.

Yes, you need an active Amazon Prime membership to take advantage of Prime Day discounts. You can sign up for Amazon Prime for $14.99 a month. If you're a new customer, you can even try Prime free for 30 days.

Apart from Amazon's own products, such as the Kindle and Echo, we can't be 100% sure, but in the past, we've seen many computer hardware components, peripherals, and monitors discounted. Therefore, we should hopefully see more tech deals during this event.

A former SpaceX security manager, who was privy to top secret information on U.S. government programs, is suing the company and one of its senior employees for alleged discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation. 

Jenna Shumway, who was promoted to senior contractor program security officer after being hired in 2022, also alleges the senior employee — Daniel Collins, a former Defense Department official hired to run security compliance for the company's government work — violated top secret protocols and then concealed this information from the government. 

Lawyers for Shumway, Collins, and SpaceX did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment. 

Collins made the news in December 2024 when The New York Times reported SpaceX was under federal review for sloppy security protocols. Collins discouraged reporting security clearance violations and allowed executives without proper clearances into classified meetings, according to the NYT. This and other allegations triggered at least three federal reviews of the company's security procedures, the NYT found. 

According to Shumway's complaint, she was passed over for the director position that Collins ultimately was hired for without being given the opportunity to apply for it. Her “work environment entirely changed” when Collins was hired as her superior in spring 2024, according to the complaint. Shumway claims Collins effectively waged a campaign of harassment against her, which included stripping her of her responsibilities over a period of months and ultimately leading to her termination in October 2024.

Collins' harassment extended to other female employees, too, the complaint alleges. The discrimination included preventing female staff from doing required security work, allegedly setting them up for noncompliance, staring at one employee's chest during a meeting, and asking a subordinate female employee if she wanted to “get s–tty together” over after-work drinks. 

Shumway and other female employees repeatedly reported Collins to SpaceX human resources, the lawsuit states. The company ignored these complaints, the suit alleges, and didn't take any action beyond suggesting the employees avoid being alone with Collins. Shumway is seeking unspecified damages.

This is not the first time SpaceX has been sued over claims that it enables sexual discrimination. Previous lawsuits have alleged similar stories of bias against female employees and a hostile work environment that enabled gender-based harassment. The company is also battling investigations from the California Civil Rights Department and the National Labor Relations Board over similar claims. 

The lawsuit was filed in late May in the Los Angeles County Superior Court; it was later moved to federal court on June 30 at SpaceX's request. It is filed in the federal Central District of California court under case number 2:22-cv-05959.

A young, energetic star has had just about enough of its clingy planet. The pair are mired in a toxic relationship, with the planet sending waves of energy toward the star—and the host star is responding with violent explosions that are destroying its planet over time.

Using the European Space Agency's (ESA) Cheops mission, a team of astronomers from the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy gathered evidence for the first known exoplanet with an apparent death wish. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the team describes the planet, similar in size to Jupiter, which may be triggering flares of radiation from the star it orbits. Although astronomers have theorized about this type of interaction before, the flares recorded in this star system are around 100 times more energetic than expected, according to the study.

The planet, named HIP 67522 b, is one of the wispiest exoplanets ever found, with density similar to candy floss. It takes just seven days to orbit its star, which is slightly larger and cooler than the Sun. And while our host star is a middle-aged 4.5-billion-year-old, this young star has only been around for 17 million years. Compared to the Sun, this star is more energetic and has a more powerful magnetic field.

The team behind the study first spotted the young star system using TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite). “We hadn't seen any systems like HIP 67522 before,” Ekaterina Ilin, lead author of the study, said in a statement. “When the planet was found it was the youngest planet known to be orbiting its host star in less than 10 days.”

The astronomers were on the hunt for stars releasing flares due to interactions with their orbiting planets, and they believed they found the perfect pair. To be sure of their findings, the team of astronomers wanted a closer look using ESA's sensitive CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). “With Cheops we saw more flares, taking the total count to 15, almost all coming in our direction as the planet transited in front of the star as seen from Earth,” Ilin said.

Our own Sun releases solar flares, intense bursts of energy that explode from its atmosphere when a build-up of magnetic energy is suddenly released. Solar flares are sometimes directed toward Earth through no fault of our own. For the unlucky exoplanet, however, the strong flares from its host star are likely its own doing.

Since HIP 67522 b orbits so close to its star, it may be exerting its own magnetic influence on the host star. The planet may be gathering energy as it orbits, then redirecting that energy as waves along the star's magnetic field line. When those waves meet the end of the magnetic field line at the star's surface, it triggers a massive flare.

“The planet seems to be triggering particularly energetic flares,” Ilin said. “The waves it sends along the star's magnetic field lines kick off flares at specific moments. But the energy of the flares is much higher than the energy of the waves. We think that the waves are setting off explosions that are waiting to happen.”

The radiation carried by the flares is eroding the planet's wispy atmosphere and causing it to lose mass at a much faster rate. In the next 100 million years, HIP 67522 b could go from a Jupiter-sized planet to a much smaller Neptune-sized planet, according to the study.

The team behind the study wants to carry out follow-up observations of the unique star system using different wavelengths to find out what kind of energy is being released by the star. “I have a million questions because this is a completely new phenomenon, so the details are still not clear,” Ilin said.

In the wake of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) announcing plans to revisit its recommended schedule for childhood vaccinations—a move that has drawn widespread criticism from experts—major insurers have not confirmed whether they'll continue to cover the full cost of routine shots for children.

For 60 years ACIP has provided vaccine guidance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including on the timing and dosage of childhood immunizations. Insurers are required to cover the cost of most jabs on the recommended schedule for children. On Wednesday, June 25, ACIP announced it would review the schedule, just weeks after health secretary and longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced the entire committee with his own appointees.

When WIRED then asked 21 of the country's largest health insurance groups whether they would stop providing cost-free coverage of current routine immunizations in the event ACIP stops recommending them, only Blue Shield of California—a company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association—confirmed it would continue coverage.

“As a payer our role is to ensure ongoing coverage and access to preventive, evidence-based care, including immunizations,” says company spokesperson Mark Seelig. “Therefore, Blue Shield of California is committed to maintaining coverage of immunizations. The decision on whether to receive a vaccine is between our member and their provider.”

Other large insurers, including UnitedHealthcare (which provides coverage for 50 million people), Cigna, Kaiser Permanente, Anthem, Humana, and Centene Corporation, did not respond to requests for comment. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan said it had no comment.

Most insurers that did respond said they were keeping an eye on developments in Washington, without indicating whether they would or would not cover vaccines dropped from the recommended schedule.

“Vaccines play an important role in the prevention of more serious illnesses,” says Phil Blando, a spokesperson at CVS Health, which owns the insurer Aetna. “We are monitoring any changes the federal government makes to vaccination guidance and eligibility and will evaluate whether coverage adjustments are needed.”

Highmark Inc., part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, operating in Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, and New York, is also waiting to see what decision ACIP reaches. “We are closely monitoring the evolving vaccine discussions occurring in Washington, DC. Various vaccines and immunizations are covered under Highmark's member benefits, with any future coverage considerations to be evaluated as more information becomes available,” says spokesperson Aaron Billger.

Bryan Campen, of Health Care Service Corporation—the licensee of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas—notes that no changes have yet been made to the vaccines ACIP recommends or the company's vaccine coverage, but says that the company will “continue to monitor any activity that may impact preventive care recommendations and will communicate any changes to recommendations that may impact standard coverage of preventive services.”

Insurers had an eye on changes in ACIP guidance even before the committee announced it would revisit the schedule. “As we navigate an evolving health care landscape, maintaining robust immunization coverage continues to be a top priority for protecting both individual and community health,” the industry's trade association, AHIP, said in a June 24 statement, the day before ACIP's announcement.

“We are committed to ongoing coverage of vaccines to ensure access and affordability for this respiratory virus season,” the statement continued. “We encourage all Americans to talk to their health care provider about vaccines.”

ACIP made headlines in early June when RFK Jr. fired all 17 of its members and replaced them with eight new appointees. (The HHS secretary appoints the committee's members, but conventionally they serve fixed four-year terms.) These new appointees include Retsef Levi, who has stated—in the face of scientific consensus—that mRNA vaccines are deadly, and Robert Malone, who routinely shares articles about supposed links between cancer and the Covid vaccine, which no credible research has found to exist. Neither Levi nor Malone replied to a request for comment.

Michael A. Ross, another recently appointed committee member, resigned from ACIP during a review of his financial holdings, The New York Times reported on June 24. When introducing his new ACIP appointees in a post on X earlier in June, RFK Jr. had described Ross as a faculty member at George Washington and Virginia Commonwealth universities—but spokespeople for the universities told NBC News4 that Ross had not taught at either in years. Ross did not reply to a request for comment.

The committee made news again on June 25 when, during its first meeting of the year, it announced it would form a working group to review the recommended immunization schedule for children and teens.

“The number of vaccines that our children and adolescents receive today exceed what children in most other developed nations receive, and what most of us in this room received when we [were] children,” ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff said during the meeting.

He noted that the group would examine the “cumulative effect” of the recommended vaccine schedule, including interactions between vaccines, the total number of vaccines given, their timing, and recipients' exposure to vaccine ingredients.

But the process for adding vaccines to the schedule is already rigorous. Before a vaccine can receive FDA licensure, its manufacturer must prove it does not negatively affect the safety or immune response of other vaccines administered at the same time on the schedule, says Paul Offit, director of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Vaccine Education Center.

In addition, “the notion that these vaccines are somehow weakening your immune system or overwhelming your immune system is fanciful,” Offit says. Today, children are exposed to fewer viral or bacterial proteins in the first few years of the vaccine schedule than those in earlier generations. When Offit's parents received the smallpox vaccine, they were exposed to 200 proteins in a single shot. In contrast, the measles vaccine only contains 10.

During the meeting, Kulldorff repeated claims he made in 2024 that he was fired from Harvard because he refused to get the Covid vaccine; he and Malone have also each served as paid expert witnesses in two separate suits against Merck over the safety of the company's HPV vaccine and its mumps vaccine, respectively. Kulldorff did not reply to a request for comment.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) did not send representatives to last week's ACIP meeting, as it typically does. According to Academy president Susan Kressly, this was because the AAP believes the vaccine recommendation process lost credibility when its original membership was gutted by Kennedy.

“We won't lend our name or our expertise to a system that is being politicized at the expense of children's health,” Kressly said in a video posted online before the meeting was set to begin. The AAP did not reply to a request for comment about the video.

The most recent child immunization schedule that the AAP endorses, from November 2024, is posted on the AAP website. A newer one, posted on the CDC site, has already changed recommendations. It no longer lists as “routine” Covid vaccines for children under 18 who are not immunocompromised but instead lists them under vaccines recommended for “shared clinical decision-making,” informed by “personal preference and circumstances.” The change should not affect insurance coverage.

A security vulnerability in a stealthy Android spyware operation called Catwatchful has exposed thousands of its customers, including its administrator. 

The bug, which was discovered by security researcher Eric Daigle, spilled the spyware app's full database of email addresses and plaintext passwords that Catwatchful customers use to access the data stolen from the phones of their victims.

Catwatchful is spyware masquerading as a child monitoring app that claims to be “invisible and cannot be detected,” all the while uploading the victim's phone's private contents to a dashboard viewable by the person who planted the app. The stolen data includes the victims' photos, messages, and real-time location data. The app can also remotely tap into the live ambient audio from the phone's microphone and access both front and rear phone cameras.

Spyware apps like Catwatchful are banned from the app stores and rely on being downloaded and planted by someone with physical access to a person's phone. As such, these apps are commonly referred to as “stalkerware” (or spouseware) for their propensity to facilitate non-consensual surveillance of spouses and romantic partners, which is illegal.

Catwatchful is the latest example in a growing list of stalkerware operations that have been hacked, breached, or otherwise exposed the data they obtain, and is at least the fifth spyware operation this year to have experienced a data spill. The incident shows that consumer-grade spyware continues to proliferate, despite being prone to shoddy coding and security failings that expose both paying customers and unsuspecting victims to data breaches.

According to a copy of the database from early June, which TechCrunch has seen, Catwatchful had email addresses and passwords on more than 62,000 customers and the phone data from 26,000 victims' devices.

Most of the compromised devices were located in Mexico, Colombia, India, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, and Bolivia (in order of the number of victims). Some of the records date back to 2018, the data shows.

The Catwatchful database also revealed the identity of the spyware operation's administrator, Omar Soca Charcov, a developer based in Uruguay. Charcov opened our emails, but did not respond to our requests for comment sent in both English and Spanish. TechCrunch asked if he was aware of the Catwatchful data breach, and if he plans to disclose the incident to its customers.

Without any clear indication that Charcov will disclose the incident, TechCrunch provided a copy of the Catwatchful database to data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned.

Daigle, a security researcher in Canada who has previously investigated stalkerware abuses, detailed his findings in a blog post. 

According to Daigle, Catwatchful uses a custom-made API, which every one of the planted Android apps relies on to communicate with and send data to Catwatchful's servers. The spyware also uses Google's Firebase, a web and mobile development platform, to host and store the victim's stolen phone data, including their photos and ambient audio recordings.

Daigle told TechCrunch that the API was unauthenticated, allowing anyone on the internet to interact with the Catwatchful user database without needing a login, which exposed the entire Catwatchful database of customer email addresses and passwords. 

When contacted by TechCrunch, the web company hosting the Catwatchful API suspended the spyware developer's account, briefly blocking the spyware from operating, but the API returned later on HostGator. A spokesperson for HostGator, Kristen Andrews, did not respond to requests for comment regarding the company hosting the spyware's operations.

TechCrunch confirmed that Catwatchful uses Firebase by downloading and installing the Catwatchful spyware on a virtualized Android device, which allows us to run the spyware in an isolated sandbox without giving it any real-world data, like our location. 

We examined the network traffic flowing in and out of the device, which showed data from the phone uploading to a specific Firebase instance used by Catwatchful to host the victim's stolen data.

After TechCrunch provided Google with copies of the Catwatchful malware, Google said it added new protections for Google Play Protect, a security tool that scans Android phones for malicious apps, like spyware. Now, Google Play Protect will alert users when it detects the Catwatchful spyware or its installer on a user's phone.

TechCrunch also provided Google with details of the Firebase instance involved in storing data for the Catwatchful operation. Asked whether the stalkerware operation violates Firebase's terms of service, Google told TechCrunch on June 25 that it was investigating but would not immediately commit to taking down the operation.

“All apps using Firebase products must abide by our terms of service and policies. We are investigating this particular issue, and if we find that an app is in violation, appropriate action will be taken. Android users that attempt to install these apps are protected by Google Play Protect,” said Ed Fernandez, a spokesperson for Google.

As of publication, Catwatchful remains hosted on Firebase. 

Like many spyware operations, Catwatchful does not publicly list its owner or disclose who runs the operation. It's not uncommon for stalkerware and spyware operators to hide their real identities, given the legal and reputational risks associated with facilitating illegal surveillance.

But an operational security mishap in the dataset exposed Charcov as the operation's administrator. 

A review of the Catwatchful database lists Charcov as the first record in one of the files in the dataset. (In past spyware-related data breaches, some operators have been identified by early records in the database, as oftentimes the developers are testing the spyware product on their own devices.)

The dataset included Charcov's full name, phone number, and the web address of the specific Firebase instance where Catwatchful's database is stored on Google's servers.

Charcov's personal email address, found in the dataset, is the same email that he lists on his LinkedIn page, which has since been set to private. Charcov also configured his Catwatchful administrator's email address as the password recovery address on his personal email account in the event he gets locked out, which directly links Charcov to the Catwatchful operation.

While Catwatchful claims it “cannot be uninstalled,” there are ways to detect and remove the app from an affected device.

Before you start, it's important to have a safety plan in place, as disabling spyware can alert the person who planted it. The Coalition Against Stalkerware does important work in this space and has resources to help victims and survivors.

Android users can detect Catwatchful, even if it is hidden from view, by dialing 543210 into your Android phone app's keypad and then hitting the call button. If Catwatchful is installed, the app should appear on your screen. This code is a built-in backdoor feature that allows whoever planted the app to regain access to the settings once the app is hidden. This code can also be used by anyone to see if the app is installed.

As for removing the app, TechCrunch has a general how-to guide for removing Android spyware that can help you identify and remove common types of phone stalkerware, and then enable the various settings you need to secure your Android device.

Microsoft is planning to lay off 9,000 employees, impacting less than 4% of its global workforce, according to a report by CNBC.

Microsoft continues to beat expectations in its quarterly earnings; in its most recent report, the company grew its net income by 18% year over year, amounting to a total of $25.8 billion.

However, the company has continued to reduce its headcount — this is one of many rounds of layoffs to have already occurred this year.

Microsoft has said that these cuts are an attempt to cut down on its layers of management, following the lead of competitors like Amazon and Meta.

Rivian has hit a milestone in its agreement with German automotive giant Volkswagen that will bring $1 billion into the EV startup's coffers in the form of a share sale. Rivian also announced Wednesday that it delivered 10,661 vehicles in the second quarter. 

That represents a 23% drop in sales from the second quarter of 2024, and only a slight improvement over Rivian's rough first quarter, when it delivered 8,640 EVs. The company has already lowered its sales target for 2025 as a result of President Trump's tariffs and trade wars, all of which make it more expensive to build cars.

Rivian said Wednesday that it still believes it will deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 EVs this year. But even hitting the high end of that range means it will ultimately sell fewer cars in 2025 than it did in either of the prior two years. All this makes things especially tenuous for Rivian, which has historically burned through billions of dollars and is banking a lot on the 2026 release of its more affordable SUV, the R2.

The payout from Volkswagen is the result of Rivian tallying its second-ever gross profit in the first quarter of this year. In 2024, the two automakers announced a technology joint venture worth up to $5.8 billion. Rivian has provided employees, along with its software and electrical architecture designs, to that joint venture. Volkswagen plans to use those underlying technologies to power its future EVs. It provided the first $1 billion to Rivian late last year in the form of a convertible note.

Rivian was only able to hit that gross profit milestone because it spent a lot of money and effort over the last two years simplifying the design of its existing consumer vehicles, the R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck. Those redesigned versions hit the road last year and were dramatically cheaper for Rivian to build, although the company is still losing money overall. 

Things could get even more challenging for companies like Rivian if Trump gets what he wants with his so-called proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill.” This week, that piece of legislation was passed from the U.S. Senate back to the House of Representatives. In its current form, it will end the federal EV tax credit, which instantly cuts $7,500 off the price of a new electric vehicle, in September of this year.

Apple's biggest assembly partner, Foxconn, has ordered more than 300 of its Chinese employees to return home from its iPhone factories in India, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.

The employees told to return account for the bulk of Foxconn's staff in its iPhone facilities in India, and only Taiwanese support staff remain in the country, the report said.

The motivation behind the order was not immediately clear, Bloomberg reported, though the outlet noted that Chinese officials have been asking regulators to curb knowledge and tech resources from being exported to India in a bid to preserve the country's manufacturing heft.

The move comes as Foxconn and other Apple suppliers have been ramping up manufacturing in India as the iPhone maker seeks to reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing for its hardware. In May, Foxconn received Indian government approval to build a $435 million semiconductor plant in the country.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook has said the company is importing more iPhones from India as one way to handle the uncertainties around U.S. tariffs and trade risks.

The good folks at Amazon must be getting warmed up for the annual Prime Day blowout, or maybe somebody lit their 4th of July fireworks a little early, because for the second day in a row there is a truly insane Dell laptop deal that's just dropped out of nowhere. The last one, on the Dell 15 Vostro 3520, took a $2,000 price tag down to just $549. Now it's the Dell 15 Vostro 3530's turn in an even bigger deal taking a $2,400 price down to just $650. 

The Dell Vostro 3530 is the slightly bigger brother to the Vostro 3520, normally retailing for $400 more than the lower model. Two huge 73% Amazon deals later, you need only an extra $100 to bump up from the 6-core processor of the Vostro 3520 to the 10-core version that powers the Vostro 3530, which means you keep a staggering $1,750 in your pocket when you score this monster laptop.

See at Amazon

The Dell description of the Vostro 3530 laptop says it's aimed at small businesses and entrepreneurs, but when you look at the specifics and the features of this machine, it's hard to think of anyone who wouldn't want it as their everyday laptop for work, play, or general use.

Start with the very most basic laptop needs — a fast processor and big-capacity storage. The Dell Vostro 3530 is powered by a 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i5 processor that can hit speeds up to 4.66GHz, much more than enough for any streaming, surfing, or heavy-duty multitasking you ask of it. It has 32GB of RAM, which you can expand to 64GBm and the built-in storage is a huge 1TB SSD.

The display on the Dell Vostro 3530 is a 15.6-inch full-HD beauty with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and driven by an Intel iRIS Xe graphics card.

The array of ports and slots you'd need to connect the Dell Vostro 3530 to parallel devices is fully loaded. It comes with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port for data transfers, USB-A 3.2 and USB-A 2.0 ports, an HDMI 1.4 port for external monitor hookups, an SD 3.0 card slot, and a RJ-45 Ethernet port. Add the WiFi and Bluetooth connections to that super-fast Ethernet hookup, and your path to surfing and streaming is clear and smooth.

The big 4th of July sales are already under way and Prime Day will be following fast on their heels, but we can't envision any huge event that will match the deals Amazon's been dropping on these powerhouse Dell laptops like the Vostro 3530. It's 73% off, which translates into a $1,750 price cut down to just $650.

Blackwell graphics cards plummet towards MSRP as deal season heats up


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Update 7/2/2025 5am PT: The Newegg gift card deals below have expired, but the cards remain in stock for purchase. The PNY GeForce RTX 5070 OC 12GB $549 @Best Buy also still remains at an excellent price point. A selection of graphics cards across Nvidia's RTX 50-series have fallen to their MSRPs on Newegg, thanks to instant rebates in the form of gift cards. These Blackwell graphics cards, including higher-end versions of the RTX 5070, 5060, and 5060 Ti, are likely falling in price as online retailers gear up for Amazon's upcoming Prime Day 2025.

PNY GeForce RTX 5070 OC 12GB: now $549 at Best Buy This is currently the best value RTX 5070 graphics card available for sale without any deal gimmicks. It's the OC version with a 2.2 GHz base clock and 2.5GHz boost. Make use of the Blackwell architecture and Nvidia's latest DLSS 4 features for improved gaming fidelity and performance.

Nvidia's RTX 5070 can be had for as low as $549 after rebates from a number of different board partners, including Gigabyte, Asus, and MSI. The tastiest deal is on this Gigabyte Windforce RTX 5070, a three-fan cooler selling for $609 bundled with a $60 promotional gift card. The inclusion of the gift card effectively takes the Gigabyte card down to $549 if you're upgrading other parts of your PC, bagging you a three-fan RTX 5070 right at MSRP. For context, the same card has sold for between $700 and $800 on Amazon since its release.

Some cards sitting at similar price levels today also ship with Newegg's "FantasTech Price Protection". This Fourth of July-linked promotion ensures that if customers purchase items with the price protection until July 6th, and the same model is discounted for cheaper as part of Independence Day sales, customers will be retroactively refunded the discount amount.

GIGABYTE WindForce GeForce RTX 5070: $549.99 ($609.99 with $60 promotional gift card) at NeweggThe cheapest RTX 5070 today, if you take into account the Newegg $60 gift card. MSRP for a high-end GPU is nothing to take for granted anymore. 

ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070: $609.99 on NeweggThe cheapest RTX 5070 with "FantasTech Price Protection" means you're safe from buyer's remorse in case of further 4th of July deals.

MSI SHADOW GeForce RTX 5070: $599 at NeweggThe absolute cheapest RTX 5070 if you're not looking for rebates or money-back after your purchase. 

RTX 5060s and RTX 5060 Tis have also fallen to similar lows. The 16GB 5060 Ti, the most attractive card of this group, has fallen to $449 from Gigabyte and other board partners, taking it within $20 of its $429 MSRP. The 8GB models of the 5060 and 5060 Ti are staying steady at their MSRPs of $299 and $379, though these 8GB models have proven much less attractive to buyers in 2025.

Very few of the sales on new graphics cards seem to have anything to do with Prime Day or Newegg's official "FantasTech" response to Amazon's four days of deals. Newegg may be attempting to squeeze in early to snag some of Amazon's business during Prime Day, but the why of these deals matters much less than the fact that they are here, possibly getting GPUs into the hands of those who have been waiting for a price drop this severe.

The RTX 5070 deals on Newegg have already started selling out, so those interested may need to act fast to not miss out on these hot buys. Be sure to keep your eyes on Tom's Hardware's deals coverage as Prime Day 2025 approaches, running this year from July 8-11.

Even though Newegg is leading the charge currently in GPU discounts, there are still deals to be had at competing retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy. See our small list of some current deals and graphics card listings.

Australian airline giant Qantas said on Wednesday it experienced a data breach that compromised the personal information of at least six million passengers.

The airline said a cybercriminal targeted one of its call centers on June 30, and stole customer data from its systems, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and frequent flyer numbers.

Qantas is the latest airline hacked in recent weeks following a spate of breaches attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and tactics that are highly adept at breaking into the networks of big companies. Canadian airline WestJet suffered a data breach in June, which media reports have linked to Scattered Spider. Hawaiian Airlines also said last week it had suffered a data breach.

Google's security unit Mandiant told TechCrunch on Wednesday that it is “too early to tell” if the Qantas hack was linked to Scattered Spider, but warned that airlines should be on “high alert” for social engineering attacks.

One company's trash can be another company's treasure—or at least that's what HP is hoping to convince its customers with a new "PCFax" service that uses telemetry, support requests, and "AI" to generate reports about a laptop's history. And if your first thought was "gee, that sounds a lot like CarFax," you're on the same wavelength as the folks at HP who designed this service. Congratulations, or I'm sorry. Whichever.

"When buying a used car, dealerships and individual buyers can access each car's particular CarFax report, detailing the vehicle's usage and maintenance history," a quartet of HP employees said in a piece for IEEE Spectrum. "Armed with this information, dealerships can perform the necessary fixes or upgrades before reselling the car. And individuals can decide whether to trust that vehicle's performance. We at HP realized that, to prevent unnecessary e-waste, we need to collect and make available usage and maintenance data for each laptop, like a CarFax for used PCs."

Some of the data used to generate these reports will be sourced from the Endpoint Security Controller built into some of HP's enterprise products to collect information from "thermal sensors that monitor CPU temperature, power-consumption monitors that track energy efficiency, storage health indicators that assess solid state drive (SSD) wear levels, performance counters that measure system utilization, fan-rotation-speed sensors that detect cooling efficiency, and more." This data is then stored on a dedicated portion of the system's storage and is supposedly tamper-proof.

A brief aside: HP introduced the Endpoint Security Controller in 2019. It didn't attract much coverage then, which isn't necessarily surprising for something as decidedly uncool as a firmware- and hardware-level snitch that gathers as much information as possible for HP's enterprise customers. But I do find it somewhat telling that several pages of search results for "Endpoint Security Controller" are filled almost entirely with complaints on HP and Microsoft's support forums related to unexpected boot failures caused by an obscure issue with the controller itself, the host BIOS, or something else.

Anyway. HP said the PCFax reports would also include "information from HP's factory and supply-chain records, digital-services platforms, customer-support service records, [and] diagnostic logs" as well as "data from external sources including partner sales and service records, refurbishment partner databases, third-party component manufacturers like Intel, and other original equipment manufacturers." All of that data will then be combined to help prospective buyers tell if a given system is junk or not. (Presumably so those customers would then return to HP for more systems later.)

That would require some amount of critical thinking, however, so HP also plans to pipe all this data into some kind of AI model that will "analyze historical telemetry data and predict failures before they happen, such as detecting increasing SSD write cycles to forecast impending failure and alert IT teams for proactive replacement, or predicting battery degradation and automatically generating a service ticket to ensure a replacement battery is ready before failure, minimizing downtime." Sounds interesting enough—provided the model is a reliable source rather than just a robotic salesperson.

Maybe that's just the cynical take. Either way, there's no denying that companies are finally responding to the absurd amounts of e-waste their product cycles generate, whether that's by reclaiming minerals from used products, finding ways to safely recycle them, or designing them to be upgraded without requiring someone to throw out the proverbial baby with the contaminated bathwater. There's a chance PCFax (or something like it) will complement those efforts by convincing HP's customers that a three-year-old laptop doesn't need to be thrown away for no reason.

The people are gaining consciousness.

GPU sales data often highlights interesting patterns such as customer preference, supply availability, variance between regions, and much more. It allows us to gauge not only the current status of the market at large, but also the specific models people are inclined toward. As such, new sales data from Mindfactory.de, spotted by TechPowerUp, tells us that customers are heavily favoring the 16GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti over its 8GB counterpart.

Mindfactory.de is one of Germany's largest retailers and the only one with public sales figures. You can see the number of units sold on each of their listings, which includes GPUs from various AIBs and manufacturers. Doing the math, the numbers reveal the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB has sold 1,675 units so far, as compared to only 105 units for the 8GB variant.



Customers are helping outsell the 8GB RTX 5060Ti by over 16 times — which means for every one RTX 5060 Ti 8GB sold, there are sixteen RTX 5060 Ti 16GB flying off the shelves. That chalks up to a 1600% difference across the board, all while both cards are in stock and keeping up with demand. So, there are no availability restraints enabling this purchasing behavior.

Despite the price difference, buyers are regularly choosing the more expensive RTX 5060 Ti simply due to the extra VRAM it has to offer. With new releases getting more demanding and visual additives like ray tracing becoming commonplace, 16GB of VRAM has started to look more lucrative regardless of the cost. It performs better today and will sell more easily tomorrow in the second-hand market.

GPUs with 8GB memory buffers often struggle with modern games these days, and our pursuit of photorealism in blockbuster titles will only worsen this over time. Features like Neural Texture Compression can help combat the increased VRAM usage, but it's up to the developers to implement these technologies, and even then, you can only fight physics so much.

Interestingly, though, opposing sales data from TechEpiphany on X shows us that it's AMD topping the charts as of late. The RX 9070 XT and RX 9060 XT are both the best-selling GPUs from the last week of June, with the aforementioned RTX 5060 Ti closely following in third place. That being said, these numbers are likely coalescing the sales of the 8GB and 16GB variants.

🔥 GPU Retail Sales Week 26 '25 (mf)ℹ️ UnitsAMD: 615 units sold, 53.95%, ASP: 533Nvidia: 515, 45.18%, ASP: 805Intel: 10, 0.88%, ASP: 108ℹ️ RevenueAMD: 327814, 44.1%Nvidia: 414427, 55.75%Intel: 1084, 0.15% pic.twitter.com/z4zxick6JfJuly 2, 2025

Moreover, a similar narrative clings to the red camp where AMD's 16GB cards are outselling their 8GB peers, only even more intensely. The Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB has more than 30 times the sales of the 8GB RX 9060 XT on Mindfactory.de, which just goes to show that the sentiment is shared across the community, regardless of whatever GPU brand you support.

IT workers in North Korea are getting jobs at American companies to help fund the country's weapons programs.

The Justice Department announced on June 30 its latest hit in the game of geopolitical whac-a-mole against North Korea's nuclear weapons programs.

The department said on Monday that it had conducted a series of coordinated actions, including "two indictments, an arrest, searches of 29 known or suspected 'laptop farms' across 16 states, and the seizure of 29 financial accounts used to launder illicit funds and 21 fraudulent websites," after North Korean IT workers "successfully obtained employment with more than 100 U.S. companies" with the help of "individuals in the United States, China, United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan."

International sanctions make it practically impossible for North Korea to fund its nuclear programs through legitimate means. But rather than scuttling its efforts to become a nuclear power, the so-called Hermit Kingdom has turned to alternative sources of income, such as stealing billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency and conducting ransomware operations against organizations in a variety of sectors. The latest scheme involves placing operatives in high-paying jobs at U.S. tech companies.

The State Department, Treasury Department, and FBI said (PDF) in 2022 that North Korea "has dispatched thousands of highly skilled IT workers around the world" who "in many cases misrepresent themselves as foreign (non-North Korean) or U.S.-based teleworkers, including by using virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual private servers (VPSs), purchased third-country IP addresses, proxy accounts, and falsified or stolen identification documents" in a bid to evade detection for as long as possible.

Yet the revelation of its not-so-secret funding operations hasn't discouraged North Korea. Quite the opposite: "We have observed the North Korean IT worker threat evolve," Google Cloud said in March. "We've detected North Korean IT workers conducting a global expansion beyond the U.S., with a notable focus on Europe. They have also intensified extortion campaigns against employers, and they've moved to conduct operations in corporate virtual desktops, networks, and servers."

Politico reported in May that "the scam is more widespread than previously understood and has recently hit many Fortune 500 companies." The problem is probably going to get worse before it gets better, too, with Wired reporting that generative AI has made it even more difficult for companies to determine if they're extending a job offer to a legitimate prospect or a North Korean operative. And help from people in the U.S. can mask other signs that a remote worker isn't above board.

The Justice Department said that "certain U.S.-based individuals [allegedly] enabled one of the schemes by creating front companies and fraudulent websites to promote the bona fides of the remote IT workers, and hosted laptop farms where the remote North Korean IT workers could remote access into U.S. victim company-provided laptop computers." It would be suspicious for a supposedly U.S.-based worker to have their laptop shipped outside the country; these "laptop farms" circumvent that issue.

Shutting down these operations can help protect companies from North Korean operatives who plan to use their access to private resources to steal intellectual property, provide information that could be useful for more overt cybercrime, and, yes, steal cryptocurrency. (The Justice Department said one undercover worker "stole virtual currency worth approximately over $900,000" from an Atlanta-based company.) The question is how long it'll take for other North Korean IT workers to take their place.

Both Switch 2 and its dock have cooling fans

Multiple Nintendo Switch 2 owners, most notably in Japan, are reporting problems with the console overheating during gameplay, leading to crashes and freezes. The problem, as noted by Nintendo Soup, includes playing hefty new titles like Cyberpunk 2077, but also less hardware-intensive titles like Pokémon and Splatoon.

According to the report, users are reporting game freezes and crashes, as well as fans going into overdrive in order to try and dissipate heat. The multitude of reports from Japanese users all come from X and are machine-translated. Some users have reported crashing and periodic freezes, but only postulate that thermal performance might be to blame. "The fan's going nuts, so maybe it's overheating," one user reported while playing Rune Factory.

Some users are definitely reporting the issue while using the Switch 2 in dock mode. A Cyberpunk 2077 player said the game had crashed at least five times, while the fans seemed to be running at full speed. Others seem to be experiencing the thermal issues in handheld mode, with one user suggesting the Switch 2 became too hot to even hold while gaming.

Beyond Japan, users on Facebook have reported the Switch 2 getting warm or even hot to the touch while gaming, while other users over on Reddit are reporting similar issues.

"I've had my Switch 2 display a message saying that the system was overheating and entering sleep mode twice now, both times while playing Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition docked," said one user. Another replied, confirming their Switch 2 was hot when they grabbed it from their dock after a day at work.

If you are experiencing these issues, Nintendo does have some suggestions. Sadly, they're pretty rudimentary. Action recommended includes simply unplugging your dock to let it cool down, moving your dock to a more ventilated area, ensuring your air vents are clear, and finally, monitoring the situation.

Nintendo says that if these remedies don't fix the issue, you'll need to send your Switch 2 in for repair.

The issue seems noteworthy, but not enormously prevalent thus far. During our own thermal testing of the Switch 2, our unit reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit, or 47 degrees Celsius, while docked. In handheld, this dropped to 102 F (39 C), which we found generally warm to the touch.

Nintendo Switch 2 has generally been met with acclaim, smashing the company's console sales record in its opening weekend. In fact, it's so popular that Nintendo's president recently had to apologize for the shortage. The launch hasn't been without bumps, however, and some users have even reported Nintendo disabling their online accounts and services over the use of Mig Flash drives, even for ROMs they already own.

A new AI model is much better than doctors at identifying patients likely to experience cardiac arrest.

The linchpin is the system's ability to analyze long-underused heart imaging, alongside a full spectrum of medical records, to reveal previously hidden information about a patient's heart health.

The federally-funded work, led by Johns Hopkins University researchers, could save many lives and also spare many people unnecessary medical interventions, including the implantation of unneeded defibrillators.

"Currently we have patients dying in the prime of their life because they aren't protected and others who are putting up with defibrillators for the rest of their lives with no benefit," said senior author Natalia Trayanova, a researcher focused on using artificial intelligence in cardiology. "We have the ability to predict with very high accuracy whether a patient is at very high risk for sudden cardiac death or not."

The findings are published today in Nature Cardiovascular Research.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most common inherited heart diseases, affecting one in every 200 to 500 individuals worldwide, and is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and athletes.

Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will live normal lives, but a percentage are at significant increased risk for sudden cardiac death. It's been nearly impossible for doctors to determine who those patients are.

Current clinical guidelines used by doctors across the United States and Europe to identify the patients most at risk for fatal heart attacks have about a 50% chance of identifying the right patients, "not much better than throwing dice," Trayanova says.

The team's model significantly outperformed clinical guidelines across all demographics.

Multimodal AI for ventricular Arrhythmia Risk Stratification (MAARS), predicts individual patients' risk for sudden cardiac death by analyzing a variety of medical data and records, and, for the first time, exploring all the information contained in the contrast-enhanced MRI images of the patient's heart.

People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develop fibrosis, or scarring, across their heart and it's the scarring that elevates their risk of sudden cardiac death. While doctors haven't been able to make sense of the raw MRI images, the AI model zeroed right in on the critical scarring patterns.

People have not used deep learning on those images. We are able to extract this hidden information in the images that is not usually accounted for."

Natalia Trayanova, senior author

The team tested the model against real patients treated with the traditional clinical guidelines at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute in North Carolina.

Compared to the clinical guidelines that were accurate about half the time, the AI model was 89% accurate across all patients and, critically, 93% accurate for people 40 to 60 years old, the population among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients most at-risk for sudden cardiac death.

The AI model also can describe why patients are high risk so that doctors can tailor a medical plan to fit their specific needs.

"Our study demonstrates that the AI model significantly enhances our ability to predict those at highest risk compared to our current algorithms and thus has the power to transform clinical care," says co-author Jonathan Crispin, a Johns Hopkins cardiologist.

In 2022, Trayanova's team created a different multi-modal AI model that offered personalized survival assessment for patients with infarcts, predicting if and when someone would die of cardiac arrest.

The team plans to further test the new model on more patients and expand the new algorithm to use with other types of heart diseases, including cardiac sarcoidosis and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

Authors include Changxin Lai, Minglang Yin, Eugene G. Kholmovski, Dan M. Popescu, Edem Binka, Stefan L. Zimmerman, Allison G. Hays, all of Johns Hopkins; Dai-Yin Lu and M. Roselle Abraham of the Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center of Excellence at University of California San Francisco; and Erica Scherer and Dermot M. Phelan of Atrium Health.

This pilot study evaluates a newly developed point-of-care (PoC) device designed to measure bilirubin levels in human blood serum using a microfluidic cartridge and optoelectronic sensing module. Accurate bilirubin measurement is critical for assessing liver function and diagnosing conditions such as jaundice and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Traditional laboratory methods are accurate but not suitable for rapid or resource-limited settings due to their complexity. The goal of this study was to determine if the new portable PoC device could deliver comparable accuracy and clinical utility.

Serum samples from 20 patients with bilirubin concentrations ranging from 2 μmol/L to 480 μmol/L were analyzed using both the PoC device and a standard laboratory method (the diazo method via the Abbott Alinity system). The PoC device employed dual-wavelength light detection (455 nm and 530 nm) and microfluidic flow to analyze small-volume samples. The results showed a strong correlation (R² = 0.986) between the PoC and lab measurements. Bland-Altman analysis showed a small mean difference (−5.6 μmol/L) with no systematic bias. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated high diagnostic performance, with 90% sensitivity and 97% specificity in classifying bilirubin levels across clinical thresholds.

The study concludes that the microfluidic-based PoC device offers a promising alternative for bilirubin testing, especially in settings where traditional lab infrastructure is unavailable. Although the sample size was small, the device met clinical accuracy standards and performed well compared to existing PoC solutions like Bilistick and BiliDx. The authors recommend larger-scale studies for further validation, including testing in patient populations with varying clinical profiles such as neonates and individuals with liver disease.

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle-specifically, a diet rich in fibre but light on red/processed meat, regular exercise, not smoking, and sticking to a normal weight-is linked to a significantly lower risk of diverticulitis, finds a large long term study, published online in the journal Gut.

What's more, these 5 components seem to offset the effects of inherited genes, the findings indicate.

Diverticulitis occurs when 'pouches' develop along the gut and become inflamed or infected in the wall of the large intestine (colon), explain the researchers. It's a common cause of hospital admissions and a major reason for emergency colon surgery, they add.

Genetic and environmental factors, including lifestyle, contribute to the development of the condition, but it's not clear exactly how these factors interact or the extent to which lifestyle might offset the genetic risk, they say.

To shed more light on this, the researchers derived an overall healthy lifestyle score (0-5) for diverticulitis from survey responses for 179,564 participants drawn from three prospective studies: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.

The score was based on 5 elements that have independently been associated with heightened risks of developing diverticulitis: smoking; weight (BMI); physical activity; fibre intake; and red/processed meat intake. 

The association between this score and incident diverticulitis was confirmed among 30,750 participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). 

Genetic risk was assessed using a polygenic risk score (PRS) in 36,077 people with available genotype information. 

During a monitoring period of 20 years, 10,299 new cases of diverticulitis were recorded. The 5 lifestyle factors were each significantly associated with the development of the condition. 

For example, compared with participants with a BMI below 25, those who were overweight were 32% more likely to develop diverticulitis, while those who were obese were 44% more likely to do so. 

Participants who had formerly or who were still smoking were, respectively, 17% and 13% more likely to be diagnosed with diverticulitis than those who had never smoked. And higher levels of physical activity were associated with a 16% reduced risk compared with lower levels. 

While higher fibre intake was associated with a 14% lower risk, higher red meat intake was associated with a 9% increased risk. 

And every 1-point increase in healthy lifestyle score was associated with a 12% lower risk of diverticulitis. Participants with a score of 5 were 50% less likely to be diagnosed with the condition than those with a score of 0.

The findings were consistently observed across all three studies and in different racial groups.

The association between healthy lifestyle score and incident diverticulitis was confirmed among 30,750 participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). 

Some 2183 new cases of diverticulitis were reported during an average monitoring period of nearly 12 years in this group. Those with a healthy lifestyle score of 3–5 had a substantially lower risk (31%) than those with a score of 0. 

Genetic risk was assessed using a polygenic (cumulative) risk score (PRS) in 36,077 people with available genotype information in the NHS, NHSII, and HPFS groups.

There were no notable differences in lifestyle factors across PRS categories, but PRS was significantly associated with incident diverticulitis. For each unit increase in PRS, the risk increased by 58%, and was particularly evident among those under the age of 60. 

And a healthy lifestyle seemed to offset genetic susceptibility to the condition. For example, those in the lowest PRS category and with a healthy lifestyle score of 4-5 were 37% less likely to develop diverticulitis compared to those with a score of 0.

Similarly, those with a medium PRS were 48% less likely to do so, while those in the highest PRS category were 50% less likely to do so. Further analysis showed that adopting a healthy lifestyle might prevent 23–42% of diverticulitis cases across PRS categories.

And when the effect of PRS and a healthy lifestyle score were combined, those in the highest PRS category with a healthy lifestyle score of 0 or 1 were 5 times more likely to develop diverticulitis than those in the lowest PRS category with a score of 4 or 5. 

The findings were further validated in the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB).

This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause. And the researchers acknowledge that ascertainment of diverticulitis was based on different approaches across the different studies.

Nevertheless, they conclude: "Our data provide consistent evidence from multiple data sets indicating that adherence to a healthy lifestyle is linked to a reduced risk of developing diverticulitis, irrespective of one's genetic predisposition."

In a large cohort, long-acting lipoglycopeptides (laLGPs) demonstrated comparable effectiveness to standard-of-care antibiotics for step-down treatment of serious Gram-positive bacterial infections in both individuals who used drugs and those who did not.

“Our study highlighted utilization patterns and supported the clinical effectiveness of laLGPs in serious bacterial infections among a diverse patient population. While awaiting a randomized clinical trial, large national databases could help clinicians understand laLGPs' efficacy, especially for off-label use among PWUD [people who use drugs] individuals,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by David Goodman-Meza, MD, PhD, Kirby Institute, Sydney, Australia. It was published online on May 21, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The classification of people who use drugs relied solely on diagnostic codes, which may not have accurately represented the true population. The absence of culture data and the use of proxies for Gram-positive infections, potentially affected the accuracy of microbiological profiling. Additionally, adherence to antibiotic therapy and completion of standard-of-care therapy could not be directly measured in this analysis.

Optibrium, a leading developer of software and AI solutions for molecular design, today announced its partnership with TalTech (Tallinn University of Technology) to co-supervise an EU-funded PhD position as part of the INNOCHEMBIO programme. This research project will focus on developing more accurate metabolism models that will reduce the reliance on costly laboratory experiments while improving speed, efficiency and sustainability in drug discovery.

The PhD research will address a critical need in modern drug development. To overcome the limited amount of available experimental data, existing predictive models use hybrid approaches that combine machine learning with physics-based methods. The most accurate physics-based methods are too computationally expensive to apply routinely, so it's necessary to use faster but less-accurate approximations. This project aims to replace those methods with more efficient and accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). These improved models will enable pharmaceutical teams to better identify risks associated with drug metabolism and guide the design of optimal compounds for synthesis, saving time and reducing costs while aligning their efforts with green chemistry principles. This research will specifically target MLIPs for drug-like molecules and metabolism mediated by Cytochrome P450 enzymes, a family responsible for the metabolism of 70-80% of all small molecule drugs.

The developed models will be integrated directly into Optibrium's StarDrop™ platform, enhancing the company's predictive capabilities for real-world drug discovery applications. This integration ensures immediate practical relevance and positions Optibrium to deliver even greater value to pharmaceutical companies seeking efficient and sustainable drug development solutions.

The collaboration forms part of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFUND programme INNOCHEMBIO, funded by the European Commission in 2025 (Grant agreement 101217295). This initiative supports the EU's Green Deal objectives by training future experts in sustainable chemistry and biotechnology. INNOCHEMBIO will co-finance 15 PhD positions in total, with the first call for applications now open.

Industry-academia collaborations like this provide PhD candidates with unique insights into real-world challenges whilst ensuring their research has immediate practical impact. The models we develop will directly improve our ability to support pharmaceutical researchers in making more informed decisions earlier in the drug discovery process."

Mario öeren, Principal Scientist, Optibrium, and Senior Researcher, TalTech

Matthew Segall, Chief Executive Officer, Optibrium, added: "By supporting the next generation of scientists, we're not only advancing individual careers but also building the expertise needed to overcome the next greatest challenges in drug discovery. Faster and more accurate predictive models allow teams to operate more cost-effectively while minimizing waste and conserving resources."

Alphalyse, a fast-growing Danish specialist contract research organization (CRO) that has developed GMP‑validated liquid‑chromatography mass‑spectrometry (LC‑MS) assays for host‑cell‑protein (HCP) impurity testing in biologic drugs, today announces that Fidelio Capital has acquired a majority stake in the company. Alphalyse's founders will retain a significant shareholding, establishing an ambitious partnership aimed at expanding capacity, accelerating international growth, and establishing Alphalyse as the global reference in biologic HCP impurity analysis.

The partnership comes at an exciting moment for the biologics market as the drug pipeline - particularly complex modalities - continues to expand and the limitations of legacy ELISA technology become increasingly clear. LC-MS is emerging as the method of choice for drug developers and manufacturers seeking deeper process insight and stronger regulatory compliance, a trend underlined by the new U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter 1132.1 and recent discussions at the BEBPA Host Cell Protein Conference, where this shift was front and center.

Alphalyse already supports customers at every development stage, from discovery to commercial release, with quantitative, reproducible HCP data that de‑risks regulatory submissions and shortens development timelines. Its GMP‑validated assays are fully in line with the new USP chapter, positioning the company to scale rapidly and set a new industry standard for HCP impurity analysis worldwide.

Demand for precise insights into HCP impurities is growing quickly as biologics pipelines continue to expand. Fidelio's operational expertise and global network will allow us to increase our capacity and international footprint, ensuring developers and manufacturers have the data that regulators now expect from day one."

Thomas Kofoed, PhD, Co‑founder & CEO, Alphalyse

Alphalyse operates in an exciting high-growth segment undergoing a structural shift from ELISA to LC-MS. We are impressed by the highly automated, scalable platform the team has built and look forward to supporting their ambitious international expansion."

Theodor Bonnier, Fidelio Capital

President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful" budget reconciliation bill would make some of the most sweeping changes in health policy in years, largely affecting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act plans — with reverberations felt throughout the health care system.

With only a few exceptions, the budget reconciliation process — which allows the political party in control to pass a bill with only 51 votes in the Senate, rather than the usual 60 — is how nearly every major piece of health legislation has passed Congress since the 1980s.

But using reconciliation to constrict rather than expand health coverage, as the GOP is attempting now? That is unusual.

One of the best-known programs born via reconciliation is the "COBRA" health insurance continuation, which allows people who leave jobs with employer-provided insurance to keep it for a time, as long as they pay the full premium.

That is one of dozens of health provisions tucked into COBRA, or the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. Also included was the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals that take Medicare to treat or transfer patients with medical emergencies, regardless of their insurance status — a law that's become a focus of abortion opponents as they seek to limit access to the procedure.

A key reason so much health policy has passed this way has to do with how Congress manages the federal budget. Federal government spending falls into two categories: mandatory, or spending required by existing law, and discretionary, which traditionally is allocated and renewed each year as part of the appropriations process.

Lawmakers use the reconciliation process to make changes to mandatory spending programs — Medicare and Medicaid are among the largest — as well as tax policy. (For complicated political reasons, reconciliation bills cannot touch Social Security, the last prong in the entitlement program trifecta.)

Reconciliation comes into play only if it is needed to reconcile taxes or mandatory spending to comply with the terms Congress sets for itself each year, through the annual budget resolution. This year the GOP's focus is finding the cash to renew Trump's expiring tax cuts, which largely benefit wealthier Americans, and boost military and border security spending.

In years when Congress orders a reconciliation bill, health policy almost always plays a major part. Usually, reconciliation instructions call for reductions in payments to health providers under Medicare — which costs the most of the federal health programs.

For much of the 1980s and 1990s, Democrats in Congress quietly used reconciliation to expand eligibility for the Medicaid program, often by cutting more than the budget called for from Medicare. For every $5 cut from Medicare, about $1 would be redirected to provide Medicaid to more low-income people.

But budget reconciliation has also become a convenient way to make policy changes to the nation's major health programs, as it is usually considered a "must-pass" bill likely to be signed by the president and not subject to filibuster in the Senate.

As a result, all manner of now-familiar health programs were created by budget reconciliation bills, many of which provided health coverage to more Americans.

The 1989 reconciliation bill created a new system for paying doctors who treat Medicare patients, as well as a new federal agency to study the cost, quality, and effectiveness of health care, today known as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Children's health has been a popular add-on over the years, including the gradual expansion of Medicaid coverage to more children based on family income. The 1993 reconciliation bill created the Vaccines for Children program, which ensures the availability and affordability of vaccines nationwide for uninsured and underinsured kids. The 1997 reconciliation bill created the Children's Health Insurance Program, which today provides insurance to more than 7 million children.

In fact, the list of major health bills of the past 50 years not passed using budget reconciliation is short. For instance, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, which added a prescription drug benefit to the program for the first time, attracted just enough bipartisan support to pass on its own.

The biggest health care law of recent decades — the Affordable Care Act — didn't start out as a reconciliation bill, but it ended up using the process to clear its final hurdles.

After initial passage of the bill in December 2009, a special election cost Democrats their 60th seat in the Senate — and with it, the supermajority they needed to pass the bill without Republican votes. In the end, the two chambers used a separate reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, to negotiate a compromise that included the ACA.

In a new study, Microsoft's AI-powered diagnostic system outperformed experienced doctors in solving the most challenging medical cases faster, cheaper, and more accurately.

A recent study on the ArXiv preprint server compared the diagnostic accuracy and resource expenditure of AI systems with those of clinicians regarding complex cases. The Microsoft AI team demonstrated the efficient use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine to tackle diagnostic challenges that physicians struggle to decipher.

Often, physicians diagnose patients for an ailment through a clinical reasoning process that involves step-by-step, iterative questioning and testing. Even with limited initial information, clinicians narrow down the possible diagnosis by questioning the patient and confirming through biochemical tests, imaging, biopsy, and other diagnostic procedures.

Solving a complex case requires a wide-ranging set of skills, including determining the most critical following questions or tests, staying aware of test costs to prevent increasing patient burden, and recognizing evidence to make a confident diagnosis.

Multiple studies have demonstrated the enhanced efficiency of language models (LMs) in performing in medical licensing exams and highly structured diagnostic vignettes. However, the performance of most LMs was evaluated under artificial conditions, which drastically differ from real-world clinical settings.

Most LMs models for diagnostic assessments are based on a multiple-choice quiz, and the diagnosis is made from a predefined answer set. A reduced sequential diagnosis cycle increases the risk of overstating static benchmarks' model competence. Furthermore, these diagnostic models present the risk of indiscriminate test ordering and premature diagnostic closure. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an AI system based on a sequential diagnosis cycle to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce test costs.

To overcome the above-stated drawbacks of LMs models for clinical diagnosis, scientists have developed the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark (SDBench) as an interactive framework to evaluate diagnostic agents (human or AI) through realistic sequential clinical encounters.

To assess diagnostic accuracy, the current study utilized weekly cases published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the world's leading medical journal. This journal typically publishes case records of patients from Massachusetts General Hospital in a detailed, narrative format. These cases are among the most diagnostically challenging and intellectually demanding in clinical medicine, often requiring multiple specialists and diagnostic tests to confirm a diagnosis.

SDBench recast 304 cases from the 2017- 2025 NEJM clinicopathological conference (CPC) into stepwise diagnostic encounters. The medical data spanned clinical presentations to final diagnoses, ranging from common conditions (e.g., pneumonia) to rare disorders (e.g., neonatal hypoglycemia). Using the interactive platform, diagnostic agents decide which questions to ask, which tests to order, and when to confirm a diagnosis.

Information Gatekeeper is a language model that selectively discloses clinical details from a comprehensive case file only when explicitly queried. It can also provide additional case-consistent information for tests not described in the original CPC narrative. After making the final diagnosis based on information obtained from the Gatekeeper, the accuracy of the clinical evaluation was tested against the real diagnosis. In addition, the cumulative cost of all requested diagnostic tests conducted in real-world diagnosis was estimated. By evaluating diagnostic accuracy and cost, SDBench indicates how close we are to high-quality care at a sustainable cost.

The current study analyzed the performance of all diagnostic agents on the SDBench. AI agents were evaluated on all 304 NEJM cases, while physicians were assessed on a held-out subset of 56 test-set cases. This study observed that AI agents performed better on this subset than physicians.

Physicians practicing in the USA and UK with a median of 12 years of clinical experience achieved 20% diagnostic accuracy at an average cost of $2,963 per case on SDBench, highlighting the benchmark's inherent difficulty. Physicians spent an average of 11.8 minutes per case, requesting 6.6 questions and 7.2 tests. GPT -4o outperformed physicians in terms of both diagnostic accuracy and cost. Commercially available off-the-shelf models offered varied diagnostic accuracy and cost.

The current study also introduced the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), a platform co-designed with physicians, which exhibited higher diagnostic efficiency than human physicians and commercial language models. Compared to commercial LMs, MAI-DxO demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy and a significant reduction in medical costs of more than half. For instance, the off-the-shelf O3 model achieved diagnostic accuracy of 78.6% for $7,850, while MAI-DxO achieved 79.9% accuracy at just $2,397, or 85.5% at $7,184.

MAI-DxO accomplished this by simulating a virtual panel of “doctor agents” with different roles in hypothesis generation, test selections, cost-consciousness, and error checking. Unlike baseline AI prompting, this structured orchestration allowed the system to reason iteratively and efficiently.

MAI-DxO is a model-agnostic approach that has demonstrated accuracy gains across various language models, not just the O3 foundation model.

The current study's findings demonstrate AI systems' higher diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness when guided to think iteratively and act judiciously. SDBench and MAI-DxO provided an empirically grounded foundation for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis under realistic constraints.

In the future, MAI-DxO must be validated in clinical environments, where disease prevalence and presentation occur as frequently as daily, rather than as a rare occasion. Furthermore, large-scale interactive medical benchmarks involving more than 304 cases are required. Incorporation of visual and other sensory modalities, such as imaging, could also enhance diagnostic accuracy without compromising cost efficiency.

However, the authors note important limitations. NEJM CPC cases are selected for their difficulty and do not reflect everyday clinical presentations. The study did not include healthy patients or measure false positive rates. Moreover, diagnostic cost estimates are based on U.S. pricing and may vary globally.

The models were also tested on a held-out test set of recent cases (2024-2025) to assess generalization and avoid overfitting, as many of these cases were published after the training cutoff for most models.

The paper also raises a broader question: Should we compare AI systems to individual physicians or full medical teams? Since MAI-DxO mimics multi-specialist collaboration, the comparison may reflect something closer to team-based care than individual practice.

Nonetheless, the research suggests that structured AI systems like MAI-DxO may one day support or augment clinicians, particularly in settings where specialist access is limited or expensive.

Relapsed/refractory peripheral and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (R/R PTCL and CTCL) are aggressive blood cancers that often resist standard therapy. Patients with these lymphomas may require stem cell transplants, but the disease needs to be brought under control before patients can undergo this treatment. A new study by investigators from PETAL Consortium at Mass General Brigham found the combination of duvelisib and romidepsin to be effective, tolerable and safe for patients with R/R PTCL and CTCL. Their findings suggest that this drug combination offers a novel strategy to help these patients control the disease in order to be eligible for stem cell transplants. The results are published in Blood Advances.

This real-world study builds upon prior clinical trials by providing a more comprehensive view of using the drug combination in clinical practice, including variations in clinical setting, prescribing patterns, and adverse event management within a diverse, higher-risk population. Despite dose modifications and interruptions, high response rates were observed in patients."

Josie Ford, BS, first author, clinical research coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital

Clinicians administered the treatment to 38 patients, tracking treatment effectiveness, how long the patient lived and side effects. Study outcomes showed that the drug combination helped shrink or eliminate cancer in 61% of patients, with 47% having no detectable cancer. Eleven patients went on to receive stem cell transplants. Additionally, in patients with the nodal T-follicular helper cell subtype of lymphoma, 82% of patients responded well. The drug combination had manageable side effects, but one patient died from treatment-related complications.

"These findings support duvelisib and romidepsin's efficacy, safety and tolerability, and we hope the study facilitates improved access to the treatment through insurance coverage and regulatory agency approvals," said senior author Salvia Jain, MD, a founding member of the PETAL consortium and a hematologist and medical oncologist at MGH. "Future direction would lie in determining markers of response or resistance, ideally through non-invasive monitoring so the treatment can be personalized."

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), a type of arthritis commonly occurring in children, is a chronic, inflammatory condition that affects the joints, causing pain, swelling, stiffness, and limiting the range of motion. An imbalance between the regulatory and effector immune cells, primarily driven by the adaptive immune system and induced by both genetic and environmental factors, contributes to the pathogenesis of JIA.

A recent study published by researchers from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in the Genes & Diseases journal analyzed the single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in JIA patients, particularly the sJIA and non-sJIA subtypes, to understand the immune response, both pathogenic and protective, in JIA progression.

Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 14 JIA patients and four healthy controls (HCs) showed an increase in the levels of monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and platelets in JIA, along with a more pronounced pro-inflammatory response in JIA patients, particularly in sJIA versus non-sJIA subtypes.

A comparison of CD4+ cell transcriptomic profiles of sJIA, non-sJIA, and HC cells showed enrichment of DEGs associated with regulating intrinsic apoptotic signaling and VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling pathways in the sJIA and non-sJIA groups. Similarly, the CD8+ transcriptomic profiles of the three groups showed a stronger inflammatory response, lymphocyte migration, and cytotoxicity in the sJIA subtype compared to non-sJIA, while T-cell apoptosis was higher in non-sJIA.

Additionally, the B-cell response to IFN was stronger in sJIA than in non-sJIA, which suggests that while VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling is associated with JIA pathogenesis, IFN may be one of the factors contributing to the different clinical manifestations of sJIA and non-sJIA. Furthermore, non-classical monocytes were found only in the sJIA subtype, implicating its pathogenic role in sJIA.

CellChat analysis revealed that interactions between the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and NK cells with other cell populations were abundant in both sJIA and non-sJIA cases, and macrophage MIF was expressed abundantly in all cell types. This study identified a new ligand-receptor pair, MIF (CD74-CXCR2), in the sJIA subtype, whose ligand CXCR2 is expressed only in monocytes. The authors suggest that MIF (CD74-CXCR2) may serve as an indicator to distinguish the sJIA from non-sJIA subtypes.

In conclusion, this study, the first to characterize the single-cell transcriptomic profile of immune cells in different subtypes of primary JIA, holds significant implications for the precise diagnosis and classification of JIA and may guide the development of personalized treatment strategies for JIA patients.

The three most common reasons schools called emergency medical services (EMS) were for neurological crises such as seizures, psychiatric conditions or substance abuse, and trauma related injuries, according to data from the national EMS registry analyzed by researchers from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

During the study period (2018-2022), school-based medical emergencies constituted 11 percent of EMS encounters for children and two-thirds resulted in transport to the hospital. Findings, published in Pediatrics, can help schools prioritize training so staff can respond even before EMS arrival.

While many schools have taken steps to ensure they are prepared for medical emergencies, many can still enhance their preparedness. Our study results highlight specific target areas for training of school staff, given that timeliness of treatment in an emergency is essential. We also stress that certain emergency medications should be available in the school setting, including benzodiazepine for seizures, epinephrine for food allergies and albuterol for asthma."

Michael Harries, MD, MAT, MA, lead author, Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellow at Lurie Children's

The authors point out that national advocacy efforts around passing Seizure Safe Schools legislation are ongoing and effective. Nineteen states passed relevant legislation as of 2022. The model bill recommended by the Epilepsy Foundation seeks to ensure not only that staff are trained, but that seizure medication is available and first-aid responders are legally protected.

The American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on medical emergencies in schools, issued in 2022, specifies the available training programs for school staff, and the medications and equipment that schools should have on hand to respond quickly to potentially life-threatening emergencies.

The study found that physical trauma occurred more frequently in elementary school age students (17 percent), while psychiatric conditions and substance abuse were more common among adolescents (18 percent).

"Given the ongoing mental health crisis in youth, we were not surprised to find that psychiatric conditions and substance abuse were among the most common emergencies in schools," said senior author Sriram Ramgopal, MD, Emergency Medicine physician at Lurie Children's and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "Our findings underscore the need for schools to proactively address mental health needs of students, especially teenagers. This may include establishing relationships with local mental health care facilities and improved training for staff on how best to respond to a psychiatric crisis. Overall, we need consistent policies across the country to ensure that all schools are prepared for common medical emergencies."

Can our gut bacteria help clear dangerous ‘forever chemicals' from our bodies? New research reveals certain microbes rapidly sequester PFAS, offering hope for microbiome-based solutions against toxic environmental exposures.

Bacteria formed microscopic PFAS "storage units" inside their cells, cryo-imaging revealed dense PFAS clusters, explaining how they tolerate concentrations 50x higher than their environment.

Scientists have discovered that certain species of microbe found in the human gut can bioaccumulate (store internally rather than merely absorb) PFAS – the toxic and long-lasting 'forever chemicals.' They say boosting these species in our gut microbiome could potentially help increase faecal excretion of some PFAS, but direct evidence of health protection in humans is not yet available. The research is published in the journal Nature Microbiology.

PFAS have been linked with a range of health issues, including decreased fertility, developmental delays in children, and a higher risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases.

Scientists at the University of Cambridge have identified a family of bacterial species, naturally found in the human gut, that can bioaccumulate various PFAS molecules within their cells. The study showed that when a community of 20 human gut bacterial strains (“Com20”) was introduced into the guts of mice to 'humanise' the mouse microbiome, these bacteria collectively rapidly accumulated PFAS eaten by the mice, which were then excreted in faeces. The researchers also performed a separate comparison using communities containing either five high-accumulating or five low-accumulating strains.

The researchers also found that as the mice were exposed to a single oral dose of PFAS, the microbes in the colonized mice contributed to increased faecal excretion of PFAS compared to germ-free controls. The finding that gut bacteria sequester a consistent fraction of PFAS across a range of concentrations comes from in vitro experiments with B. uniformis, not from the mouse model. Within minutes of exposure, the bacterial species tested in laboratory (in vitro) kinetic studies bioaccumulated between 25% and 74% of the PFAS. This rapid uptake was demonstrated in cell cultures, whereas the 25–74% range was observed in a 24-hour screen across different strains.

Some bacteria evolved supercharged PFAS resistance in just 20 days. B. uniformis grew 46x better under PFDA exposure after lab evolution, showing rapid adaptation potential.

The results are the first evidence that our gut microbiome may play a beneficial role in removing toxic PFAS chemicals from the body, although this has not yet been directly tested in humans. The study only demonstrated increased faecal excretion in mice colonised with human gut bacteria, and did not assess PFAS levels in blood or measure health effects.

The researchers plan to utilize their discovery to develop probiotic dietary supplements that enhance the levels of these beneficial microbes in the gut, potentially protecting against the toxic effects of PFAS. However, further research, including human cohort studies, will be necessary to determine whether this strategy can effectively reduce PFAS levels and associated health risks in people.

PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) can't be avoided in our modern world. These man-made chemicals are found in many everyday items, including waterproof clothing, non-stick pans, lipsticks, and food packaging, which are used for their resistance to heat, water, oil, and grease. However, because they take thousands of years to break down, they accumulate in large quantities in the environment and in our bodies.

Dr Kiran Patil, in the University of Cambridge's MRC Toxicology Unit and senior author of the report, said: "Given the scale of the problem of PFAS 'forever chemicals', particularly their effects on human health, it's concerning that so little is being done about removing these from our bodies. We found that certain species of human gut bacteria have a remarkably high capacity to soak up PFAS from their environment at a range of concentrations, and store these in clumps inside their cells. Due to aggregation of PFAS in these clumps, the bacteria themselves seem protected from the toxic effects."

Dr Indra Roux, a researcher at the University of Cambridge's MRC Toxicology Unit and a co-author of the study, said: "The reality is that PFAS are already in the environment and our bodies, and we need to try and mitigate their impact on our health now. We haven't found a way to destroy PFAS, but our findings open the possibility of developing ways to get them out of our bodies where they do the most harm."

There is increasing concern about the environmental and health impacts of PFAS, and in April 2025, the UK launched a parliamentary inquiry into their risks and regulation.

There are over 4,700 PFAS chemicals in widespread use. Some substances are cleared out of the body through our urine in a matter of days, but others with a longer molecular structure can remain in the body for years.

Dr Anna Lindell, a researcher at the University of Cambridge's MRC Toxicology Unit and first author of the study, said: "We're all being exposed to PFAS through our water and food – these chemicals are so widespread that they're in all of us.

"PFAS were once considered safe, but it's now clear that they're not. It's taken a long time for PFAS to become noticed because at low levels they're not acutely toxic. But they're like a slow poison."

Lindell and Patil have co-founded Cambiotics, a startup, along with serial entrepreneur Peter Holme Jensen, to develop probiotics that remove PFAS from the body. They are investigating various ways to turbocharge the microbes' performance. Cambiotics is supported by Cambridge Enterprise, the innovation arm of the University of Cambridge, which helps researchers translate their work into a globally leading economic and social impact.

Not all PFAS were handled equally, long-chain types like PFDA accumulated 2x better than shorter chains, and sulfonated versions behaved differently than carboxylates in mixtures.

While the new findings show that certain gut bacteria can accumulate PFAS in the lab and animal models, not all gut bacteria are capable of doing so. The study found that some species, particularly Gram-negative strains, are high accumulators, while others are not. The experiments primarily focused on one PFAS (PFNA), so the effects may differ for other PFAS compounds.

While we wait for new probiotics to become available, the researchers suggest that the best things we can do to protect ourselves against PFAS are to avoid PFAS-coated cooking pans and use a reliable water filter.

The authors also caution that further research is needed to determine whether increasing PFAS-bioaccumulating gut bacteria will significantly reduce PFAS levels or health risks in humans. Further human studies are planned to clarify this potential.

The study also identified mechanistic details, including the role of bacterial efflux pumps (such as TolC in E. coli) and the intracellular aggregation of PFAS, visualized via cryogenic FIB-SIMS imaging. Longer-chain PFAS (such as PFDA) were found to be more efficiently bioaccumulated than shorter-chain variants.

Three years ago, the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team reached a historic collective bargaining agreement with the U.S. Soccer Federation that guaranteed equal pay and better working conditions for both the women's team and the men's team. As the women's soccer players fought for equitable working conditions, they also found a profound way to give back by funding a program to support female entrepreneurs.

"That economic justice fight is something that's a bit of an extension of our pay equity fight," Tierna Davidson, USWNT center back and current president of the USWNT Players Association, told Newsweek. "We wanted to partner with someone that was established in that space and could help us help small businesses get on their feet, whether it was starting or continuing to invest in their business."

That partner was Kiva, the social venture firm that provides microloans to women and minority-owned businesses across the world. Through Kiva, the Players Association set up a revolving loan fund and a crowdfunding platform to allow women's soccer fans to support female entrepreneurs around the country.

To date, over 5,100 businesses have received loans through this program, totaling $400,000. The initiative won a Gold Halo Award in 2023 for its social impact success and has a goal to lend out $2.5 million as the revolving fund grows.

Davidson, who plays professionally for the National Women's Soccer League's Gotham FC, won a gold medal in the 2024 Olympic Games on Team USA and was also on the bargaining committee as the USWNT Players Association sought out its new contract in the wake of the 2019 lawsuit that kicked off the fight for equal pay. She was one of the youngest players on the 2019 squad that won Team USA's fourth World Cup as fans called attention to the players' cause with chants for equal pay.

"Every conversation with U.S. Soccer's legal team, we always had at least one player represented on it," Annie Reid, director of Strategic Partnerships and Business for the USWNT Players Association, told Newsweek. "They were really, really involved."

Stars like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan fought for equal pay, even though their careers would end before the majority of the improvements in pay and working conditions took place.

"With that win, that was a long time coming, players started to think about ... Where else do we want to have impact? There's a variety of ways that we at the Players Association, with our players, have worked to have that impact," Reid said.

Reid shared that the larger economic justice mission also includes improving access to youth sports, where pay-for-play can prevent people from earning opportunities in sports, and driving equal pay for female athletes around the world.

"Looking at the steps that other national teams have taken with their own women's teams to improve their working conditions [and] improve their pay to more model their men's side is so important," Davidson said. "That was such a large part of the battle as well as understanding that it wasn't just for us, but it was for national teams globally. We've seen that drastically improve over the past couple of years. It's super evident, too, in how competitive the women's game is."

They've also improved the moneymaking potential of the name, image, and likeness of their players by driving sales of merchandise. Despite ongoing pay inequality globally, women's teams around the world have also pushed for better pay and working conditions as a result of USWNT's success.

"These women are using their platform to talk about gender equity, economic justice, equal pay. These are all systemic problems, not just in sports, but throughout many different industries," Tess Murphy, director of corporate partnerships for Kiva, told Newsweek. "They understood what economic justice and empowerment meant for them, and they wanted to extend that opportunity to other women around the country."

Six months after the signing of this collective bargaining agreement, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Equal Pay for Team USA Act, guaranteeing equal pay for men and women across all Olympic sports. Senator Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who co-sponsored the bill with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., a signal of the broader impact of the USWNT's battle.

"I ... want to thank heroes like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, who brought that case against U.S. Soccer," Cantwell said. "U.S. women's soccer led the charge after winning the World Cup and making it clear to everyone that women athletes deserve equal pay."

Kiva's data suggests that female small-business owners have a high community impact but are underserved in access to funding. These loans help them make key investments in starting or growing their business.

One such business owner is Jimbi Mboob, who owns Smiling Coast Beauty Salon in Madison, Wisconsin. Through Kiva and its USWNT partnership, she secured a $14,500 loan to double the size of her store, make interior improvements and invest in social media for marketing.

"My credit wasn't that great, and I have four kids," Mboob said. "Resources were limited. If I could get the resources to start up, getting my own chairs and booths, it will be better. So I used that to buy chairs and space that I rented for a few months just to get me on track."

Mboob shared that she's hiring people to help them get into the field of braiding and has also hosted community events, including a Juneteenth youth function that centered around hair care. She said that she would have never had the opportunity to expand her presence or give back without this loan.

"It's a lot to deal with, but through these little resources ... I'm able to get more clients coming in through my door, and I'm able to extend that [work opportunity] to other women like me," Mboob said. "I feel like I'm not only benefiting, those people benefit, too, and the community that I'm serving benefits."

The USWNT-Kiva partnership focused on supporting small businesses in cities where they were playing. They've also set up a small business fund for businesses impacted by the wildfires in Southern California.

Many USWNT members, like Morgan, have their own business ventures. Their challenging personal experiences in the marketing and sponsorship world, despite being popular pro athletes, helped them realize the need to boost women-owned businesses, especially because they do not get as much funding or support from the financial services industry.

"Even with their name and the money that they have, they saw that there is a tougher time for a business to get off the ground, particularly for women and for BIPOC owners. They have experienced that themselves," Reid said, emphasizing that challenges earning branding and sponsorship deals for the USWNT Players Association and its members is another example of the business barriers that the players faced. "Their thought is, If I'm experiencing this as the known name that I have, what is that like for your average person?"

The players embraced the larger impact they had the potential to make.

"We understood that the fight for pay equity was not just for us," Davidson said. "It's not just for our own benefit, but it's also for the benefit of many women out there, of many individuals looking to us as an inspiration."

For Davidson, the responsibilities of being on the bargaining committee and now president of the USWNTPA are certainly a lot to add to a professional athlete's loaded schedule, but she said she fell in love with learning about the work that goes on behind the scenes to operate a high-level sports team.

"It was really interesting to be able to look under the metaphorical hood of the PA and of the Federation and kind of see the inner workings that didn't have to do so much with soccer but a little bit more of the logistical side of things and understanding how much work goes into planning," Davidson said. "I take it as a responsibility, but I also get a lot of joy from it."

"They really wanted to use their platform of both their name ... but also their social media platform and their wide reach to tell this story of economic empowerment and of how hard it is to be a woman-owned small business," Murphy said.

The USWNT has a friendly matchup against Canada on July 2 in Washington, D.C., kicking off at 7:30 p.m.

We're inching ever closer to a victor.

After two cutthroat rounds — where favorites Manchester City and Inter Milan were eliminated — the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has whittled the 64-team field down to eight.

Their quarterfinal round gets underway on Friday, July 4.

To kick things off, Brazil's Fluminense takes on Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal at Orlando's Camping World Stadium at 3 p.m. EST. Both underdog clubs are surprises here; they upset the aforementioned Man City and Inter Milan.

Later that day, Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field hosts Brazil's Palmeiras and England's Chelsea in their round of eight match at 9 p.m. NBC Sports claims Chelsea is the favorite to win it all, and, to add insult to injury, Palmeiras star Estevao Willian is joining Chelsea after the CWC. This one's for pride.

The next day, Saturday, July 5 at noon, France's Paris Saint Germain will do battle with Germany's Bayern Munich at Atlanta, GA's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. PSG dismantled Lionel Messi's Inter Miami FC in their previous match while Harry Kane and Bayern held off Flamengo.

Finally, Spain's Real Madrid and Germany's Borussia Dortmund close the quarterfinals at East Rutherford, NJ's MetLife Stadium at 4 p.m. and features two exciting storylines. Kylian Mbappe, the biggest remaining star in the tourney, returns after missing a game due to a stomach issue. Also of note, Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham was set to face his younger brother Jobe, who recently joined Dortmund, but Jobe was suspended for this match due to yellow-card accumulation.

It's pretty uncommon for a pair of brothers to make it at the highest level, and even more rare for the two to face off against one another. 

Gary and Phil Neville, who spent much of their careers together at Manchester United, memorably avoided eye contact in the Goodison Park tunnel ahead of a Premier League encounter as opponents in 2010, while Kolo and Yaya Toure went head-to-head in the 2016 EFL Cup final. 

There, of course, are other high-profile examples, like Kevin-Prince and Jérôme Boateng, André and Jordan Ayew, Beppe and Franco Baresi, as well as Fabio and Paolo Cannavaro. 

Jude and Jobe Bellingham looked poised to be the next brotherly tandem to meet on the big stage, as both Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund progressed into the Club World Cup quarterfinals. However, there will be no individual face-off between the pair. Here's why. 

Madrid are taking on Dortmund in a repeat of the 2024 UEFA Champions League final at MetLife Stadium this Saturday, with a spot in the semifinals at stake. 

And while Jude is expected to earn a fifth consecutive start at the tournament, his younger brother is ineligible to feature due to suspension. 

Jobe, who joined Dortmund from Sunderland before the Club World Cup got underway in a £31 million ($42.2 million) deal, has impressed this summer, as he attempts to emulate Jude's success in the Ruhr region. 

The 19-year-old scored his first goal for the club on his first start, against Mamelodi Sundowns, but then received a booking in Dortmund's final group game against Ulsan HD. As a result, the yellow card he received in the 2–1 victory over Monterrey on Tuesday was his second of the tournament, and he'll be forced to serve a one-match ban. Jobe will be eligible to return for the semifinals if BVB advance.

“I think we all saw that he was very disappointed,” said Dortmund manager Niko Kovač post-match.

“I think he did not exactly know that the second yellow card is a suspension at half-time. He was a little bit surprised.”

While there won't be a meeting between the two in East Rutherford this weekend, plenty more opportunities for a Bellingham face-off in a competitive setting are bound to arise, even as soon as 2025–26. Dortmund's strong conclusion to the Bundesliga season meant they qualified for the Champions League, and the two teams are in Pot 1 for the league phase draw. 

However, there's less than a one in four chance that Dortmund meet Madrid in the league phase next season.

The United States men's national team are only one win away from a spot in the Gold Cup final, where they'll face the winner of Mexico and Honduras. While this semifinal match is against Guatemala instead of the expected side in Canada, it goes to show how Concacaf has improved because any team can win on their day. The USMNT almost experienced that, facing Costa Rica, where Matt Freese had to save three penalties in order to avoid going out.

That win will help propel the USMNT in this clash with Guatemala. With Mexico winning the last edition of the Gold Cup, this could give the USMNT a chance to avenge that, while players on the roster are also looking to show why they should go to the World Cup in 2026. 

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

These teams haven't met since 2016, and Guatemala hasn't scored a goal on the USMNT since 2012. This defense has had its moments of poor performances, but when that 2016 match ended in a 4-0 USMNT victory, it's easy to see how this could go. Rubio Rubin has been in good form for Guatemala and will be someone that the USMNT defense has to watch out for, but this is a game where they should be able to get a few goals in the first half to cruise to victory.

USMNT: Matt Freese, John Tolkin, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Alex Freeman, Tyler Adams, Luca De La Torre, Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, Jack McGlynn, Patrick Agyemang

Malik Tillman, PSV: Even with missing a penalty in the Costa Rica match, there may not be a player who has improved their stock more during this tournament. With three goals and an assist, Tillman has been a central figure to this run and could be rewarded for that with a move to Bayer Leverkusen. Tillman is someone who was already likely in the USMNT squad for the 2026 World Cup, but with performances like these, he's looking to break into the starting XI during the tournament. If others can follow his lead during this camp, the USMNT will be in a good place.

Can the USMNT operate as the favorites? Facing Costa Rica, the USMNT created issues for themselves in conceding penalties and having defensive lapses. It wasn't even a full-strength Costa Rica side either, which is why the result has a tinge of concern despite the good ending. It's something that this team has to work out of their systems under Pochettino and a strong performance here will go a long way. The USMNT must ensure that they aren't beating themselves as competition gets harder all around.

Luna will set the tone with an early goal, and it'll be all USMNT from there. Like their opening match to this tournament, it will be a time that things are out of reach by halftime en route to the USMNT putting up a crooked number to book their place in the final.  Pick: USMNT 5, Guatemala 0

When FIFA dubiously awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, it gave a country with no sporting history or infrastructure the right to host soccer's biggest event in an extreme summer climate. But Qatar's brutal heat became such a concern that FIFA ultimately shook up the calendar and moved the tournament to winter.

Looking ahead to the 2026 World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, weather is once again becoming a concern. And we're seeing those challenges play out at the 2025 Club World Cup.

But is FIFA going to consider a massive upheaval to the scheduling for 2026's tournament? Here's what we know so far.

While early kickoffs and high prices in NFL stadiums have contributed to lackluster attendance for many Club World Cup matches, the weather hasn't helped either.

Out of the 12 Club World Cup venues, Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium is the only one with a roof. This has largely forced players to play in summer heat that they aren't accustomed to — particularly those from the major European leagues. It also hasn't helped that the Northeast U.S. experienced a significant heat wave during the tournament.

Chelsea's match against Flamengo in Philadelphia was 97°F at kickoff with a heat index in the 100s. Borussia Dortmund players described Cincinnati's weather like playing in a sauna. And while midday summer thunderstorms are common in the Southeast and Florida, they can be disruptive. The Club World Cup has already seen several long weather delays due to lightning.

Now, it's important to note that seven Club World Cup venues won't be utilized in the World Cup. There will also be five stadiums with roofs in 2026 as opposed to just one in Atlanta. But players are still concerned.

Soccer's global players union, FIFPRO, is asking FIFA to abandon the afternoon kickoffs in the 2026 World Cup due to heat concerns.

And though the five indoor stadiums will offer relief, FIFPRO did classify the open-air stadiums in Miami, Kansas City and Monterrey as "extremely high risk." Boston, Philadelphia and Guadalajara were listed as "very high risk."

The union said via The Athletic:

Professor Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, FIFPRO's medical director, told reporters on a Zoom call on Monday: “From our research, a couple of cities and some matches on the ongoing Club World Cup can be labelled as having a higher risk for heat-related illness, or, in the worst case, extreme high risk for heat related illness.

“There are certain areas in a country that will be more at risk. So think about match destinations such as Orlando or Miami, for example, where you can see over a period of years that there's a higher risk attached to these venues and destinations.

“The question is, if we look at match scheduling and match planning ahead of the tournament, if we actually need midday kick-off times in these locations or in these high-risk areas — if we should probably move towards late kick-off times as a preferences for these venues.”

The World Cup final is slated to be played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, which FIFPRO calls "high risk."

Though discussions are ongoing between FIFA and FIFPRO, there does not seem to be any immediate plans to shift kickoff times or venues.

And as right now, New Jersey expects the 2026 World Cup final to kick off at 3 p.m. Eastern Time, which is the traditional local time kickoff for the final match.

New Jersey governor Phil Murphy said:

“I don't want to speak for FIFA, and obviously they call the shots, but I think they're circling in and around 3 p.m. New Jersey time for the World Cup final on July 19,” Murphy told The Athletic by phone on Tuesday.

FIFA also commented about the weather via USA TODAY:

“FIFA's top priority is the health of everyone involved in football,” a spokesman said. “FIFA will continue to monitor the weather conditions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.”

This late in the process, it would be almost unheard of for FIFA to shake up the hosting cities or change venues. But there are seven indoor stadiums (Arizona, Detroit, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Indianapolis and San Antonio) that were not chosen to host World Cup matches.

FIFA has plenty of options when it comes to the tournament in U.S. weather. We'll have to see what FIFA chooses to do about it.

Began working for Murphy as an intern in 2019

By David Wildstein, July 02 2025
1:00 pm

A top aide to Gov. Phil Murphy has left the governor's office to take a key post at the FIFA World Cup New York/New Jersey Host Committee.

Natalie Hamilton, who joined Murphy's staff as an intern in 2019, joined the governor's office in 2021 and became press secretary in 2024.  She will serve as the director of communications of the host committee.

“Natalie's deep knowledge of the region—its people, its diversity, and its energy—makes her uniquely positioned to help share our story with the world,” said Alex Lasry, the host committee CEO.  “We're excited to have someone with her regional insight, strategic vision, and commitment to community and public service help lead our efforts as we prepare to welcome the world in 2026.”

Murphy praised Hamilton's service.

“Natalie Hamilton has been an invaluable member of my team. Her sharp judgment, tireless work ethic, and strong, respectful relationship with the press corps made her an outstanding Press Secretary,” Murphy said.  “While we're saddened to see her depart for the NYNJ Host Committee, I'm confident she'll excel as the committee's director of communications.”

After graduating from the University of Delaware, Hamilton worked on Murphy's re-election campaign in 2021 and joined the governor's office that year.

In 2023, she took a short leave of absence to serve as a communications advisor to Brandon Presley, the Democratic candidate for governor of Mississippi.

Hey there! While the Gold Cup and Club World Cup enter their final stages, another major tournament will begin Wednesday in Switzerland, where 16 of the best national teams have convened for the Women's Euros. A jam-packed week is in full swing – and that's without considering the U.S. women's national team's big friendly against Canada on Wednesday! I'm Pardeep Cattry with the latest as the summer of soccer shows no signs of slowing down.

It is the U.S. men's national team's turn to take center stage during the country's busy summer of soccer on Wednesday, when they face Guatemala in the Concacaf Gold Cup semifinals. History – and the odds – favor Mauricio Pochettino's side but as surprises and upsets continue to define this edition of the Gold Cup, Wednesday's match in St. Louis also provides the USMNT to make a real statement.

The USMNT reached the semifinals the hard way with a penalty shootout win over Costa Rica on Sunday in the quarterfinals, a game of trials and tribulations that also arguably serves as the first gutsy, meaningful win of Pochettino's tenure with the national team. He has handed the task of winning the USMNT's first Gold Cup in four years to a group of inexperienced players, several of whom are starting to make a case for themselves – the Bayer Leverkusen-bound Malik Tillman is the standout so far, but on Sunday, goalkeeper Matt Freese, defender Max Arfsten and midfielder Diego Luna also had their moments.

Going into the semifinals, the question facing the USMNT is whether they can translate Sunday's positives into genuine upward momentum and provide reasons for optimism after a year of disappointing performances and results. That includes a focus on the individual players, all of whom are competing to earn a spot amongst the regulars once that version of the team reconvenes later this year, all with an eye on next year's World Cup roster.

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., the U.S. women's national team are undergoing a similar period of experimentation as they take on Canada, though the stakes are different. Head coach Emma Hayes has earmarked this friendly as the end of her vast project to explore the USWNT's wider player pool, giving a group of young players one last chance to impress as Hayes spends the next two years building chemistry in time for the Women's World Cup. The head coach will not be short on impressive options in a variety of positions, though the chance to succeed Alyssa Naeher as the USWNT's first choice in goal is something to keep an eye on – Mandy McGlynn and Claudia Dickey each started games in the last week against Ireland, while Angelina Anderson rounds out the rostered goalkeepers for this camp.

The summer of major international tournaments kicks into high gear on Wednesday with the start of the Women's Euros, which is expected to be the latest showcase for the growth of women's soccer in the region. Look no further than the competitive group of teams that have a realistic shot at the title – reigning world champions Spain are in the mix to win the competition for the first time and build a dynastic legacy two years after lifting the Women's World Cup, while a resurgent Germany look to build upon their bronze medal run at last year's Olympics. Sandra Herrera, though, argues this is England's title to lose, placing them atop her pre-tournament power rankings.

The tournament will be just as much of a spotlight for Europe's top teams as it will be for the continent's best players, including many of the usual suspects as well as those ready for a breakout performance. That's especially true for Spain, who still boast Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati, though her availability to start the tournament is still a question after a battle with meningitis. Spain still pack plenty of punch when it comes to goalscorers, who should be able to operate just fine at the start even without Bonmati pulling the strings behind them – the in-form, NWSL-based Esther Gonzalez is in the mix, while rising talent Claudia Pina is the pick to become the game's next big star with a statement-making showing in Switzerland.

Club World Cup's last eight confirmed

While there's plenty of action in Switzerland and the U.S., the Club World Cup will take the next few days off after locking in its quarterfinalists. Real Madrid joined the last eight on Tuesday with a 1-0 win over Juventus and will play Borussia Dortmund in a rematch of the 2024 UEFA Champions League final, with the German side beating Monterrey 2-1 later that day. The much-awaited battle of the Bellingham brothers will have to wait for another day, though – Dortmund's Jobe will be suspended for Saturday's quarterfinal, meaning Real Madrid's Jude will be the only Bellingham available for selection.

The biggest surprises of the competition so far, though, came on Monday. First was Fluminense's 2-0 win over Inter in an upset that was just waiting to happen – the victors are one of two Brazilian sides remaining at the Club World Cup, which has been a showcase for teams from the country, while Inter have been in middling form for months now. Nothing was quite as surprising as Al-Hilal's 4-3 win over Manchester City, defeating the English side in extra time after a thrilling match. City were the dominant side with 30 shots but their sloppiness in the back cost them, with Al-Hilal now the only team from outside Europe and South America left in the competition.

For the second time this FIFA Club World Cup, Xabi Alonso benched Rodrygo in a must-win game for Real Madrid.

Rodrygo's future at Real Madrid has been uncertain ever since Carlo Ancelotti overlooked the winger in a title-deciding El Clásico. The Brazilian logged zero minutes against Barcelona and then missed out on Los Blancos' final league matches of the season due to fitness concerns.

The arrival of Alonso was supposed to be a fresh start for Rodrygo after his poor 2024–25 campaign in which he found the back of the net just once in his final 22 appearances. It looked like the 24-year-old was a part of his new manager's plans when he got the nod against Al Hilal in Real Madrid's Club World Cup opener.

Except Los Blancos went on to only collect a point from the disappointing 1–1 draw. Rodrygo, despite assisting Real Madrid's lone goal, was pulled in the 65th minute and then benched against Pachuca. He then only featured for 23 minutes in Real Madrid's 3–0 victory over RB Salzburg to close out the group stage.

Things got even more bleak for Rodrygo when he was once again left out Alonso's XI for Real Madrid's round of 16 match against Juventus. Even when Los Blancos were desperate for an insurance goal in the latter stages of the game, the Brazil international was kept on the bench.

Rodrygo has now played just 23 minutes in Real Madrid's last three matches, and 88 overall in the Club World Cup. The likes of Brahim Díaz and Dani Ceballos have more appearances than the winger in the United States this summer, a loud statement from Alonso.

Although the new Real Madrid boss insisted Rodrygo has “a big role to play” in the tournament, he is putting his trust in just Vinícius Júnior and now a healthy Kylian Mbappé up top, while Trent Alexander-Arnold occupies much of the right wing. 

The lack of minutes does nothing but fuel the transfer rumors surrounding Rodrygo. The Brazilian has been linked with several Premier League clubs this summer, including Arsenal and Chelsea, and could soon find himself playing in the English top-flight should Alonso continue relegating him to the bench.

The Gunners, in particular, have their sights set on Rodrygo. The two-time Champions League winner would finally be able to play on his preferred left wing with a move to north London, providing a solution to Arsenal's attacking woes from this last season. Still, Mikel Arteta's side will likely have difficulty financing such a deal.

All eyes will be on Rodrygo when Real Madrid take on Borussia Dortmund in the Club World Cup quarterfinals.

In a summer full of soccer, there's one match that stands out among the rest. The rivalry between the U.S. Women's National Team and Canada is one of the fiercest and most storied in women's soccer. And with the 67th edition on July 2 in the Allstate Continental Clásico, two players are on this week's episode to share their very different perspectives: Lynn Biyendolo, the veteran forward who recently captained the USWNT for the first time, and defender Jordyn Bugg, who at 18 years old just made her first career start.

Together, they join David Gass and Megan Klingenberg to discuss the 600th win in USWNT history (6:30), the superpowers of a soft-spoken leader (15:30), Lynn's thoughtful choice to change the name on her jersey (17:00) and Jordyn's decision to go pro at 17 years old (19:15) before diving into the rivalry with Canada (23:05). Then, the group concludes with some fun rapid-fire questions (34:00) including their takes on ‘Love Island USA' Season 7.

Nearly 100 civil rights groups have signed a letter sent to FIFA expressing concern over United States immigration policies ahead of the men's soccer World Cup next year, which will feature several matches hosted in New Jersey.

The July 1 letter, first reported by The Athletic, urged soccer's top governing body to "use its influence to encourage the U.S. government to guarantee the fundamental rights of the millions of foreign visitors and fans." The message cited recent policies enforced by President Donald Trump, including a full travel ban for citizens of 12 countries and nationwide raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.

"If FIFA continues to stay silent, not only will millions be placed at risk, but the FIFA brand will also be used as a public relations tool to whitewash the reputation of an increasingly authoritarian government," the civil rights organizations stated.

Groups that signed the letter include Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP. The message was also signed by unions based in eight states scheduled to host World Cup matches: New York, Pennsylvania, California, Massachusetts, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Missouri.

MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford will be the site of eight fixtures during the 2026 World Cup, including the final on July 19. The United States is co-hosting the tournament along with Mexico and Canada.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino supported the efforts of the U.S. to host the World Cup at the annual FIFA Congress in Paraguay May 15, where he said foreigners will have no issues entering the country next summer.

"The world is welcome in America," Infantino said. "Of course, the players, of course, everyone involved, all of us, but definitely also all the fans."

Vice President JD Vance, in a May 6 White House event touting the upcoming tournament, shared the same sentiment but warned travelers not to overstay their visas.

"We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game," he said. "But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Otherwise, they will have to talk to (U.S. Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem."

The 2026 World Cup kicks off June 11 in Mexico City.

The United States Women's National Team played a series of friendly matches against the Republic of Ireland, earning two back-to-back 4-0 wins. After stringing together a series of impressive performances in the first half of the 2025 NWSL season, all four Reign FC players saw the pitch, marking many milestone moments.

 

Lynn Biyendolo

Forward Lynn Biyendolo, a United States Women's National Team veteran, has been called upon to lead the squad this international window. She is the oldest player on the June/July camp roster and has 82 career caps. 

She reached two milestones in the USWNT's most recent match against the Republic of Ireland – she was captain of the team for the first time and reached her 25th international goal.

The USWNT patiently passed the ball around the field to create the scoring opportunity, with Sam Meza, Emma Sears and Biyendolo leading the charge. The quick series of passes opened up space out wide for Sears to run and chip a cross into the box. Biyendolo was poised in front of the goal, making no mistake as she volleyed the ball into the left side of the net.

Jordyn Bugg

Jordyn Bugg, the youngest player on the USWNT roster, made her first appearance for the United States on June 26. The 4-0 win saw Bugg come onto the field in the 73rd minute, replacing Naomi Girma and becoming the 280th player in USWNT history to earn a cap. She is the youngest USWNT debutante since Olivia Moultrie debuted at 18 years and 76 days in 2023.

The 18-year-old earned her first start in the very next match and played a full 90 minutes alongside fellow defenders Emily Sams, Tara McKeown and Izzy Rodriguez.

Claudia Dickey

Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey made her first appearance for the United States on June 26. She became the 29th goalkeeper in USWNT history to earn a cap. A long time in the making, Dickey had previously joined the senior national team this year but had not yet made an appearance prior to this international window.

She didn't have a lot of work to do as the United States captured the shutout, as Ireland managed just two shots, both of which were off target. She was tested in the 61st minute the match, as Ireland's Kyra Carusa fired a close-range shot that required a quality stop from Dickey, but in the end, the play ended up being called offside and the save would not appear on the stats sheet.

Sam Meza

Midfielder Sam Meza also made her United States debut, starting the match on June 29. She became the first player to play in the USL Super League and earn a USWNT cap. She showed her quality in the midfield, using her strength and tenacity to control possession of the ball for the United States, in addition to connecting quick passes. She played for 87 minutes before giving way to Rose Lavelle. 

She debuted alongside Izzy Rodriguez as the two became the 281st and 282nd players to earn a cap for the USWNT and the 23rd and 24th players to debut under head coach Emma Hayes. They are also the 12th and 13th players of Hispanic descent to play for the USWNT.

Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m; forward has signed an eight-year deal with the Blues; Brazil international will join Chelsea at the Club World Cup; Pedro could make Chelsea debut in quarter-final against Palmeiras on Saturday

Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m.

The 23-year-old has signed an eight-year deal and is already in the USA with his new Chelsea team-mates for the Club World Cup.

Pedro will be able to play for Chelsea at the tournament as clubs are allowed to register players between June 27 and July 3.

It means the Brazil international could make his Chelsea debut in the Club World Cup quarter-finals against Palmeiras in Philadelphia on Saturday and has the chance to win a trophy within his first month at the club.

"I grew up watching the Premier League, and Chelsea were a club that won trophies. So, when you join Chelsea, you can only think one thing: to win trophies," he said.

"Every competition, you have to think, 'I play for Chelsea and that is my ambition'."

Newcastle had also been interested in Pedro and had a bid of around £50m rejected, but it is understood Pedro only wanted to play for Chelsea.

Watford, who sold Pedro to Brighton for £35m in 2023, will be due 20 per cent of the profit from this deal. Chelsea have good relations with Brighton, who have a sell-on clause in the deal.

The Blues view Pedro as a versatile forward who can play as a No 9 or across the front line. He scored 30 goals in 70 appearances

Pedro's transfer takes Chelsea's spend on Brighton players to £260m since 2022. He has followed Marc Cucurella (£63m), Robert Sanchez (£25m) and Moises Caicedo (£115m) in making the move to west London.

Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler says selling Pedro to Chelsea is an "excellent deal" for the club

Hurzeler said: "This is a good move for all parties. It's an excellent deal for the club, and a good return on a significant investment in an area of the pitch where we have a lot of competition and are already well served in terms of our attacking talent.

"It's also an exciting move for Joao: it gives him the opportunity to play Champions League football this coming season, and he will of course be keen to cement his position in the Brazil team ahead of the World Cup next summer.

"Joao has given us some wonderful moments - during my time and before I came to the club - so on behalf of everyone I would like to thank him for his service over the past two seasons and wish him the best for the future."

Sky Sports News' James Savundra and Elliot Cook:

Brighton had no intention of selling Pedro in this window but were aware of mounting Premier League interest.

The 23-year-old's ambition to play at the top level of European football has been no secret and he's also keen to put himself firmly in the picture for next summer's World Cup.

Brighton will continue to sell players when they consider it the right time for both themselves and the player - as long as the value is matched. They will not stand in a player's way if their value is met.

After Pedro was sent off against Brentford and was involved in an altercation during training with Jan Paul van Hecke, it seemed an exit this summer could happen.

While he is not regarded as a troublemaker, the incidents did not go down well internally. Pedro moved to Brighton from Watford in May 2023 and had 40 goal contributions in all competitions across 70 games.

He was the top scorer in the Europa League group stage during the 2023/24 season, including a late winner against Marseille.

The fee from Chelsea represents a significant profit on a player who helped the club achieve a top-10 finish last season and who was their top scorer in their first campaign in Europe.

The club will bide their time when it comes to assessing their attacking plans. Their existing options include record signing Georginio Rutter, Danny Welbeck, Evan Ferguson and new signing Charalampos Kostoulas - whom the club have extremely high hopes for.

The USMNT beat Costa Rica in one penalty shootout, just hours after Guatemala did the same to eliminate Canada, setting up an unlikely semifinal showdown in the semifinals of the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup on Wednesday (7 pm ET).

Mauricio Pochettino's side erased an early deficit with goals two minutes before and after halftime, but the Ticos hit back in the 71st minute and took the Yanks to spot kicks. Goalkeeper Matt Freese wound up the hero of the day after saving three of six attempts from 12 yards. Even without the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun and Yunus Musah, the Americans are in the semifinals of the Gold Cup for the 13th straight tournament.



Kick off time: 7 pm ET, WednesdayHow to watch: FS1, TUDNStream online: FOXSports.com or the FOX Sports app



Two USMNT players, Malik Tillman and Patrick Agyemang, felt slightly worse for wear when they awoke on Monday after throwing themselves into 34 duels (18 won) and suffering eight fouls between them. Tillman took six of those fouls and at looked like he might have to come off at multiple points during the second half, only to go the full 90 and redeem himself in the penalty shootout after he hit the post from the spot in the 37th minute. Tillman has been a revelation at this tournament (3 goals, 1 assist) after finishing the Eredivisie season with a bang (5 goals, 1 assist in eight games upon returning from an ankle injury. Next stop: Bayer Leverkusen? And then, World Cup starting XI for the USMNT? We shall see, sooner rather than later.

Guatemala found themselves a goal down midway through the first half as well, and their fortunes also changed right before halftime when Jacob Shaffelburg was shown his second yellow card and sent off. Los Chapines equalized through former United States international Rubio Rubin, who switched his international allegiance in 2022 to represent his mother's homeland. Rubio has scored 13 goals in 34 appearances. 

At this point of the tournament, Pochettino's team just about picks itself with promising performers (Tillman, Agyemang and Diego Luna) becoming breakout stars across the front line. As their chemistry grows, so will their output. USMNT 3-1 Guatemala.

Chelsea have reached the quarter-finals of the Club World Cup, and will be backing themselves to win the whole thing due to how the tournament has progressed.

After finishing second in their group behind Flamengo, the Blues have been handed the easier side of the draw on paper. Chelsea aimed a dig at the Brazilian side upon their exit from the competition.

Manchester City will no longer be a threat to Chelsea, whilst Thiago Silva helped knock out Champions League finalists Inter Milan with a dominant defensive performance.

The Blues face Palmeiras in the quarter-final, with Enzo Maresca getting his first up-close look at Estevao Willian ahead of his transfer to the club.

With Estevao frustrated at his manager, there will be optimism amongst the Blues that they can progress, which would set up a semi-final tie against Fluminense or Al-Hilal.

Despite a potential final against one of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or PSG, the Opta Supercomputer is giving out positive results when it comes to Chelsea's chances.

As per The Analyst, the Blues have a 26.8% chance of winning the competition, making them the favourites to win the whole thing.

Maresca has already delivered silverware in his first season at Stamford Bridge in the form of the Conference League, however the Club World Cup being added to it would make for a remarkable 12 months in charge.

Maresca has been forced to utilise most of his outfield players during the competition due to the extreme weather conditions facing Chelsea in the United States.

Therefore he will be delighted that Joao Pedro is set to join the club after his £60m move from Brighton is set to be announced imminently.

Pedro is available for the Club World Cup, whereas Jamie Gittens will have to wait for his debut after featuring in the competition for Borussia Dortmund.

With Maresca a big fan of Pedro, it can be expected that he will give serious consideration to playing the Brazilian despite his limited time with the first team squad.

Herculez Gomez takes a look at what the USMNT still has to improve on after narrowly beating Costa Rica on penalties in the Gold Cup. (1:59)

Alejandro Zendejas is arguably the most important player for the biggest team in North American soccer.

Since arriving to Mexico City giants Club América in 2022, the FC Dallas academy product has been a revelation. His efforts have helped cement three Liga MX titles with Las Águilas, and when including all competitions, that trophy haul then extends to five.

Selected as a member of the Best XI for the Concacaf Champions Cup in 2024 and Player of the Month earlier this year in Liga MX -- a league whose top teams are the powerhouses of the continent -- the 27-year-old native of El Paso, Texas, has been nothing short of exceptional.

Zendejas' reward? Watching the U.S. men's national team from afar as they take part in this summer's Gold Cup.

When head coach Mauricio Pochettino revealed his MLS-heavy roster shorn of marquee attacking names such as Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah and Giovanni Reyna, Zendejas seemed perfectly suited to guide the backup squad that didn't have many key players. Leaving the winger out ensured zero representation for Liga MX, a league that was once a vital source of talent for the USMNT.

Twelve years ago, at the 2013 Gold Cup, the U.S. had six players from Mexico's first division. A handful of players were also added in the two following Gold Cup tournaments, as well as at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.

But that fútbol influence is now diminishing.

Why is a game-changing América starter like Zendejas still left out? And with no Liga MX player currently in the picture, when so many prominent figures are missing at the Gold Cup, what has happened to the Liga MX-USMNT connection?

"He's going to play on June 1 [with América] against [LAFC] to see if he qualifies for the Club World Cup, so he's a player where there was a risk to consider him," Pochettino told members of the media when asked why Zendejas wasn't included in a USMNT training camp ahead of the Gold Cup.

"We considered him, but the risk was that if they won that match, they would be the ones who would be available to play [at the Club World Cup]."

América went on to lose that Club World Cup play-in match, thereby leaving a window of time for Zendejas to be chosen by Pochettino, who then didn't select him. Despite Pochettino stating that the Texan was "considered," it's worth noting that the América player wasn't called up to the 23-man Concacaf Nations League roster in March.

It becomes even more of a head-scratching decision when considering the lack of wingers at Pochettino's disposal for the 4-2-3-1 lineup he's preferred in this tournament. Malik Tillman, Brenden Aaronson, Quinn Sullivan and Jack McGlynn all have played in wide attacking roles this summer -- Tillman, Aaronson and Sullivan historically have operated more centrally, while McGlynn is a traditional central midfielder.

"It sucks, man. I've watched Zendejas," Sebastian Saucedo, who has had runs in both Liga MX and MLS while representing the U.S. youth national team, said to ESPN. "You know how big América is in Mexico, you know what I mean? For him to perform like that ... I don't know, I think that Zendejas deserves more."

Alejandro Guido, a former player in both Liga MX and MLS who was called up to the USMNT in 2018 while with Tijuana, was also perplexed by Zendejas' omission.

"He's playing for if not the biggest club in North America and doing a great job," said the now FC Cincinnati 2 assistant coach. "Being a foreign player, winning titles. I mean, I just don't know another player that's been doing that as consistently in MLS."

One possible reason for Zendejas' absence? His USMNT performances haven't mirrored his brilliant form in Mexico.

Last season, Zendejas provided an impressive tally of 22 goal contributions (goals plus assists) across 3,063 minutes of play, one every 139.2 minutes. In a much smaller sample size for the USMNT, that production drops to two goal contributions across a total of 511 minutes since his 2023 debut, one every 255.5 minutes.

"I'm a big believer in Zendejas and his level in Liga MX, but certainly when we're talking about the U.S. men's national team, he's not exactly showered himself in glory," said Herculez Gomez, an ESPN analyst and former USMNT striker that played in both MLS and Liga MX. "Do I think he's done enough to merit call-ups? Absolutely. Do I think it's a mistake if they leave him off? I don't know ... He's one of those players that when he's played for the national team, you've seen glimpses, but he's never really had that type of performance where you could say, 'This is why he needs to be here.'"

Aside from Zendejas, why haven't other U.S.-eligible players stepped up from Liga MX? That may simply be due to the current numbers.

Of the 16 American players in Liga MX in 2024-25, only 22-year-old FC Juarez full back Ralph Orquin (now back at América after his loan spell with Juarez) was as frequent of a starter for his club side as Zendejas. After those two names, the U.S. list then ranges from rotational options to scarce minutes. Coupled with a growing MLS and more players landing in Europe, it's perhaps not a shock that Liga MX's USMNT influence is at a low point.

"[Orquin] should be given an opportunity, you see a lot of new MLS guys getting an opportunity," Saucedo said. "These guys should get one too, but there is a lack of Mexican-Americans in Mexico that used to play at a top level like Joe [Corona], like Ventura [Alvarado]."

Guido has seen firsthand how the gap between Liga MX and MLS isn't as great as it once was. Before going pro across the border with Tijuana in 2012, the San Diegan at first considered signing with the Colorado Rapids before ultimately deciding that Liga MX would be better for his career.

"I could just tell the level wasn't the same as in Mexico," said the FC Cincy 2 assistant. But now? "It's a lot different, man. It's a lot better, and yes, I would be considering if I was starting [my career today] to play in the U.S."

As seen in the aforementioned lack of minutes for many U.S. players in Mexico, it's difficult to make your mark in a Liga MX whose split seasons emphasizes short-term goals at the expense of long-term development. While that condensed format leads to unpredictable and entertaining soccer, it also means that many managers aren't willing to take chances on the younger generation when needing to find success in such limited timeframes.

"You know the landscape in Liga MX, young players don't get much opportunity," Gomez said. "Liga MX doesn't really prioritize their youth."

Alianza, the largest amateur grassroots soccer program in the United States for Latinos, has also seen a developing trend with MLS being able to provide more pathways in players' own backyards.

For years, the program was dominated by Liga MX scouts who would offer pathways for budding U.S. stars through the Mexican league. That's changing.

"We love all the scouts from Liga MX and they're always big supporters and they continue to show up to our events, but there has definitely been a shift with more and more MLS teams coming to our events," Daina Lecuona, a director at Alianza, said to ESPN. "There's a lot of these players that were slipping through the cracks previously that were landing up in Liga MX teams, but now that [MLS] academies are getting more and more well funded ... now you have more and more pumping funding into the academy system, so they're sending scouts or being able to canvas a lot wider of an area.

On "The Football Reporters" podcast, Jeff Carlisle gauges how USMNT fans are feeling about Mauricio Pochettino's time in charge of the team.

"The pathway in the U.S. is such a great thing right now, and it wasn't the case 10 to 15 years ago."

For now, at the Gold Cup, that pathway seems to be working for the USMNT.

With plenty of MLS options stepping up, Pochettino and his men earned three consecutive victories in the group stage and recently defeated Costa Rica on penalties in a dramatic quarterfinal clash. Although they've battled through some close calls, few could complain about a goal differential of +7 through 360 minutes of play.

All that said, the stakes and competition will be much higher in the latter stages of the knockouts for a group of players that still has plenty to prove. For many of these MLS-based options, the intensity and expectations might be something they've never experienced before in a league that's growing, but still developing.

In Liga MX, meanwhile, there are certain intangibles that can be gleaned by a decisive attacker like Zendejas, who has shined in a league that not only has a significant amount of history but also an ongoing domination of the region with 19 of the last 20 Concacaf club titles. And when things inevitably become difficult for Pochettino's men in the Gold Cup's latter stages, Zendejas' experience may have proven invaluable.

"Playing in the [Estadio] Azteca against Cruz Azul is very different from playing in MLS, there's still that component that you can't find in MLS," Guido said. "The way you mature, the way you adapt to a different culture, it's just going there and thinking exclusively about soccer and leaving your family to pursue your dream ... it's definitely more challenging and I do agree that it brings a different sense of maturity to a player."

Saucedo agreed, and despite no current spot for a Liga MX player in the USMNT, the winger still hopes to see others following in his and Zendejas' footsteps.

"The way I saw it was, I'm gonna go and sacrifice, going away from home, going and seeing what it's like to play at one of the biggest clubs in Mexico ... everything that I experienced, I soaked it in," he said. "I wish I could see more kids sacrifice ... giving it a try."

Joao Pedro has been playing in England since joining Watford from Fluminense in 2020

Joao Pedro has become the 18th forward to sign for Chelsea in just over three years under their current owners.

He joins from Brighton in a deal worth £60m, taking their total spending on attackers in that period to £560m. 

And the 23-year-old could go straight in to the squad for Chelsea's Club World Cup quarter-final with Palmeiras on Saturday in Philadelphia.

Typically for a Blues signing, Joao Pedro has signed a long contract - eight years - although the club can no longer spread the cost of his transfer over the length of the deal after that loophole was closed by the Premier League.

The Fluminense youth product scored 30 goals in 70 games for Brighton after joining from Watford in 2023 for just under £30m, which at the time was a club record fee.

"Everyone knows this is a big club with a great history," he said. "They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing - win."

Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said it was a "good move for all parties".

"It's an excellent deal for the club, and a good return on a significant investment in an area of the pitch where we have a lot of competition and are already well served in terms of our attacking talent," he added.

"It's also an exciting move for Joao - it gives him the opportunity to play Champions League football this coming season, and he will of course be keen to cement his position in the Brazil team before the World Cup next summer."

Chelsea's spending looks set to rise further. They have had a £55m bid for English winger Jamie Gittens, 20, accepted by Borussia Dortmund.

What might Pedro offer for Chelsea?

Once Chelsea's move for Gittens goes through, they will have added Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap to an already strong attack featuring Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson, Pedro Neto, Noni Madueke, Christopher Nkunku, Marc Guiu and Tyrique George.

Estevao Willian is also joining the club after the Club World Cup as he prepares to face Chelsea with Palmeiras on Sunday.

It might feel as though Chelsea are almost doing deals just for the sake of it, but there is a specific plan.

The signing of Joao Pedro is expected to add competition for the number nine and 10 positions, with Nkunku expected to leave.

Gittens will come in as a left winger and replace Jadon Sancho after his loan spell from Manchester United was not made permanent. It's also worth noting Mykhailo Mudryk remains provisionally suspended for a failed drugs test.

Delap comes in to add competition for Jackson in the number nine position, with Chelsea having looked short up front last season.

Chelsea are not forcing any of the players in their Club World Cup squad out but could accept substantial offers for Madueke or Jackson, who are not deemed untouchable like Palmer is at Stamford Bridge.

It's worth noting Chelsea have eight attackers for four forward positions, but we haven't mentioned the likes of midfielders Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos, who often play as number 10s as well.

The prospect of loaning out Guiu and George, both 19, remains open. They played a substantial part in last season's Conference League campaign, but Chelsea need to strengthen the squad now they are back in the Champions League.

The likes of exiled attackers Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix and Armando Broja remain at the club and are available for sale.

Chelsea's deal for Joao Pedro takes their spending on initial transfer fees to £1.32bn in seven transfer windows, including this one, under their current ownership.

The expected arrival of Gittens would mean the club's outlay surpasses £1.5bn in three years once you include potential add-ons and Joao Felix's loan fee. Even taking into account sales, their net spend is £1.07bn.

Chelsea's gross and net spends were the most in the Premier League in their first three transfer windows under the current owners. 

The club have been quiet in the past two winters but spent the most again last summer – though their net spend was only the seventh highest – and are on course to be the Premier League's biggest spenders once more ahead of the new season.

More than £560m, or 43%, of Chelsea's spending on guaranteed fees has been on 18 attacking players. Thirteen of those have made their debut for the Blues, with mixed returns so far.

By buying younger players on lower wages and spreading the payments over long-term contracts, Chelsea's strategy is to unearth new stars and sell on unwanted talent for a profit.

But their ability to further bolster their ranks may be determined by the Premier League's response to the sale of their women's team to parent company BlueCo for £198.7m - a process that put the wider business into profit.

This move gave them "headroom" under the Premier League spending rules, while Chelsea's finances are also being boosted by playing in next season's Champions League and the Club World Cup run.



Chelsea's sale of their women's team to themselves - what does it mean?

Edu Rubio, former West Ham, Crystal Palace and Wolves coach:

Some may wonder 'why this signing?' but for me, Joao Pedro is exactly what Chelsea need. He also falls into the category of young player with potential, to bring more revenue in a future sale, of course; but he is Premier League tested and proven, he is not a gamble.

He can come short, hold the ball and link up play to help the team with their attacks. He can offer Liam Delap space for forward runs, which will stretch the opposition and offer Chelsea more pockets and options in the final third.

Joao offers more of a much-needed presence in that final build-up than Nicolas Jackson. His ideal position is striker but he can also play as a false nine and offers Enzo Maresca more options.

His work off the ball and physicality will also support the style and DNA that Maresca is looking to build on in his second year at the helm. Joao's stats in penalty kicks, assists and open-play goals are also impressive. He definitely brings a new game dimension to Chelsea.

He has not gone past 11 league goals in a season so there might be a question mark there. Can he become a top player now that he is in a Champions League team?

There is a fresh Fortnite mystery that's swept the gaming world, but this time, football is the mystery itself—it just happens to center on why three of England's biggest clubs aren't attending the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. Manchester City will be attending, but Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal won't. Why aren't they participating, and what does that indicate about the selection process for the teams?

32 of the world's largest clubs will be invited to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, but none of England's giants. Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal were not invited alongside their counterparts, reports Gistreel, on the basis of a strict points-based system used by FIFA. The system awards clubs points in line with performances over the past four years in the UEFA Champions League, and only the most frequent and consistent clubs are invited.

Manchester United, despite all their past glory, have been performing terribly in the recent past in European competitions. Liverpool, who won the Champions League in 2019, failed to gain enough points in the next seasons. Arsenal, however, returned to the Champions League a few months ago after many years and failed to gain enough points to qualify.

TalkSport informs us that the qualification relied on how the club did between 2021 and 2024 in the Champions League. Manchester City, Chelsea, and Real Madrid qualified since they won the tournament or maintained a consistent streak in the latter stages of the tournament. United, Liverpool, and Arsenal did not qualify, forfeiting precious points and ultimately a spot in the longer tournament.

There has to be caution against confusing Manchester United with Manchester City, who will represent England at the 2025 Club World Cup. Manchester City's recent dominance of football on the pitch in European as well as domestic football, capped by a Champions League title, ensured their participation. The same could not be assured of United, Liverpool, or Arsenal, whose recent European display was short of the required standard as provided by FIFA.

As TalkSport summarizes, “Manchester City, Chelsea, and Real Madrid are already among the clubs to have secured spots in the 2025 Club World Cup.”

United, Liverpool, and Arsenal's absence is a reminder that past triumphs won won't secure future appearances—performances today alone matter. Rebuild now begins for the three clubs.

The redesigned Club World Cup is more clubs, sure, but more competition. Performing at the European standard should be a priority for the club in the event that they wish to be the largest in the sporting arena globally. United, Liverpool, and Arsenal view it wake-up call and a time for a comeback next year.

Missing out on competing in the 2025 Club World Cup will be a letdown to Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal supporters, but it is an indication of just how much these words mean to them. They will need to go back to the drawing board and make it a core business in case they become the winner of the next one.

The “secret room” of this tale is concealed, however, not in Fortnite but in the FIFA qualification system. Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal were denied entry into next year's 2025 Club World Cup on recent performances and not on merit. Rebuild now begins for the three clubs.

Two all-European clashes, Brazilian flair and a Saudi surprise form the last-eight clashes of the Club World Cup.

Eight teams from across three continents have their sights set on the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 trophy as the tournament enters the second stage of knockout phase.

After an extra-time thriller, two major upsets, three close encounters and two thumping wins, the quarterfinal lineup has been completed as Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund became the last two teams to seal their spots.

The last-eight stage pits four European giants against each other, provides a Middle Eastern club the chance to build on their deserved success and two Brazilian teams the opportunity to take the continent further.

Here's how the Club World Cup quarterfinals line up:

When: Friday, July 4 at 3pm (19:00 GMT)
Where: Camping World Stadium, Orlando, Florida

Emotions will run high and the stands will be replete with colour and noise when one of Brazil's oldest football clubs, Fluminense, take on Saudi Arabia's football giants Al Hilal at the 65,000-capacity venue in Florida.

Al Hilal will ride on the high of beating the tournament's defending champions Manchester City 4-3 in an extra-time thriller in one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history on Tuesday.

Their Brazilian opponents, too, achieved similar success as they ousted Italian giants and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter Milan in a 2-0 win.

When: Friday, July 4 at 9pm (01:00 GMT, July 5)
Where: Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Palmeiras, the second Brazilian club to make the quarterfinals, will face the former English champions Chelsea in Friday's second knockout to be held in Philadelphia.

Runners-up in the Brazilian top-flight last season, Palmeiras beat compatriots Botafogo in a heated clash in the round of 16 and have been one of the strongest defensive lineups in the tournament.

Their opponents, who won the Club World Cup in 2021, will look to move past a disappointing English Premier League season and enter the business end of the competition for a chance to finish the season with a trophy.

The last-eight clash will be the final match held at the 69,000-capacity Lincoln Field stadium.

The winner will face the team that emerges victorious from the Al Hilal vs Fluminense match in the first semifinal.

When: Saturday, July 5 at 12pm (16:00 GMT)
Where: Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia

Arguably, the biggest clash of the quarterfinals pits two of the three title favourites remaining in the competition.

A win over German giants Bayern will consolidate European champions PSG‘s pedigree as one of the biggest clubs in the world and offer the Paris-based side a chance to complete a sensational season quadruple.

Bayern are the joint top goal-scoring team in the competition, with 16 goals in their four games so far, but their attack will be tested against the French champions at the 75,000-capacity stadium in Georgia.

When: Saturday, July 5 at 4pm (20:00 GMT)
Where: MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey

The undisputed kings of the Club World Cup will come face-to-face with the German team that consistently finds itself amongst the best European clubs.

Real have welcomed back their star forward Kylian Mbappe and will hope he returns to his goalscoring form in a tough last-eight clash against a talented Dortmund team.

The blockbuster fixture – a rematch of the 2024 UEFA Champions League final – will be staged at the tournament's biggest stadium, which is doubling up as the the venue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup final.

A full house at MetLife Stadium's 88,000 seat arena on Saturday would go a long way to quelling doubts about American fan interest in the Club World Cup ahead of the semifinals and finals.

The winner of this clash will meet the winner of the PSG-Bayern match in the second semifinal.

The U.S. men's national team is one step away from returning to the Gold Cup final. 

After NYCFC goalie Matt Freese stepped up by saving three penalties in a shootout win vs. Costa Rica in the quarterfinals Sunday, the U.S. will meet Guatemala in the semifinals.

The U.S. has not lost or tied in this Gold Cup run, but it needed to come from behind and stay sharp mentally in the shootout vs. Costa Rica with essentially a brand-new squad under Mauricio Pochettino.

But Guatemala, the 106th-ranked nation by FIFA, is the biggest underdog alive after eliminating Canada via penalties in the quarterfinals.

So, can the U.S. secure a spot in the final, where either Mexico or Honduras will be the opponent? The U.S. lost to underdogs Panama in a penalty shootout in the 2023 semifinals after beating Mexico 1-0 in the 2021 final.

United States goalkeeper Matthew Freese (25) stops a shot during the second half of a CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinals match against Costa Rica on Sunday, June 29, 2025, in Minneapolis.

The two games the U.S. men's national team played leading up to the CONCACAF Gold Cup were ominous, first a 2-1 loss to Turkey and then a 4-0 thumping by Switzerland that did not inspire much confidence. For the national team, it was a seldom-seen four-game losing streak, with all four losses at home.

But the Gold Cup, the regional championship, has gone much better, and even if some of the team's better players aren't on hand, new faces have emerged, new candidates for spots on the team have made their cases.

The next test for the national team comes Wednesday night at sold-out Energizer Park, when the Americans face Guatemala in the semifinals of the Gold Cup, the highest-stakes U.S. game to be played in St. Louis in more than 30 years. The U.S. advanced past Costa Rica in a dramatic penalty-kick shootout on Sunday.

With a win over the decidedly underdog Guatemala team, the Americans would face the winner of another David vs. Goliath match, Mexico vs. Honduras, which will also meet Wednesday in Santa Clara, California.

“It's the togetherness that we've created and fostered,” said Tim Ream, the veteran center back and captain of the U.S. team who played at St. Dominic High and St. Louis University. “I think with the two friendlies that we had, it could have been a not-great situation going into the Gold Cup, and to be honest, I think everybody used it as a learning experience and a moment to understand what it would take to come together and what it would take to play in the tournament, survive and continue to move on. And I sit back and look at these guys and in the game, in the changing room, at meals and just the bonds that are being created in such a short amount of time. I don't think you can speak about it enough, and it's something that maybe not necessarily we've had enough of in the past, and to see guys just getting along and having fun is so good to see.

“And I said it after the game the other day to a few of the guys, watching them work for each other in moments, in heated moments, in moments like Malik (Tillman) having their guy come into his face and watching everybody rush in. It's such a, it may sound weird, but that's an enjoyable thing to see, because I think it shows that OK, finally, we're a group of guys that we're going to push back. You're not going to push us around. And we have the personalities in here, and to see them all jelling together, that's been nice to see.”

Even if the quarterfinal with Costa Rica that got the U.S. to St. Louis goes into the books as a tie, it was a significant performance for the Americans. The U.S. conceded an early penalty kick and trailed 1-0. Tillman missed a PK that would have tied the game, then the U.S. got goals from Diego Luna and Max Arfsten to take the lead, only for Costa Rica to tie the game in 71st minute. The game then went to penalty kicks, where U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese, making a solid push for the top goalkeeper spot that has belonged for some time to Matt Turner, made three saves as the U.S. advanced.

“I think when you look back on our performance, you'll see a really resilient mentality,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “Max Arfsten, to come out and give up a penalty and then come back and have an assist and a goal is a great mentality and shows the team spirit. Malik Tillman, after getting fouled pretty hard, steps and takes the penalty and misses but still makes amazing plays in the game, and obviously Matt Freese, unbelievable in the penalty shootout. So many guys with valuable experience throughout that game and it sets us up for success in the future.”

The United States has reached the final of the tournament in 12 of its 17 editions to date, so this is familiar territory for them but not so much for Guatemala. This is only the second time Guatemala has gotten this far, the other being in 1996. Guatemala has never reached the final. Guatemala finished second in its group to Panama and then tied Canada and advanced on penalty kicks in its quarterfinal. Guatemala, ranked No. 106 in the world by FIFA (the U.S. is 16th), has only one win over the United States in its past 23 meetings, a 2-0 win in a World Cup qualifier in 2016 in Guatemala City.

But this year's Gold Cup has seen some upsets. In addition to Guatemala eliminating Canada, on the other side of the bracket, Honduras beat Panama on PKs. (If the game is tied after regulation Wednesday, it will go straight to penalty kicks with no overtime.) Canada and Panama had both won their groups and were considered to be the teams looking the best in group play.

“It's going to be very difficult,” said U.S. coach Maurico Pochettino. “They're very good, very well-organized, very great coach, very good players. I see this as a big challenge for us.”

There are two interesting names on the Guatemala roster. Rubio Rubin played seven games with the U.S. national team but also was eligible to play for Mexico and Guatemala and, after dropping off the U.S. radar, used a one-time international switch to play for Guatemala. Aaron Herrera played with the U.S. under-20 and under-23 teams and one game with the full national team before switching to Guatemala.

City SC beat writer Tom Timmermann and co-host Beth O'Malley reflect on City SC's steadily climbing goals-allowed totals, which are lessening the benefits of the team's improved offense.

After a quarterfinals scare against Costa Rica, the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) is back in the Concacaf Gold Cup semifinals.

USMNT advanced 4-3 on penalties to avoid falling victim to a massive upset against Costa Rica this past Sunday night at U.S. Bank Stadium.

Up next for USMNT is Guatemala, who's made it to the semifinals later for the first time in 29 years after a stunning upset over Canada 6-5 on penalties.

This marks the first meeting between these two countries in almost a decade, with the last head-to-head matchup coming all the way back in 2016, when USMNT defeated Guatemala 4-0 in FIFA World Cup Qualifying nine years ago.

The winner of this match will advance to the championship game and awaits the winner of Mexico vs. Honduras, which kicks off at 10 p.m. following the conclusion of USMNT-Guatemala.

The United States has owned this matchup in recent history, winning four of five matches and outscored Guatemala 17-3 in the process.

Here's everything you need to know on how to watch the Concacaf Gold Cup semifinals match between USMNT and Guatemala on Wednesday night:

The USMNT vs. Guatemala Concacaf Gold Cup semifinals match begins at 7 p.m. on Wednesday night from Energizer Park in St. Louis, Missouri.

World Cup

These next two weeks at MetLife Stadium, beginning with FIFA Club World Cup's last quarterfinal match on Saturday, will serve as a critical dry run for the New Jersey-based venue as it prepares to host eight matches at the men's World Cup next year – including the final.

As he has been throughout, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy will continue to be there to take it all in. He was there for the stadium's opening clash between Palmeiras and FC Porto two weeks ago, all the way through the fourth match, a chaotic 4-4 draw between Porto and Al Ahly. Like fans, Gov. Murphy withstood scorching temperatures during June's dangerous heat wave and waited through scattered thunderstorms that suspended the fixture between Al Ahly and Palmeiras for 30 minutes.

Concerns over playing through summer weather conditions have become a lightning rod of a topic during the Club World Cup, with start-time discourse and U.S. meteorology now an unavoidable part of the competition. Fans globally are growing familiar with just how catastrophic American summers can be. In New Jersey, specifically, that's come in the form of extreme heat and scattered thunderstorms.

The heat is least bearable during midday and early afternoon hours, which is when several matches for the Club World Cup were scheduled – including the quarterfinal, both semifinals and final at MetLife. Football's global players union FIFPRO has urged FIFA to abandon plans for midday and afternoon kickoffs to avoid the heat in three “extremely high risk” venues at the World Cup next year (Kansas City, Miami and Monterrey in Mexico). The union labeled MetLife as being a “high risk” location.

The union said it made presentations to FIFA about kickoff times, but the union's leadership fears “commercial interests,” driven by a pressure to satisfy a huge global TV audience – particularly in Europe and Asia – will hold sway in some cases, as The Athletic reported.

To that end, Murphy indicated that, as of now, the plan is for a 2026 World Cup final that begins with a 3 p.m. ET kickoff.

“I don't want to speak for FIFA, and obviously they call the shots, but I think they're circling in and around 3 p.m. New Jersey time for the World Cup final on July 19,” Murphy told The Athletic by phone on Tuesday.

The Athletic understands that the time for next year's final is not yet set in stone, and a review of lessons learned from the Club World Cup is still pending. A 3 p.m. start time, however, falls in line with the last four games of the Club World Cup at MetLife. Saturday's quarterfinal between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund features a 4 p.m. kickoff. The semifinals and final are slated for 3 p.m. starts.

To adapt to the extreme heat, FIFA has implemented some rules, including hydration breaks during games. Some teams have directed their bench players to watch games from inside locker rooms. Players have also regularly been seen with cooling or ice towels draped over their heads.

Murphy said he “feels like a meteorologist,” constantly checking the weather over the course of this tournament. As of Tuesday evening, the local forecast for Saturday calls for a high of 85 degrees, with temperatures peaking between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.

“Heat has been a concern across the tournament, no question about it,” Murphy said. “I think we've managed it very well in New Jersey. … It goes with the territory if you're in North America in early to mid-summer, playing a lot of late afternoon (and) early evening matches. It's a factor, but I'm highly confident we'll find our way through this.”

These final games, as Murphy told The Athletic, will likely mirror what's in store for next year. Larger crowds are expected, compared to the relatively sparse turnout for the first four games there, another crucial test for the city's infrastructure as organizers finalize their transportation plan with FIFA for 2026.

Crowds at MetLife for the first half of this tournament have floated around half-capacity. It's expected that these final games in New Jersey will draw more fans, so long as fans are not deterred by ticket pricing. As of Tuesday evening, tickets for Saturday's quarterfinal – before Real Madrid's opponent was known – were starting at $128.25, before taxes and fees. (Once Dortmund punched its ticket to the next round, that price point dipped slightly to $107.05.)

While weather discourse remains ongoing, for the “final four” matches at MetLife, as Murphy calls them, he will be focusing on transportation, safety and security and the fan experience. The latter, he says, has been better than he's ever witnessed at the venue – which is saying a lot, even if an exaggeration. It speaks to the fans that have been fueling this tournament, and why FIFA has been such a staunch advocate of the expanded club competition.

“I go to games of one sort or another at MetLife year-round practically,” Murphy said. “And I've never heard such noise. The spirit has been extraordinary.”

“We always wanted to play a major role in this Club World Cup,” he added. “We let that be known to (FIFA) president (Gianni) Infantino and all the FIFA folks, right from the get-go.”

Summertime, and the living is easy; players are jumpin' and the goal count is high. The top-ranked women's soccer team in the world continues its round of exhibitions with a Canadian friendly in the U.S. capital. The U.S. women's national team has not allowed a goal across its last four outings.

The Americans have won by a 4-0 final score in three straight friendlies. Last week, they put a combined 8-0 hurting on the Republic of Ireland. Dynamic forward Alyssa Thompson found the back of the net in both matches, while Rose Lavelle took a bow in her first USWNT showing since ankle surgery:

Head coach Emma Hayes said that she'd use the summer to test new call-ups and grant breathers to her players in European leagues. Hayes completely scrambled the starting lineup between the Ireland friendlies, and will all but certainly try more configurations in D.C.

The former Chelsea manager has prioritized the U.S. youth pipeline in her nascent tenure — after Sunday's action in Cincinnati, her first 24 matches at the helm have yielded 24 debut caps. Izzy Rodriguez, a fullback for the NWSL's Kansas City Current, scored in her very first USWNT look on Sunday.

In 66 total matches, the Americans have an absurd plus-147 goal differential versus Canada. This year's Canadian crew is led by goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan, a standout stopper with the San Diego Wave. Her domestic teammate Adriana Leon plays forward and leads the active roster with 44 international goals. Jessie Fleming is Canada's captain; she was forever enshrined in the country's sports history after her gold medal goal in 2020. Fleming also played under Hayes with Chelsea from 2020-24.

2002: “Mia Hamm chipped a shot over goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc 3 minutes 34 seconds into overtime to lift the United States to a 2-1 victory over Canada in the Concacaf Women's Gold Cup championship game last night in Pasadena, Calif. Hamm, who has 136 national team goals and ranks as the top scorer in women's international soccer, leaped in joy when her kick floated over the charging LeBlanc and into the net. A beaming Hamm then sprinted to the right corner and slid into the flag, with her teammates rushing over to pile on.”

2008: “Angela Hucles scored the game's only goal in second-half injury time as the United States women's national team defeated Canada, 1-0, to win the Peace Queen Cup on Saturday in Suwon, South Korea. Hucles, a midfielder, won the golden ball as the tournament's most valuable player.”

2012: “The game was more than two hours old. Over the first 122 minutes of the United States women's soccer team's Olympic semifinal with Canada, the Americans had been shocked by three goals from their opponent's best player, boosted by three separate rallies to tie the score, and helped by a referee's call so unusual even their own players admitted they had never seen it before. But now it was the 123rd minute — and most likely the last minute of extra time in overtime — and one final hopeful cross was floating into the area in front of the Canadian goal. Suddenly, a pink headband rose high in the air and Alex Morgan, the speedy American star forward, used her head to send the ball on a perfect arc, just over the goalkeeper's hand and just under the crossbar, for a 4-3 victory. Old Trafford, the venerable stadium here, exploded for one final time on a chilly English night as the United States prevailed.”

FIFA have been offering more free tickets to Club World Cup matches, Mail Sport understands.

Earlier this week, we revealed that the governing body had told those who paid to see Chelsea's weather-delayed victory over Benfica in Charlotte that they could have four complimentary seats for the fixture between Inter Milan and Fluminense at the same stadium.

At the time, FIFA seemed to suggest that the offer was a form of compensation after the Chelsea game had been hit by a two-hour pause thanks to the threat of thunderstorms in the area.

In an email to those involved, they said the move was ‘a token of our appreciation' for the 25,929 who attended the fixture at what was an empty-looking 74,867-capacity venue.

However, Mail Sport has since learned that FIFA has delivered a similar offer elsewhere. Those who bought tickets for Paris Saint-Germain's match with Inter Miami on Sunday – at the indoor Mercedes Benz Arena in Atlanta – were subsequently offered two free tickets for Borussia Dortmund's last-16 victory over Mexicans Monterrey on Tuesday.

Despite the offer, the cavernous venue with a 71,000-capacity was less than half full, with a reported 31,442 present and the upper deck not needed.

Earlier in the tournament, Mail Sport revealed that FIFA had been moving those who had bought tickets for matches to seats facing television cameras, in an apparent attempt to make stadia appear more populated and improve optics.

Despite some healthy attendances, many of the games in the revamped, expanded tournament have failed to capture the imagination of the US public.

FIFA will be hoping that it is a different story for the quarter-finals, which feature the likes of PSG, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. 

They may well, however, be nervous over Brazilians Fluminense's clash with the Saudi Arabian conquerors of Manchester City, Al-Hilal. That match will take place on Friday afternoon, local time, at Orlando's 65,000-capacity Camping World Stadium.

German side dispatch Monterrey 2-1 with Guirassy goals

Bellingham booking rules him out of Real Madrid tie

Serhou Guirassy scored two early goals as Borussia Dortmund held on to defeat Monterrey 2-1 on Tuesday night in Atlanta to reach the Fifa Club World Cup quarter-finals. Karim Adeyemi assisted both goals to bring Guirassy's tournament total to three.

Germán Berterame scored his third of the competition early in a much-improved second half for Monterrey that gave their German opponents some nervy moments, including Sergio Ramos's header early in stoppage time that went narrowly wide of the top corner.

Dortmund become the fifth and final European side to reach the last eight, and the second from Germany along with Bayern Munich. They will face Real Madrid on Saturday in East Rutherford.

But there will be no meeting of the Bellingham brothers there after Jobe was booked for a foul on Nelson Deossa, the midfielder's second of the tournament. The 19-year-old's first yellow card came in Dortmund's 1-0 group win over Ulsan HD.

“I think we all saw that he was very disappointed,” Dortmund's manager, Niko Kovac, said. “I think he did not exactly know that the second yellow card is a suspension at half-time. He was a little bit surprised.”

Kovac said there would be more opportunities for the siblings to face each other. “He's young. His brother is also young, so I'm convinced they will face each other, maybe next season in the Champions League, and then the future. The future is for them.”

Jobe, who sealed a €33m (£28m) move to Dortmund from Sunderland last month, was substituted in the 55th minute to avoid any chance of a red card, Kovac said.

Monterrey were the last of five Concacaf entrants eliminated after Inter Miami's 4-0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain.

Berterame cut Monterrey's deficit to 2-1 with a powerful downward header after an initial cross from the left took a fortunate deflection off teammate Erick Aguirre.

Eleven minutes later, Monterrey's Jesus Corona was played in for a one-on-one with the keeper, but he fired what would have been a leveller straight at Gregor Kobel.

Guirassy and Adeyemi combined twice in the opening 24 minutes. In the 14th, Guirassy received a pass on the edge of the 18-yard box with his back to goal and found Adeyemi next to him. Adeyemi's instant return pass played Guirassy into a position for a low finish beyond the outstretched leg of goalkeeper Esteban Andrada.

Ten minutes later, Adeyemi chased a long ball down the right-hand side, held up play and delivered a square pass into the run of Guirassy, who drove home, giving Andrada little chance.

Guirassy could have had a hat-trick before half-time when he fired narrowly wide of the right post after Bellingham's feed. Three minutes later, Andrada's remarkable recovery and save denied him after a cross from Pascal Gross.

The late game drew a crowd of 31,442 at the cavernous Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where the upper deck wasn't needed. But the sweltering US heat wasn't an issue with the roof closed in Atlanta.

Tennessee soccer forward Reese Mattern was called up to the U.S. U-19 Women's National Team domestic training camp, U.S. Soccer communications announced Tuesday.

In March, the U.S. Under-19 Women's National Team announced the call-up of Tennessee's star forward for a training camp. Mattern will join 20 other collegiate standouts and three professionals from across the country in Fayetteville, Georgia, at the future home of the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center for a domestic training camp slated to begin June 24 and run through July 1.

U-19 WNT head coach Carrie Kveton and U-16 GNT head coach Ciara Crinion will be co-head coaches for the camp.

As a freshman the Charlottesville, Virginia native, started all 20 games, finishing second on the team with 32 shots and tying for the team lead with 16 shots on goal.

Mattern's impressive rookie season was rewarded with a 2024 SEC All-Freshman Team selection and a Freshman of the Week honor during the second week of the 2024 season.

COCO Gauff was left emotional after an early Wimbledon exit on Tuesday.

Gauff entered Wimbledon coming off a Grand Slam win at Roland Garros, but ended up losing in the first round.

Gauff was the No. 2 seed at Wimbledon, but was taken out in a stunning defeat to unranked Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska.

In her presser after the match, Gauff shared that she was feeling mentally "overwhelmed" while wiping away tears.

"I feel like mentally I was little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards, so I didn't feel like I had enough time to do, I guess celebrate and then also get back into it," she said.

"But it's the first time, in this experience, like coming off a win and having to play at Wimbledon, and I definitely learned about what I would and would not do again."

Gauff lost to Yastremska in straight sets, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1.

"I have faith that if I can make these adjustments, I can do well here, I really do want to do well here, I'm not someone who wants to write myself off grass this early in my career, but I definitely need to make some changes if I want to be successful," she said.

Gauff has gone as far as the fourth round at Wimbledon, including last year's tournament.

With the US Open approaching soon, Gauff is trying to keep her chin up for the home tournament.

"I'm trying to be positive," Gauff said.

"After the match I was definitely struggling in the locker room.

"I don't like losing, and I think for me the main thing I'm sure my team and everyone is going to tell me is 'you did well at Roland Garros don't be so upset' and things like that."

Despite a positive mindset, Gauff was still incredibly upset about the first-round exit and wiped away tears throughout her presser.

"I just feel a little disappointed in how I showed up today," she said.

"I feel like I could have been a little bit better in those tough tiebreaker moments.

"Especially after Roland Garros when I felt like I learned a lot in those tiebreakers.

"So yea obviously I'm not going to dwell on this too long because I want to do well at US Open and maybe losing here in the first round isn't the worst thing because of that.

"But yea, it definitely sucks."

Wimbledon runs through July 13 and the US Open begins on August 24.

 Milestones in tennis are sometimes like London buses. You wait a long time for one, and then two come along at once. 

 That has been the case for August Holmgren at 2025 Wimbledon. Last Thursday, the No. 192 player in the PIF ATP Rankings defeated Yosuke Watanuki in the final round of Wimbledon qualifying to seal his spot in the main draw at a major for the first time. On Tuesday, the Dane backed up that win by racing past Quentin Halys to earn his maiden Grand Slam match win. 

 At 27 years old, Holmgren had to be patient for his first taste of major action. When it arrived, he made winning on one of tennis' biggest stages appear straightforward, defeating Halys 7-6(4), 6-3, 6-4. 

 “I was happily surprised. I'm very happy that I didn't really have a dip in level in all three sets, which is uncommon for a five-set match,” Holmgren told ATPTour.com at Wimbledon. “On the one hand, I'm not surprised, because I have so much faith in my serve and my game. On the other hand, I'm really happy and ecstatic to be like, ‘Hell, yeah, I'm here!'”

 Hailing from Espergaerde in Denmark, Holmgren played college tennis from 2017 to 2022 at the University of San Diego, where he earned a bachelor's degree in theatre arts and performance studies. In California, the Dane's coaches and teammates quickly came to know him as an open-minded student-athlete with multiple interests, and someone who was not afraid to take on new challenges. 

 “[August] did everything,” recalled Ryan Keckley, men's tennis head coach at USD, who has been at Wimbledon this week watching both Holmgren and current USD star Oliver Tarvet. “He just loved USD. This is a guy who on a Tuesday would go like salsa dancing because it was in the room next to his dorm or something like that. 

 “On Saturdays in his junior year, he took a surfing class. He loved everything that was USD, [joined] every club he could. He filled his time from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed.”

 For Holmgren, keeping up pursuits outside of tennis was, and still remains, an essential aspect of what made him a better tennis player. 

“I think the most valuable thing I got from college was understanding that I need to have a balance with tennis and life off the court,” he said. “To make sure I was happy off the court, because I needed that in order to be happy on the court. 

 “Often in my life when I have some disruption, in my personal life, it reflects on my tennis. If I don't do my hobbies and only focus on tennis, it has a negative impact on me. So I need to have those other things in life to balance it out.” 

 Holmgren's desire to try new things should not be mistaken as lack of commitment to his tennis. The Dane, who is now coached by former Wimbledon doubles champion Frederik Nielsen, has competed relentlessly on the ATP Challenger Tour and ITF World Tennis Tour since leaving San Diego. 

 “His work ethic was insatiable,” remembers Keckley. “August is a guy who, any time he steps on a court, he's going to make you a better tennis player just because of his attitude and his work ethic, and just his overall demeanour. He's just a wonderful human being. A wonderful, kind, genuine human being. 

 “It doesn't surprise me that this has unlocked for him this week. He's got an incredible serve. He's worked really hard on his game, and he's got a great supporting cast with Freddie Nielsen, who obviously has experience at the highest level of the Tour, helping him along the way and navigating not only his tennis, but his mind, which is probably one of the most important things for the young men.” 



 Holmgren was willing to throw himself into new experiences and situations at college. While he is not sure that has had a direct impact on his ability to navigate the trials and tribulations of the pro circuit, he does think that his willingness to embrace ‘the moment' is one of his strengths. 

 “I talk a lot with Freddie about who I want to be in big moments,” said Holmgren. “Am I going to be scared and hope my opponent is going to give me the match or am I going to go out and take it? How do I react to uncomfortable moments? 

 “Do I resign and let my ego tell the world that, ‘This is so unfair, I am usually much better. The world is mistreating me'? Or do I take responsibility and say that everything that happens here is something that I just need to deal with?” 

 Already up 39 spots to No. 153 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings after his win against World No. 46 Halys, Holmgren will hope to forge a third milestone moment in the space of a week on Wednesday. If he can upset 21st seed Tomas Machac on the All England Club's No. 12 Court, it will be the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking.

American tennis pros were bounced early from Wimbledon this year, with several top-ranked players dropping in the first and second rounds of the tournament at the historic All England Club this week.

Frances Tiafoe, the 12th-seeded men's player, exited the Grand Slam after losing a tough battle to Cam Norrie in the second round on Wednesday. The British tennis player, who entered the tournament unseeded, advanced to the third round after a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 victory.

But Tiafoe wasn't the only American to suffer a stunning defeat.

Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula — the top-seeded American women's players — were both out after suffering upsets in the first round on Tuesday. 

"I definitely was struggling in the locker room. I don't like losing," Gauff, the reigning French Open champion, said after losing her match in straight sets to an unseeded Dayana Yastremska on Tuesday. "The main thing I'm sure my team and everyone is going to tell me (is): 'You did well at Roland-Garros. Don't be so upset.' Things like that."

AMERICAN TENNIS PRO JESSICA PEGULA SUFFERS STUNNING EARLY WIMBLEDON EXIT

Earlier in the day, Pegula also lost in straight sets to 116th-ranked Italian tennis player Elisabetta Cocciaretto. It followed just days after victory over five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek on grass courts at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany.

But the Americans weren't the only ones to have their Wimbledon dreams abruptly end.

Coco Gauff has suffered a shock first round defeat at Wimbledon this year.

Gauff was beaten by Dayana Yastremska in her first Grand Slam match since winning Roland Garros last month.

The world number two is the highest seeded casualty from Wimbledon so far, with Gauff's defeat receiving a huge reaction.

While this is an unusual position for Gauff to be in, it is not the first time that she has suffered an opening round loss at Wimbledon.

The only other time that Gauff has lost in the first round of Wimbledon is in 2023, when she was beaten by compatriot Sofia Kenin.

Gauff had reached the latter stages of Roland Garros again that year, but was unable to transition to the grass courts of Wimbledon.

However, what Gauff was able to do after that was truly remarkable, as she went on to win 18 of her next 19 matches.

Gauff would hire coach Brad Gilbert after her disappointment, and he would help her win titles in Washington D.C and Cincinnati ahead of her home Grand Slam at the US Open.

Despite not always playing her best tennis in New York, Gauff would win the Grand Slam at the US Open.

This would make her first round defeat at Wimbledon in 2023 worth it, as she became the first American to win the women's singles title at her home major in six years.

Although it was unclear as to what would be next for Gauff when she lost in the first round of the US Open in 2023, she had already hinted that better things were coming.

When speaking in her post-match press conference at Wimbledon that year, Gauff revealed that her defeat had only motivated her to get better.

“I mean, it really wants me to work harder,” said Gauff. “Right now I'm very frustrated and disappointed. So, yeah, I think it makes me want to work even harder. I feel like I have been working hard, but clearly it's not enough.

“I have to go back to the drawing board and see where I need to improve and how to do the right drills to do that.”

This should reassure Gauff after her most recent loss to Yastremska, as she looks to bounce back ahead of the North American hard court swing.

Gauff has struggled on grass compared to the other surfaces, and should be much more comfortable on the hard courts closer to home.

Follow live updates and scores from day three of the Wimbledon Championships at the All England Club

It's day three at Wimbledon 2025 and a packed day is almost done, with a raft of British players in action including Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter, as well as Carlos Alcaraz, Naomi Osaka and a host of other big names.

The first Brit on court today was Sonay Kartal, sweeping aside Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova in straight sets, though Billy Harris was beaten by Portuguese No 1 Nuno Borges. British qualifier Oliver Tarvet also exited, showing heart in a loss to defending champion Alcaraz in the match of his life, but Cameron Norrie advanced with an epic win over Frances Tiafoe on Court One. Raducanu, meanwhile, passed a huge test against former champion Marketa Vondrousova, downing the Czech in straight sets.

Yesterday Jack Draper cruised through to the second round, but Heather Watson and Jodie Burrage were early casualties among the home prospects. There were more dramatic exits in the women's draw, however, when third seed Jessica Pegula and fifth seed Zheng Qinwen were eliminated, before French Open champion Coco Gauff lost to Dayana Yastremska in the final match on Court One.

The men's No 3 seed Alexander Zverev suffered a shock defeat to France's Arthur Rinderknech but top seed Jannik Sinner swept past Italian Luca Nardi. Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic saw off the stout challenge of Alexandre Muller to make his way into the next round, crediting “miracle pills” for his turnaround.

Follow all of the latest from Wimbledon with The Independent's live blog below:

The last four years have been strange for Emma Raducanu. On one hand, she has long been trying to recapture the form of her breakthrough season, when she reached the fourth round at Wimbledon before sealing a stunning victory at the US Open. On the other hand, she has been trying to distance herself from that 2021 campaign, and the consensus among many in the tennis world is that the 22-year-old should not be held to those standards.

Yet it was difficult to put that captivating first appearance in SW19 out of the mind when, on Wednesday, the Briton stood across from Marketa Vondrousova in the second round – the same player she beat at the same stage, four years ago.

It was even harder to cast aside memories of that dizzying summer when Raducanu achieved the same result.

Alex Pattle reports from Wimbledon:

Cameron Norrie is enjoying tennis more than ever after reaching the third round of Wimbledon with a tenacious victory against 12th seed Frances Tiafoe.

In doing so he booked a likely clash with Queen's finalist Jiri Lehecka in the third round, and looks set to enter that tie full of confidence.

"I played an unreal match," he said. "I think it was a very good performance from me.

"Mentally, as well - I was very stable throughout the whole match. I think if you spoke to Frances he would probably say the same.

"It was a very high-level match. He was playing so well but I never really flinched. I just kept doing what I was doing and made the match on my terms. I can take a lot of confidence from that."

Ollie Tarvet insists he will not be quitting university in San Diego to go professional before he's finished his course.

“Nothing's changed based on the last 10 days. I still want to go back to University of San Diego, it's been incredible. I think I have a few things, a few creases in my game I need to iron out. I think if you give me a year, especially with the coaches that we have at USD, I think I'll be in a much better spot.”

Report from Centre Court:

Another women's top seed bites the dust!

We've had the likes of Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Zheng Qinwen all crash out in the early stages of Wimbledon this year.

And now, World No 4 and last year's Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini has herself suffered an early exit, losing to Kamilla Rakhimova 6-4 4-6 4-6 to leave things wide open in the women's singles.

Three days and we've already had bucket-loads of drama. Long may it continue!

“I've played against really good players before but not quite the level of Alcaraz,” Tarvet said. “As soon as I dropped to 95% focus, I lost the game. When I missed the first serve, the guy's on the baseline and it's intimidating, he's ready to make you run.”

Emma Raducanu jokes that there will be “no pressure” now that she's playing the World No 1 in Aryna Sabalenka in her next match.

She said: “When you play an opponent like her you know you have to play well so I guess there is no pressure on me at all in the next round!"

Underdog she may be, but the likes of Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Zheng Qinwen - and just now, Jasmine Paolini - are among the top seeds to have already crashed out of Wimbledon. Who says Sabalenka can't be next?

"I think today I played really, really well,” she said. “There were some points that I have no idea how I turned around. 

“I knew playing Marketa was going to be an incredibly difficult match. She has won this tournament which is a huge achievement. I'm really pleased with how I played my game the whole way through.

“I knew today I had to be aggressive because if I pushed the ball around Vondrousova would beat me. Mark [Petchey] has helped me a lot, everyone in that box. The support was incredible and I felt it today. The atmosphere was electric.”

Follow live updates and scores from day three of the Wimbledon Championships at the All England Club

It's day three at Wimbledon 2025 and a packed day is almost done, with a raft of British players in action including Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter, as well as Carlos Alcaraz, Naomi Osaka and a host of other big names.

The first Brit on court today was Sonay Kartal, sweeping aside Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova in straight sets, though Billy Harris was beaten by Portuguese No 1 Nuno Borges. British qualifier Oliver Tarvet also exited, showing heart in a loss to defending champion Alcaraz in the match of his life, but Cameron Norrie advanced with an epic win over Frances Tiafoe on Court One. Raducanu, meanwhile, faces a huge test against former champion Marketa Vondrousova. 

Yesterday Jack Draper cruised through to the second round, but Heather Watson and Jodie Burrage were early casualties among the home prospects. There were more dramatic exits in the women's draw, however, when third seed Jessica Pegula and fifth seed Zheng Qinwen were eliminated, before French Open champion Coco Gauff lost to Dayana Yastremska in the final match on Court One.

The men's No 3 seed Alexander Zverev suffered a shock defeat to France's Arthur Rinderknech but top seed Jannik Sinner swept past Italian Luca Nardi. Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic saw off the stout challenge of Alexandre Muller to make his way into the next round, crediting “miracle pills” for his turnaround.

Follow all of the latest from Wimbledon with The Independent's live blog below:

Raducanu 2-1 Vondrousova*

Vondrousova hits the wrong side of the tramline with an ambitious groundstroke, but Raducanu nets shortly after a second serve on the next point. 15-15.

Raducanu can't quite shuffle her feet into position as she tries a forehand now, and she nets again. 15-30.

Better from the Brit! She rips a backhand and rushes the net, where she slices a winner past Vondrousova – with help from the net cord, though the Czech looked beaten anyway. 30-30.

More fine net play from Raducanu, to the delight of the Centre Court crowd. She puts away a smash after chipping a forehand approach shot into the corner. 40-30.

But she propels a forehand long to find herself at deuce.

Really good baseline hitting from both players, who push the ball close to the baseline and tramline again and again. Eventually, Raducanu finds the chalk on a cross-court backhand, and Vondrousova can't get it back.

Vondrousova then aims to move in on a forehand, but she whips it wide! Raducanu holds.

*Raducanu 1-1 Vondrousova

Vondrousova can't beat the net on her first service point, misfiring with a groundstroke, before she falls to 0-30 thanks to a crouching backhand winner by Raducanu.

The Briton misses on her next effort, however. 15-30.

And a couple more misses by Raducanu from the baseline see her fail to convert from a promising position in this game.

Raducanu 1-0 Vondrousova*

*denotes next to serve

Raducanu flies into a 40-0 lead, forcing two errors out of Vondrousova either side of a spitfire, inside-out forehand winner.

She punctuates that winner with a “come on!”, but two points later, Vondrousova scores with a forehand winner of her own – a well-placed one down the line. 40-15.

Now a longer rally ends with Raducanu, on the stretch, slapping a backhand low and wide. 40-30.

Fine serving from Raducanu, though, as she holds!

Noami Oasaka is a set up against Katerina Siniakova, but another seed has fallen on the women's side! Beatriz Haddad Maia loses to Dalma Galfi in straight sets!

Alongside that debut effort in 2021, last year was a joint-best run for Raducanu at Wimbledon.

She reached the fourth round in both cases.

Here, she aims for round three.

Both players are on court and warming up.

Okay, the final Centre Court match today pits Emma Raducanu against 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova in round two.

Raducanu actually beat Vondrousova here in 2021, also in the second round, in that stellar debut Wimbledon campaign where the Briton reached round four.

Four years on, Raducanu, 22, looks to repeat that result against the Czech, 26.

Boulter 7-6(7), 2-6, 0-1 Sierra*

It's a fourth consecutive break of the Boulter serve for Sierra and Court 1's enthusiasm has been dampened. 

*Boulter 7-6(7), 2-6 Sierra

A shout of delight from Sierra as she takes the second set with a big serve. The Argentine looks right at home on the grass and the big stage, not having lost any confidence despite losing that first set, and playing much more aggressively than the Brit. 

“I have to give a big credit to Oliver. It's his second match on the tour, I just loved his game to be honest, the level he played in his first match on Centre Court. I knew I had to play my best tennis, I played great tennis, really happy about my performance, and just big credit to him as well. 

“Today I played against someone from here, at home, it was not easy, but the crowd was really respectful.”

On his run of 20 wins in a row: “I found the right way, I'm trying to enjoy every match, it doesn't matter if I'm winning or losing. That's the key in the last two or three months to my consecutive winning streak. I'm just trying to keep it going.”

Boulter 7-6(7), 2-5 Sierra*

A backhand error hands over a very tame break, and Sierra once again leads by two breaks.

Gauff said she felt "a little bit overwhelmed" after winning the French Open last month

Robert Prange/Getty 

 The biggest win of Coco Gauff's year might have led to her biggest loss, the American tennis star surmised after getting knocked out of Wimbledon in the first round on Tuesday.


 The 21-year-old American tennis star was upset in the first round of the English tennis tournament after losing to unseeded Ukrainian tennis player Dayana Yastremska in straight sets. Gauff was the No. 2 seed in the tournament.


 Gauff said after her shocking loss on Tuesday that she was “a little bit overwhelmed” with “everything” that came with winning her second major tournament last month. Gauff defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open, and went on a mini media tour in the weeks following the victory.


 "I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards," Gauff said, according to ESPN. "So, I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it."

 The outlet reported that Gauff made “mistake after mistake” in the match against Yastremska, 25, who won the first set 7-6 before cruising to a 6-1 win in the second set. Gauff made 29 unforced errors in the match, including nine double-faults.


 "Dayana started off playing strong," Gauff said afterwards. "I couldn't find my footing out there today."

 It's the second time in the last three years that Gauff has lost in the first round at Wimbledon after getting upset in 2023 as the No. 7 seed to unseeded Sofia Kenin.


 After the match Tuesday, Yastremska said she felt “really on fire” during the first-round performance and complimented Gauff as a tough opponent.


 "Playing against Coco, it is something special,” the world No. 42 said. 


 Gauff wasn't the only top-seeded player to go down in the first round Tuesday. A record-breaking four women ranked in the top 10, as well as four men, were all upset – the most ever at a major tournament in the Open Era (since 1968), according to ESPN.

Never one to shy away from the spotlight, Nick Kyrgios continues to make headlines with his comments on and off the tour.

Ahead of Wimbledon, Kyrgios reacted as the BBC decided against hiring him as a commentator, as they had done in 2024.

The Aussie claimed it was ‘very strange' they wouldn't want someone of his calibre sharing insight, as he argued he was a better choice than former Wimbledon quarterfinalist Chris Eubanks.

As it turns out, the BBC hadn't hired Eubanks either, as the American explained on social media in reaction to Kyrgios' comments.

Snubbed by the BBC, Kyrgios is working for another British media outlet, TalkSport, at Wimbledon, as he now gives his verdict on his fellow ATP star's controversial comments.

Looking to make his presence felt at Wimbledon, world number eight Holger Rune suffered a shock defeat in his opening match.

Struggling with a knee injury, the Dane lost to Chile's Nicolas Jarry in five sets, 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 4-6.

Causing controversy after the match, Rune claimed he would've beaten Jarry if his knee had been 100%.

“In normal conditions, I'd beat him nine times out of ten, with all due respect to Nicolas Jarry. Obviously, I didn't have it easy today with my knee, but yes, it wasn't a great match,” he said during his press conference.

Sharing his thoughts on Rune's comments, Kyrgios named the 22-year-old as his ‘villain of the week'.

“My villain of the week is Holger [Rune]. I just love that comment, straight away saying that he would beat [Nicolas] Jarry nine times out of ten,” he said.

“That is like the cockiest comment ever but I like it. That is something I would have said in my press conferences.

“That is why I do like Holger. I do like that, and that has stirred up the media a little bit.”

Rune will now set his sights on the US Open in September as he looks to get back on track at the Grand Slams.

In Rune's first eight Grand Slam tournaments, he qualified for three quarterfinals, but has remarkably failed to return to the quarterfinals since.

Since Rune last made the quarterfinals, he's lost his round of 16 match on four occasions, narrowly missing out.

Unfortunately for the Dane, he now faces a trip to New York for the US Open in September, statistically his worst Grand Slam event.

On his previous four visits to Flushing Meadows, Rune won just one match, heading into this year's tournament with a dismal 1-4 (20%) record.

In 2024, Rune was well beaten in straight sets by home-favorite Brandon Nakashima 2-6, 1-6, 4-6, as his US Open woes continued.

He'll be hoping for a better showing this time around, as he looks to improve his record at the year's final major tournament.

To do so, he'll need to be fully fit, as the 22-year-old has struggled with various injuries over the years, which have cost him on the biggest of stages.

Sending a message on social media after his Wimbledon exit, Rune updated fans on his injury status, as he now prepares for the North American hard-court swing.

Not a happy ending for me on the grass this year . Will have my knee checked and keep you updated 😢 good luck Jarry for the rest of Wimbledon 🍀

“Not a happy ending for me on the grass this year. Will have my knee checked and keep you updated,” he said on X.

Rune is currently scheduled to return to action at the Canadian Open, where he lost in the third round 12 months ago.

A trip to Cincinnati will follow, before Rune returns to the US Open, which begins on August 24.

The upsets keep coming at Wimbledon. Following an upset-heavy first round, American Frances Tiafoe added his name to the list of disappointing performers after a loss to Cameron Norrie on Tuesday.

Tiafoe lost the match in four sets, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5.

Tiafoe got off to a decent start, taking the first set 6-4. But he couldn't hold that momentum. Tiafoe dropped the next two sets against Norrie 6-4, 6-3, to fall behind in the match.

With Tiafoe on the ropes, the American decided to take a lengthy bathroom break ahead of the fourth set. His absence lingered longer than expected, causing some to accuse Tiafoe of trying to halt Norrie's momentum. Tiafoe was gone long enough that some sites erroneously listed the match as over after just three sets, leading some to wonder whether Tiafoe retired due to an injury.

That was not the case. Tiafoe returned to the court for the fourth set, and initially seemed reinvigorated as he resumed play. But Norrie once again fought back, taking a 4-3 lead in the set. Tiafoe again showed signs of life, taking the next two games to make it 5-4, but Norrie battled back to win the set.

Norrie didn't miss his opportunity to send Tiafoe packing. The Brit won the next two games, taking the fourth set 7-5 and ending the match.

Tiafoe is far from the biggest name to be eliminated early at Wimbledon this year. The first round of the event saw multiple top seeds fall, including Coco Gauff, Alexander Zverev and Jessica Pegula. Americans, in particular, have struggled in 2025. Following the premature exits of Gauff, Pegula and Tiafoe, sixth-seeded Madison Keys remains the highest-ranked American still standing on the women's side. Fifth-seeded Taylor Fritz represents the highest-ranked American on the men's side.

It's a disappointing loss for Tiafoe, who made it to at least the third round at Wimbledon in each of the past four years. While the loss likely hurts, Norrie is far from a pushover. He was No. 61 coming into Wimbledon, but ranked as high as No. 18 in 2024 before plummeting down the rankings. Norrie battled injuries and illness since then, which could explain his recent struggles.

If Norrie is back to form, he could prove to be a tough opponent the rest of the way. Norrie ranked as high as No. 8 back in 2022, and has shown the ability to play tennis at an elite level in the past. Tuesday's win over Tiafoe offered some hope Norrie can turn things around after his recent struggles.

Legendary tennis coach Darren Cahill has revealed what Jannik Sinner did moments after his French Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz that surprised onlookers.

Sinner lost a five-hour epic 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 6-7, 6-7 to Alcaraz at Roland-Garros last month.

It was his first defeat in four Grand Slam finals, with the Italian dropping just two sets in his previous three finals.

Alcaraz saved three championship points on the way to arguably the greatest victory of his career.

The length of the match appeared to take its toll on Sinner, judging by the light-hearted thing he did minutes later.

According to Cahill, who has coached Sinner to all three of his Grand Slam final victories and previously mentored Simona Halep and Andre Agassi, the Italian walked past a candy jar as he was leaving the arena.

While tradition indicates that each player takes a small number of candies with them, Sinner instead decided to take the whole jar.

Speaking on ESPN, Cahill explained: "About a half an hour afterwards, he went and did the press, he was walking to the transport, we had this big bus where we all sit in.

"And for the players, they have this candy jar, that you can take a couple of candies as you're walking out. He took the whole jar. He grabbed the glass jar, took the candies.

"He'd been on a strict diet for two weeks, and that was it - the diet was out of the window. In the car, he was handing candies out to everyone, he was laughing, he was giggling.



"He moved on pretty quickly [from the defeat]. It'll be interesting to see how he moves on here [at Wimbledon], because this will be the big test."

Advert

Sinner got off to a positive start in SW19 on Tuesday, defeating compatriot Luca Nardi in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-0.

He takes on Aleksandar Vukic of Australia in round two on Thursday evening.

Sinner and Alcaraz are on opposite sides of the draw so, should they face each other at this year's Wimbledon, the pair will have reached yet another Grand Slam final.

BBC co-commentator John Lloyd took aim at Frances Tiafoe's antics during his second round Wimbledon with Cameron Norrie as he labelled the American "absolutely ridiculous".

Tiafoe claimed the opening set on Court 1 on Wednesday afternoon before Norris, who is a former semi-finalist at SW19, fired back to win the next three sets. But it was the American's antics after the third set that caused controversy as he decided to take a moment to compose himself, but took his time in doing so.

Before the fourth set could begin, Tiafoe took a prolonged period of time to collect his belongings from his side of the court before heading for a toilet break. He appeared to grab a towel, t-shirt, shorts and fresh trainers from his bag before requesting a toilet break from the umpire.

It took seven minutes for him to return with Lloyd claiming he was deliberately trying to halt Norrie's momentum. Not that it worked as the Brith would claim the fourth set to progress with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 victory.

He said ahead of the fourth set: "This is ridiculous, I'm sorry but it's absolutely ridiculous. The momentum of the game. And you had the French Open final and they didn't go for one bathroom break in five hours. Not one. If I was Norrie I would go out and hit a couple of serves."

Andrew Castle, who was also on commentary duty, joked about the amount of stuff that Tiafoe was taking as he joked: "It looks like he is moving in."

The French umpire Damian Dumusois allowed Tiafoe to then slowly walk off the court with Castle letting rip as he claimed it was unfair on the home player. He said: "Damian Dumusois in the chair here. I'm not sure what he can do. You've got the court official waiting to lead him off and the loo is just back there. I think this is actually unfair to the person who is in front and is on the charge."

Lloyd then added: "I think if you have to have a bathroom break, you get your stuff immediately. You can't just wait three minutes deciding which shirt and shorts you want to wear. This for me, I don't agree with it at all. I think this is wrong."

Norrie said after his win: "I just stayed calm and played point by point. It was so nice to play Frances at such a big match. I served really well in that last game and you guys we were amazing in that last game so thank you.

"It's so special. You forget so quickly. You just feel goose bumps. It's such a special court and such a special tournament. I just walked out and smiled as much as I could. And then you have to go out to battle. I'm really happy with my level today."

...

LONDON (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka was just two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times on Wednesday before asserting herself for a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory over Marie Bouzkova to avoid the sort of surprise that has sent a group of seeded players home.

Four of the top 10 women's seeds failed to make it out of the first round: No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 5 Zheng Qinwen and No. 9 Paula Badosa. In all, a record-tying 23 seeded players — 10 women, 13 men — were gone by the end of Day 2, equaling the most at any Grand Slam event in the past 25 years.

“Of course you're going to know the overall picture. ... I hope it's no upsets anymore in this tournament,” the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said afterward with a chuckle. "If you know what I mean.”

She is a three-time Grand Slam champion, with all of those titles coming on hard courts at the Australian Open or U.S. Open. She also was the runner-up to Gauff at the clay-court French Open last month — drawing criticism from some over her post-match comments, a flap she and Gauff set aside via social media videos last week — but hasn't been past the semifinals on the grass of the All England Club.

A year ago, Sabalenka was forced to miss Wimbledon because of an injured shoulder.

On Wednesday, the record-breaking heat of the first two days gave way to rain that delayed the start of play on smaller courts for about two hours, along with temperatures that dropped from above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) to below 68 F (20 C).

At Centre Court, the 48th-ranked Bouzkova went ahead 6-5 in the first set with the match's initial service break thanks to a double-fault by Sabalenka. Bouzkova served for that set, and was two points away from it at 30-15 in that game, again at 30-all, then once more at deuce.

But on the last such occasion, Sabalenka came through with a forehand volley winner she punctuated with a yell, followed by a down-the-line backhand winner that was accompanied by another shout.

“That was a tough moment," said Sabalenka, who will face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova next. “Until that point, (my) return wasn't great enough to break her serve. I'm really glad ... everything clicked together and I was able to break her back. I kind of like felt a little bit better.”

That sent them to a tiebreaker, and from 4-all there, Sabalenka took the next three points, ending the set with a powerful forehand return winner off a 67 mph second serve. In the second set, the only break arrived for a 3-2 lead for Sabalenka, and that was basically that.

Sabalenka compiled a 41-17 edge in winners while making only 18 unforced errors in a match that lasted a little more than 1 1/2 hours.

What else happened Wednesday at Wimbledon?

Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who is seeded sixth, joined Sabalenka in the third round, beating Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Other players in action later included 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini among the women and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe among the men.

Who plays Thursday at the All England Club?


          Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 major championships at Wimbledon will lead off the Centre Court schedule on Day 4 against Britain's Dan Evans at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET), followed by Iga Swiatek vs. Caty McNally, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. Aleksandar Vukic.

Aryna Sabalenka is trying to fight her way to her first Wimbledon title. She has mastered the courts at the Australian Open, but grass has never been her best surface. She has the game for success at Wimbledon, but the history of it.

In the second round of Wimbledon 2025, Sabalenka faced Marie Bouzkova, a player who can hit with power that almost matches Sabalenka. To make matters tougher for the WTA No. 1, Bouzkova is Czech, and any and all women's players from that nation should have confidence in London.

Sabalenka wasn't trying to defeat Bouzkova, but the entire culture of Czech women's tennis, which appears to be set on dominating at Wimbledon. The last two champions have come from the country, and in the first round, five Czech women pushed through into the second round.

Several have real chances to make a run at the title, including 2023 Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova and rising player Linda Noskova. But Sabalenka isn't going to be afraid of any player. She has earned that right. 

The Belarusian was tested by good shot-making from Bouzkova, but the Czech could not match Sabalenka's immense power. Few players can, and if Sabalenka learns to volley a bit more, she could be unbeatable in London as long as her serve holds up.

The Belarusian also did what all great players do. In a tight first set, she took control in the tie-break and moved to the lead by winning it 7-4. This happened after Sabalenka was broken late in the set, but she came back to break Bouzkova in the next game.

In the second set, Sabalenka got an early break and simply needed to hold serve the rest of the way, which she did, mostly with ease.

The WTA No. 1 showed no nerves in her final service game, winning at love with smart shots deep in the corners that Bouzkova had no answer for. The Belarusian took the final set 6-4. 

Overall, Sabalenka played an exceedingly efficient match. She finished with 41 winners against just 18 unforced errors, and 28 of her 35 net chances. She faced only one break point. She feels like more of a threat to win Wimbledon in 2025 than in any previous year.

Emma Navarro has joked that Jannik Sinner had been desperate to play alongside her at the US Open, quipping that the world No.1 'begged her' to play as his partner.

The two have agreed to team up in the new format of the mixed doubles later this summer, with the matches to be held over two days prior to the two-week period of the major championship, which get underway on Sunday, August 24. A number of big names have already agreed to play in the mixed doubles, with Carlos Alcaraz set to team up with British star Emma Raducanu, as well as Novak Djokovic playing with fellow Serbian Olga Danilovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas pairing with his girlfriend Paula Badosa.

Sinner and Navarro are the latest mixed doubles to enter the talent-stacked tournament, with Navarro explaining how the world number one approached her to be his partner for the matchups.

Navarro said: "He was begging me to play. I said 'yeah sure. I guess I'll play with you. You're not the best player but I'll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year!'"

After the news broke that the two would be entering as partners, Sinner was asked about how this came about prior to his first round matchup at Wimbledon.

He told reporters: "It was very unexpected, to be honest. Look, I just met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked. We never texted to each other. It's actually a funny story.

"The tournament, they wanted us to kind of play together because certain teams were already set up. The choice was not big, but I'm very happy to play with Emma."

The new-look competition will see games be played in a different format, being much quicker and less strenuous in order for more than one game to be played per day.

The format up to the final will be best-of-three-set matches with sets played to four games and a sudden-death deciding point at deuce.

Sinner explained why he was "very excited" to be apart of the new look competition in Queens, New York City. He said: "It's something new. I think it's very exciting for the fans to see something different.

"The best singles player playing doubles is always something fun to watch. We have something similar - obviously not mixed - in Indian Wells and Miami.

"This time, I think the teams are very, very high level, the best players to play. It's going to be exciting to see. I'm looking forward to it."

Taylor Fritz claimed there would be "no point" in breaking the Wimbledon serve speed record after Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard claimed he could throw one down at over 160pm.

It is the Frenchman who holds the record after a 153mph first serve against the American on Monday night. Mpetshi Perricard twice broke the record at the start of the week in the same match.

He laid down the gauntlet in the first round clash and sent his first serve down at 149mph - which eclipsed the mark set at SW19 in 2010 by American ace Taylor Dent of 148mph.

Shortly later he was at it again to hammer down a serve at 153mph - which incredibly was returned by Fritz who would go on to win that point.

The American would eventually win a five-set thriller on Tuesday afternoon after their Monday night clash had carried over. It was then put to him that Mpetshi Perricard could further break his record, but Fritz explained why that would be a pointless exercise.

He said: "If he did 153, he could potentially do close to 160 in the right conditions. The question I have is: Why? There's no point. It's much better to hit 140 to a spot than just hit the ball, serve as hard as you can."

Firtz, who made his first Grand Slam final less than a year ago when he played at the US Open, confessed that he didn't mind the crazy fast serves as they meant he had to react instantly, rather than have to think too much, which is when he admits errors come.

He said: "I don't really mind it because it actually gives me absolutely zero time to think. Normally when I start thinking, that's when I mess things up (smiling). The fact that it's just all reflexes. I think that's one of the things I do better in my return game, when I like to stand close, chip, holding a backhand grip. It's just handsy and it's reflexes. I'd much rather deal with the speed than the spot."

The 27-year-old reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon last year, which is his best result to date. Fritz hasn't shied away from making a Grand Slam his ultimate goal and said recently: "Winning a Grand Slam is the only reason I want to keep playing. It will probably feel like emptiness if I don't achieve it. I'd think about it for the rest of my life if that were the case.

"Wimbledon might be my best opportunity to win a Grand Slam. I don't know if I have a better chance at the US Open, but either way, I never thought I had unlimited time."

Coco Gauff wasn't herself during Tuesday's shocking opening-round loss at Wimbledon to Dayana Yastremska, failing to flex her usual strengths as a defensive player and top-rated American.

Coming off her second Grand Slam with a French Open title over Aryna Sabalenka last month, Gauff admitted her focus wasn't there against the unseeded Ukrainian after her straight sets loss. Gauff managed just six winners in the match, suffered nine double faults and whiffed her way to 29 unforced errors.

Gauff is the third player since the Open era began in 1968 to win the French Open before losing in the first round at Wimbledon.

"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards," Gauff said, "so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it."

Gauff's career-long grass court struggles continued on Court No. 1 after failing to find a rhythm once she lost the tiebreak in the first set.

Gauff lost shortly after World No. 3 and fellow American Jessica Pegula was upset in the first round as well, leaving the women's draw at Wimbledon without America's two top threats early in Week 1.

Gauff's serve was an issue early and lingered throughout the match. Gauff endured a critical double fault in the tiebreaker to end the first set, a major miscue that left Yastremska with a prime opportunity.

Gauff played from behind early in the second set after losing her serve in the first game with Yastremska not being fooled by consistency issues. Whether serves went wide or into the net, it was obvious Gauff was not going to be on the offensive on grass.

"When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat," Gauff said. "I didn't serve that well."

Gauff mentioned Yastremska's strong play after the loss and said she "couldn't find my footing" on a hot day in London. 

"I definitely was struggling in the locker room. I don't like losing," Gauff said. "The main thing I'm sure my team and everyone is going to tell me (is): 'You did well at Roland-Garros. Don't be so upset.' Things like that."

Gauff said she won't dwell on her first-round upset and her focus has already turned to the U.S. Open later this year.

"Maybe losing here (in the) first round isn't the worst thing in the world," Gauff said, "because I have time to reset."

Jim Courier was more decisive, picking Siniakova to pull off another upset at SW19.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 02, 2025 copy_link

Published Jul 02, 2025

Naomi Osaka's 2025 Wimbledon draw ostensibly opened up when No. 5 seed Zheng Qinwen fell in the first round, but is the former world No. 1 in for an even bigger challenge against Zheng's conqueror Katerina Siniakova?“Siniakova is a very good grass-court player,” Lindsay Davenport said of the WTA doubles No. 1, who peaked at No. 27 in singles. “She hits the ball very flat and through the court. But this is a good section of the draw for Osaka if she can make her way through, but I'm split. I'm torn.”Siniakova shocked Zheng for the second time in three years at the All England Club, improving to 3-1 overall against the reigning Olympic champion.

“When we were talking about unseeded players, I was looking at Katerina like, ‘She might actually pull this upset off [vs. Zheng Qinwen],” added Davenport, a former No. 1 and 1999 Wimbledon champion.Osaka eased through her opening round against Australia's Talia Gibson, but the four-time Grand Slam champion has never been past the third round at Wimbledon despite her big game.“I don't like Osaka's chances in this match,” said Jim Courier, a fellow former No. 1. “She's probably the favorite from the oddmaker's standpoint, but boy, Siniakova and her style of play, I would like her in this match.”“She robs you of time, goes hard up the middle quite a bit,” added Prakash Amritraj. “She forced a bunch of errors off that Zheng forehand. I think Osaka likes to dictate and grass sometimes rushes her a little bit too much. It's probably a 50-50, but I might lean towards Siniakova.”

Siniakova and Osaka are 1-1 in their head-to-head, the Czech winning their lone Grand Slam match at 2019 Roland Garros.

Osaka, who returned from maternity leave at the start of the 2024 season, won just one match in the lead-up to Wimbledon, taking out Olga Danilovic in a pair of tiebreakers at the Bad Homburg Open. She was last in the third round of Wimbledon in 2018, falling in the second round to Emma Navarro in 2024, and hasn't been in the second week of a major tournament since winning the 2021 Australian Open.Still Davenport was optimistic that Osaka could top that result—perhaps later this season if not at SW19.“You'd think that something is coming for Osaka with how hard she's been practicing. She looks fitter out there,” she said of Osaka, who has been working with coach Patrick Mouratoglou since last year.Osaka and Siniakova will play on No. 2 Court on Wednesday.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have won the last six Grand Slam titles and in the ongoing Wimbledon too, they are the heavy favorites to win. Last month, they locked horns in the final of the French Open-the first time they faced off in a Grand Slam summit clash and it did not disappoint at all.

It was what perhaps everyone expected it to be: nothing short of a thrilling clash that kept everyone on the edge of their seats for five hours and 29 minutes. Tommy Paul, after his first-round match at Wimbledon against Johannus Monday, was asked in the press conference what went through his mind while watching the final between the two young rivals.

We all know what it was. It was amazing. I love both of those guys. I love watching both.

Paul, who will square off against Sebastian Ofner, is projected to lock horns with Sinner in the fourth round and could only face Alcaraz if he reaches the final. The Spaniard holds a 5-2 head-to-head record over the 28-year-old and had knocked him out in this year's Roland Garros quarterfinal. Against the three-time Grand Slam champion, Paul trails 1-4 in the head-to-head record and had also lost their clash in this year's Rome Open semifinal.

You're not gonna put together two weeks against these guys [to win a Slam]. We've got some catching up to do.

Paul has never played the final of a Grand Slam tournament and at Wimbledon, he produced his best when he reached the quarterfinals last year. Alcaraz had knocked him out of the tournament then.

The five-time Grand Slam champion is playing the tournament as the two-time defending champion. It was 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, whom he defeated in the last two finals. Djokovic is the last player other than Alcaraz and Sinner to win a Major since the 2023 US Open.

The 22-year-old Spaniard survived a scare in the first round as it took him more than four hours to knock out Italy's Fabio Fognini in five sets. He will next face Britain's Oliver Tarvet on July 2. If he wins this year's Wimbledon, he will complete the Channel Slam for two consecutive seasons.

Jannik Sinner secured a spot in the second round of the Championships without breaking any sweat. He was up against Luca Nardi, whom he defeated 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 to schedule his second-round clash with Aleksandar Vukic.

At the press conference later, Sinner was asked whether he was worried about the reception of the public as he is playing his first Wimbledon since the doping scandal. The Italian thinks people have forgotten a bit about the case which is a “good and bad thing about today's society.”

At first, everything was a bit different; people saw me in different ways, but I think everyone has seen that I'm a clean player, that I never intended to do anything wrong. I always try to be my best version and have a good team around me, and that's what I'll try to achieve in the future. The things I can control, I will, both on and off the court. It was an incident, yes.

 Sinner is bidding to win his second title of the season following the Australian Open. At Wimbledon, the 23-year-old has never progressed beyond the semifinals, reaching the stage in 2023 (lost to Novak Djokovic) and last year,  Daniil Medvedev knocked him out in the quarterfinals.

Sinner has faced his second-round opponent Vukic twice, winning both matches. But they will be facing each other for the first time on grass. Before scheduling the clash with Sinner, the Australian knocked out Tsen Chun-hsin in four sets.

Coco Gauff vowed to make changes in a bid to find the formula to Wimbledon success.

The second seed was the latest big name to fall in a dramatic first round at SW19, with fellow American Jessica Pegula and Qinwen Zheng sent packing earlier on Tuesday.

Across the men's and women's singles draws, eight top-ten seeds fell at the first hurdle, the most of any Grand Slam in the Open Era.

Gauff reached the Wimbledon fourth round as a 15-year-old but has not bettered that since and her struggles continued here.

Dayana Yastremska took full advantage to secure a 7-6 6-1 win on No1 Court, with Gauff admitting she had struggled to adapt to the surface.

Gauff won the French Open last month but her grass-court preparations consisted of an opening defeat in Berlin.

“I think it's just changing my playing style a little bit, which is difficult, because for me it's like I approach clay and I play this one way for however long clay season is, six to eight weeks, or I don't know,” she said.

“Then I feel like when I go on hard, I don't have to change as much, but I still have to adjust it a little bit. I know on grass I do. I feel like by the time I find it, it's already time to play. It's difficult, but I don't know.

“I have faith that if I can make these adjustments, I can do well here. I really do want to do well here. I'm not someone who wants to write myself off grass this early in my career, but I definitely need to make changes if I want to be successful here.”

There were cheers on No1 Court following Jack Draper's win, as it was announced that Gauff and Yastremska would be moved from their scheduled slot on Centre Court.

But those same fans could not rally Gauff into a comeback as the second set slipped away in double quick time.

The 21-year-old managed only six winners compared to 29 unforced errors, and struggled with her serve throughout as the double fault tally reached nine.

Gauff will now turn her attention to the hard-court swing on home soil, culminating in a bid for a second US Open title at Flushing Meadows later this summer.

“I don't really like losing,” she said. “I don't know, I just feel a little bit disappointed in how I showed up today. I feel like I could have been a little bit better in those tough tie-breaker moments, especially after Roland Garros, where I felt like I learned a lot in those tie-breakers.

“Yeah, I mean, obviously I'm not going to dwell on this too long because I want to do well at US Open. Maybe losing here first round isn't the worst thing in the world because I have time to reset.”

Gauff began to tear up, as she added: “Yeah, definitely sucks.”

Novak Djokovic has credited a doctor's 'miracle pills' for helping him to battle through an illness during his first round match at Wimbledon on Tuesday night.

The Serbian star asked for a doctor to be called to the court shortly after losing the second set of the match to France's Alexandre Muller.

Djokovic had appeared visibly unwell and after discussions during a medical time out, was given a tablet by the doctor to ease his symptoms.

The seven-time Wimbledon champion was then able to seize control of the match, breaking Muller's impressive resistance.

Djokovic won 10 of the final 12 games following his medical time out, ultimately wrapped up a 6-1, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-2 victory.

When asked in his on court interview about the illness, Djokovic suggested he may have been suffering from a stomach bug.

Djokovic had credited the doctor's 'miracle pills' for helping him to fight through to the second round. 

'I went from feeling my absolutely best for a set and a half to my absolute worst for about 45 minutes,' Djokovic said. 

'Whether it was a stomach bug - I don't know what it is, but just struggled with that. 

'The energy kind of kicked back after some doctor's miracle pills and I managed to finish the match on a good note.'

Despite Djokovic appearing visibly hampered by illness, some fans queried the extent of the issue with the medical time out coming just minutes after losing the second set.

'Textbook Djokovic "I'm not playing great so I'll take a medical timeout even though there's no signs of me being remotely injured" move to make sure he gets the crowd back on side and acting like he's playing on against all the odds,' one fan wrote.

'Every time I watch a Djokovic match that he's losing, or is tight, he calls on the on court doctor,' another added. 'Saw him do it multiple times. Can't have him at all. Medical time outs to halt opponents momentum.'

A third added: 'Djokovic in “shock” loses a set and immediately calls a medical timeout followed by securing a double break. How many times does he do that?' 

Djokovic's use of 'miracle pills' also generated discussion from fans on social media.

'"I think a lot of people would like to know what these doctors miracle pills are" is quite a line to Novak,' one fan wrote, referencing a question by the on court interviewer.

'Djokovic references “miracle pills from the doctor”, which generally happens when things aren't going his way. Everyone laughs. Interviewer jokes about it. Staggering this has been accepted without question for so long,' another fan added.

It is not the first time in his long career Djokovic has created debate, after previously claiming he had been drinking a 'magical potion' when asked by journalists in 2022.

The questioning followed Djokovic appearing to breathe in the contents of a drink during Wimbledon that year.

While some also queried Djokovic's description of 'miracle pills', others defended the Serbian by claiming it was merely a phrase to highlight how it had helped to ease his symptoms.

'He always calls that miracle pills in this case Novak was sick and those pills calmed his stomach pain fast that's why he called it miracle pills,' one fan wrote.

Djokovic had also been seen in discussion with the doctor during the next changeover during the match in the third set.

The discussion took place while Muller had his own medical timeout due to an apparent calf issue.

Djokovic's eventual four set victory saw the 38-year-old, who is targeting a record 25th Grand Slam title, set up a second round encounter with Britain's Dan Evans.

Djokovic admitted post-match that Wimbledon represents his best chance of adding to his haul, with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner having established themselves as the leading duo in recent Grand Slams.

'I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I have a chance. I think I always have a chance,' Djokovic added.

'I think I earned my right to really feel like I can go all the way to the title'

'I always felt like grass, particularly in the second part of my career, was really the surface where I played my best tennis. So why not do it again?'

The world No. 3 says it's been tough to find joy on—and off—the tennis court following his Wimbledon first-round exit.ByTENNIS.comPublished Jul 02, 2025 copy_link

Alexander Zverev will hope to “solve myself” during the North American hard-court swing after suffering his earliest Grand Slam exit in six years on Tuesday.In an upset-filled first round that saw four Top 10 stars in both Wimbledon singles draws tumble out, the world No. 3 dropped a five-setter carried over from Monday to Arthur Rinderknech on Centre Court.Speaking with press following the defeat, Zverev shared a sense of loneliness has proven insurmountable to brush aside since losing January's Australian Open final to Jannik Sinner.“I'm trying to find ways, trying to find ways to kind of get out of this hole. I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way,” he said. “I feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice.”

I've never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do.

Asked in a follow-up if making tweaks to his team was on the table, Zverev responded “possibly.” But at the end of the day, the change that's needed starts within him.“It's not a feeling on a tennis court, it's just a life feeling in general. As I said, I never felt this way before. I don't know. It's difficult to find joy outside the tennis court for me at the moment,” the 28-year-old stated.“It's not an excuse or anything. I think Arthur deserved to win today. It's something I've felt for the past few months. Again, I just feel generally very, very alone and very lonely. I don't know. Just never felt that way before.“I don't have the answers right now.”

Zverev is now 35-14 on the season, with one title to his name in Munich. He came into The Championships at No. 3 in the race to the Nitto ATP Finals, adding a quarterfinal showing at Roland Garros.If Zverev is to rejoin the conversation among the top contenders by the US Open, for him it comes down to waking up with the right mindset again.“I have to solve myself first. I have to solve my issues,” he expressed.“I've been through a lot of difficulties in the media. I've been through a lot of difficulties in life generally. I've never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do. It's not necessarily about tennis. Just lacking joy outside of tennis, as well.”

Coco Gauff became the biggest seed to fall across the opening two days of Wimbledon as the American second seed was beaten in straight sets by Dayana
Yastremska.

Fresh from her second Grand Slam win at the French Open, Gauff looked a shadow of her best self only a month on from that triumph - her serve, in particular, deserting her as she sent down nine double faults while being broken four times in the 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 defeat.

"I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came after [the French Open]," a tearful Gauff said in her post-match press conference. "I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it."

She added: "I definitely was struggling in the locker room. I don't like losing. I just feel a little bit disappointed in how I showed up today."

Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club when, just 15 years old in 2019, she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass court tournament has proven to be her least successful major, the only one where she has failed to reach the semi-finals.

It was admittedly a tough draw for Gauff against the world No 42 from Ukraine, but one she will have still expected to navigate. Instead, the 21-year-old exits a major in the first round for just the third time in her career, and first since 2023, which was also at Wimbledon.

"I think it's just changing my playing style a little bit, which is difficult," she said.

"I have faith that if I can make these adjustments, I can do well here. I really do want to do well here."

In all across the opening two days of Wimbledon, a grand total of 23 seeds - 13 men and 10 women - are already out, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.

Novak Djokovic somewhat limped to a late-evening victory over Alexandre Muller on Centre Court to set up a second-round meeting with Great Britain's Dan Evans on Thursday.

The 38-year-old, searching for a 25th Grand Slam singles title to take him clear of Margaret Court, received a medical timeout after losing a second-set tie-breaker to the 41st-ranked Frenchman but ultimately rallied to a 6-1 6-7 (7-9) 6-2 6-2 win clinched at 10.30pm, shortly before the 11pm curfew.

Monday saw seven British players record victories at the All England Club, the best tally on any day of the Championships in the Open era. And the wait for an eighth home player to reach the second round was ended at 4.48pm when Evans beat fellow Briton Jay Clarke 6-1 7-5 6-2 to set up the meeting with Djokovic. It was the 35-year-old's first Wimbledon win in four years.

"I'd love it to be on Centre, to get a chance to play him [Djokovic]," Evans said after his win. "He's at the latter end of his career and I'd go out there and give it a really good go. It would be special in England to play the greatest of all time."

Elsewhere in the men's draw, world No 1 Jannik Sinner eased into the second round, needing just an hour and 48 minutes to dispose of his Italian compatriot Luca Nardi 6-4 6-3 6-0.

American fifth seed Taylor Fritz defeated France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (8-10) 6-4 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 in a match suspended on Monday evening with the pair level at two sets each.

Along with Gauff, two of the biggest seed casualties on Tuesday at Wimbledon were men's and women's world No 3s, Alexander Zverev and Jessica Pegula.

Zverev and Arthur Rinderknech were locked at one set apiece on Monday when play was stopped but, after resuming on Centre Court the following afternoon, it was the Frenchman who ground out a 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (8-10) 6-3 6-7 (7-5) 6-4 victory.

It was Zverev's first opening-round defeat at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon in 2019 and leaves the 28-year-old still searching for a first major after 38 attempts.

Pegula struggled to explain away her shock Wimbledon exit as she praised the "insane" performance of opponent Elisabetta Cocciaretto. Last year's US Open runner-up crashed out following a 6-2 6-3 defeat to the Italian world No 116 in just 58 minutes.

Asked what went wrong, the 31-year-old American replied: "I don't know. She played absolutely incredible tennis.

"Do I think I played the best match ever? No. But I definitely don't think I was playing bad. It's really a bummer to lose. I haven't lost first round of a Slam in a very long time, so that sucks."

Cocciaretto, who had only once before defeated a top-10 player, spectacularly turned the tables on Pegula, having suffered a 6-4 6-0 round-three loss to her at the All England Club in 2023.

Defending women's singles champion Barbora Krejcikova was tested by promising 20-year-old Alexandra Eala, losing the first set before finding her form late in a 3-6 6-2 6-1 win.

Eala is the first player from the Philippines to appear in the main draw at Wimbledon in the Open era and Krejcikova was full of praise for her afterwards.

"I mean, what the hell [kind of tennis] she played in the first set?," the reigning champion said of her young opponent.

"She was smashing the ball and cleaning the lines, so wow, wow. She's going to be really good in a couple of years."

Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek, seeded eighth, is yet to conquer Wimbledon but showed positive signs as she beat Polina Kudermetova 7-5 6-1, while Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva advanced after a 6-3 6-3 victory over Mayar Sherif.

The women's draw is now without three of its top five seeds after No 5 Qinwen Zheng of China, the Olympic champion, suffered a third successive Wimbledon first-round defeat, beaten 7-5 4-6 6-1 by Czech doubles specialist Katerina Siniakova.

Elsewhere, US 10th seed Emma Navarro knocked out two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova with a 6-3 6-1 victory in a match that lasted exactly an hour. It marked Kvitova's final appearance at Wimbledon before heading into retirement.

Queen's champion Tatjana Maria, who reached the semi-finals in 2022, also made an early exit as she lost in three sets to American Katie Volynets.

Less than three weeks ago, Oliver Tarvet did not have a wild card into Wimbledon qualifying. Now the 21-year-old is preparing to take on two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court in the second round of the main draw.

It is similar to the storybook run of Marcus Willis, who was No. 772 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2016 when he faced Roger Federer in the second round of the Wimbledon main draw after advancing through pre-qualifying. A big difference is that World No. 733 Tarvet flew across the world without knowing he would have a qualifying spot.

The Briton, who plays college tennis for the University of San Diego, competed in back-to-back ITF World Tennis Tour events in San Diego the first two weeks of June. After playing nine singles matches in the California heat — including a title campaign in the first event — Tarvet retired during the semi-finals of the second tournament, totally wiped out physically and mentally from a huge effort.

During the second event Ryan Keckley, the head coach at the University of San Diego, received word from Mark Hilton, a national coach for the Lawn Tennis Association, that Tarvet was under consideration for a qualifying wild card. There was no guarantee, but after the semi-finals, Keckley informed his player that he had a chance to receive a qualifying wild card and that they would need to get plans into motion in the hopes of that possibility becoming a reality.

“We pretty much pulled him into the locker room and said, ‘Hey, you've got an opportunity here. We've got to go try to make the most of it',” Keckley told ATPTour.com. “So he jumped on a plane the next day.”



That gave Tarvet less than a week to travel eight time zones and adjust not only to the big time difference, but from hard court to grass, for one of the most prestigious sporting events on the planet.

“He only really had six days of preparation on the grass before one of the biggest moments of his life,” Keckley said. “And then the next day was the biggest moment, and then the next day was the biggest moment. He's just risen to the occasion every opportunity and chance he's gotten.”

In the 11 sets Tarvet has played since beginning his qualifying run, the home favourite has lost just one. Before last week Tarvet had never faced an opponent ranked higher than World No. 367 in a professional match, and now he has the opportunity to take on a five-time major champion.

“He's done it with a lot of hard work. He's not afraid of work, and he's always prioritised his tennis over any kind of academic priorities that he might have,” Keckley said. “He's not a guy that ever skips a day. So when you put that many consecutive days of healthy practices, thoughtful, mindful practices, and you have some of the skill sets that Ollie does, good things are bound to happen.”








Tarvet, who is entering his senior season at USD, made an immediate impact on his head coach three years ago. The Briton's work ethic has shone through consistently during his time as a Torero.

“[Juniors] go to college tennis and everyone says they want to be a pro and quite frankly, very few are willing to do what it takes to become a pro. And Ollie was different in that regard,” Keckley said. “He texted me at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday and maybe some other college students would be at the library, some would be at the bars or socialising. He was underneath the lights hitting forehands with another player and it wasn't just a one-time thing. It was continuous.”

That dedication has helped Tarvet become a multiple-time qualifier for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, which was created to increase the development pathway for top players in the American collegiate system by providing direct entry into ATP Challenger Tour events. The 21-year-old's plan is to take the fall off from school to make use of those entries before returning to school in the spring.

Tarvet has not lost an official completed singles match in college or the pros since November, a stretch during which he has won 31 consecutive completed matches.

“His confidence is at an all-time high,” Keckley said. “So you're taking a very confident kid who believes in himself, believes in the work that he's put in, has an extremely high tennis IQ and you're putting him in an opportunity to win in an uncomfortable environment… He gets comfortable in the uncomfortable. He buys into the mentality.”

Keckley is not someone who cries, but when Tarvet defeated fellow qualifier Leandro Riedi on Monday in the first round of the main draw, the coach was emotional, full of pride for someone he watched make a dream come true.

“That moment, I'll never forget it because he just comes over and he gives you the biggest, sloppiest, wettest hug possible and you are just embracing every second of it because he's just made a name for himself,” Keckley said. “Not only in the United States, because he had a name for himself in the U.S college system, but in the LTA and worldwide.” 

There is no doubt that there is a huge gap between the experience Alcaraz and Tarvet will walk on Centre Court with Wednesday. But according to Keckley, his charge is someone who “eats and breathes and loves tennis”, and handles big moments “exceptionally”.

“We've got to first focus on our side of the net, focusing on what makes Ollie special, and he's very special. [it is about] getting his mind right and staying within what he is capable of doing, and then the rest is adjustments along the way,” Keckley said. “But he is a very capable tennis player and every challenge that has been put in front of him, he's matched and risen to the occasion. 

“So tomorrow we're going to go out there and the lines are the same, the balls are the same. The surface is a little different from San Diego, but we're going to focus on our side of the net.”

Dayana Yastremska made headlines Tuesday by completing one of the biggest upsets at Wimbledon with her first-round victory in straight sets over No. 2 seed Coco Gauff. 

But the unseeded Ukrainian tennis player isn't a complete unknown. 

The 25-year-old is ranked No. 42 in the world and has three WTA singles titles to her name, while having her best finish in a major at the 2024 Australian Open when she reached the semifinals.

But Tuesday's victory was by far the biggest of her career and is sure to add an extra buzz around Yastremska.

Yastremska already has an interesting backstory due to her apparent allergy to grass — the same surface she's playing on at Wimbledon.

Yastremska, who celebrated her 25th birthday in May, detailed her allergy after she reached the final at the Nottingham Open earlier this month, saying at the time that “I really love playing on grass, even though I think I have a bit of an allergy to grass!” 

She already had quite the following on social media with 217,000 followers on Instagram, where she's posted content around her tennis career and stylish shots from parties and modeling.

“I like modeling, I like fashion, I like philosophy, and I like many things to do,” she's quoted as saying in a 2024 Tennis.com article. “But I don't have much time for it.”

And her talents extend beyond the court as Yastremska showed off her singing chops during the COVID-19 pandemic and released two singles during the summer of 2020 titled “Thousands of Me” and “Favourite Track.”

“I do not strive to become a cool artist,” she wrote in a post on Instagram in 2020. “I just like to sing, I like this whole atmosphere. It's much easier for me on the tennis court, than being in the studio, standing near the microphone, and singing, it's such a stress for me!”

Yastremska paused her musical ambitions in 2021 during a provisional doping ban following a positive test for a prohibited substance, but she was cleared six months later after an independent tribunal ruled that the positive result was due to contamination of the test sample.

She was also forced to flee her home in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine, revealing in a social media post that after two nights in an underground parking garage, her parents decided to send her and her sister out of the country. 

In February 2024, Yastremska released a new single, “Hearts,” which she described as a “song for Ukraine.” 

Yastremska will face Anastasia Zakharova in the second round of Wimbledon.

Ahead of becoming Audi's works team in 2026, Sauber have opened their new Technology Centre at Bicester Motion in the United Kingdom.

Sauber have announced the opening of their new Technology Centre based at Bicester Motion in the United Kingdom, marking the next step in the squad's transition into Audi's Formula 1 works outfit in 2026.

With the 444-acre Bicester Motion located in an area known as Motorsport Valley in the Midlands and South East of the country – due to this being where seven of F1's 10 teams are based – Sauber say that the facility will “provide a base for the team to benefit from the expertise within the region and support the Audi F1 Project's HQ in Hinwil, Switzerland, to create a cohesive and integrated approach to all aspects of the project”.

The primary purpose of the Bicester centre in Building 123 is to “enhance and expand the team's technical capabilities, to ensure the team is well-positioned to attract top engineering talent and foster partnerships with leading industry supply chain specialists”.

Sauber previously announced their intention to open the centre earlier in the year as preparations ramp up for their transformation into becoming the Audi F1 factory team from 2026 onwards.

Mattia Binotto, Head of Audi F1 Project, said: "The opening of the Sauber Motorsport Technology Centre at Bicester Motion is a significant milestone as we prepare for Audi's arrival in Formula 1.

“This facility will allow us to tap into the talent pool in Motorsport Valley and further strengthen our technical capabilities while being part of a thriving cluster at Bicester Motion where you live and breathe motorsport.

“The support it will play to Hinwil will be important to our long-term success.”

Daniel Geoghegan, Chief Executive Officer, Bicester Motion, added: “We warmly welcome Sauber Motorsport in what is an exciting step in its Audi F1 transformation ahead of next year's F1 season.

“It is thrilling that Bicester Motion has been chosen as their UK base connecting into their Swiss and German operations to support their vision to deliver sustainability, innovation, and maximum performance in motorsport.

“They join many other pioneering automotive and aviation companies, along with Motorsport UK, the governing body of this great industry, already based here. We look forward to seeing their team develop and their transformation on and off the track continue.”

Lawrence Barretto explains the state of play after Alpine enquired about the availability of 10-time race winner and current Mercedes reserve Valtteri Bottas.

Alpine have enquired about the availability of 10-time race winner and current Mercedes reserve Valtteri Bottas, should they decide they want to change their line-up this season or beyond. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto explains the state of play...

Well, they're not so much chasing as they are exploring their options.

Alpine are in something of a transitional year – and with the Enstone-based team swapping to Mercedes power next year as part of an overhaul of the squad under the stewardship of Flavio Briatore, they are keen to get their driver line-up right for 2026.

Pierre Gasly is, without question, part of their plans. Their second seat is trickier.

They've already made a change this season, bringing in Franco Colapinto to replace Jack Doohan (with the latter back to reserve and the bench) from Imola onwards.

Colapinto hasn't hit the ground running like he did in his super sub performance for Williams and has yet to score a point in five races with the squad.

However, it must be said that the car has lacked performance relative to its rivals and, since Colapinto joined the team, his team mate Gasly has scored just once with eighth in Spain.

Alpine continue to back Colapinto – and believe he is capable of delivering.

But as 2026 edges ever closer, Briatore is doing what you'd expect him to do – keeping his finger on the pulse and ensuring he knows what his options are going forward, hence why sources say he contacted Mercedes to check on Bottas' availability.

My understanding is that Mercedes will not stand in Bottas' way should he be offered a race seat elsewhere.

I believe Bottas is contracted to the Silver Arrows, where he won all of his 10 races, until the end of the year – and then he is free to make his own decisions with regards trying to find a race seat (or worst-case alternative role) next season.

His boss Toto Wolff is a big supporter of Bottas and believes he is still operating at a high-level and is deserving of a place on the grid. So, it's no surprise they would accommodate a request should one be made for his services, especially as Alpine will be running the Silver Arrows' engines next year.

It's two-fold. Briatore finds the team's currently level of performance concerning. With Alpine locked to the bottom of the Constructors' Championship, he wants short-term progress soon.

Having two strong drivers delivering consistently can have a significant impact – as Williams are seeing with their experienced line-up of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz.

Secondly, he wants the team to take advantage of sweeping changes to the aerodynamic and power unit regulations next season – and the arrival of Mercedes power, which is widely expected to be among the best, if not the best, engines next year.

Bringing on someone with Bottas' experience could help on both counts.

Teams' standings after Austria

The Finn has 247 Grands Prix to his name, has won 10 races, scored 67 podiums and taken 20 pole positions. He excelled during his time at Mercedes, particularly with regards to his one-lap pace, and made a positive impact during his three years at Sauber.

His time at Mercedes has given him recent insight into how a race-winning team is operating while he is believed to have been fully plugged into the development of the 2026 car. He even had some seat time with McLaren earlier this year in a 2023-spec car.

Alpine could benefit from Bottas' presence in the race team – and there will be those internally who are fans of his given he was in contention for a seat there this year before the management changed and opted for Doohan.

One thing is for sure, Bottas is hungry to return to a race seat and more motivated than ever.

He took the Mercedes reserve role (to stay relevant, fit and connected to the sport) and is keen on discussions with newcomers Cadillac about a race seat next year.

The Finn would back himself to deliver if he gets a shot at Alpine – and you'd expect he'd be interested in a deal that allows him to drive next year, too, for security. His experience with Mercedes power could be invaluable.

Such a move would help him get race sharp again so that even if Alpine don't retain him, he would be even more appealing to the likes of Cadillac, as they look to hit the ground running on debut next year.

For now, it's business as usual and Colapinto will be in the car at Silverstone and beyond.

If Alpine decide they want to pursue an alternative, preliminary talks with Mercedes would likely continue, with Bottas and his management also being drafted in if things accelerate.

Absolutely, but every driver is under pressure to perform – and Colapinto is no different.

Briatore's move to explore options will raise that pressure, but it might trigger a step up in performance for the Argentine driver.

Silverstone is a circuit which the 22-year-old has performed well at in junior formulae – and he'll have fond memories of the place having made his Grand Prix weekend debut there last year when driving for Williams.

If Colapinto improves his results, Briatore won't need to change anything for now. And just knowing Bottas is available gives Briatore and Alpine flexibility.

			By Jill Goldsmith, Ted Johnson 


Dr. Phil's Fort Worth-based JV Merit Street Media filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday, simultaneously suing business partner Trinity Broadcasting for breach of contract that it claims destroyed its new television network and pushed it into bankruptcy.


	The TV personality's high-rated daytime Dr. Phil show ended a 21-year run after the 2022-23 season although it lived on in syndication. The suit centers around his latest venture, Merit Street Media, a JV of McGraw's Peteski Productions and Trinity Broadcasting Group. The latter was founded by American televangelist Paul Crouch and his wife Jan in 1973 and is currently overseen by president and CEO Matthew Crouch. The network has had carriage on over the air broadcast television as well as multichannel platforms and streaming.

	A Merit Street spokesperson said, “Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) is being sued by Merit Street Media (MSM) for failing to provide clearly agreed-upon national distribution and other significant foundational commitments critical to the network's continuing success and viability. The suit is part of a restructuring proceeding also initiated by MSM.”

	A spokesperson for TBN did not immediately return a request for comment.


	The JV called for Peteski to provide Merit Street with certain new original episodes of the Dr. Phil show, as well as primetime specials to air on the new TV network. For its part, TBN agreed to provide, at no cost to Merit Street, carriage to distribute Dr. Phil's shows and specials to a nationwide audience … in exchange for which TBN would have a controlling equity interest in the network,” according to the lawsuit. 

	











	TBN also agreed to provide all “first class quality” services necessary to produce Dr. Phil's shows and primetime specials, the suit said.


	“In short, the deal was simple and straightforward” — McGraw/Peteski contributed content, while TBN contributed access to a distribution network to air Dr. Phil's content along with the production services to support the creation of that content,” according to the lawsuit.


	Shortly after Merit Street was formed, however, TBN reneged, Merit claimed. It “began to abuse its power as a controlling shareholder to advance its own interests and those of its CEO Matthew Crouch, while causing Merit Street to assume responsibility of TBN's obligations under the Joint Venture Agreement, and to otherwise enrich itself at Merit Street's expense. The suit accuses TBN of “a conscious, intentional pattern of choices made with full awareness that the consequence of which was to sabotage and seal the fate of a new but already nationally acclaimed network which has, since its launch in April of 2024, delivered its viewers with cutting edge reports, interviews, and in-depth analysis of national importance. This fresh voice on the national stage is inexorably going dark, going off the air because TBN has refused to honor its commitment to transfer its must carry rights and thereby provide national distribution for the network—Merit Street.”


	Simply put, as a result of TBN's conduct, “Merit Street has nowhere to send its broadcast signal and nowhere to air its programming no matter how great it may be.”


	Since its launch last year, Merit Street has featured McGraw's interview with Donald Trump following his conviction on New York state charges, as well as the host's embed with federal immigration agents back in January.


	Merit Street says that it will continue to broadcast shows as long as it can, but it will be library programming.


	The filing in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas estimated Merit Street's assets at $100-$500 million and liabilities in the same range. Creditors, from 200-999, included distributors like DirecTV and Nexstar and rating agency Nielsen.


	Merit Street is seeking damages, recoupment of legal costs, and other remedies.

The Velvet Sundown, an obviously fictional “band” that's gone viral after somehow racking up more than 500,000 monthly listeners on Spotify out of nowhere, used the generative-AI platform Suno in the creation of their songs, and consider themselves an “art hoax,” a band spokesperson reveals to Rolling Stone.  On their X account, the “band” fervently and repeatedly denied any AI usage after multiple media outlets reported on their mysterious popularity — but pseudonymous band spokesperson and “adjunct” member Andrew Frelon now admits, “It's marketing. It's trolling. People before, they didn't care about what we did, and now suddenly, we're talking to Rolling Stone, so it's like, ‘Is that wrong?'”  


	“Personally, I'm interested in art hoaxes,” Frelon continues. “The Leeds 13, a group of art students in the U.K., made, like, fake photos of themselves spending scholarship money at a beach or something like that, and it became a huge scandal. I think that stuff's really interesting.… We live in a world now where things that are fake have sometimes even more impact than things that are real. And that's messed up, but that's the reality that we face now. So it's like, ‘Should we ignore that reality? Should we ignore these things that kind of exist on a continuum of real versus fake or kind of a blend between the two? Or should we dive into it and just let it be the emerging native language of the internet?'”In the phone conversation Tuesday morning, Frelon originally maintained that AI was used only in brainstorming for the music, then admitted to the use of Suno but “not in the final product,” and finally came to acknowledge that at least some songs (“I don't want to say which ones”) are Suno-generated. “I haven't admitted that to anyone else,” Frelon says. He also acknowledged employing Suno's “Persona” feature — the same one Timbaland is using with his controversial AI artist TaTa — to maintain a consistent singer's voice across songs, although he continues to claim that's not the case on every track.

	











	Some observers have wondered whether some kind of playlist manipulation was used to build Velvet Sundown's Spotify listenership, but Frelon dodged that question. “ I'm not running the Spotify backend stuff, so I can't super speak to exactly how that happened,” he says. “I know we got on some playlists that just have like tons of followers, and it seems to have spiraled from there.” Did Frelon and his associates use playlists of their own to boost the process? “I don't have an answer that I can give to you for that because I'm not involved,” he says. “And I don't want to say something that's not true.”

The Velvet Sundown enigma began in June, when two of the band's albums suddenly appeared on Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and other streaming services. A band that no one had ever heard of, and didn't seem to have any sort of digital footprint, suddenly had hundreds of thousands of listeners for music that the band described as “fusing Seventies psychedelic textures with cinematic alt-pop and dreamy analog soul.” 


	But how real was it? The songs, like “Dust on the Wind,” felt like generic reproductions of Seventies rock, and “photographs” of the group obviously had the amber-encased glow of AI-generated content. On Reddit, two posters called out what one poster called “a completely fake band”; musician and writer Chris Dalla Riva questioned their existence on TikTok; and the streaming service Deezer noted that “some tracks on this album may have been created using artificial intelligence.” The site Music Ally determined that most of the Spotify playlists which featured the band came from just four Spotify accounts — and no one could explain how the band's catalog ended up on a playlist of songs evoking the Vietnam War. 


	Early this week, the “band” pushed back on its X account, claiming it was “absolutely crazy that so-called ‘journalists' keep pushing the lazy, baseless theory that the Velvet Sundown is ‘AI-generated' with zero evidence.… This is not a joke. This is our music, written in long, sweaty nights in a cramped bungalow in California with real instruments, real minds and real soul.” (“Then make an appearance on live TV,” responded one person on X. “Proof [sic] it make a real video,” replied another.)

	Spotify, for one, has no rules against AI music. In the past, says Glenn McDonald, a former data alchemist at Spotify, “fake listeners were a larger problem than fake music. It might have flipped.” McDonald feels the Velvet Sundown's prominence on that platform is the result of several factors: Artists and content creators are able to pay for more exposure on playlists, he says, and the company's recommendations systems have moved “away from understandable algorithms with strong grounding in actual human listening and communities” and toward AI-driven systems that “can pick songs for recommendations based on characteristics of their audio.” 


	Added together, McDonald says, these factors “increase the lottery-like dynamics of the system so that there are fewer reasons why a fake band couldn't be successful. Most fake bands still won't be successful, and of course nobody notices when an AI band gets no listeners, but there are no protections against it happening, and probably from Spotify's business point of view it's not even clear that this is a bad thing to be ‘protected' against.” (A spokesperson for Spotify declined to comment.)

	As for the viral attention Velvet Sundown has garnered, “it's because they're AI, not because the music's great,” says one veteran A&R executive, who asked for anonymity. “It doesn't feel authentic. That said, it's clearly just a matter of time before AI creates a genuine hit song. Not convinced yet it will create a sustainable hit artist. My prediction is that a hit song will appear that the public loves. At that point, someone will reveal it to be AI. No one will care because they love the song.”


	The Velvet Sundown's Frelon, meanwhile, says that music fans need to learn to accept AI tools, calling the fear of them “super overwrought.” “I respect that people have really strong emotions about this,” he says. “But I think it's important that we allow artists to experiment with new technologies and new tools,  try things out, and not freak out at people just because they're using a program or not using a program. People have this idea that you have to please everybody and you have to follow the rules. And that's not how music and culture progress. Music and culture progressed by people doing weird experiments and sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. And that's kind of the spirit that we're [embracing].”

[Editor's note: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel‘s “Ironheart” finale.]

Where were you when you first learned about Mephisto?

I was at my parents' house during COVID, when Marvel began its erratic foray into television with the powerful “WandaVision.” In Marvel Comics, Mephisto is literally the devil; he crops up with various heroes and villains across the comics under thin aliases (Beelzebub? who could that be?), leaving his mark on the lives of everyone from Spider-Man to Doctor Strange, and more. He's connected to Scarlet Witch through her sons, who were introduced in Jac Schaeffer's Emmy-winning series.

And as the world Wanda (Elisabeth Olsen) built around herself started to fracture, fans thought the devil was in the details — but he never broke through. Eager theorists tabled their disappointment (easy to do when Kathryn Hahn is the one guiding you into the unknown) with the hope that Mephisto would pop up in the upcoming slate of films and shows.

But he didn't. 

There were whispers around “Loki” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” Surely he'd appear in “The Multiverse of Madness,” which brought Scarlet Witch face-to-face with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). By then, however, the villain of the phase had been introduced as Kang (Jonathan Majors), with pieces falling into place for an epic battle against him, leaving little room for a second big bad.

As someone who was scrambling for Mephisto crumbs during “WandaVision,” I've been saddened by my growing distance from the MCU since then. But between “Thunderbolts” and “Ironheart,” I feel something stirring that has been dormant since the days of lockdown.

For one thing, I was removed enough to miss the whispers that Mephisto would debut in “Ironheart,” and if I did catch this news item blowing the entire reveal over two years ago, I simply forgot! Watching the screeners all at once meant no week-to-week theorizing, so by the time Sacha Baron Cohen arrived on screen I was too absorbed in stunt casting to even consider who he was playing. It wasn't until a few lines before the character identifies himself that I remembered a name I had long forgotten — and realized that not only could this be him, but it had to be.

“You can call me Mephisto,” he said. To my own surprise, I shrieked. Mephisto is the one who gave Parker (Anthony Ramos) his hood as part of a sinister “deal,” and he's the devil who will offer Riri (Dominique Thorne) what she most desires in exchange for what's sure to be a deadly price. The shriek was less of shock than disbelief — or maybe I've been holding it in for years? Finally, we got there — so where do we go next?

 










This character and “Ironheart” took a long time to reach our screens (that 2022 leak was from the set), but seeing Baron Cohen eat up the role was immensely satisfying, regardless of the wait. Not only is it a departure from the actor's usual repertoire (I couldn't ID him with full confidence with the American accent), but it instantly stood out from the slew of gratuitous and garish MCU cameos in the past few years. (Harry Styles and Brett Goldstein come to mind.)

Mephisto has presence and purpose, and his powers remain a mystery to the audience because they're a mystery to our protagonist. Their deal slightly betrays Riri's journey with grief throughout the season, but that's the kind of character heel turn that indicates a larger plan within the franchise.

The MCU has struggled with memorable villains (remember Malekith? of course you don't) enough to approach them more thoughtfully over time; crafting a good one is hard enough, and more than one at a time would dilute their overall impression. With Kang out of the picture, there was a brief an opening for HBIC (Head Beelzebub in Charge, if you will), but that role got reworked into Doctor Doom (Robert Downey Jr.), whos scheduled to be the central villain of 2026's “Avengers: Doomsday.”

 










“Ironheart” was originally filmed before Marvel cut ties with Majors, so there was at least a plan for Mephisto to coexist with Kang, if not others upon his introduction. There's always the chance that this is a long game and Mephisto will work in the shadows throughout the events leading up to and following “Doomsday,” stepping into the spotlight during Phase… 7?? Admittedly, that's not as enticing as imagining him in “Fantastic Four: The First Steps” later this month, given his overlap with those characters, and it's also entirely possible that this character missed his window and joined the party too late.

But one way or another, Mephisto has finally entered the MCU, and the timing is such that I'm less concerned about the path forward than the road it took to get here. Through two Phases, 16 shows, and 13 movies, I finally got to release that scream, and I might just dare to get excited about what the future might bring.

All episodes of “Ironheart” are now streaming on Disney+.

Brad Pitt is putting his football differences with Bradley Cooper aside to praise the writer/director/producer/star's sophomore directorial effort, “Maestro.” Pitt, who is good pals with Cooper, joked that their friendship is still intact despite their differing NFL fandoms (Pitt roots for the Kansas City Chiefs, while Cooper is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles lover.)

During the “New Heights” with Jason and Travis Kelce podcast (in the below video), Pitt admitted that he couldn't help but throw some shade at Cooper when celebrating “Maestro” in 2024. Pitt also praised the Leonard Bernstein biopic for being one of the best films of the 2020s; Pitt implied that an Academy Award for Cooper is even long overdue. “Maestro” was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actress for Carey Mulligan, and Best Actor for Cooper.

“I have a confession: I'm friends with Bradley Cooper,” Pitt said. “He was getting an award for ‘Maestro,' [which] is still probably one of the best movies of this decade. And I was giving him this award and he's been nominated like 18 times for the Oscars. And I closed with, at the Santa Barbara Film Awards, ‘Listen, he's been nominated the 19,000th time. You know, if he doesn't get it, it's OK. He's used to it. He's a Philadelphia Eagles fan.'” To be clear, Cooper has actually received 12 Oscar nominations in his career.

As for the Eagles winning the Super Bowl against the Chiefs earlier in 2025, Pitt said, “I think he was happy this year. He gracefully let me hurt.” 

Cooper infamously said that he would prefer the Eagles taking home the Super Bowl trophy to getting an Oscar, anyway. Cooper will next appear in, direct, produce, and serve as B camera operator for meta Hollywood comedy “Is This Thing On?” He said during ESPN's “The Pat McAfee Show” that filmmaking itself is “very similar to team sports,” saying, “It's all about creating a culture. It's all about just the shot you're in and not thinking about just the end of the movie. It's very, very similar to football in particular, you know, if one of the 11 messes up, the whole thing's screwing up and people don't see that from the outside, but if you're in it, you know that very well. Same thing in a movie set.”

During the “New Heights” podcast, Pitt echoed Cooper's sentiments. Pitt, who is promoting his racing film “F1,” deemed sports films to be the “greatest” genre. 

“I look back at Gene Hackman and ‘Hoosiers' and Redford and ‘The Natural,'” he said. “It's an amazing metaphor for a lifetime. […] I feel like we really got it right in ‘Moneyball' in a lovely, beautiful way to add to that lexicon, and I think this one [‘F1'] does that too on a really big level.” Pitt added that “F1” also has a “spiritual ending” which he is “really proud of.” Check out the full interview here.

During Baylee Littrell's run on season 23 of “American Idol,” he had no bigger cheerleader than his dad, Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell. But in an interview published on July 2, 2025, Brian told Parade Magazine that initially, he wasn't keen on the idea of his son trying out for the show. 

“To be honest with you, I didn't want him to do it at first,” he admitted. “But they courted him for a couple of years. They were like, ‘Come and audition,' and he was like, ‘Nah.' I don't think he was ready at that time, but he did well.” 

In addition to the thousands of tens of thousands of singers who audition for producers virtually each season, “American Idol” casting producers also scour social media and performance venues for up-and-coming talent, encouraging rising stars to give the show a shot. Baylee, who's been trying to make it as a country and contemporary Christian artist, finally decided it was worth the exposure. 

A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)

Brian was a proud papa throughout 20-year-old Baylee's journey, from singing with his son for part of his audition, to cheering for him from the balcony during Hollywood Week. 

“He stepped up,” he told Parade of his son, who made it to the Top 20. “He's super professional. He's just a great individual. He's just a great person. He has a heart of gold, and he's super talented.” 

The 90s pop icon, who still tours extensively with the Backstreet Boys, often got emotional while supporting his only child with wife Leighanne Littrell, to whom he's been married since 2000. 

“I get choked up a little bit when I talk about my boy,” Brian said. “He's just (the) most inspiring thing in my life right now. He inspires me more than anything. Top 20 isn't a bad thing out of 124,000.” 

Brian's bandmates also chimed in, telling Parade how cool it was to watch Baylee on “American Idol,” since he's been joining them backstage — and even onstage — since he was a little boy. 

AJ McLean said, “We've known Baylee his whole life, so to watch him come from singing with us during soundcheck to opening up for us back in the day to now, having his own career … He's an incredible songwriter. It's unbelievable, the level of talent. Obviously, the apple didn't fall far. Honestly, he did fantastic in my opinion.”

On June 24, Baylee released the original single he performed during Hollywood Week on “American Idol” called “Hey Jesus.” 

“I wrote it in a very dark time in my life,” Littrell told CCM before releasing the song. “A big common misconception is that God won't let us fall down. That's part of the journey, that's part of learning …”

“Three years ago I found myself questioning everything, even the big man upstairs,” he told the outlet. “The growing pains of life weighed heavy on my shoulders and I lived every day in fear of the next. At the time, I had never fully put my trust in God. I thought I had to be a certain way for Him to see me—but He took me as I was. That's when I wrote ‘Hey Jesus.'”

Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has been found guilty on two out of five counts against him in federal court. The jury found Combs guilty of the Mann Act (a federal law that criminalizes the transportation of “any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose”) in connection to his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and an ex-girlfriend known under the pseudonym “Jane.” He was found not guilty of charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion in connection with Ventura and “Jane,” per ABC News. 

Abuse allegations against the famed hip-hop producer first surfaced in 2023 from Ventura, who would go on to testify in the federal trial. In addition to the federal case, dozens of civil suits have since been filed against Combs, who has admitted to domestic abuse but denied the more grievous charges against him. Accusations leveled against Combs include rape, sexual assault, physical and psychological abuse, violence, and intimidation. He was arrested in September 2024 and remained in custody since then, having been denied bail due to the judge's concerns of “the danger of obstruction of justice and the danger of witness tampering.”

The jury initially announced it had reached a verdict on only four of the five counts, indicating to the judge that the group was deadlocked over the matter of racketeering conspiracy. They were instructed to continue deliberating and ultimately returned with a not guilty verdict. The prosecution is now seeking a 20-year maximum sentence against Combs, and asked the judge that he remain in custody until sentencing. The defense has requested he “be released on conditions to his home in Miami and offered a $1 million bond,” per NBC News. Both sides were granted several hours to submit letters arguing for or against release before the court reconvenes on Wednesday afternoon; Combs will remain in the courthouse until that time, ABC News reports. 

In a statement (via CNN), Ventura's lawyer said, “This entire criminal process started when our client Cassie Ventura had the courage to file her civil complaint in November 2023. Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.” The attorney praised her courage and said she “brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussion,” adding, “This case proved that change is long overdue, and we will continue to fight on behalf of survivors.”

Sean "Diddy" Combs will face a monthslong process to determine his sentence, which could have been much more severe if he'd been convicted on all charges.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



Sean “Diddy” Combs has been convicted of illegal prostitution but acquitted of meatier sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, a significant legal victory for the disgraced rap mogul who faced up to life in prison if found guilty on all counts.


	What's next for Combs? Following the verdict on Wednesday (July 2), there will be a lengthy process before Judge Arun Subramanian decides the rapper's sentence. He'll be interviewed by the U.S. Probation Department, which will calculate suggested sentencing guidelines based on various factors like Combs' criminal history and the seriousness of his offense.


	After this process, which can take months, Judge Subramanian will hold a sentencing hearing. The charges that Combs was found guilty of – transporting escorts across state lines for marathon sex parties called “freak-offs” – carry no mandatory minimum and a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

	Combs faced a far lengthier prison term if he'd been convicted on the other charges he faced: forcing women to have sex with escorts during the freak-offs, and operating a criminal syndicate under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.


	If Combs had been convicted under RICO in addition to the prostitution charge, he'd face a maximum of 40 years behind bars. If he had been found guilty of sex-trafficking, he faced a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and maximum of life behind bars.


	As it stands, Combs defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said Wednesday that the rapper should be immediately released from the pretrial jail where he's been in custody since his arrest last year.


	Agnifilo said Combs has “been given his life by this jury” and should be allowed to await sentencing from his home in Miami, according to CNN. Prosecutor Maureen Comey opposed the request, saying her office intends to seek prison time and noting that Combs “continued to commit a litany of crimes” after he knew he was under investigation last year.


	Judge Subramanian asked both sides to submit letters on the matter by this afternoon and said he'll make a decision afterwards about whether Combs will be released.

Taron Egerton is bringing his action skills once more to the big screen. The actor leads “She Rides Shotgun,” which Nick Rowland directs. Ana Sophia Heger co-stars as Egerton's onscreen daughter whom he must protect from gang members and corrupt cops after leaving prison. 

The official synopsis for “She Rides Shotgun” reads: “Marked for death by unrelenting enemies, Nate (Egerton) must now protect his estranged 11-year-old daughter, Polly (Ana Sophia Heger) at all costs. Shy, precocious, and wary of her father, Polly is swept up in Nate's dangerous plight as they flee to evade the corrupt sheriff and brutal leader of a gang who will stop at nothing to protect his criminal interests. With scant resources and no one to trust, Nate and Polly form a bond forged under fire as he shows her how to fight and survive — and she teaches him what unconditional love truly means in this intense, moving story about loyalty, strength, and redemption.” Rob Yang and John Carroll Lynch co-star.

Rowland directs from a script by Jordan Harper, Ben Collins, and Luke Piotrowski; the film is adapted from Harper's book of the same name. Rowland previously helmed the Netflix film “Calm with Horses” starring Barry Keoghan and Cosmo Jarvis. The feature earned 10 BIFA nominations including Best Director, and 4 BAFTA nominations including Outstanding British Film. 

 










“She Rides Shotgun” was acquired by Lionsgate earlier this year. Actor and producer Egerton, who recently led series “Smoke,” explained in a statement to Variety that “She Rides Shotgun” is one of his career highlights. “I cannot recall a happier or more soul-enriching experience than making ‘She Rides Shotgun.' It is without doubt the most tender and felt relationship I have had with an actor onscreen,” he said. “Ana Sophia Heger was 10 when we made the film and she is nothing short of extraordinary. In Nick Rowland, I found the kind of like-minded friend and collaborator that comes along once or twice in a lifetime.”

Director Rowland added, “Working on ‘She Rides Shotgun' was about honoring Jordan Harper's brutal, beautiful novel while finding a cinematic language that could carry both its savagery and its soul. The film is about two people — strangers, really — who find a way to become a real family in the most brutal of circumstances. What moved me most was the emotional survival in it. There's tenderness in the trauma. That's what I wanted to explore — how love can grow even in the darkest places. Taron Egerton brought such depth and volatility to Nate, and Ana Sophia Heger blew us away with her heart and fearlessness as Polly. I'm incredibly proud of what we created together — it's a ride, and it doesn't let go.”

 










“She Rides Shotgun” is produced by Brad Weston, Collin Creighton, Nate Matteson, Hiro Murai, and Egerton. The executive producers are Ken Kao, Josh Rosenbaum, Teddy Schwarzman, John Friedberg, Walter Parkes, Laurie Macdonald, Alexis Garcia, Chris Rice, Christopher Slager, and Graham Taylor. Lionsgate and Fifth Season present, in association with Waypoint Entertainment, the Makeready and Super Frog production. Blanck Mass crafted the original soundtrack for the movie.

Rowland is next reuniting with Fifth Season for crime thriller “The Final Score.” 

Lionsgate will release “She Rides Shotgun” in select theaters August 1. Check out the trailer below.

	After a seven-week trial, Sean Combs was convicted on two of the five felony charges against him, but in a boon to the embattled mogul, he was acquitted on the most serious counts.


The mixed verdict found Combs guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution related to his ex-girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, and an ex-girlfriend who testified under the name “Jane.” But he was found not guilty on the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.


	Had he been convicted on all charges, or even some of the more serious ones, Combs could have faced up to life in prison. The guilty verdicts for the two prostitution charges could still land him in prison for some time, but the penalty is expected to be much less severe.


	Each violation of the Mann Act carries up to 10 years in prison, meaning Combs technically faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. Most legal experts, however, do not expect Judge Arun Subramanian to hand down such a harsh punishment. Combs has no prior criminal record, which could lead to a more lenient sentence, while Subramanian could also allow him to serve concurrent sentences for the two counts.

	More pressing at the moment is whether Combs will be remanded back into custody or released on bond as he awaits sentencing. After the verdict was read, the prosecution and defense squabbled over the matter, with Subramanian expected to make a decision later today.

	











	The government raised concerns that, if released, Combs could “disregard orders from this court,” citing evidence that the mogul “continued to commit a litany of crimes” — such as alleged abuse and drug use — even after he knew he was under federal investigation. Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo, however, pushed for his client's immediate release on bond, saying he would be “nothing short of a fool” to violate a court order.

	To coincide with the band's 30th anniversary, Foo Fighters returned Wednesday with “Today's Song,” their first new music in two years.


Dave Grohl revealed the song on the band's official website, accompanied by a reflective 13-minute audio statement where he acknowledged, for the first time, the departure of drummer Josh Freese, who joined the band following the death of Taylor Hawkins.


	“Over the years, we've had moments of unbridled joy and moments of devastating heartbreak. Moments of beautiful victory, and moments of painful defeat. We have mended broken bones and broken hearts. But we have followed this road together, with each other, for each other, no matter what. Because in life, you just can't go it alone,” Grohl said.


	“It should go without saying that without the boundless energy of William Goldsmith, the seasoned wisdom of Franz Stahl, and the thunderous wizardry of Josh Freese, this story would be incomplete, so we extend our heartfelt gratitude for the time, music, and memories that we shared with each of them over the years. Thank you, gentlemen.”

	











	Grohl's lengthy statement reminisces about encountering Nate Mendel for the first time on Thanksgiving in 1994, and how that chance meeting resulted in the birth of the Foo Fighters. “A few heaping plates of food, a few bottles of wine, one thing leading to another, and before long we had started a new band with other dear friends, Pat Smear and William Goldsmith,” Grohl said. “We called it Foo Fighters.” The band's self-titled debut album arrived on June 26, 1995.

	Later in the note, Grohl paid tribute to his late friend and band mate Hawkins. “And… Taylor. Your name is spoken every day, sometimes with tears, sometimes with a smile, but you are still in everything we do, everywhere we go, forever,” Grohl added. “The enormity of your beautiful soul is only rivaled by the infinite longing we feel in your absence. We all miss you beyond words. Foo Fighters will forever include Taylor Hawkins in every note that we play, until we do finally reach our destination.”


	“Today's Song” itself echoes many of the themes in Grohl's note, namely the passage of time. “Two sides to a river / Too troubled to cross / It might take you under / Today's song,” Grohl sings on the track. “We'll drown in the middle / Which side are you on / One way or another / Today's song.”

	The track marks the Foo Fighters' first new original music since their 2023 album But Here We Are; the band quietly resurfaced for the first time amid all the domestic drama recently to release a Minor Threat cover.


	It appears Grohl and company are revving up for their grand return as the band has announced October concerts in Indonesia, Singapore, and Japan, their first shows together in over a year.

	“I haven't played this in like 100 years,” Neil Young told the crowd Tuesday evening at the very beginning of his show at Drafbaan Stadspark in Groningen, The Netherlands. “We'll see what happens.”


	He was talking about “Ambulance Blues,” the stunning, nine-minute On The Beach classic that many Young aficionados consider one of his finest achievements. (Rolling Stone placed it #2 on our 2021 list of Young's 100 best songs, topped only by “Powderfinger.”)


	To be fair, it hadn't quite been 100 years since the song surfaced in concert. He last played it January 26, 2019, at the Pantages Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. But like the vast majority of live renditions of “Ambulance Blues” in history, going all the way back to the Bottom Line in 1974, that one was solo acoustic. He didn't do it with a band until R.E.M convinced him to play it with them at the 1998 Bridge School Benefit.


	“I don't know how we did that,” R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills told Rolling Stone in 2023. “Neil was just into it. I think he was glad to have an outlet where he felt like he could play it and do it justice, which is of course a really nice thing to credit our band with, if I dare go that far…It was a super fun thing and really great for [guitarist] Peter [Buck] and [touring guitarist] Scott McCaughey, who are Neil Young fans to the bone, even more so than myself and Michael [Stipe]. It was a real thrill.”

	“Ambulance Blues” was regularly played at solo acoustic shows in 1999 and 2007/08, but Young didn't perform it with a band again until January 25, 2016, at a private show in Paris for Carmignac CEO Édouard Carmignac. That means this newest one in the Netherlands is just the third time in history he's done it with a band. (And it was a different group every time: R.E.M., Promise of the Real, and now the Chrome Hearts.)

	Young largely stuck to his standard summer setlist for the rest of the Groningen show, which completely ignores his new LP Talkin' To The Trees, and instead centers around hits like “Old Man,” “Like a Hurricane,” and “Cinnamon Girl” in addition to a smattering of rarities like “Name of Love,” “Sun Green,” and “Looking Forward.”


	The European run wraps up July 13 in Paris and then heads over to the States for a run of outdoor shows that kick off August 8 in Charlotte, North Carolina. The last show on the calendar is the Farm Aid 40th anniversary celebration at Huntington Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on September 20.

Riz Ahmed is cleaning up corporate messes, one corrupt client at a time, for David Mackenzie‘s “Relay.” The film, which debuted at TIFF 2024 and was later acquired by Bleecker Street, stars “The Night Of” alum as an anonymous “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corporations and individuals threatening to expose them. However, after one client's case proves to be even more layered than usual, things go sideways.

The official synopsis reads: “A nameless character, he keeps his identity a secret by using a message relay service called Relay, which is usually used by people with a hearing or speech disability to make and receive telephone calls via text. Yet when a message arrives from a potential client (Lily James) who needs his protection just to stay alive, Ahmed's character abandons his own ironclad rules of communication.” Sam Worthington, Willa Fitzgerald, Matthew Maher, Helen Eigenberg, Pun Bandhu, Eisa Davis, Purva Bedi, Aaron Roman Weiner, Reed Northrup, Sasha Sen, Brian O'Neill, and José Báez co-star.

IndieWire previously debuted the teaser here, which encouraged audiences to text the number to get a special message from Ahmed's character.

“Hell or High Water” director Mackenzie helms the action-thriller, which was financed by Black Bear. The company also produced alongside Thunder Road Pictures and Sigma Films. Additional producers include Basil Iwanyk for Thunder Road, Gillian Berrie for Sigma, Teddy Schwarzman for Black Bear, and MacKenzie. The executive producers are Black Bear's Michael Heimler and John Friedberg, and Thunder Road's Erica Lee and Charlie Morrison.

“It was just the idea that this person is doing everything without any direct communication with other human beings, which sort of adds to the aloneness of it and the sort of weird sort of tension and paranoia,” Mackenzie told IndieWire of directing the feature, which was written by Justin Piasecki.

The IndieWire review deemed “Relay” a “modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday [with] Justin Piasecki's knotted script absolutely delighting in the process of Ahmed's character's work. Smooth but vulnerable, clever but anonymous, desperate to provoke a human response but willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done, ‘Relay' isn't out to set the world on fire, it just wants to be a hand-crafted thriller that communicates a real sense of personal investment at a time when corporations would rather kill a single whistleblower than spare the lives of 1,000 customers, and it pulls that off with expert precision.”

 










Ahmed told IndieWire that “Relay” is a return to classic indies. “This isn't a high-concept AI, internet kind of movie,” Ahmed said. “Definitely one of the most distinctive aspects about it is how the main characters communicate or don't communicate. From an acting point of view, that was really exciting to me, that you've got a director like David who can just bring characters to life with so little and bring out these complex relationships. It felt like a lot of fun.”

Bleecker Street will premiere “Relay” in theaters August 22. Check out the trailer below.

"Absolutely rocked the stage yet again," the athlete raved about his superstar girlfriend.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift‘s surprise performance at Travis Kelce‘s Tight End University event was truly that: a surprise.


	According to the Kansas City Chiefs star, the 14-time Grammy winner's live showcase of Billboard Hot 100-topper “Shake It Off” with Kane Brown's band June 24 in Nashville was so last minute, she didn't even practice beforehand. Speaking to brother and co-host Jason Kelce on their New Heights podcast episode posted Wednesday (July 2), Travis shed some light on how the performance came about, raving, “Tay Tay showed up!”


	“We're in Nashville, she grew up in Nashville — she moved there when she was younger,” the Grotesquerie star explained. “We had this plan for a while that we were going to have some fun with the tight ends.”

	











	“I won't say when the idea came up, but when we were there at Tight End and Friends, and we knew there was a professional like Kane Brown, who can just, he can figure it out,” Travis continued. “He's a pro. Tay just kind of went up to him and the band and went, ‘Hey, if you guys are down, I'll go up there, play a song and see if we can pop the roof off this place.'”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The athlete went on to share that moments before the viral performance, Swift jotted down accompaniment notes for Brown's band members so that they could perform with her without missing a beat. “She was like in the back doing musical notes,” Travis said with awe. “Sheets of music, she was writing out — I think the high hats, maybe? I don't know, I'm not a musician. But she was, like, making sure the band and everybody knew.”


	“And then just went out there without practicing, and it was pitch-perfect,” Travis added. “[She] just killed it.”

	











	The knockout performance in question happened at the Tight Ends and Friends concert at Music City's Brooklyn Bowl, with Swift getting the crowd hyped up as she took the stage in a black dress and matching heeled boots. As she strummed her guitar, Brown danced along on stage and added extra percussion by shaking a stick of bells.


	The pop star was also present throughout the three-day Tight End University summit, appearing alongside Travis on the red carpet during opening ceremonies and later attending the welcome party with him that night. The Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? host founded TEU in 2021 with George Kittle and Greg Olsen to foster community among the NFL's tight ends and help them prepare for the football season ahead.


	“She's so good with just everybody — people and making people feel comfortable,” Travis praised Swift. “Absolutely rocked the stage yet again. It was awesome.”

Political Editor


	The news that Paramount Global will settle Donald Trump‘s 60 Minutes lawsuit for $16 million certainly did not come as a shock to staffers at CBS News.


	For months, there has been a great deal of consternation and even resignation at the prospect of a settlement and the impact that it would have on the news division.


	“People are not surprised but also disappointed,” one CBS News staffer said on Wednesday. “There is hope that if the Skydance deal goes through, that could be a fresh start.”


	CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, in the morning editorial call, noted that the settlement did not include an apology, while urging his team to move forward, per a source. In its announcement of the settlement, Paramount Global also emphasized that there was no apology, as did CBS President and CEO George Cheeks.

	Over the past few months, CBS News staffers have had a great deal of consternation over a pending settlement, a prospect that was out of their control. Talks were occurring at the corporate level and having much to do with the circumstances of the pending Paramount Global merger with Skydance Media. Some staffers also have seen the whole affair as obscuring standout work in the news division, particularly in the early months of the Trump administration.


	In the aftermath, a succession of press freedom groups and other organizations have blasted Paramount Global's decision. Trump sued the network over an Oct. 7 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 rival Kamala Harris, claiming that it was intentionally edited to make her look better and boost her electoral chances. CBS News called the lawsuit meritless, and said that there was no deception, and released the transcript in February.


	The network published a story about the settlement early Wednesday morning, quoting legal experts who saw the lawsuit as frivolous. Trump claimed a violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act,  typically used in false advertising and product claims.

	They included Geoffrey R. Stone, law professor at the University of Chicago, who told the network, “That statute is about sales — a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't. But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.”


	Within CBS News, there has been some second guessing about how the whole situation could have been handled differently, including that 60 Minutes could have released the transcript of the interview with Kamala Harris much earlier, as some other news organizations routinely do.


	The settlement did include an agreement that in the future, 60 Minutes “will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.”


	As some staffers look to get beyond the whole affair, the legal and corporate aspects are not actually over. A conservative group, the Center for American Rights, filed an FCC complaint over the 60 Minutes broadcast under the agency's news distortion policy. But that has been rarely invoked in the past and under the narrowest of circumstances, while First Amendment attorneys say that the network would have a strong case should it ever come to a fine or other sanction.


	There is also the merger itself. The FCC passed an informal, 180-day timeline to review the deal, and Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, has not said when a decision will be rendered. His spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.


	Unclear is what the ultimate impact that the settlement will have on CBS News, whether that be reputation or ratings. Bill Owens, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, exited the network in April, he said that he no longer make independent decisions about the show. The newsmagazine is consistently a top ratings getter for the network, drawing an average of 8.32 million viewers in its 57th season. As the wrangling over the Skydance-Paramount merger dragged on, the show did a number of hard-hitting pieces on the Trump administration, to the point where the president threatened to file another lawsuit. That potential defamation action also was part of the settlement agreement, per Paramount Global.

How Trump really gains his wealth vs the great businessman he professes to be.
His father gave him millions he puddles away.
He is not pulled himself up by the bootstraps kind of guy.

Shari wants her $8B so they had to settle

I don't know if you can hear this inside your echo chamber, but even if they don't like his personality, normal people living out here in objective reality agree with Trump on most things.

Trump's current approval rating is at 44%. I don't know how you math, but that's not the majority of people “agreeing with Trump.” You're the one in an echo chamber.

‘Normal' people meaning people who look like you, I'm guessing?

I live in a purple state and can tell you most of the people I speak with don't agree with Trump on almost anything. Mainly because they're smart enough to see that he cares only about himself and enriching the already wealthy at the cost of everyone else and the country as a whole.

Time to get off Fox news, Newsmax, and X. Educate yourself.

It's pure corruption but what do you expect from the most corrupt president ever? Shari Redstone wants the merger to go through so she can get her fat payday. 

Paramount's only hope for survival is to use the Ellison billions to turn things around and even then I think they're wasting their money but we shall see.

Never wrestle with a pig…

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


UPDATED with more details: Sean “Diddy” Combs has been found guilty on two counts in his sex-trafficking trial, the jury said today.


	After a total of just 13 hours in the jury room, the panel of eight men and four women found the Bad Boy Records founder guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. However, the jury found Combs not guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The mixed verdict, just read out by the foreman, can only be viewed as a big defeat for the Maurene Comey-led prosecution


	The two counts under the engaging in prostitution charge each carry a maximum sentence of a decade behind bars. Surely stinging from being defeated on the major RICO charge, prosecutors do not think Combs should be allowed out on bond, which is what the defense is arguing for with a million dollars on the table. The defense also wants its client to be able to travel to homes in Florida, L.A. and the Empire State.

	











	Judge Arun Subramanian has asked both sides to submit their POVs to him and the court will gather this afternoon on the bond matter. 


	Certain to face an appeal no matter if the bond is granted or not, today's decision comes after two tense days filled with notes from the jury and an admission late on July 1 that there were “unpersuadable opinions on both sides” when it came to the pivotal racketeering charge. With verdicts on counts 2, 3,4, and 5 — a.k.a.  the two sex-trafficking charges and the two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution – it looked like the month and a half long trial may stumble into a partial verdict at best or worse yet, a mistrial.


RELATED: Juror Tossed Out Of Sean “Diddy” Combs Trial For Perceived “Lying”; Judge Admonishes Defense For Claiming Racial Bias


	After the verdict was read out, the judge in the case praised the jury, which had a rocky ride at times: “I want you to know that it is inspiring to all of us. You listened, you worked together, you were here every day, rain or shine.” Even before the trial started last month, Judge Subramanian had promised the proceedings would be over by the July 4 holiday — a promise kept. 

	











	For Combs, freedom might also come before Independence Day if the judge rules he can be released on bail – a move that looks likely if for no other reason than the charges the defendant, who has had previous offenses over the years, was found guilty on were of a non-violent nature


	Following nearly a year of abuse and assault allegations, started for the most part by a very quickly settled ($20 million) suit from former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, Combs was arrested in New York City in September on criminal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and more. Failing repeatedly to regain his freedom with a $50 million bail pitch, Combs has been in custody at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center ever since.


	Filled with often harrowing testimony from a then very pregnant Ventura (who got snared in a defense fastball revealing a $10 million payout from an L.A. hotel over a violent 2016 incident by Combs), as well as other rape and abuse accusers' “Jane” and “Mia,” the trial began at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan on May 12. As well as the three victims (and minus a Victim 2 who simply disappeared mere days before the trial), the jury heard from various male escorts hired for the drug-drenched and often filmed “freak-off” sex sessions, rap star Kid Cudi, former Combs employees, law enforcement officials and an expert or two in the prosecution's dense case.


	In a tactic straight out of Harvey Weinstein's last rape retrial, the defense decided not to put their client on the stand and wrapped up their case in around 30 minutes last week with no witnesses at all. In the midnight hour just before closing arguments, the feds trimmed and culled some of the initial charges against Combs claims in what they called an effort to “streamline” the case.


	Attracting a lot of last-minute attention, the largely procedural move changed nothing when it came to a possible outcome of the 55-year-old Combs spending the rest of his life in a federal prison if found guilty on all the charges.


	However, for about an hour on Tuesday it looked as if the case against Combs could at least partially collapse under the weight of the jury's deadlock.


	Buoyed by a rare scenario of agreement between the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York and Combs' 10-lawyer defense bench that the jury should keep deliberating, Judge Arun Subramanian eventually asked the panel to keep at it a bit longer in hopes of reaching a unified verdict. The irony of sorts is that the judge's borderline pleading came right at the end of the day on Tuesday and the non-sequestered jurors went home soon afterwards anyway.


	The New York dozen were back in the courthouse Wednesday at around 9 a.m. ET and back behind closed doors deliberating.


	Surrounded by members of his family like his mother (a near constant presence during the trial) and children, plus lawyers Marc Agnifilo, Alexandra Shapiro, Brian Steel, and others, the now white-haired and sweater wearing Combs was in Judge Subramanian's courtroom first thing this morning too. At one point, Combs took to prayer with members of his family joining in. “Let us pray, please watch over my family,” the “All About the Benjamins” performer said, getting an “Amen” in reply from those assembled.

	











	After the verdict was delivered, Cassie Ventura's lawyer Doug Wigdor put out a statement praising his client. “Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution,” the attorney said in part. “By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.”

Sure Netflix already offering Diddy a deal.

Johnson and Johnson stock just went up. Buy now.

Diddie gonna continue to diddle…moneyband politics always above the law and human morals

He and many other artists create a bad boy/girl image that is at least a partial reality and they are awarded for it with accolades from the press, awards from their industry and so much money from the public. Why should they regulate their behavior when everything out there, including the many who cozy up to them looking for a piece of the action, tells them that being bad is good?

Diddy do it or Diddy not.

Apparently, he diddy'nt do it.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


(Updated with more details) Sean “Diddy” Combs has been found guilty on two counts in his sex-trafficking trial, the jury said today.


	After a total of just 13 hours in the jury room, the panel of eight men and four women found the Bad Boy Records founder guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. However, the jury found Combs not guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The mixed verdict, just read out by the foreman, can only be viewed as a big defeat for the Maurene Comey-led prosecution


	The two counts under the engaging in prostitution charge each carry a maximum sentence of a decade behind bars. Surely stinging from being defeated on the major RICO charge, prosecutors do not think Combs should be allowed out on bond, which is what the defense is arguing for with a million dollars on the table. The defense also wants its client to be able to travel to homes in Florida, L.A. and the Empire State.

	











	Judge Arun Subramanian has asked both sides to submit their POVs to him and the court will gather this afternoon on the bond matter. 


	Certain to face an appeal no matter if the bond is granted or not, today's decision comes after two tense days filled with notes from the jury and an admission late on July 1 that there were “unpersuadable opinions on both sides” when it came to the pivotal racketeering charge. With verdicts on counts 2, 3,4, and 5 — a.k.a.  the two sex-trafficking charges and the two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution – it looked like the month and a half long trial may stumble into a partial verdict at best or worse yet, a mistrial.

	After the verdict was read out, the judge in the case praised the jury, which had a rocky ride at times: “I want you to know that it is inspiring to all of us. You listened, you worked together, you were here every day, rain or shine.” Even before the trial started last month, Judge Subramanian had promised the proceedings would be over by the July 4 holiday — a promise kept. 

	











	For Combs, freedom might also come before Independence Day if the judge rules he can be released on bail – a move that looks likely if for no other reason than the charges the defendant, who has had previous offenses over the years, was found guilty on were of a non-violent nature


	Following nearly a year of abuse and assault allegations, started for the most part by a very quickly settled ($20 million) suit from former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, Combs was arrested in New York City in September on criminal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and more. Failing repeatedly to regain his freedom with a $50 million bail pitch, Combs has been in custody at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center ever since.


	Filled with often harrowing testimony from a then very pregnant Ventura (who got snared in a defense fastball revealing a $10 million payout from an L.A. hotel over a violent 2016 incident by Combs), as well as other rape and abuse accusers' “Jane” and “Mia,” the trial began at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan on May 12. As well as the three victims (and minus a Victim 2 who simply disappeared mere days before the trial), the jury heard from various male escorts hired for the drug-drenched and often filmed “freak-off” sex sessions, rap star Kid Cudi, former Combs employees, law enforcement officials and an expert or two in the prosecution's dense case.


	In a tactic straight out of Harvey Weinstein's last rape retrial, the defense decided not to put their client on the stand and wrapped up their case in around 30 minutes last week with no witnesses at all. In the midnight hour just before closing arguments, the feds trimmed and culled some of the initial charges against Combs claims in what they called an effort to “streamline” the case.


	Attracting a lot of last-minute attention, the largely procedural move changed nothing when it came to a possible outcome of the 55-year-old Combs spending the rest of his life in a federal prison if found guilty on all the charges.


	However, for about an hour on Tuesday it looked as if the case against Combs could at least partially collapse under the weight of the jury's deadlock.


	Buoyed by a rare scenario of agreement between the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York and Combs' 10-lawyer defense bench that the jury should keep deliberating, Judge Arun Subramanian eventually asked the panel to keep at it a bit longer in hopes of reaching a unified verdict. The irony of sorts is that the judge's borderline pleading came right at the end of the day on Tuesday and the non-sequestered jurors went home soon afterwards anyway.


	The New York dozen were back in the courthouse Wednesday at around 9 a.m. ET and back behind closed doors deliberating.


	Surrounded by members of his family like his mother (a near constant presence during the trial) and children, plus lawyers Marc Agnifilo, Alexandra Shapiro, Brian Steel, and others, the now white-haired and sweater wearing Combs was in Judge Subramanian's courtroom first thing this morning too. At one point, Combs took to prayer with members of his family joining in. “Let us pray, please watch over my family,” the “All About the Benjamins” performer said, getting an “Amen” in reply from those assembled.

	











	After the verdict was delivered, Cassie Ventura's lawyer Doug Wigdor put out a statement praising his client. “Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution,” the attorney said in part. “By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.”

It was an ordinary spring day in 1962 Italy… ordinary outside of a warm greeting between the very married superstar Elizabeth Taylor and the very married actor Richard Burton that a photographer happened to catch. The “kissing picture,” as it would become known, caught like wildfire, and the paparazzi never let up. Richard Burton dubbed the ensuing press storm “Le Scandale,” and the judgement of the world swiftly followed — included a condemnation from the Vatican newspaper calling it Taylor's “erotic vagrancy.”

At the center of Le Scandale — one which TCM host Ben Mankiewicz calls the “biggest in the history of American celebrities” — was a mammoth film, perhaps the biggest in the history of American cinema: 20th Century Fox's “Cleopatra.”

“The first photograph of them kissing as the rumors were circulating that they were involved was [taken by] a paparazzo hiding under a car, under like a Fiat… lying on the ground, taking a picture of them,” Mankiewicz said in an interview with IndieWire. “[Fellow ‘Cleopatra' star] Martin Landau [said] there were photographers in the trees. This had never happened on a movie before.”

 










The film was always going to be a giant undertaking, but an almost comical series of unfortunate events had curtailed it into becoming one of the most expensive pictures Hollywood had ever produced… long before Burton even joined the project. By the time of their steamy tryst began, “Cleopatra” had been in production — in fits and starts — for roughly four years. Taylor had signed on for the unheard sum of $1 million in 1959 (a salary she reportedly asked for only in jest).

Then she had health problems (she almost died).

The original Marc Antony and Julius Caesar dropped out (Stephen Boyd and Peter Finch, respectively).

The first director Rouben Mamoulian dropped out.

Footage was scrapped.

Numerous drafts of the script were rejected. 

The entire production moved from London to Rome, where sets had to be reconstructed.

By the time cameras were rolling on “Cleopatra” scenes that would actually make it into the bloated four-hour epic's final cut, it was not just over budget — it had blown past any semblance of a budget. For a time, it was the only production 20th Century Fox had going. That studio lot back in Century City? Virtually empty.

 










It would be thanks to the perceived failure of the movie — notoriety it perhaps should not have earned — that the kind of studio system the American film industry had operated under since the '20s would largely die. New Hollywood came in swiftly after with an era that would be defined by maverick filmmakers and stars with increased financial agency and power.

Almost everyone and everything involved with “Cleopatra” survived and thrived after its release. Taylor and Burton outlived the scandal and appeared together in the all-timer “Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff?” Fox eventually released “The Sound of Music” and financially recovered. Co-star Rex Harrison led in the biggest movie of 1964: “My Fair Lady,” and won an Academy Award for it. 

But then there was Joseph L. Mankiewicz — the one-time boy wonder of Hollywood, who set an Oscar record by winning back-to-back trophies for both writing and directing (1949's “A Letter to Three Wives and 1950's “All About Eve”). The man came into “Cleopatra” halfway, and he seemed up to tackling the gargantuan responsibility. He had enjoyed great success a decade earlier with his Marlon Brando-starring “Julius Caesar,” so he knew the time period. He had directed Taylor in the big 1959 hit “Suddenly, Last Summer,” so he knew the talent. When he joined the film, he was 51-going-on-52, very squarely in his prime.

 










“Cleopatra” would break Joe Mankiewicz.

By the time the movie was wrapped, in theaters, and finally sending some money back to Fox, Mankiewicz was a shell of the powerhouse he had once been. He would direct just three more narrative features, only one of which would receive any real critical or commercial success (the brilliant “Sleuth” in 1972). At one time the most lauded writer/director combo, he'd never pen another screenplay, though he lived another 30 years after the release of “Cleopatra.” Not only that, but the filmmaker struggled to write anything at all, including personal letters and Christmas cards.

“The Plot Thickens,” Turner Classic Movies' podcast series that tackles various aspects of Hollywood history, will explore the troubled history of this unwieldy Egyptian epic in its new season — out July 17 — through a uniquely personal lens. Released first for IndieWire, TCM has unveiled a trailer, narrated by Joe Mankiewicz's great nephew, Ben, who serves as the series host.

 










“[Joe] would have said his biggest professional regret certainly would have been ‘Cleopatra.' He said it was an act of ‘whoredom.' He did it for the money. But I mean, a lot of people in Hollywood do things for money, and then make something great,” Ben Mankiewicz said. 

“Cleopatra” became an albatross for Ben's uncle… a nightmare he was never able to escape and something he never again wanted to discuss. Through Joe's personal diaries. “The Plot Thickens” reconstructs the history of the complicated production through the eyes of its writer/director.

“[When] most people think of Cleopatra, they think about the about the affair and the scandal, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and then these sort of myths [about] the movie that destroyed a studio,” Ben Mankiewicz said. “We dispatch a lot of those myths in the podcast, but we probably wouldn't have done [the podcast] without the family angle… Joe was broken by it in really substantive ways. And he had been one of the truly finest filmmakers of the 1950s. But it did a number on him and that was worth examining.”

The Mankiewicz family is true Hollywood royalty. Joe's brother Herman won an Oscar for some overlooked gem called “Citizen Kane.” Joe's son Tom wrote three James Bond flicks. Herman's son Don wrote a score of features in the '50s, '60s, and '70s. Ben's father Frank was president of National Public Radio, was Robert F. Kennedy, Sr.'s press secretary, and headed up George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. Frank's other son Josh is a journalist on NBC's “Nightline.” 

 










“There was a line I heard a lot growing up. Family members used to say it,” Ben Mankiewicz says in “The Plot Thickens” promo. “The line was that my grandfather wrote the best movie ever made — ‘Citizen Kane' — and that my great uncle directed the worst movie ever made.”

Through its reframing in “The Plot Thickens,” it becomes clear that the efforts at the center of “Cleopatra” were that of passionate film professionals — people who cared about the movies. If Joe Mankiewicz had his way, in fact, it would've been two epics instead of one: one part focused on Julius Caesar, the other on Marc Antony.

“This sort of historical costume drama is not my kind of movie, but… one of the myths is that it's the worst movie ever made. It's not even one of the 3,000 worst movies ever made. Some of it's pretty good. And I think that if Joe Mankiewicz, my uncle, had gotten his way and released it as two three-hour movies, that some of the issues — the pacing problems, where it actually seems slow — would have been better, because you would have had two tighter, three-hour movies,” Ben explained. “It's funny. Now, if you say, ‘Listen, I know you asked me to shoot one movie, but I've actually shot two. Do you want both?' Every studio would be like, ‘Is this a trick question? Yeah, we'll take two, sure.'”

 










As it stands, though there have been various versions presented over the years, “Cleopatra” exists as one 243 minute film. But it would eventually be a success on the books. It scored a Best Picture nomination, and though it did not actually turn a profit for a few years due to its reported $44 million budget, it was not the total financial disaster some later claimed — in reality, it was the top grossing movie of 1963.

“Spyros Skouras had been the president of the company prior to Darryl Zanuck coming back. Spyros quit, but basically got fired,” Ben explained. “But his time had come to an end, and he and the board sort of blamed him for the fiasco of ‘Cleopatra,' and then Zanuck came and blamed Joe. Spyros Skouras… what he really [was good at was] his relationships and [setting] up deals with theater owners, and he had set up a deal where they had prepaid for ticket sales of ‘Cleopatra.' And so, right off the bat, ‘Cleopatra' had $20 million come in very quickly… and then more after that at the box office, to where — okay, it lost a lot of money — but still brought back, let's say, $25 million. And obviously, Fox doesn't get all that, but they get a lot of it. And by the time 1965 rolls around, when they sell it to network TV, it's in the black.”

So this particular “The Plot Thickens” season is a little bit different for TCM's resident savant. More than the narrator of a fascinating chapter in film history, Mankiewicz is recasting his own family's heritage and the reputation of a film whose impact, while great, is perhaps unfairly perceived.

 










“What you get from this podcast is [that] Joe threw everything into this. I mean, he poured his heart and soul into this movie. Because of the money, [there was] this perception that he came in, he wasn't the right director, [and] he didn't know what he was doing. He definitely knew what he was doing,” Ben said. “He just tried to do too much, among the other things, tried to do too much. First of all, he was a therapist to Elizabeth and to Richard and to Rex and to everybody else on the cast.”

Joe Mankiewicz used speed, Ben explained, to help him through the grueling shoot days. He actually ended principal photography in the wheelchair after mistakenly shooting up and hitting a sciatic nerve.

“He's in a wheelchair, and he's got to get over sand. So they carried him out to the shot on a stretcher. And he's like writing on the stretcher, while a bunch of guys carry him out so he can sit and and direct the scene,” Ben recounted. “[His] diaries reveal a guy who was a director in the day, and then frequently would go home [and] write the screenplay at night… He needed help.”

This, along with the controversies surrounding Le Scandale, weather delays, the recurrent health issues of cast members, the haggling over the film's final cut, and, of course, the movie's legacy as the film that changed Hollywood… all will be explored when “The Plot Thickens: Cleopatra” begins dropping weekly episodes starting July 17, wherever you get your podcasts.

When Jelly Roll and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson embraced in a big bear hug backstage at “American Idol” in May 2025, it was much more than a scene of two celebrities greeting each other. Incredibly, the meaningful moment marked the first time in the men's nearly 10 years of friendship that they'd met in person. 

Johnson, 53, shared a lengthy tribute to Jelly Roll, 40, in an Instagram post on June 30, 2025, which included footage of their emotional meeting on the “American Idol” soundstage on May 12. He revealed the two had been corresponding for years, helping each other through some dark times in their lives. But the timing had never worked out for them to meet up — until that fateful night at “American Idol.”

Jelly Roll was on set at “American Idol” on May 12 because he was the show's first-ever artist-in-residence, a mentorship role he served in throughout season 23, guiding and encouraging the contestants. 

Johnson, meanwhile, was on set at “American Idol” that night for two reasons. First, his daughter performed in the Polynesian children's choir that backed up 2023 “American Idol” winner Iam Tongi, who sang his song from the new live-action “Lilo & Stitch” movie. 

Tongi was asked to cover “Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride,” the classic tune from the original 2002 movie, and a new generation of students from Kamehameha School's Children's Chorus appear on the song. Johnson posted on Instagram on May 12 about what a proud “girl dad” he was as he watched the choir back up Tongi. 

Johnson also promoted his upcoming animated Disney film, “Moana 2,” while in the audience at “American Idol,” in a brief segment with Ryan Seacrest. But it was the long-awaited meetup with Jelly Roll that clearly meant the most to the actor. 

In his July 1 post, Johnson explained that he had first reached out to Jelly Roll before he was an international sensation, writing, “Several years ago (roughly 2017) I was going through a very hard thing at the time, I was struggling. My mental wellness turned into my mental hellness. Many of you know the drill, you put on ‘the face', show up to work, smile and get through it. Perhaps not the healthiest thing to do, but it's what I was used to doing at the time.” 

“Then a song came on through my headphones one morning on a random shuffle playlist. ‘Only' from Jelly Roll. The lyrics rocked me. Hard core. The words moved me so much that I reached out to Jelly. I said you don't know me and I don't know you, but this song of yours is helping me through some stuff I'm dealing with. I just called to say thank you brother. Our bond was born.”

The June 30 post included a video about Jelly Roll and The Rock's bond. After Jelly Roll emerged from his trailer, the two embraced for a long time, telling each other how much they loved each other. 

“Jelly Roll and I have been buddies for almost 10 years — texting, showing love, support, always there for each other, whatever you need, I got you,” Johnson said. “We'd never met. So yesterday at ‘American Idol' was the first time we ever met and it was very special.” 

Among the things they've bonded over is growing up in Nashville without stable families, as well as Jelly Roll's recent health journey. When the two say each other, he told Johnson that he had lost 200 pounds and was prepared to lose another 100.  

In November, Johnson posted on Instagram Jelly Roll's health journey. It included a clip of Johnson on “The Kelly Clarkson Show” reading lyrics from “Only” and why Jelly Roll's song meant so much to him, and well as clips of Jelly Roll's progress losing weight. 

He wrote, “Always believed in you brother☝🏾 your music & friendship helped me thru a very hard time in my life when I was struggling to find a way. Keep kicking ass, shaking cities and moving crowds ~ with gratitude and a smile 🥃🖤”

	Dan Rys



Chart-topping R&B/soul singer Tems is launching a new program called The Leading Vibe Initiative in an effort to support young women who want to learn and get involved with the music business, Billboard can announce Wednesday (July 2). 


	The singer, songwriter and entrepreneur from Lagos, Nigeria, is planning a two-day seminar for between 15 and 20 women in Lagos “to provide opportunities for participants to hone their craft, sharpen industry knowledge, and build community,” according to a press release.


	The program, which will be held Aug. 8 and 9, will bring together participants with industry executives and creatives for meet and greets, training sessions on songwriting and music production, studio sessions, panel discussions, and tutorials on different aspects of the music business; participants will also receive production software and other resources, the release states. The mentors and speakers who will be part of the program will be announced at a later date. The program is intended to expand beyond Lagos to additional cities in Africa in the future.

	Applicants can apply here by the July 13 deadline.


	“My goal with the Leading Vibe Initiative is to help discover and support talented young women who have the potential to redefine the industry,” Tems said in a statement. “By providing access, tools and opportunity, we're creating space for them to find their voices, step into their power and shape the future of music across the continent and globally.”


	Tems is one of the most successful artists of her generation, with her mix of R&B, soul, Afrobeats, alté and more producing a singular sound that is distinct from many others in the crossover wave of African artists in the past half-decade. She's racked up two Grammys — the first Nigerian artist with two — as well as two top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including one No. 1, and 10 top 10 Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs top 10s, including two No. 1s. She also has an ownership stake in the MLS franchise San Diego FC.


	As part of this initiative, Tems has also partnered with Native Instruments, which will be providing technology and support for the program, according to a rep for the company. Tems has also joined the Native Instruments artist board, a collective that also includes Alicia Keys, Noah “40” Shebib, Jacob Collier and Ludwig Goransson, among others.

	Scenes of “law enforcement” that look like lawlessness are unfolding, daily, on the streets of America. 


	Masked agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies jump out of unmarked cars. They wear masks and are often irregularly uniformed, in a slapdash assemblage of jeans and security vests. Some may have labels reading POLICE. Some may have badges. Others dress in t-shirts and baseball caps. They often refuse to identify themselves or produce warrants. 


	These squads are snatching individuals off the streets, and out of federal courthouses, and wrestling them into vehicles to be spirited away in a spectacle that even a U.S. senator has likened to “being kidnapped.”


	This anarchic authoritarianism is playing out in isolated pockets, for now. But if the budget reconciliation legislation known as President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” becomes law, the horror will spread nationwide. 


	“This bill is a force multiplier for ICE,” Nayna Gupta, Policy Director of the pro-immigrant American Immigration Council tells Rolling Stone. “It allows them to hire 10,000 more agents around the country,” she says, “while simultaneously deputizing state and local police departments to do things like interrogate, arrest, detain and deport immigrants.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Senate's version of the bill steers an astonishing $130 billion into immigration enforcement, detention, and border security, according to the American Immigration Council's tally, which includes funding for Trump's border wall. In the buildup to passage in the Senate, this funding became the central MAGA sales pitch. “Everything else” — including the bill's staggering cuts to the social safety net — “is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions,” Vice President J.D. Vance posted on X Monday night,  Vance's post preceded, by hours, his casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.

	











	Stephen Miller, Trump's nativist policy chief, touts the Big Beautiful Bill for the same reason Gupta blasts it: “The BBB will increase by orders of magnitude the scope, scale and speed of removing illegal and criminal aliens,” Miller posted on X in June, branding the bill, with a chauvinistic flourish, “the most essential piece of legislation… in the entire Western World, in generations.”

	Building the case for the bill, Trump's so-called Border Czar, Tom Homan, appeared last week at a conference in Washington D.C. held by the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a right-wing organization led by the scandal-tainted evangelical power broker Ralph Reed. Homan got raucous cheers from the Christian audience for a profanity-laced speech, in which he touted the administration's agenda to arrest and remove the strangers among us. “If I offend anybody today,” Homan said, “I don't give a shit.”


	In his speech, Homan advanced a version of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. He baselessly alleged that Democrats under Joe Biden “unsecured the border on purpose” to build a new political power base of immigrants. “They knew exactly what they're doing,” Homan said. “They saw future political benefit on doing it. They thought millions of people coming into the country are going to be future Democratic voters.” Homan continued: “They sold this country out for future political power. And to me, that's treasonous.”


	Homan talked up congressional passage of the Big Beautiful Bill as a countermeasure: “They pass that bill, we're gonna have more money than we ever had to do immigration enforcement,” he said, adding gruffly: “You think we're arresting people now? You wait till we get the funding to do what we got to do.” (Homan's comments were first highlighted by Right Wing Watch.)

	The Big Beautiful Bill will swell the ranks of ICE agents. The Senate bill earmarks about $30 billion for recruiting and retention; the House version specifies the hiring of nearly 10,000 new agents, or “boots on the ground,” as Homan described them, militaristically. The bill also has more than $45 billion to ramp up detention facilities and detainee transportation — to turn the Trump deportation machine into what acting ICE director Todd Lyons envisions as an Amazon-like logistics operation: “Like Prime, but with human beings.” 


	Gupta, the immigrant-rights policy advocate, tells Rolling Stone: “The dollar numbers that we're seeing here will have the effect of creating an immigration detention system as large, or larger, than the U.S. federal prison system.” She adds that the law would create an “enforcement regime that militarizes American communities in a much more extreme way than what we've already seen in the first six months of the Trump administration.”

	











	Homan, in his speech, pointed to current ICE detention capacity as limiting arrests, with the administration playing a constant “chess game” to clear out enough beds to then jail more migrants. “We need 100,000 beds. So I can fill 100,000 beds,” Homan said. “We should be coming to work every day saying, Get everybody you can get. And we got the bed waitin'.”


	Homan's current “game” has deadly consequences for detainees held in crowded conditions: “We've already seen 10 deaths in immigration facilities in just five months,” says Gupta, citing reports of “horrific conditions inside the facilities, including starvation, lack of gynecological care for women, [and] delayed insulin treatment for diabetic patients.” In a press availability Monday, Homan responded with indifference to the report of the recent in-custody death of a 75-year-old Cuban immigrant who'd first arrived in the United States in 1966: “People die in ICE custody,” Homan said. “People die in county jails. People die in state prisons.”


	Speaking to the religious audience in D.C., the border czar insisted that President Trump's orders to target “the worst first” is still in effect. But he made clear that anyone without legal status should live in fear of what's coming. “The media has been hitting me up lately saying, Homan is lying. They're not arresting just criminals and public safety threats. They're arresting non-criminals. What they're afraid to tell you is: Yeah, they're in a country illegally. So they're on the table too.”The Big Beautiful Bill also provides, Gupta says, $10 billion in funding to deputize local law enforcement into the detention and deportation ranks — a move that seems destined to exacerbate the rag-tag optics of armed men wearing face gaiters jumping out of cars and tackling alleged undocumented immigrants.In a recent TV interview, ICE's Lyons said he would prefer that officers not mask, because it is “hot” and “dangerous.” But he justified the practice, because “ICE agents are being doxed at a horrible rate.” Doxing refers to making personal details public. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about Lyons' definition of doxing, in what circumstances it is a crime (there is a narrow federal anti-doxing provision), or what horrific metric Lyons was referring to. 


	However DHS makes no apologies for the fact that “undercover” federal officers on immigration duty look like irregular combatants. “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rolling Stone.


	In a separate statement, DHS maintained that its agents always “verbally identify themselves as with ICE or Homeland Security,” that they “wear vests that say ICE/ERO or Homeland Security,” and that they're “flanked by vehicles that also say the name of the department.” Such claims are contradicted by viral videos and Senate hearings. 


	Consider the case of Brad Lander, the New York City mayoral candidate who was tackled and detained after trying to accompany a New Yorker through the hallway of a federal court courthouse after an immigration proceeding. One of the apparent under-cover agents who nabbed Lander wore jeans and a shirt branded “Rogue” — from a clothing company whose motto is: “We do not come in peace.”In a recent Senate hearing Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi on the dangers of masked ICE agents who do “not follow required protocol to identify themselves as law enforcement.” Peters told Bondi he was “deeply concerned” about the “lack of identification” by federal agents, calling it “dangerous both to the public as well as to the officers themselves.” He told Bondi that “the public risks being harmed by individuals pretending to be immigration enforcement which has already happened.” He added that federal agents “also risk being injured by individuals who think they're basically being kidnapped or attacked by some unknown assailant.”

	











	In the face of this questioning, the attorney general struck a pose of ignorance. “Senator Peters, that's the first time that issue has come to me.” But Bondi countered that agents “are being doxed,” adding: “They're being threatened; their families are being threatened.”


	In his speech to Faith & Freedom, Homan talked up how the feds are arresting those who challenge ICE and its irregular operations — making plain that legal peril awaits any would-be Good Samaritan who misapprehends an authorized ICE arrest as violent crime: “You can't impede our enforcement efforts. That's a felony, and we will prosecute,” Homan said. “You cannot put your hands on an ICE officer. We're prosecuting two judges. We're prosecuting a member of Congress,” he bragged. “You can't cross the line.”


	ICE's current director, Lyons has blamed the city of Portland, Oregon, for the agency's masking imperative, telling an interviewer: “We had ICE officers' names, addresses, and family Instagrams [and] Facebook posted and spread all around the city of Portland, saying ‘No Rest For Ice.'”It will not come as any surprise that ICE agents are not celebrated in the biggest, bluest city in Oregon, a sanctuary state, where law enforcement is largely prohibited from participating in immigration enforcement. Portland has been ground zero for confrontations between protesters and the feds in recent years. Trump pioneered a militarized crackdown on protesters in Portland in 2020, when citizens were snatched off the sidewalk into unmarked cars, and feds shot chemical munitions and less-lethal projectiles against people protesting police violence.Though they have not matched the intensity of the conflict in Los Angeles, where Trump federalized the National Guard and deployed the Marines, anti-ICE protests here have been smoldering here for weeks.


	The ICE facility in Portland is catty corner to the city's main Tesla dealership — itself the target of incessant protests in recent weeks. The ICE building resembles a minimum security prison, and it occupies an odd-angled city block hemmed in by a freeway and overgrown trolley tracks. The three-story taupe concrete structure is currently up-armored in plywood, its windows and doors covered to the second floor. 


	The building is also splashed with graffiti ranging from Zen-like scolding — “LOOK INWARD” — to the bloodthirsty — “Kill KKKops.” Many of the messages equate ICE with the “Gestapo.” One grafito reads: “NAZI CUCKS.” Across the street from the gates of the main driveway, a small group of protesters is gathered by a folding table and a sun tent. Some are yelling “Fuck ICE!”  They have a sign for passing motorists reading: “YOU'RE NOT SAFE, YOU'RE NEXT.”


The air on a recent weekday afternoon is spicy with the scent of exploded pepper balls and “green gas,” a crowd-control chemical, deployed against protesters the previous night when federal agents in riot gear emerged to confront a woman, whom DHS's McLaughlin alleges “threatened officers with a large knife by swinging it and then throwing it at them.” (The woman has been charged with attempted assault of a federal officer.)

	











	A 47-year-old protester who identified herself only as Jezzy told Rolling Stone that she'd been coming to the “nonviolent encampment” most nights since the “No Kings” rallies against Trump in mid-June, along with her “Latina Aztec daughter,” who's 18. Jezzy says she left before the violent clash the previous night, but added that showdowns between protesters and the feds were commonplace.

	“I don't know how many times we've been smoke bombed,” Jezzy says. “We got gassed very badly our first night.” After dark, as Jezzy describes it, feds in riot gear often emerge from the gate and fire pepper balls against protesters. She accuses them of “ripping up protester signs.” 


	She describes these federal agents as “very, very angry” and “abusive of all the fucking rights anybody has as a human — or as an American.” Despite a personal toll, Jezzy insists she's committed to showing up to defend community members at risk from Trump and his faceless forces. She describes her new daily ritual: “I work. I protest. I do it all over again.”

[Editor's note: The recap of episode eight publishes July 3. This recap contains spoilers.]    

The Berzattos are a lot. That's just a fact. But despite all their faults, their messiness, and the ways they project their trauma outward, people are drawn into their event horizon like flies to mānuka honey. There's Richie, Jimmy, and the Faks, of course, all whirlwinds in their own right. But there are also the calm, composed folks—Tiff, Claire, Sydney, Stevie, Lee—who can't help but be drawn in. As Stevie tells Frank, “It's really fun. Genuinely.”

This extra-long episode sees the whole Bear clan come together. Despite their reservations, Richie, Carmy, and Natalie have all turned out for Tiff and Frank's wedding, forcing themselves to face their various ghosts. Sydney is also there in her capacity as Richie's emotional support plus one (plus Marcus and Chester, who apparently slept with Frank's mom?! Man, is Chicago a small town.) 

This season, the show seems determined to prove that it still deserves a place in the comedy category at the Emmys, and “Bears” makes a solid argument. It's a classic entry into the wedding-episode canon, complete with reunited exes, estranged relatives, and dishy revelations. It also represents a pivotal moment for our big three characters: Carmy exorcising his demons, Sydney's priorities coming into focus, and Richie realizing he's not as alone as he thinks.

Carm is even more on edge than usual, because he's about to see his mom for the first time since she drove through her own wall. Nat has strapped on her armor for her dreaded reunion with Francie Fak. And Richie is determined to make nice with Frank. 

Sugar and Francie—played by Oscar winner Brie Larson!—start shouting over each other within seconds, stomping their heels on the floor like angry horses. We've been waiting for literal years to find out what caused the rift between these two ex-BFFs, and the answer is juicy as hell: They hooked up! Pete is just as surprised as we are, if significantly less delighted.

Michelle (Sarah Paulson) is the first to run into Donna, and you can instantly see her hackles rise. She shelters with Tiff in the bedroom, getting her ready for the mess downstairs. It's a quiet, intimate scene between two excellent actors as Tiff talks about her complicated feelings about her mom not coming to the wedding. 

Downstairs, Michelle's partner, Stevie (John Mulaney), is giving Frank the lowdown on what to expect from the Bears. He and fellow honorary Berzatto Claire try their best not to scare Frank too much: “It's a lot of people with very specific and unique personalities that feel things very strongly.” Best of luck to the groom!

Carmy's spidey sense kicks in before he's even laid eyes on Donna, snapping him into a signature trauma-flashback montage. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance is achingly specific as always. From the way Deedee looks at her son, you can see how hard she's working to hold herself back. They're both as nervous as two teens on a first date, stuttering half-sentences and inanities about Tiff and Sophie and how many people are here. 

As far as I'm concerned, Richie coming to Carmy's rescue is proof positive that he's finally forgiven his cousin for the refrigerator incident. He and Sydney give Bear an out with a fake story about how he's needed in the kitchen and take over the conversation with Donna. But when Frank pulls Richie away, Syd is left all alone with the monster in Carm's closet. 

Sweet, innocent Frank needs help coaxing Evie out from under a table, where she's hiding out in protest of their planned stepfather-stepdaughter dance. It costs Richie more than Frank knows to bargain on his behalf, but he does it anyway because he's a really decent guy. He's also encouraged by the golden-boy groom's insecurity about being a good dad—an issue that's never been in question for Richie.

Carmy is hiding out in the kitchen chomping on Nicorette when he runs into the last person he expected—or wanted—to see: Uncle Lee (Bob Odenkirk), who is probably Donna's boyfriend even though he swears their relationship is purely platonic. Carm opens up to him in ways we've never seen before. It's a lot easier to confess your darkest secrets to someone you don't give a shit about. 

Lee has mellowed since we last saw him in “Fishes,” approaching Carm like a fellow adult whose choices he respects. Bear is shocked when Lee says he clocked his brief appearance at Mikey's funeral—and even more shocked that he didn't tell anyone. Carmy didn't stay because he didn't think he deserved to—not after skipping town even though he knew how bad things were. “That's stupid,” Lee says.

While Carm was off rising up through the fine-dining ranks, Lee became close with Mikey. And he talked about his little bro a lot—how proud he was of Bear, out there working at the best restaurants in the world, wrapping fish in potatoes. It's a truth that's harder for Carmy to hear than if Mikey had hated him for leaving. Lee also says Bear is more like his sensitive, intense mother than he knows. And like him, she's starting to open herself to the world and identify the ways she needs to change.

Back in the reception room, Sydney is genuinely enjoying Donna's company. They bond over how much they both were drawn to the frenzy of The Beef. It's loud, sure, but Syd likes the noise. Deedee asks what it's like to work with Carm, and Sydney remembers why she was so drawn to her talented, hardworking partner in the first place. She talks about the time visited Chef David's restaurant in New York so she could taste a Carmy Berzatto masterpiece. “You guys are very close,” Deedee says, and Sydney realizes that, despite the tension between them, it's true. He's family. With the same grace she showed when she left Natalie and Pete to gush over their newborn, Donna makes her exit so her son can stop cowering in fear. 

Meanwhile, Frank, Richie, and Claire join Evie under the table for a mini-summit—followed by a curious Carmy. A wonderful farce unfolds as more Bears join. To make Evie feel better about being scared of dancing, each member of the extended fam shares their biggest fears, ranging from heights and big dogs to the singularity and the gradual collapse of the planet. (Chester, hilariously, hates spiders but also loves them?) Carm has trouble formulating his answer. “What's the opposite of chaos?” he asks. “Peace,” Claire tells him. He chickens out and says math instead, but that bell can't be unrung.

Evie lights up as she watches her family grow bigger and bigger. She's getting the loving, supportive childhood the damaged adults around her never got to experience. It's the exact inverse of Christmas at Donna's and not just because they're gathered under a table instead of around one. This is a brood that becomes a little kinder with every person they invite into their ranks.

The Bears return to the party with hearts and souls refreshed, ready to become their better selves—or at least to try. Sug and Francie, no longer able to deny how much they've missed each other, finally bury the hatchet, with the provision that neither can fuck the other over. (Nat tells Pete there aren't any romantic vibes between them anymore, but I'm not convinced.) 

Meanwhile, Richie realizes that his jealousy toward Frank has been misplaced. Helping Evie to trust her stepdad doesn't mean he's replacing Richie; it just means he's made his daughter's support system even stronger. Lately, he's been feeling isolated, thinking of himself as a lone boulder in that Zen garden in Kyoto. But he's finally figured it out: He's not one of the rocks; he's the sand dividing the gulfs between them.

Sydney gets a text from Shapiro because she's been ghosting him yet again. We don't see her response, but we know what side she came down on when Richie asks what decision she's been nervous about. “You make the right one?” “I think there was only one. Y'know?”

At the edge of the party, Claire is seeing Carmy with fresh eyes. He's trying to participate in the project of being human, ready to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known. As she asked him to recently, he opens up to her about the big stuff: When he got the call about Mikey's suicide, he didn't accidentally scorch his hand on a pot; he pressed it to a burner. “I'm trying to tell people things,” he says, which Claire knows is terrifying for him. He counters that it's not scary when the person he's telling is her. When they step out onto the dancefloor, turning slowly to Emmylou Harris' “Tougher Than The Rest,” they press their foreheads together like they've finally come home.

Tiff offers Jimmy her own painful truth: He and the rest of the Berzattos mean everything to her. They took her in with open arms when her own family left her in the dust, and she was so afraid she'd lose them when she divorced Richie. Jimmy holds her close and promises that, for better or worse, she's a Bear forever.

After he gets home from the wedding, Richie pops open a solitary beer like he does every night. But then Teddy texts him a picture of their whole crazy family, sardined together under the table and grinning like idiots, and remembers that he has plenty of rocks to lean on.

"The response to 'Prens' just shows how strong the demand for high-quality, locally produced originals is and highlights Max as the home of this type of content," says top executive Deniz Şaşmaz Oflaz.

	And the best-performing local original production, or LOP, for Warner Bros. Discovery‘s Max, soon-to-be-rebranded as HBO Max, globally is … drum roll, please … Turkish satire series The Prince (Prens).


	On Friday, the final episode of the third season of the hit series became available and seems to have helped seal the deal, according to company data. 




	Starring Giray Altınok as the Prince, the show is “set in the imaginary kingdom of Bongomia and follows the comedic adventures of the prince, a very unpopular member of the kingdom whose own family didn't even bother to give him a name,” according to a synopsis.

	Over the past month, the Turkish Max original achieved “the highest level of engagement of any Max local original production globally,” with 74 percent of subscribers in the country tuning in to it, according to WBD.


	Over the same period, The Prince proved to be a key driver for new subscribers, becoming “the first show that almost three in four (73 percent) of new Max users watched — the highest nominal acquisition volume for a local original production” in a country in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, company data shows.


	During its finale week, season three of The Prince accounted for 72 percent of all viewing on Max in Türkiye, WBD said, adding: “The final episode (season three episode eight), released just three days ago, became the most viewed episode of the week with 54 percent of total viewers already having watched the finale.”


WBD's transition of its streaming service BluTV to Max in Turkey became official in mid-April as the Hollywood giant underlined its “commitment to increasing its investment in local content” and “bringing a compelling slate of new local stories” to its streamer in the country.

	











	“The response to Prens just shows how strong the demand for high-quality, locally produced originals is and highlights Max as the home of this type of content,” Deniz Şaşmaz Oflaz, vp of local original productions, local channels and streaming operations lead for Türkiye, tells THR. “As one of our first original series since launching the platform direct-to-consumer in Türkiye earlier this year, it's exciting to see Prens playing a key role in attracting new viewers to the platform.”


	In a recent THR interview, she described the series this way: “It looks like a comedy, but it's more of a dramedy. … The lead character is the prince, who doesn't want to be on the throne and is not really that smart. And then we see all these typical things happening in this kingdom that we've been seeing in such series as Game of Thrones. So it's a satire.”

"The British media in a frenzy about Bob Vylan and Kneecap but artists all weekend at Glastonbury from pop to rock to rap to punk to DJs spoke up onstage," the band wrote.

Amyl & The Sniffers have issued a pointed statement of solidarity with Bob Vylan and Kneecap in the wake of growing media backlash surrounding the artists' pro-Palestinian messages at Glastonbury 2025, accusing the press of misrepresenting what they say was a festival-wide stance.

	Posting to Instagram Stories on Monday (July 1), the Australian punk rock band criticized the British media's “frenzy” over select sets that included political speech, specifically targeting how coverage framed Bob Vylan and Kneecap as outliers.

	“The British media in a frenzy about Bob Vylan and Kneecap but artists all weekend at Glastonbury from pop to rock to rap to punk to DJs spoke up onstage and there were toned of flags on every streamed set,” the band wrote. “Trying to make it look like just a couple of isolated incidents and a couple of ‘bad bands' so it appears the public isn't as anti-genocide as it is, and trying to make it look like Bob and Kneecap are one-offs, instead of that the status quo has shifted majorly and that people are concerned and desperate for our governments to listen.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	They continued: “And if you don't want politics in music don't blame the musicians, blame the politicians and journalists, and the political landscape in general, for not doing their job, and there'll be more and more of [this] until it stops.”

	











	The statement follows Bob Vylan's controversial performance at Glastonbury, during which the punk-rap duo led chants condemning the Israeli Defense Forces. The BBC later confirmed it “should have pulled” the livestream and did not re-air the performance. Irish rap group Kneecap, who followed Vylan on the West Holts stage, waved Palestinian flags and made their own statements during their set.


	Amyl & The Sniffers — who also performed at the festival — delivered a politically charged set of their own. During a passionate moment onstage, frontwoman Amy Taylor used the platform to discuss colonization, Australia's treatment of Indigenous people, and the importance of political expression. “They want us to shut the f–k up,” Taylor said to the crowd. “Because if we think about Palestine, then back home in Australia, we think about the Indigenous people there… and that's disgusting.”


	Their comments were met with roaring applause, and clips of the speech circulated widely online — though notably, they did not attract the same level of media criticism as Bob Vylan or Kneecap.


	Glastonbury 2025 saw a significant wave of political statements from artists across genres, with Palestinian flags visible at nearly every major stage. Acts from the pop, punk, indie, and dance scenes voiced solidarity, many calling out what they see as governmental inaction and media silence on the ongoing conflict in Gaza.


	Amyl & The Sniffers' statement adds to the growing chorus of artists using their platforms to speak out, echoing a shift in live music where festival stages have increasingly become vehicles for protest and visibility. The band's message is clear: they stand behind artists who speak up — and won't back down from the fight for accountability and awareness.

Uma Thurman and Henry Golding join the returning cast in this follow-up to 2020's adaptation of the graphic novel series about immortal soldiers battling to protect humanity.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	A welcome surprise after months of COVID lockdown and upended release schedules, The Old Guard came along in 2020 to demonstrate that hard-charging action and emotionally textured drama need not be mutually exclusive. Its well-developed lead characters could handle themselves with MMA fight moves, knives, swords and Bronze Age axes. But they also had soulful interiority, their immortality sentencing them to existences of aching solitude and loss. Arriving five years later, Netflix's sequel has most of those elements, but it's missing the secret sauce — Gina Prince-Bythewood's commanding direction.

Charlize Theron and KiKi Layne return as, respectively, the ancient — though still gorgeous, toned and nimble — warrior and the powerful fledgling immortal, along with a solid supporting cast that includes Marwan Kenzari and Luca Marinelli as Joe and Nicky, the gay couple whose relationship spans centuries. Joe's unabashed declaration of love and the passionate kiss they shared in the back of a truck full of macho armored thugs in the first movie was a gift to queer audiences starved for representation in superhero cinema.

The Bottom Line

	
	Gets the job done but stints on the excitement.
	



Release date: Wednesday, July 2Cast: Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Veronica Van, Henry Golding, Uma Thurman, Chiwetel EjioforDirector: Victoria MahoneyScreenwriters: Greg Rucka, Sarah L. Walker

									Rated R,
								1 hour 45 minutes			






	Again adapted by Greg Rucka from the graphic novel series he authored with illustrator Leandro Fernandez, this time working with co-writer Sarah L. Walker, the sequel obviously can't repeat the novelty of its predecessor. But the first film worked not just thanks to the dimensionality of the characters and the charismatic cast. It was also very much about the muscularity Prince-Bythewood brought to the physical action and the corresponding depth she instilled in the emotional beats.

	











Victoria Mahoney, who has directed extensively on episodic television as well as second unit on Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, does a polished job and maintains a confident pace. But the sequel ultimately is more competent than thrilling, and its moments of pathos too seldom resonate.


	The last film ended with Andy (Theron) mysteriously losing her immortality; fellow soldier Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) exiled for 100 years because of a betrayal; and CIA agent Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) switching sides, pledging to use his expertise to cover the group's tracks and steer them to wherever their services were needed. A coda six months later showed Booker drowning his sorrows in Paris, coming home to find Quynh (Veronica Van) in his apartment.


	That immortal was the beloved companion of Andy, way back when it was just the two of them, though the sequel again declines to address the implication that they were lovers. (Why the coyness? Did Netflix think two queer couples were too many?)


	Quynh was condemned for witchcraft 500 years earlier and buried alive at sea in an iron casket wrapped in chains. Her ability, like her fellow immortals, to regenerate every time she dies means she has been coming back to life and drowning again for five centuries. That gave Quynh ample time to feed her hatred for humanity and her rage at Andy, who had promised to be by her side until the end. She's fished out of the ocean and revealed gasping for breath in a brief prologue.

	











	The movie proper gets off to a promising start with its most exhilarating action set-piece, unfolding at a magnificent villa on the Croatian coast where a large arms deal is taking place. (In reality, it's a gorgeous piece of real-estate porn on Lake Como; the production was mostly shot in Italy.) While Nile (Layne) observes from a boat and Joe and Nicky distract some of the guards by speeding off in two vintage sportscars parked outside, Andy and Copley enter the mansion, where she conveniently finds a hefty sword hanging on the wall.


	Mahoney, cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, fight choreographer Georgi Manchev and the cast and stunt crew are all working at the top of their game here, with beatdown after beatdown, intercut with a pulse-racing car chase as Joe and Nicky are pursued by guards. The bravura sequence gets a fresh jolt when Nile abandons her lookout vessel and makes a spectacular entrance.


	Unfortunately, while there are plenty of kickass fight scenes to come, the sequel never quite regains the opening's explosive energy. But nor is it ever dull, meaning fans of the first movie will want to stay the course.


	When the protagonists regroup back at their safe house, Copley informs them that the dead man they believed to be the arms buyer was in fact just a conduit for an unidentified woman, seen in a CCTV photo awaiting facial recognition results. But Nile recognizes her from a dream in a library full of ancient tomes.


	That library is the result of many lifetimes of work by Andy's old friend Tuah (Henry Golding), who dropped out of soldiering to devote himself to documenting the immortals' place in history — the cause and effect of their exploits that Copley traced.

	











	Tuah reveals that several volumes of his work were stolen by a woman of many names, now going by Discord (Uma Thurman), an immortal whose existence predates even Andy's. They learn that Discord has spent five centuries living in the shadows, amassing untold wealth and power. She is now going after an even greater prize, using Quynh to get to Andy and Co.


	Rucka and Walker's script deftly fills in the blanks about the specific way an immortal can become mortal, which provides answers for Andy, as well as the revelation that the surrendered power can be bestowed on another. 


	That leads to affecting developments once the disillusioned Booker is accepted back into the fold. Andy's brooding nature gets fresh fuel with the vengeful Quynh's re-emergence, but with Nile now more accepting of her mentorship, the rapport between those two women acquires a new warmth and humor. “I'm mortal, but I'm not retired,” Andy deadpans when Nile shows concern about her state of mind.


	There's an electrifying fight scene, freighted with emotional baggage and guilt, after Andy tracks Quynh down in Rome and they duke it out in an alley with lots of fancy footwork. While there's no shortage of guns, knives and assorted other blades used in the clashes, the emphasis on physicality, on body against body, is a strength shared by both movies. Ditto the fact that, mortal or immortal, the characters feel the pain of their injuries.


	The hangout scenes once again are pleasurable, even if Kenzari and Marinelli are underutilized aside from their daredevilry in the early car chase. Nothing comes close to the swoony magic of their big moment in the first film, though it's sweet to watch them stagger off to bed together, with Joe playfully berating Nicky over his snoring when he's been drinking. But an intimate scene that appears to be building toward a kiss instead ends with them nuzzling foreheads. Boo! 

	











	Still, the fact that these two have been spared much of the loneliness and sorrow suffered by their comrades because they have always had each other provides a tender note of queer affirmation.


	The climactic stretch, while it folds in some moving moments for Andy, becomes more routine once the action shifts to a Chinese-run secret nuclear facility in Indonesia, rigged with explosives. Everything points toward the inevitable smackdown between Andy and Discord — not to mention between Theron, whose fight skills have been on display not just in The Old Guard, but also in Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde, and Thurman, immortalized as Black Mamba in the Kill Bill movies. But that anticipated face-off underwhelms.


	The cliffhanger ending clearly indicates a third movie in the planning, so maybe the filmmakers are saving their big guns for a final chapter. Whatever its shortcomings, The Old Guard 2 is a better-than-average original streaming feature — well acted by a highly capable cast, peppered with enough action to satisfy most appetites, and underscored with a melancholy vein of introspection about the conflicted roles of superheroes.

The president sued over an interview with Harris on the CBS News segment that he said was deceptively edited to her advantage.



		By Alex Weprin, Winston Cho 

	July 1, 2025 10:26pm	




	In a widely expected but still stunning decision, Paramount Global has agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Trump, who sued over an October interview that 60 Minutes conducted with Kamala Harris.


	Under the deal, announced Tuesday evening, the money will go to Trump's presidential library. It involves an agreement from Paramount, which will not apologize as part of the settlement, to release 60 Minutes transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates after they've aired, according to a statement from the company.

	By most legal observers' thinking, the lawsuit was destined for dismissal because of industry-wide norms related to editing interviews. But the deal provides a pathway to regulatory approval of Paramount's sink-or-swim merger with Skydance. 


	At the Paramount shareholder meeting Wednesday morning, co-CEO George Cheeks addressed the settlement, telling attendees that “yes, the company has agreed in principle to settle the lawsuit, and as reported, it does not include an apology.


	“As to the why? Look, companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,” Cheeks continued. “A settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives, rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction.”

	











	In a statement, the legal team for President Trump said that “with this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit. 


	“CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle,” the statement continued. “President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again.”


	Trump's suit, filed in October, alleged that there was “deceptive doctoring” in the interview, with clips of Harris being asked a question but delivering different answers in a preview clip and the final version, as well as the inclusion of a longer section of her response to a question about the conflict in the Middle East. CBS, consistent with practices in other newsrooms, maintained that it merely edited down Harris' reply for the final broadcast, and that she was answering the same question in both cases.


	According to sources, Paramount believes that the suit posed a threat to Skydance's deal to acquire the company, which requires regulatory approval, including the transfer of FCC licenses. FCC chairman Brendan Carr has said that the 60 Minutes interview would come up in the Commission's review of the deal. The FCC has since requested the full transcript and unedited footage of the interview.


	And clearly executives believe that the settlement boosts the chances of the government greenlighting the merger, though it's always possible that the FCC still takes a close look.

	











	Inside CBS News, rumors of the settlement sparked anger and resignation, given how common it is in the news business to edit down long interviews for time constraints. On April 22, longtime 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens abruptly announced his resignation, citing an inability to “make independent decisions based on what was right” for the show. 


	“Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger,” said correspondent Scott Pelley in the first episode of the newsmagazine after Owens' exit. “The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”


	And on May 19, CBS News and Stations chief Wendy McMahon also resigned, telling staff that “the company and I do not agree on a path forward.”


	The decisions from Owens and McMahon sent shock waves throughout CBS News amid industry-wide concerns of the government's campaign against media over accusations of liberal bias. In December, ABC News settled for $16 million a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump in what was viewed as a major concession for the network.


60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl told David Remnick on The New Yorker Radio Hour that the team of correspondents is already thinking about what comes next.


	“I'm already beginning to think about mourning, grieving. But I'm holding out hope,” Stahl said. “I know there's going to be a settlement. I know there's going to be some money exchanged. I know that. And then we will hopefully still be around, turning a new page, and finding out what that new page is gonna look like.”

	











	Stahl and her colleagues have already asked CBS leadership to make Tanya Simon Owens' successor, though no formal decision has been made as of now.


	The Writers Guild of America East, which reps 60 Minutes and CBS News staffers, criticized the deal and backed the journalists at the news outlets. “This settlement is a transparent attempt to curry favors with an administration in the hopes it will allow Paramount Global and Skydance Media merger to be cleared for approval,” the WGAE stated. “Paramount's decision to capitulate to Trump threatens journalists' ability to do their job reporting on powerful public figures.”


	The arguments outlined in Trump's lawsuit, which didn't allege defamation and also named Rep. Ronny Jackson as a plaintiff, marked a new road map for the president and his legal team to chill free speech by weaponizing the courts. The complaint advanced a claim over an alleged violation of Texas' consumer protection law covering deceptive advertising grounded in the premise that the network's segment with Harris misled the public. It's a way to bypass the legal barriers to asserting defamation. He brought a similar claim in December in a lawsuit against pollster J. Ann Selzer, The Des Moines Register and Gannett, the newspaper's parent company, for “brazen election interference” over releasing a poll showing Harris leading in Iowa, which Trump won.


	CBS argued that its editorial judgments are “non-commercial speech that lies wholly outside the scope” of Texas consumer protection laws. It also said that Trump should have brought the lawsuit in a federal court in New York and not Texas, where judges are more receptive to conservative legal causes.

	











	Trump's picks at various regulatory agencies have emerged as another tool in his arsenal to steer networks away from coverage critical of him and his administration. Carr has threatened to revoke broadcast licenses for stations owned by networks that have drawn Trump's ire under the agency's authority to ensure that public airwaves operate in the public interest. It's a long shot considering there aren't any TV station licenses up for renewal until 2028 — and pulling one in the middle of a term is essentially unheard of — but long-term incentives to stay out of Trump's crosshairs by toning down adversarial coverage persist.

Following years of hype, an inescapable ad campaign, and a popcorn vessel with a detachable face, M3GAN 2.0 flopped at the box office over the weekend. While many in the industry have been playing Monday morning quarterback over why, Jason Blum called into Matt Belloni's podcast, The Town, to explain what went wrong with the movie everyone thought they wanted. It's the latest in a string of disappointments for the reliable mid-budget hitmaker, with Wolf Man, The Woman In The Yard, and Drop all disappointing before M3GAN 2.0 swooped in on a wingsuit. “If Blumhouse is in a slump, I'd like to tell that story,” Blum said. “I don't want other people to tell that story.”

Blum isn't sugarcoating it for himself. People did go to the multiplex last weekend, just not to see his movie. They'd rather see Brad Pitt show the youngsters how it's done than watch M3GAN confuse her brand. “Clearly, there is a huge audience who is excited to go to the movies,” he continued. “We can't figure out what movies they wanna go see.” Ultimately, it sounds like they tried to make all the movies they might want to see, treating M3GAN as everything other than the mean girl bot who kills people who disrespect her bestie. Blumhouse thought she “was like Superman,” and like Superman, “We could change genres, we could put her in the summer, we could make her look different, we could turn her from a bad guy into a good guy.” She had all those classic Superman traits, but Belloni concludes that audiences wanted “something the same but different.” However, after two years of memes and an antagonistic ad campaign, it felt like Blumhouse was leaning too hard into the joke with M3GAN 2.0. Deliberately camp is a difficult tone to pull off, and whereas M3GAN felt like it came out of nowhere, with M3GAN 2.0, the character became a forced meme, and nobody wants that. Still, a sequel to a massive hit bombing at the box office? It really is, as Blum puts it, “a classic Hollywood story.”

Did Marvel Studios just produce its first Arrowverse series? Yes, Ironheart is unmistakably a Marvel show—with its budget-busting digital effects and prestige sheen, it can sometimes even look like a Marvel movie—but the final three episodes of the Disney+ miniseries give the uncanny feeling they were beamed in from some parallel-Earth version of The CW. With Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) holed up at Gary's Auto with her friends and family, frantically welding together a new suit in record time, only to have her crew stand around emoting while she processes the next phase of her hero's journey, the back half of Ironheart gave off strong Flash vibes. Gary's Auto had become an ersatz S.T.A.R. Labs: a home base where emotions run high, coffee's on tap, and problems get scienced. Step aside, Team Flash; Team Ironheart is here.

This isn't shade (I happen to enjoy the Arrowverse), but the shoe fits: Like a certain nine-season DC superhero series, Ironheart races past resonance—specifically, the themes of class and marginalization it only gestured at early on—in favor of earnest emotions and a frustrating cliffhanger that left consequences for its lead to be resolved at a later date. (I forget, did Barry Allen ever learn to stop breaking the timeline?) Like The Flash, Ironheart sets up flimsy emotional stakes while occasionally indulging in superhero action but mostly features an ensemble sitting around solving problems caused by a lack of communication. That's Ironheart: dilemmas generated by keeping secrets from trustworthy people, forgiveness given because it's nicer than holding a grudge. Despite all that brimstone creeping in during the finale, the status quo of Ironheart remains uncomplicated and, sadly, uninteresting.

And yet, as we prepare to shelve this series alongside Marvel's other uneven streaming entries, its finale warps the mostly frictionless drama—distilled into astro-glide by the end—into something more spiritually gnarly. After witnessing her AI bestie N.A.T.A.L.I.E. (Lyric Ross) vanish due to magic tinkering by rookie sorcerer Zelma (Regan Aliyah), Riri seemingly trades her soul to a devil she barely understands—Mephisto, or a Kroger-brand version of him (Sacha Baron Cohen)—in exchange for bringing Natalie back. Not a new digital copy, but a living, breathing Natalie. Bad idea? Sure. But it's the kind of impulsive, guilt-driven act a young hero might make and something Ironheart established in its lead quite well. So, what's the price she'll pay? Her soul? Natalie's? After a mostly juiceless first season, this wild twist comes along and demands a second. 

But let me rewind: As episode four begins, we find Parker Robbins (Anthony Ramos), a man of many honeyed words, suddenly at a loss for them after the death of his lifelong friend, John (Manny Montana). Grief is a tight fit for someone used to wearing a billowy number; The Hood is rendered silent, but his eyes write a tome for Riri. (The title might go something like I Know It Was You.) Still, death doesn't slow the Desperito's Pizza crew. There's work to be done, and Riri is central to it. “I have plans for you,” Parker tells her. Meanwhile, Riri's Heirlum misadventure left behind more than a body: The biomesh she borrowed from Ezekiel Stane (Alden Ehrenreich) has been recovered by authorities, exposing his identity and landing him in jail under a domestic terrorism rap. (It's strange that John's body didn't send the cops to Desperito's; maybe he left his business cards at home for once?) Zeke doesn't take her visit well: “You lie, you cheat, you manipulate,” he says, Ehrenreich's eyes swimming with fury. “Even if that means hurting other people.”

Riri needs a solution to at least one of her problems, and magic seems worth exploring. Enter Zelma Stanton, daughter of Maddie (Cree Summer), who, from her perch atop her mother's Wicker Park crystal shop, transports Ronnie, Maddie, and Riri to the “Western Cortex of Neverish,” a nebulous realm where the women can investigate The Hood more freely. We learn Maddie studied at Kamar-Taj (Sorcerer Supreme University), where Zelma hopes to enroll. A more serious revelation unsettles Maddie: “You know how we say there's no bad tech, just bad people using tech? Well, there is bad magic, and it is dangerous for everyone.” This warning finally prompts Ronnie to press Riri for answers. It turns out her casual cool-mom attitude comes from envy. (In happier days, Riri would confide in Gary instead of her.) Riri, not ready to fully unpack this, hops into her suit and flies straight to another mess: Xavier (Matthew Elam), who discovers N.A.T.A.L.I.E.'s existence and is horrified by this digital image of his late sister.

As Riri's life falls apart, Zeke's gets a second lease courtesy of The Hood, who springs him from prison and pulls him into his circle. A fresh start means a new look. His shaved head “is giving store-brand Jason Statham,” according to Slug (Shea Couleé), but the transformation isn't just aesthetic: Parker upgrades Zeke into a willing biotech Frankenstein, which I don't buy even a little. Zeke's speed run to the dark side feels both convenient and underdeveloped; I wish there were a few more scenes to show the depth of his internalized anger. (No such luck—even The Hood gets short shrift in this department.) After all, didn't this bio-nerd feel weird about touching this technology two episodes ago? Now he's grafting it into his flesh?

Anyway, once Slug procures Riri's suit (N.A.T.A.L.I.E. took it after the Xavier drama—how Slug tracked it, who knows), Hood's revenge quest locks into place in “Karma is a Glitch,” and the series finally gets a jolt of action. Natalie go-go-gadgets her way out of Slug's clutches just before they can run Riri down in the street, and Riri, suited up, twists some metal. The effects of the series continue to punch above their weight. The bit where Riri pops the truck into the air while flipping Slug the bird is the kind of gonzo grace note Marvel used to excel at. The high is short-lived: Zeke swings by to tear up her suit with his new bionic abilities, though he spares her life, possibly because his heel turn won't be permanent.

Naturally, Riri's latest low point brings out the best in her friends and family. Gary's Auto comes to life, and his car, which Riri sold between Wakanda Forever and the series premiere, becomes Riri's new protective shell. (This is significant considering she built her suit to protect her family after his death.) Riri rises, powered by the Dark Dimension (courtesy of Zelma) to counter The Hood's magic—and with some new hardware to wield it. As Team Ironheart rushes to finish the new suit, Parker tightens his grip. He fires his crew after failing to ice Riri and asserts control over Zeke, who cuts a path to Parker's ultimate target: his father (Paul Calderón). We find out, too late for the scene to carry much weight, that he kicked Parker out of the house at twelve, took his inheritance, and set him on this dark path. He hands Dad a new contract. “Sign it in ink…or sign it in blood,” he commands, and Dad obeys.

We've seen what the use of The Hood has done to Parker, not just physically (those scars are looking pretty intense) but also mentally. The man has lost himself, enveloped in crimson tatters. This recklessness is mirrored by Riri, who allows Zelma to tap into forbidden magic to upgrade her armor. But Zelma warns that magic has a cost, a price Riri is only too willing to pay. Little did she realize that she'd have to pay in advance. Her first sacrifice, inconveniently, is N.A.T.A.L.I.E., erased by the suit's infusion of magic. 

Parker also feels his cost in the truncated finale, “The Past Is The Past,” where the sum of his choices leaves him feasting alone at the head of his ill-gotten empire. It all started with a handshake with a sinister-looking stranger (Sascha Baron Cohen), who, in flashback, gave Parker his cloak in exchange for… well, he puts it like this: “You won't even miss it.” As for Zeke, his reward for being a dumb-dumb is becoming a lackey, though Riri later manages a hard reset of his systems with a well-placed kick to his groin—a pulled hit, she says, “for the sake of the Stane family name.” Though Zeke complies with this reboot, he, not without affection, insists that they are “not done.” 

All that's left is Parker. It's your standard Marvel boss fight: Riri tests her new gear against The Hood's powers, though how Riri suddenly knows how to wield magic is unknown. (Maybe Zelma gave her a remedial primer during the last episode's montage?) Riri comes out on top, taking The Hood and leaving Parker a weeping mess on the floor. On her way out, however, comes a scene Marvel Zombies have been waiting for since the days of WandaVision: the introduction of Mephisto, sans his scarlet visage (presumably to save on the budget), who gives Riri the same offer he has given many over the millennia—that is, Parker, popes, and a Beatle (poor Ringo). “Tell me: What can I do for you?” the Dark One asks. 

The finale plays with our perception of time. Is Riri back in Gary's Auto, reunited with her friend, or is she just imagining what she knows she can't have? The answer comes quickly, and the moral ambiguity is both compelling and frustrating. Turns out, Riri hasn't learned the cost of taking shortcuts. She hasn't re-coded Natalie. She hasn't reckoned with her impulse to fix everything through force or magic. Despite her brilliance, she's stuck in a loop. That might be the most Marvel thing about Ironheart: not the cameos or the setup for the next story, but the feeling that growth always remains one installment away.

The powerhouse trio join forces on Streisand's new album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Barbra Streisand has dropped a behind-the-scenes video highlighting her recent collaboration with Ariana Grande and Mariah Carey on the stirring track “One Heart, One Voice.” 


	The song appears on Streisand's newly released album The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, out now via Columbia Records.

	











	Streisand took to Instagram to reflect on the collaboration's emotional core, writing, “When the idea of recording a song with Mariah and Ariana was first suggested, it felt inevitable that it would speak to female empowerment.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“The lyrics ‘we've got every right to make a choice' resonated with me. The song became a vehicle for three strong-willed women to join in voice and purpose. Thank you to both @mariahcarey and @arianagrande for lending their talent and sharing this special moment with me.”


	In the video, the legendary star reflects on the team-up, saying, “When the idea of recording a song with Mariah and Ariana was first suggested, it felt inevitable that it would address female empowerment,” Streisand shares.


	For Carey, who has often cited Streisand as a personal inspiration, the experience was both surreal and emotional. “Ever since I was a little girl, I've loved Barbra,” Carey says. “So when I got a chance to work with her on ‘One Heart, One Voice,' it was a huge honor.”

	











	Grande, who grew up idolizing both Carey and Streisand, called the moment “a dream come true.” She adds, “Barbra has, quite literally, always been a part of my life. I went to go see Barbra with my mom, and we made it into the concert DVD somehow! We've come a long way from being in the audience to collaborating on the album.”


	The soaring ballad sees all three artists trading lines and harmonizing on a message of unity, resilience, and generational strength. The release marks a major moment for fans of powerhouse vocals and pop history alike, pairing three of the most influential and technically gifted singers of the last six decades.


The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two is a follow-up to Streisand's 2014 Partners album, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and featured duets with Stevie Wonder, John Legend, and Blake Shelton. The new collection continues that legacy, featuring collaborations with Paul McCartney, Josh Groban, Hozier, Laufey, and more.


	Streisand, one of the most decorated artists in entertainment history, has notched 11 No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 and earned eight Grammy wins, along with two Oscars, five Primetime Emmys, and countless other honors. Her duet partners on the track are no strangers to accolades either: Carey holds the record for the most No. 1 singles by a solo artist in Billboard Hot 100 history (19), while Grande boasts six No. 1 Hot 100 hits and remains one of the most streamed artists globally.


	“One Heart, One Voice” marks the first time all three artists have appeared together on a single track.

As much as Christopher Nolan values the cinematic experience, his clout-hungry public does not. Still in production on his upcoming epic, The Odyssey, for Universal, Nolan and the studio produced a teaser for his $250 million movie and attached it to Universal's biggest release of the summer, Jurassic World Rebirth. Unfortunately, someone lucky enough to attend an early screening already recorded the trailer and put it on X, the everything app, where people can watch pirated videos to their heart's content.

The teaser, which we won't be linking to, is very much a tease. Running 70 seconds long, the clip opens with a voice-over saying, “Darkness. Zeus' law was smashed to pieces. I'm without a king since my master died. He knew it was an unwinnable war. And then, somehow, he won it.” It then cuts to Telemachus (Tom Holland) asking Jon Bernthal's character about his father, and Bernthal's character screams about rumors regarding the missing father as images of Odysseus in the sea and on his journey flash by. It somewhat resembles Batman Begins at times, but set to a discordant soundtrack that evokes the sound of 2001's “Encounter With Monolith.” He shouts at an unseen crowd, asking if anyone knows anything about Odysseus, and the scene closes on a shot of the wayward traveler on his raft, before reminding the audience that The Odyssey is coming out “one year from now.”

For those looking to watch it, one can head over to the modern-day 4chan, where they can see shaky, cameraphone footage from the film, amid ads for other Universal releases and random Nazis just trying to get the word out. Or, they could do what Phantom Menace hounds did with Meet Joe Black, i.e., pay to see Jurassic World Rebirth and leave after the trailer.

Swaggart had two cousins who made it big in music: rock 'n' roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis & country star Mickey Gilley.

Jimmy Swaggart, who was among the most successful televangelists in the U.S. in the 1980s, died Tuesday (July 1) at the age of 90. He died at Baton Rouge (Louisiana) General Medical Center two weeks after suffering a cardiac event on June 15, according to a statement from Megan Kelly, a family spokesperson.

	











	Over the course of his career, Swaggart wrote nearly 50 books and dozens of study guides and commentaries on the Bible.


	He also recorded numerous albums. His 1980 album Worship received a Grammy nomination for best gospel performance, traditional. Swaggart placed four albums on Billboard's Top Christian Albums chart in the mid-1980s: Living Waters (No. 12 in 1984), Jesus Just the Mention of Your Name (No. 32 in 1984), Sweet Anointing (No. 22 in 1985) and It's Beginning to Rain (No. 13 in 1986).




			Trending on Billboard		







	But Swaggart was not a fan of Christian rock music. In 1987, he co-authored Religious Rock n Roll: A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing with Robert Paul Lamb, in which he argued that the rise of the Contemporary Christian Music is as an extension of “worldly” entertainment interests.


	Jimmy Lee Swaggart was born on March 15, 1935, in Ferriday, a small town in northeastern Louisiana. Swaggart had two cousins who made it big in music: rock 'n' roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis (who was also born in Ferriday) and country music star Mickey Gilley. They were known locally as The Ferriday Three. Lewis, who was in the first class of artists inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and Gilley, who amassed 17 No. 1 hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, both died in 2022 – Gilley in May at age 86; Lewis in October at age 87.

	











	A fire-and-brimstone Pentecostal preacher, Swaggart began full-time evangelistic work in 1955. In 1960, he began recording gospel music albums and transmitting on Christian radio stations. In 1961, he was ordained by the Assemblies of God. A year later, he began his radio ministry.


	In 1971, Swaggart began transmitting a weekly, 30-minute telecast over local TV stations in Baton Rouge. Two years later, he proposed to television producers in Nashville a program including a music segment, a short sermon and time for talking about current ministry projects. Within weeks, The Jimmy Swaggart Telecast was being broadcast around the U.S.


	By 1984, Swaggart had overtaken Robert Schuller and Oral Roberts as America's top televangelist. The Jimmy Swaggart Telecast reached nearly 2 million viewers a week on 500 stations. Swaggart's monthly magazine, The Evangelist, was distributed to more than 800,000 households.


	By 1985, his ministry was reportedly bringing in approximately $120 million a year from collections, magazine sales and merchandise sales.


	A bitter rivalry among the top televangelists of the era led to ruin. Swaggart took the first swing when he accused Jim Bakker of having an affair with church secretary Jessica Hahn. On April 6, 1987, Swaggart and Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker appeared on the cover of TIME magazine with the cover line “Unholy Row: TV Preacher Jimmy Swaggart and the Besieged Bakkers.” Swaggart acknowledged that he had passed along rumors of Jim Bakker's illicit behavior to officials of the Assemblies of God, the Pentecostal denomination in which both were clergy.


	Swaggart also went after New Orleans preacher Marvin Gorman, accusing him of having multiple affairs. Gorman fought back, suing Swaggart for defamation and ultimately settling out of court for $1.8 million. Suspicious that Swaggart was an adulterer, Gorman asked his son to tail Swaggart one night. The son found Swaggart at a motel in New Orleans and took photos of the preacher checking into a room with a prostitute. On Feb. 16, 1988, Gorman handed the photos over to the Assemblies of God, which ordered Swaggart suspended for three months.

	











	Five days later, Swaggart tearfully delivered what came to be known as “I have sinned” speech on live television, an image that has become iconic.


	The national presbytery of the Assemblies of God defrocked Swaggart, removing his credentials and ministerial license. Swaggart countered by becoming an independent and non-denominational Pentecostal minister, establishing Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, based at the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge.


	A second scandal involving another prostitute three years later further diminished Swaggart's popularity. Even so, Swaggart was senior pastor of Family Worship Center until his death.


	Swaggart is survived by his wife of 73 years, Francis (whom he married when he was 17 and she was 15); a son, Donnie; three grandchildren and nine great grandchildren.

Born in 1935 in Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart first “spoke” to the Lord while waiting in line outside a movie theater. “‘Don't go in there, but give me your heart,'” Swaggart recounted the voice he heard. “‘I want to save your soul and set you apart as a chosen vessel used in my service.'” That service included a string of sex scandals, pilfering children's aid funds for his luxurious compounds, and collecting checks from the elderly. When Zoe Vance, a wealthy California widow, died, she left her fortune to Swaggart's ministry. Lawyers for the Vance family accused the preacher of “preying upon her loneliness and illness” to secure donations. According to ABC News, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries generated an estimated $142 million in revenue in 1986.

Swaggart came from humble beginnings. He first preached with an accordion outside a grocery store in Louisiana, where the young preacher realized that music brought crowds. The cousin of rock ‘n' roll innovator Jerry Lee Lewis and, later, a two-time Grammy nominee, Swaggart turned down a record deal with Sun Records, which sought an entry into the gospel business. Swaggart began cutting records himself, slowly building a media empire through radio and live performances. Swaggart was a passionate preacher able to bring that energy to the airwaves, where his influence and bank account began to grow.

In the early 1960s, he founded his radio ministry and slowly accumulated a following. By the end of the decade, he had founded the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, LA. With the '70s approaching, he began focusing on television, where his fiery sermons captivated millions. He used his power to lambast Roman Catholics (“a false religion”), Jews (“because of their rejection of Christ, they have known sorrow and heartache like no other people on the face of the Earth”), and homosexuals (“we've got to get those limp-wristed preachers out of the pulpits”). In 2004, he remarked that if a man ever looked at him “like that,” he would “kill him and tell God he died.”

Despite being the preacher who “helped engineer” fellow televangelist Jim Bakker's downfall, a tactic he had employed against other supposedly pious competitors, he was undone by his own infidelity. A year after the Bakker scandal broke, Swaggart was photographed with a sex worker, who told reporters that they didn't have sex; he took nude pictures of her. Swaggart would give a tearful apology to the viewing audience at home and those in the pews of a Family Worship Center. Three years later, he was pulled over for driving on the wrong side of the road in an unregistered Jaguar with another sex worker.

Former UK minister says platform, which will use AI to draft community notes, is ‘leaving it to bots to edit the news'

A decision by Elon Musk's X social media platform to enlist artificial intelligence chatbots to draft factchecks risks increasing the promotion of “lies and conspiracy theories”, a former UK technology minister has warned.

Damian Collins accused Musk's firm of “leaving it to bots to edit the news” after X announced on Tuesday that it would allow large language models to write community notes to clarify or correct contentious posts, before users approve them for publication. The notes have previously been written by humans.

X said using AI to write factchecking notes – which sit beneath some X posts – “advances the state of the art in improving information quality on the internet”.

Keith Coleman, the vice-president of product at X, said humans would review AI-generated notes and the note would appear only if people with a variety of viewpoints found it useful.

“We designed this pilot to be AI helping humans, with humans deciding,” he said. “We believe this can deliver both high quality and high trust. Additionally we published a paper along with the launch of our pilot, co-authored with professors and researchers from MIT, University of Washington, Harvard and Stanford laying out why this combination of AI and humans is such a promising direction.”

But Collins said the system was already open to abuse and that AI agents working on community notes could allow “the industrial manipulation of what people see and decide to trust” on the platform, which has about 600 million users.

It is the latest pushback against human factcheckers by US tech firms. Last month Google said user-created factchecks, including by professional factchecking organisations, would be deprioritised in its search results. It said such checks were “no longer providing significant additional value for users”. In January, Meta announced it was getting rid of human factcheckers in the US and would adopt its own community notes system on Instagram, Facebook and Threads.

X's research paper outlining its new factchecking system criticised professional factchecking as often slow and limited in scale and said it “lacks trust by large sections of the public”.

AI-created community notes “have the potential to be faster to produce, less effort to generate, and of high quality”, it said. Human and AI-written notes would be submitted into the same pool and X users would vote for which were most useful and should appear on the platform.

AI would draft “a neutral well-evidenced summary”, the research paper said. Trust in community notes “stems not from who drafts the notes, but from the people that evaluate them”, it said.

But Andy Dudfield, the head of AI at the UK factchecking organisation Full Fact, said: “These plans risk increasing the already significant burden on human reviewers to check even more draft notes, opening the door to a worrying and plausible situation in which notes could be drafted, reviewed, and published entirely by AI without the careful consideration that human input provides.”

Samuel Stockwell, a research associate at the Centre for Emerging Technology and Security at the Alan Turing Institute, said: “AI can help factcheckers process the huge volumes of claims flowing daily through social media, but much will depend on the quality of safeguards X puts in place against the risk that these AI ‘note writers' could hallucinate and amplify misinformation in their outputs. AI chatbots often struggle with nuance and context, but are good at confidently providing answers that sound persuasive even when untrue. That could be a dangerous combination if not effectively addressed by the platform.”

Researchers have found that people perceive human-authored community notes as significantly more trustworthy than simple misinformation flags.

An analysis of several hundred misleading posts on X in the run-up to last year's presidential election found that in three-quarters of cases, accurate community notes were not being displayed, indicating they were not being upvoted by users. These misleading posts, including claims that Democrats were importing illegal voters and the 2020 presidential election was stolen, amassed more than 2bn views, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate.

The viral 2019 Facebook event is revisited in 'Trainwreck: Storm Area 51', premiering July 29 on Netflix

 Netflix is revisiting the viral Facebook event that took the internet by storm. 


 On June 27, 2019, 21-year-old Matty Roberts created a satirical Facebook event titled "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us." Intended as a joke, the post invited users to band together and raid Area 51 — a highly classified United States Air Force facility in Nevada — to uncover extraterrestrial life, long rumored to be hidden there.


 “I had no idea what I'd started,” Roberts, now 26, says in the trailer for Trainwreck: Storm Area 51, which will premiere on July 29 as part of Netflix's six-episode Trainwreck documentary series. “It just seemed like a hilarious idea to me.”

 What began as a sarcastic question — “What if every fool on the internet converged on Area 51 what would they do? Shoot everyone?” — suddenly seemed plausible after more than 2 million people marked themselves as “going,” and another 1.5 million as “interested.”


 “We're about to storm one of the most heavily guarded military bases in the world,” a man says in the trailer, exclusively shared with People. “Why? Because the internet told us to.”


 To coincide with the event, organizers planned a music festival — Alienstock — in Rachel, Nev., the tiny town nearest to Area 51. As the date approached, law enforcement prepared for a potentially dangerous situation. The trailer includes ominous government warnings: “Anyone breaching Area 51 will be shot.” One official remarks, “It'd gotten out of hand, and it had gotten out of hand in a hurry.”

 The challenge of preparing the remote town for an influx of visitors was daunting. “Where do you host a million people in the middle of nowhere?” a man asks in the trailer. “We were building a city from nothing.” A woman adds, “We have a restaurant, camping space, and ten rooms. That's it.”


 As the event gained momentum, Roberts grew concerned. “This whole time I'm sitting here with less than a thousand dollars in my bank account,” he says, alongside videos of him being interviewed on television.


 In the end, there was no raid and no aliens — just a few thousand attendees, many in costume, celebrating a viral moment in internet history. “We are going to dress as sexy aliens,” a woman says in the trailer. “We're going out into the desert, and we're getting probed.”

For decades, people have been claiming to have been abducted by aliens. To these people, something profound has happened to them, but can we really say it is the result of extraterrestrials, or is something else going on?

For years, Steven Kilburn had felt uneasy when driving a particular stretch of road between Pikesville, Baltimore, and Frederick, Maryland. It was an uncanny feeling, not based in any solid memory; just an overwhelming sense of wrongness, like he was being watched. 

According to Steven, the feeling first started one night while driving home from the place where his college girlfriend had lived. “I don't know whether someone was watching me or I was watching something strange,” he explained. “Whatever it was that particular time, I remember I felt that something maybe had just happened to me, or was going to happen, and it was this very weird feeling.”

Whatever was going on, Steven was sure of one thing: “Every time I passed that approximate area, I felt for some reason something right there had happened.”

This sense of unease persisted for years until May 1978, when Steven was introduced to Dr Girard Franklin, a psychologist who was training in hypnosis at the time. Curious to know whether Steven's strange feelings were in fact the result of some sort of suppressed memory, Dr Franklin subjected him to hypnosis, which was increasingly used by people to access details their minds had supposedly “repressed”. What came next, however, was unexpected. 

Under hypnosis, Steven relived and narrated the events of the drive home that set this whole situation in motion. His voice was soft, almost slightly slurred as he recalled what he now “saw”. At first, the details of his drive home seemed normal, but suddenly, Steven paused, becoming hesitant. According to the events he was reliving, his car had inexplicably stopped working and he was forced to get out and investigate it on that lonely stretch of road. And then it happened: “It's on my shoulder,” Steven cried out, “...a clamp... it hurts. I can't move!”

Steven was terrified, his face streaming with tears, but he nevertheless continued explaining what he was seeing. Over the course of the next hour and a half, Steven relayed an incredible account of how, on that night years ago, he had been abducted by some unknown entities he described as being near human size, but with white skin and no hair on their heads. 

This account was recorded in Budd Hopkins' 1981 bestselling book Missing Time, which detailed various first-hand experiences from people who believed they had been abducted by aliens with no or little memory of their ordeals. The book provides various accounts from people Hopkins and colleagues interviewed on the subject of their supposed abduction experiences, most of which were gathered by way of hypnotic regression. 

So many people came forward, each with memories that appeared to have been wiped by alien influence, that Hopkins became convinced there was effectively a secret abduction plague going on. As he recalled in Missing Time:

 “An inescapable conclusion to be drawn from all these cases is that anyone could have been abducted, with no memory of it, no conscious recall even of a preliminary event like the sighting of a UFO.”    

However, is this conclusion sound? The obvious answer is probably not, but that doesn't mean something interesting wasn't occurring. Unbeknownst to Hopkins, as well as many other unidentified flying object (UFO) researchers at the time, this collective work came to show how many so-called alien abduction stories were in fact the result of created memories produced by the hypnotist/subject interaction. Or, to put it differently, rather than revealing the extent to which aliens were nabbing everyday people, Hopkins' work revealed how flexible memory can be and how false ones can be constructed. Today, this is one of the leading scientific explanations concerning alien abduction cases, but it is not the only one. 

Given the above account, you may be thinking one of three things. Firstly, that these people are mentally unwell and delusional. Secondly, they're lying. Or thirdly, that it all must be true, and therefore aliens are routinely abducting people. Of course, the final possibility is a little hard to support as doing so would also require substantial evidence in other scientific fields related to physics, biology, and so on. 

There is also no doubt that many people who claim to have encountered aliens, seen UFOs, or even been abducted have deliberately lied, either for attention, boredom, or sheer mischief. But what about those accounts made by people who are completely sincere and, more importantly, do not exhibit signs of any other psychological issues that might produce hallucinations or delusions?

This is an important and consistent point. Anyone who reads Missing Time or abduction claims made since the 1980s will be struck by how earnest many speakers are. In fact, I have received incredibly frank emails from IFLScience readers who wish to state plainly how they are not looking for attention or notoriety, but they are convinced that they have been abducted, and it was real. One individual even told me he had not believed in aliens or UFOs until his own experience. It's hard not to take someone at their word when they come across so earnest. 

This is something that struck Hopkins and many other avid alien encounter investigators over the years; people who underwent hypnosis to retrieve “lost” memories not only believed they were genuine encounters but were deeply traumatized by them. The whole phenomenon baffled Hopkins to such an extent that he became convinced he had stumbled on some sort of secret untold reality whereby countless unknowing people had no conscious memory of being abducted by aliens he believed were ultimately non-malevolent but nevertheless terrifying. 

In some cases, women who had supposedly become pregnant after an abduction – despite having no memory of the event or having had sex with anyone since then – would suddenly find they were no longer pregnant. Such strangeness was explained away as the person having been impregnated by an alien and then re-abducted before their due date, all so the visitors from outer space could collect their hybrid infants. 

It was this genuine sincerity that helped Hopkins' work become so popular. In fact, his approach even convinced Professor John E. Mack, who, during the early 1990s, was a Pulitzer Prize winner and eminent head of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. This led Mack to publish his own lengthy book on the subject of alien abduction accounts retrieved by hypnosis, which the author utterly believed were real. For Mack, alien abductions were even positive things, ultimately leading to spiritual enlightenment, and were akin to religious experiences scattered throughout history.

Anyone who's been reading to this point has likely noticed a repeated part of these stories – hypnotic regression. This tricky, sneaky technique is now largely recognized as highly controversial at best, or otherwise completely untrustworthy by mainstream scientific communities. To be sure, there's a whole history of hypnosis I couldn't do justice to here, but suffice it to say that hypnotic regression became particularly contentious in the so-called “memory wars” of the 1980s and 1990s. This was an extremely complex situation where the validity of supposedly recovered memories led to accusations of childhood sexual abuse. 

In short, under the influence of “memory recovery” techniques like hypnosis, some people became convinced they had been abused as children but had subsequently suppressed the memory. That is, until the hypnosis allowed them to “re-” discover them, often resulting in trauma and significant upset for the individuals and their families. In some cases, the recovered memories involved satanic rituals, cannibalism, and human sacrifice. And, as you can now probably guess, many such claims turned out to be the result of the hypnosis that assisted in creating and structuring these terrifying but untrue memories. To be clear, these were not lies; many people who had their memories “recovered”, like their alien-abduction counterparts, believed they were real.

Unfortunately, child abuse is a very real and far more prevalent phenomenon than many would like to believe, and so such cases should be taken seriously and investigated properly. However, in this context, the “memory wars” really demonstrated how slippery memory can be and how prone to imagination it is. 

Aside from these perspectives, there are other psychological factors that can lead some people to believe they've experienced an alien encounter more than others. Past research has demonstrated that people who measure higher for fantasy-proneness (a tendency to engage in vivid and elaborate mental worlds inside your own head), dissociativity (one's susceptibility to a sense of separation from the world around them), and absorption (the trait of becoming lost in an activity), all correlate with paranormal beliefs, experiences, and even false memories.  

Then there is the fascinating but complex subject of sleep paralysis, which has been identified as a likely source for alien abduction experiences, as well as those related to other fantastical creatures, such as witches, vampires, and demons from across the world. 

For more detail on this, especially in relation to alien abduction claims, I would thoroughly recommend reading anomalistic psychologist Chris French's new book: The Science of Weird Shit.  

When it comes to UFOs, alien encounters, and even alien abductions, Dr Robert Bartholomew is clear about one thing: “They're living folklore. They're modern myths in the making,” he told IFLScience.

Bartholomew, a medical sociologist and Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Auckland's Department of Psychological Medicine, is not alone in linking modern alien encounters with folklore traditions. Even during the heyday of alien abduction reports, folklorists identified parallels between alien encounters and fantasy /supernatural elements found in folklore. For example, in 1989, the folklorist Thomas E. Bullard wrote that “UFOs defy physical laws by making right-angle turns at high speed or disappearing in mid-flight. Short beings reminiscent of fairies appear from inside the craft. Men in Black haunt witnesses and share significant properties of traditional devils.”

Bullard went on to note that “for all the science fiction trappings, abduction reports sound like rewrites of older supernatural encounter traditions with aliens serving the functional roles of divine beings or nature spirits.”

Folklorists have identified multiple themes in abduction narratives that have been present in human storytelling and individual experiences for centuries. Aside from obviously being an encounter with some non-human beings (e.g. fairies, spirits, elves, djinn, or goblins), abductees are often taken to some otherworldly place (e.g. the fairyland, the realm of the dead, and so on). 

The person may experience lost time, which is also a phenomenon present in many folklore traditions when someone stumbles back into the real world several days later, believing they had only been gone a few hours. In many instances, the entities are ambiguous creatures, sometimes cold and distant, while other times providing wisdom or a warning. In many cases, these encounters serve as personal ordeals, causing some sort of transformation for the abductee (such as offering spiritual enlightenment or literally allowing them to develop psychic powers). 

These are just a few examples of crossovers between folk traditions and modern abduction stories. To be sure, the literature on this topic is rich. But why have these themes persisted? Some might argue that this is evidence that something really has been going on for centuries, and this continuity proves it. However, given the paucity of evidence outside of personal testaments, plus the malleability of such claims, this seems doubtful. Instead, it is likely that such narratives speak to a deeper part of human consciousness and experience, especially in today's secular society. 

“They are very exciting. They're interesting. They open the door to a different world with different laws of physics and stuff like that,” Bartholomew told IFLScience. In addition, he added, they offer people a chance to be part of something bigger.

“All you have to do to be part of one of the greatest ‘mysteries' in the world is to go outside into your backyard and look up into the sky. Maybe you just saw an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Or maybe you just saw Starlink. But which one is more alluring?”

“I think it's part of the human condition. You know, we want to believe. We want to think that there's something greater than us.”

For Bartholomew, this is one of the secrets to the power of alien abduction and encounter stories. They serve as a kind of folkloric bridge between the secular modern world and old psychological or cultural needs for something more. They re-enchant the world. In fact, ideas about aliens within wider alien-believer communities has reached a point where they have essentially become vehicles for, as Bartholomew explained, “transcendence” in a similar way to some religions. 

For instance, some people believe that aliens built the pyramids and visited Earth millennia ago, helping to kick-start civilization and shaping humanity. Such entities are effectively gods due to their unparalleled technology or their abilities to move between dimensions, and so on. One day, perhaps these aliens will share these secrets with us and so we too will become immortal. 

The same is true for stories about ghosts because, as Bartholomew said, “if ghosts are real, then they offer proof of life after death”. They offer a sliver of hope that there is something beyond our everyday mortal experience. 

At the same time, people who believe in aliens and things like cryptids – Big Foot, the Loch Ness Monster, or chupacabra – are taking part in beliefs that undermine the power of science, the darling of the secular age. To put it another way, if someone local, say a farmer who lives down the road, claims to see Big Foot, even though science says Big Foot is not real, then they have secret knowledge that limits the knowing gaze of science more generally. This opens up the possibility for more things “science” does not know, meaning it ultimately has less power. 

This latter factor represents the point where fringe ideas meet politics, where the former becomes a reason to reject trust in the latter. In this sense, some people arm themselves with these types of beliefs not just because they enrich their world and themselves with something meaningful, but because they also undermine the established order. 

In many ways, the near-contemporaneous Satanic Panic of the 1980s and early 1990s serves the same purpose: it represented an example of mass hysteria that reacted to perceived societal changes related to family structures and shifting values concerning sexuality, feminism, and secular education in America. And, like all good folktales, these stories persist, transforming and adapting with each generation.  

As such, it is probably not worth looking to the sky for evidence of extraterrestrial beings, but rather within our minds, and at, as Bartholomew explained, “what deep-seated psychological needs are being fulfilled? In other words, why do we need our monsters, why do we need our aliens, what need is being fulfilled?”

CONNECTICUT — World UFO Day 2025, celebrated on July 2, commemorates the 78th anniversary of what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers.” It started with the first widely publicized U.S. sighting of an unidentified flying object by a civilian pilot searching the Cascade Mountains of Washington for a crashed military aircraft, followed by the crash of a mysterious object near Roswell, New Mexico, on July 2, 1947.

Ever since we have known what to look for, it has been clear that Connecticut gets better than its fair share of visitors from strange planets. The National UFO Reporting Center takes thousands of reports a year from people who can't explain what they're seeing, whether a bright light, a peculiarly shaped object, or an aircraft that rapidly accelerates and decelerates just as quickly, seemingly exceeding current understanding of propulsion.

This year alone, 13 reports have been made about unusual sightings in the skies over Connecticut. 

Just last week in Hamden, a skywatcher reported "at least 6 craft" bathed in the "whitest light … changing directions and formations/colors flashing at times." The sky show lasted for 25 minutes, ending just after 4 a.m.

Two weeks ago, a couple driving northward just past the National Guard Armory "looked up and saw what I would describe as a large automobile front-end. It had red and blue lights where the headlights would be and spanning between them was an array of 4 to 6 very bright white lights. The red and blue lights were not pulsating … It was so big, I compare it to standing a few feet away from the front of a semi-truck's cab."

Shortly after 9 p.m. on May 1, Trumbull residents caught on video "something flying towards us that wasn't normal" in their backyard. The 8-second clip uploaded to NUFORC shows "six lights in a teardrop formation and a very loud noise kinda like a helicopter but sounded like waves."

We know they're there, but do they know we know they're there? Their bold, recurring shenanigans above a couple of Connecticut towns this year suggest they just might.

In January, a Norwalk resident of 57 years extended an open invitation to like-minded skywatchers to visit Couch Street any evening and see the alien parade for themselves: 

Another concerned citizen reported to NUFORC in January that they had "been seeing star like flying things" every clear night for a month, over a pond in the middle of some woods in Killingly. 

‘Summer Of The Flying Saucers'

On June 24, 1947, civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, when he saw nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at about 10,000 feet at about a nearly impossible speed for the times of 1,200 to 1,700 mph. .

It wasn't the first sighting of a UFO, but the public quickly became fascinated — and slightly terrified — after Arnold's sighting was reported worldwide. News coverage often included references to a “flying saucer,” a play on Arnold's statement that the object moved “like a saucer would if you skipped it over water.”

More reports followed during what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers,” including the Roswell incident. The Roswell Army Air Field announced in a July 8, 1947, news release that it had recovered the wreckage of a “flying disc” from W.W. “Mac” Brazel's ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell. 

The release was straightforward, noting:

“The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves County.

“The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Major Jesse A Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office.

“Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.”

The Roswell Army Air Field mentioned nothing in its press release about alien life, but people were already growing uneasy about what might be circling overhead. Brazel was among them. 

He thought the object he found on his ranch was similar to what Arnold had seen, or to the objects described in stories about flying saucers and discs, so he gathered some of the material from the wreckage, including rubber strips, tinfoil and thick paper, and deposited them with Sheriff George Wilcox, who in turn turned it over to the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Air Field.

Military Said It Was Mistaken

Within 24 hours of the original press release, the military backtracked and said a mistake had been made and the “flying disc” was in reality a crashed weather balloon.

The story was widely accepted, and the Roswell incident might have become a forgotten chapter in history if not for a 1978 conversation between physicist and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman and Marcel, by then retired, according to an account in BBC's Sky At Night Magazine.

Marcel said the weather balloon story had been a cover, the photos had been staged, weather balloon debris had been substituted for the real wreckage, and that everyone involved in the retrieval believed it to be an extraterrestrial craft. The story was corroborated by a number of other retired military personnel who had been at Roswell at the time.

Some skeptics dismissed it as a tall tale, saying Marcel and others were seeking attention or writing themselves into the story. Regardless, Roswell became embedded in pop culture books, documentaries and movies.

One story that captured the attention of conspiracy theorists was that the wreckage had been seized by the military to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial flight at Area 51 — a highly classified Air Force military installation in the Nevada desert primarily known for its role in developing and testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems. And a fake film clip purported to show “an alien autopsy” connected to Roswell.

Bowing to public pressure about the incident in the 1990s, the government launched a retrospective investigation that concluded the object that crashed was a Project Mogul weather balloon carrying top-secret equipment designed to search the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests.

A Government-Fueled Conspiracy?

2025 brings an interesting new twist to the story. 

According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal published on June 6, the government fueled the UFO conspiracy theories, especially during the Cold War, to hide its true mission at Area 51. Specifically, the Pentagon wanted to conceal the development of advanced aircraft, such as the otherworldly-looking F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, according to the report.

The disinformation campaign was uncovered by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, established by the Pentagon in 2022, to investigate UAP reports. A report last year dismissed the notion that the government covered up the existence of extraterrestrial life But, The Journal reported, “public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.”

As an investigation of the possibility of deliberate misinformation to hide secret programs continues, the government continues to take UAP and other unexplained phenomena seriously, The Associated Press reported.

THE first ever bombshell footage of the infamous "Mosul orb" UFO captured by a US spy plane in Iraq has now been released. 

The declassified video, filmed in 2016 by a US MC-12 surveillance aircraft, shows a mysterious metallic spherical object flying over the city of Mosul.  

Interestingly, the four-second footage shows the UFO flying at a constant speed without dropping altitude. 

The object appeared suddenly and moved erratically in and out of the camera's view. 

The clip was obtained by Dustin Slaughter, a leading UFO investigator, through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request - and was shown to the public by UFO podcaster Jeremy Corbell. 

It comes two years after the first still image from the video was declassified by the Pentagon. 

The image was part of a classified briefing for US officials and was later released to the public.

 It's considered part of the ongoing investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) by the US intelligence community. 

Corbell said at the time: "For the first time, we are releasing a military filmed image of a UAP over an active conflict zone,” he said.

“UAP pose a significant risk to our service men and women, and this case highlights this – and is unfortunately not unique.

“Origin, capability, operator and intent have not been determined in relation to this intelligently controlled UFO over Mosul, Iraq.

"At a minimum UAP pose a fundamental intelligence and combat identification problem that must be addressed.”

Meanwhile, another declassified UFO footage showed a similar mystery metal orb soaring above the ground - leaving US officials puzzled.

In 2023, A testimony was heard at Capitol Hill, Washington DC, as the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office revealed the shocking clips.

The videos released in the declassified cases are said to have been observed by US military drones.

The footage showed a mystery "metal orb" as it hovered and flew across open airspace.

The incidents were believed to have been recorded in the Middle East and South Asia.

Corbell has been behind a string of high-profile leaks featuring encounters between UFOs and the US military one which was played at a landmark hearing held by Congress.

FOR decades, UFOs and aliens were considered to be make belief things created by people in tinfoil hats but they are now considered a threat to national security.

Long gone are those who claim conspiracy theories are all false as many are now discussed at the highest levels of government with US officials even admitting their existence.

As more and more credible witnesses continue to come forward to tell their extraordinary stories publicly.

The 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security.

Across the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing "dead alien corpses" on display for Congress.

Researchers recently verified the legitimacy of a set of three-fingered mummies as potential evidence of "non-human" life forms.

A line-up of doctors confirmed at Mexico's Congress on Tuesday that the bodies, purportedly not of this Earth, were in fact real, once-living organisms.

The Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme.

The haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans, sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech.

Top UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity "in our backyard."

The Pentagon's UFO analysis office launched a UFO reporting service to the public after admitting to uncovering "some things" and calling the high number of suspicious activity either a foreign power or aliens.

Navy jet footage has revealed the intriguing images of a government-confirmed UFO baffling the internet.

The United States Government launched the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

He urged the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office to dedicate resources to “this enduring mystery on behalf of the American and global public”.

Corbell had previously directed 2018 documentary film Bob Lazar: Area 51 and the Flying Saucers.

It tells the story of Lazar, who claims to be a former US government physicist who worked with tech from UFOs.

It comes after a picture claiming to show a 1,000ft wide silver UFO flying over the US was released by an infamous Pentagon whistleblower.

The picture was allegedly snapped by an airline pilot in 2021 while flying 21,000ft above the Four Corners Monument - spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado.

The spooky picture shows what looks like a circular object floating above the Earth.

The UAP Disclosure Fund shared the image on X, and wrote: “Captured near Four Corners at FL20 — estimated 600 – 1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped.”

“Several speakers confirmed Department of Defense and Intelligence Community hold hundreds of similar UAP images + sensor files still classified.

“It's time for full declassification and open scientific analysis.”

But sceptics were quick to challenge the discovery - claiming the photo merely showed irrigation circles that are common in desert climates.

A man who killed his wife and two children in 1994 after his wife sought a divorce has been scheduled for execution in Florida

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A man who killed his wife and two children in 1994 after she sought a divorce is scheduled for execution in Florida under a death warrant signed Tuesday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Edward J. Zakrzewski, II, is set to die July 31 in the ninth execution scheduled for this year in the state. He pleaded guilty in 1996 to three counts of first-degree murder and received three death sentences in the killings of wife Sylvia Zakrzewski, son Edward Zakrzewski, 7, and Anna Zakrzewski, 5. 

The man beat his wife with a crowbar and machete and strangled her to death and killed the children with a machete June 9, 1994, in Okaloosa County. 

He eventually turned himself into law enforcement after the case was profiled on the television show “Unsolved Mysteries,” according to court documents.

Another man on death row, Michael Bernard Bell, 54, is set to die by lethal injection July 15 at Florida State Prison. He's convicted of killing two people outside a bar.

Thomas Lee Gudinas, 51, who was convicted of raping and killing a woman in Florida, was executed following a lethal injection at the same prison last week.

The state also executed six people in 2023 but only carried out one execution last year.

Ivanka Trump just attended Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's “the wedding of the century,” but according to one psychic, the days in Venice might be more than just a social outing.

Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, were among the 200 elite who travelled to celebrate the luxurious wedding of the Amazon founder. The party was held in a renovated Venice amphitheatre on a privately owned island in Italy and involved such celebrities as Oprah, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Orlando Bloom, as well as all of the Kardashian family.

Ivanka vowed in a salmon-pink strapless gown by Tony Ward Couture, featuring silver floral details, delicate cutouts, and a thigh-high slit. She completed the look with silver strappy heels and minimal jewellery. 

Jared kept it classic with a navy suit and black bowtie.

Psychic Athos Salomé, aka ‘Living Nostradamus', who predicted COVID-19 and Queen Elizabeth II's death, told Daily Mail, “Ivanka is not running away from the past — she's trying to buy it back with a new storyline,” adding that her Venetian weekend is “just the first chapter.”

The Brazilian clairvoyant cited a 70% chance the weekend will lead to one or two major projects for Ivanka, possibly a book, a docuseries, or a fashion venture.

“Premium publishers are looking for behind-the-scenes White House memoirs that don't exalt Trumpism, in line with the electoral climate of 2028, when the public will be hungry for ‘clean' versions of history,” he said.

“By the second half of 2026, she should announce a book with Amazon Publishing.”

Salomé also believes there's a 50% chance of a short-format docu-series on Amazon Prime Video. “The connection with Jeff Bezos isn't just for selfies,” he told Daily Mail.

“It offers direct access to Amazon Prime Video, whose catalogue has an appetite for behind-the-scenes content about public figures.”

Salomé envisions the series as “four episodes on women's philanthropy in emerging markets.” He called it “an easy product to approve” and “excellent for image cleaning.”

Ivanka's former fashion brand, which she shut down in 2018, has only a 25% chance of being revived, according to Salomé.

If she were to give it another go, he suggests it should be a “limited capsule collection with recycled fabrics and a carbon-neutral footprint, co-signed with a luxury maison.”

“It's the kind of project that the Bezos Earth Fund would love to sponsor,” he said.

Supernatural season 15 brought the long-running CW series to a somewhat divisive end; while some viewers appreciated the larger story beats, others felt they could've been executed more seamlessly. There's always the argument to be made that Supernatural should have ended in season 5, as it was intended to. But overall, there are enough highlights in its 15 seasons that this stance doesn't hold up.

And in a way, Supernatural's true ending resembles that of season 5's "Swan Song." The show's final episode, "Carry On," still kills one of the Winchesters — and leaves the other to move on without them. The penultimate episode of Supernatural, "Inherit the Earth," also features a high-stakes confrontation on par with Sam and Dean's stand-off with Lucifer. 

However, it's the Winchesters' fates at the end of Supernatural season 15 that are most notable, as they're reminiscent of their circumstances after "Swan Song." The only difference is that "Carry On" reverses their roles, and it does so in a way that feels more in line with their stories.

Supernatural season 15 flips the series' original season 5 ending, as it swaps the Winchesters' fates. In "Swan Song," Sam sacrifices himself in order to trap Lucifer back in Hell and prevent the apocalypse from happening. Dean watches as his brother condemns himself to this fate, and then he returns to Lisa and attempts to live a normal life without hunting. 

Supernatural is still immensely popular, years after its ending, and Jensen Ackles had the perfect response to a potential revival of The CW show.

This doesn't last very long, as Supernatural season 6 sees Sam returning to the world of the living and Dean resuming his usual lifestyle. And season 15 turns their original endings on their heads, with Dean losing his life on the job and Sam giving up hunting for good.

Although many find "Swan Song" more satisfying, "Carry On" makes the right call by reversing its outcome.

There's been some debate about how this outcome was handled, but it does make more sense given the brothers' previous character arcs. Although many find "Swan Song" more satisfying, "Carry On" makes the right call by flipping its outcome.

Supernatural opens with Sam Winchester getting pulled back into hunting, despite his desire to lead an ordinary life, so season 15's finale feels like the natural conclusion to his journey. It's only his father's disappearance and Jessica's death that get him wrapped up in the family business again.

Sam finally getting to live out the life he envisioned for himself is a touching outcome for his character, and it highlights his ability to move on from all his losses. It's just as emotional as sacrificing himself for the greater good of the world — perhaps even more so.

Meanwhile, Dean is the type of character that will always get drawn back to hunting, as it's been his purpose since childhood. One of the least believable elements of Supernatural's original ending is Dean never trying to bring Sam back. He's a fighter through and through, and it makes sense that he'd go out that way in the series finale. 

Although Supernatural season 15's ending is the logical conclusion for both of the Winchester brothers, I do wish that Dean's send-off was a little bit stronger. Dean doesn't perish during some high-stakes, world-altering confrontation. Instead, he's killed tracking down a vampire, which feels underwhelming and unrealistic after everything he goes through.

"Carry On" has the right idea when it comes to the Winchesters, but the way Supernatural's ending plays out leaves something to be desired.

It makes sense for Dean to go out on a hunt, but the way that job is handled is incredibly disappointing. This is one of the reasons Supernatural's series finale has gotten so much backlash. "Carry On" has the right idea when it comes to the Winchesters, but the way Supernatural's ending plays out leaves something to be desired.

I would argue that Dean didn't die from a "random vampire" but rather a random accident, because that vampire wasn't purposely aiming to put Dean on a spike.  And it speaks to the fact that since God wasn't wasn't writing their story and pulling their strings that all the randomness of life, whether it was good, bad or ugly, would define their future lives just like everyone else.

Season 15s ending sucked hard... loved the show, all through, but did not like the finale episode at all....

No, the show should have ended 10 seasons after Crowley was introduced.



That would have been the perfect ending. It would have implied that the show creator made a deal with the crossroads demon. Thing and when the 10 years was up, it's time to go.



That season finale should have cut to black at the end. And you should have heard hellhounds howling as it fades out.



How they got to that last episode would have been up to them, but that would have been the ending point of the show that made the most sense.



There's a reason you're not a show writer. 

Deans death was always going to happen but I think what disappointed me most was the way Dean died, I was late to supernatural so read online what happened so I've never watched that episode and never will.

They should bring the show back.  I wasn't ready for it to end. Why can't it be a long running show? The cop shows are!

It's one of the longest running live action shows…

Supernatural season 16 is discussed by cast and crew a whole lot with no sign of starting, and Jensen Ackles has revealed why that may be.

With Scott Gimple leaving the door open for Steven Yeun's The Walking Dead return, the series has the opportunity to feature an emotional reunion.

In a recent appearance on Amy Poehler's podcast, Idris Elba opened up about the iconic Stringer Bell scene from The Wire that he wasn't sure about.

After The Wheel of Time's surprise cancellation, this news about one of Prime Video's most anticipated fantasy adaptations is even more disappointing.

Mark Hamill's Joker casting was so groundbreaking that not even his fellow actors believed he was voicing the villain in Batman: The Animated Series.

Although this Fourth Wing character may appear cruel at first, Iron Flame and Onyx Storm reveal she was right to push Violet outside her comfort zone.

Although I'm excited for The Lincoln Lawyer season 4, which isn't here yet, I'm already eager for Netflix to adapt Michael Connelly's new book.

The second half of Ironheart has arrived on Disney+, and you can find a full breakdown of how things play out here. Like almost every MCU movie and TV show, there is a post-credits scene, but figuring out what it means for the future is easier said than done. 

After having his Hood taken from him by Riri Williams, Parker Robbins heads to the store run by Zelma Stanton's mom and seeks out the teenager's help. Well, some "supreme" help that he hopes she can assist him in tracking down (earlier in the series, Zelma mentions that she trained at Kamar-Taj for a time, so he's likely hoping to be connected with the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong). 

The scene ends with him suggesting they do a little "abracadabra" together, and it feels a lot like this was meant to lay the groundwork for the Strange Academy TV series that's now on hold. 

The idea was presumably for Zelma and Parker to train under Wong, with the latter hoping to regain his soul from Mephisto. Riri Williams may have even factored into the show, but as things stand, this is a pretty confusing stinger that only really confirms there are plans for Parker and Zelma's stories to continue...somewhere. 

Ironheart has been sitting on the shelf since it wrapped shooting in 2022, and much has changed for Marvel Studios since then.

Midnight Sons, Blade, and perhaps even a Ghost Rider movie are thought to be in production, but the likelihood of the stories of these streaming characters continuing in any of those movies surely can't be any better than 50/50. We'll have to wait and see. 

Set after the events of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Marvel Television's Ironheart pits technology against magic when Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) - a young, genius inventor determined to make her mark on the world - returns to her hometown of Chicago.

Her unique take on building iron suits is brilliant, but in pursuit of her ambitions, she finds herself wrapped up with the mysterious yet charming Parker Robbins aka "The Hood" (Anthony Ramos).

The series also stars Lyric Ross, Alden Ehrenreich, Regan Aliyah, Manny Montana, Matthew Elam and Anji White. Chinaka Hodge is head writer and executive producer; episodes are directed by Sam Bailey and Angela Barnes.

"Ironheart soars when Dominique Thorne, Anthony Ramos, Alden Ehrenreich, and Lyric Ross are on screen," we wrote in our 3* review, "but a by-the-numbers story means the series falls short of reaching the same heights as Iron Man. Still, the finale is an undeniable must-see."

All episodes of Ironheart are now streaming on Disney+.
