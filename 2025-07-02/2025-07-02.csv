            A village in Chicago's south suburbs is poised to purchase Pope Leo XIV's childhood home after its board voted unanimously on Tuesday to take control of the property.
    


            Since the pope's election, the small, two-story house on E. 142nd Place in Dolton, Illinois – around 20 miles south of the Windy City - has gained national attention, drawing visitors and attracting those interested in the leader's early life.
    


            Leo, known before as Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected in May as the first American pope – a decision that stunned many in the United States who celebrated his ascension as a historic moment. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson called Leo's election at the time as “one of the biggest moments in the modern history of our city.”
    


            Born in Chicago in 1955, Prevost earned his bachelor's in mathematics from Villanova and went on to receive his diploma in theology from the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago. He later spent decades as a missionary, including 20 years in Peru, where he is a naturalized citizen and served as a bishop.
    


A surreal moment as America celebrates its first pope — and wonders what his election means



            Members of the Dolton Village Board on Tuesday called the purchase of the pope's home a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” saying that gaining control over the house will allow the board to “do it justice.”
    


            “We can either seize this moment and move it forward, or we can let that moment go to an investor,” Dolton Mayor Jason House said at a board meeting Tuesday. The purchase will provide Dolton with the opportunity to re-evaluate enterprise and historic land zones and bring “state and congressional funds” into the town, House added.
    


            Other trustees at the Tuesday meeting joined the mayor in expressing support for the decision, with some citing the homes of Michael Jackson and Martin Luther King as examples of historic sites that have brought economic benefits for their communities.
    


            Officials, however, acknowledged the concerns and complaints of residents who say that traffic into the community has added further strain to already-dilapidated roads.
    


            “Purchasing the pope's house is admirable,” longtime Dolton resident Mary Avent told CNN affiliate WBBM, “but with the state we're in right now, I guess my concern is, do we have the money?”
    


            Avent told the outlet that Dolton currently lacks a police and fire chief, which she believes is more important.
    


            Trustee Edward Steave, at the Tuesday meeting, assured residents that their complaints were valid, but asserted “we can do this great thing at the same time.”
    


            The sale is likely to close within the next two weeks, the mayor said.
    


            Photos posted on the village's Facebook page late Tuesday show workers conducting repairs to the roof of the pope's house. It is unclear whether those repairs are being directed by the town.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Dolton Village Board for further information.

US President Donald Trump has warned that the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, Zohran Mamdani, could be arrested if he follows through on his promise to prevent federal officials from enforcing immigration laws in the country's largest city.

Uganda-born Mamdani said in his victory speech after the New York City Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday that he would “stop masked ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents from deporting our neighbors.”

“Well then, we will have to arrest him,” Trump said when asked by journalists about the New York state lawmaker's pledge later in the day, as he visited the so-called “Alligator Alcatraz” migrant detention center in Florida.

“Look, we do not need a communist in this country, but if we have one, I am going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation,” the president said, referring to Mamdani.

Trump also claimed that “a lot of people are saying he is here illegally. We are going to look at everything.”

The president continued his attacks on the Democratic politician after returning to the White House, describing Mamdani as a “total nut job” and threatening to withhold funding for New York City if he does not “do the right thing.”

Mamdani responded to Trump's comments in a statement on X, labeling them an “intimidation” attempt that his supporters and him will not accept.

The president threatened him with arrest and deportation “not because I have broken any law, but because I will refuse to let ICE terrorize our city,” the 33-year-old argued.

“His statements do not just represent an attack on our democracy but an attempt to send a message to every New Yorker who refuses to hide in the shadows: if you speak up, they will come for you,” he said.

Mamdani has been living in the US since the age of seven and became a naturalized citizen in 2018. He denies being a communist, describing himself as a democratic socialist.

The Pentagon has suspended shipments of several categories of US-made weapons to Ukraine, according to Politico and NBC News.

The decision reportedly followed an internal review of American weapons reserves ordered by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, amid rising concerns about the rate at which munitions are being depleted.

The move reportedly affects dozens of Patriot missile interceptors, Stinger and AIM air-to-air missiles, hundreds of Hellfire and GMLRS systems, as well as thousands of 155mm artillery shells that Washington had previously pledged to Kiev. Some of the weapons which were already positioned in Europe have now been withheld and will be provided to Ukrainian forces, NBC reported.

The weapons in question had been funded under the Biden administration through two mechanisms: direct drawdowns from existing US military stockpiles and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which contracts new production from defense contractors. The Trump administration has not requested any additional aid for Kiev, and existing resources are expected to last only “several more months,” according to Politico.

White House Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly defended the move as a necessary step to prioritize American defense needs. “This decision was made to put America's interests first following a DOD review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe. The strength of the United States Armed Forces remains unquestioned – just ask Iran,” she said, without confirming any details.

The decision to freeze or slow-walk the remaining aid without formal notice to Congress may raise legal concerns similar to the 2019 withholding of some Ukraine assistance under Trump's first administration –a move the Government Accountability Office ruled unlawful at the time, Politico noted.

Kiev has repeatedly voiced frustration over what it sees as dwindling support from Washington. Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky met with President Donald Trump at the NATO summit in The Hague last week but received no firm promises. Trump said Patriots were “very hard to get” and that the US needed them for its own defense and for Israel.

Trump has stated that he intends to negotiate a ceasefire with Moscow and bring the conflict to an end. Hegseth said last month that the White House is reducing military funding for Kiev as part of its “America First” strategy, in the hopes of achieving a diplomatic settlement.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration signed a deal giving the US priority access to Ukraine's mineral wealth –a step the White House said would allow America to “get back” some of the hundreds of billions spent under Biden.

The Pentagon's policy shift appears to reflect a broader realignment under Trump, who has publicly questioned the rationale behind endless aid to Ukraine. Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Direct Investment Fund, noted that the move “highlights the real limits of Western capacity and the shifting priorities of the US military.”

A British intelligence operative allegedly infiltrated the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to help coordinate Western sanctions against Iran, The Grayzone wrote on Tuesday.

The outlet cited leaked documents describing MI6 agent Nicholas Langman and his role within the UN watchdog.

Langman's resume was reportedly found in a trove of leaked papers detailing the activities of Torchlight, a UK intelligence cutout. He was allegedly linked to covering up British intelligence's role in Princess Diana's death and has been accused by Greek authorities of managing the abduction and torture of Pakistani immigrants in Athens.

His resume reportedly states that Langman also “led large, inter-agency teams to identify and defeat the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons technology,” including through “support for the [IAEA] and Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).”

Langman is said to have played a major role in organizing the sanctions imposed on Iran by “[building] highly effective and mutually supportive relations across government and with senior US, European, Middle and Far Eastern colleagues for strategy” between 2010 and 2012. He also claims credit for enabling “the major diplomatic success of [the] Iranian nuclear and sanctions agreement.”

Langman's tenure at the UK Foreign Office's Counter-Proliferation Centre coincided with a surge in Western sanctions and covert operations against Iranian scientists. During that period, Israeli assassinations and sabotage intensified, while the US and EU imposed sweeping economic penalties.

Iran has long accused the IAEA of colluding with its adversaries. Officials in Tehran have claimed the agency provided Israel with the identities of nuclear scientists and intelligence about key facilities, which were bombed last month by Israeli and US forces. 

On June 12, the IAEA accused Iran of violating the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Despite no evidence being presented that Tehran was pursuing a nuclear weapon, the following day Israel launched strikes targeting Iranian nuclear scientists and uranium enrichment facilities. Iran denied the accusations and retaliated. 

The US joined the Israeli operation on June 22. The 12-day war ended last week in a US brokered ceasefire which has so far been upheld.

Tehran has since suspended cooperation with the IAEA, barred Director General Rafael Grossi from entering the country, and voted to end the routine monitoring of its nuclear sites. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei has accused Grossi of issuing a “biased report” that was used by Israel to justify its “unlawful” attack. 

Russia has also condemned the agency's role. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has said IAEA data was used to plan the strikes, calling it “a colossal blow” to the watchdog's credibility.

WASHINGTON, July 2. /TASS/. The US Department of Defense has suspended deliveries of air defense system missiles and precision-guided munitions to Ukraine due to depleted stockpiles, Politico reported citing sources.

According to the report, the decision to halt the shipments was initiated by US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby. It followed an internal review of US ammunition stockpiles, which raised concerns over the sharp decline in the overall number of artillery shells, air defense missiles, and precision-guided munitions.

Politico sources noted that the decision to suspend certain aid deliveries, originally approved under former US President Joe Biden's administration, was made in early June but has only now gone into effect.

When asked by TASS to comment on the Politico publication, the Pentagon stated that the US Armed Forces are ""fully equipped to deter against any threat.""

MOSCOW, July 2. /TASS/. As the European Union evolves into a military alliance a la NATO, Russia must stay vigilant and prepare itself to respond to this threat, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said.

In a broadcast by the Rossiya-24 TV channel, he noted that the European Union is morphing from a peaceful project into ""something resembling a very aggressive military bloc."" ""This is being shaped not only by decisions to provide it with additional military capabilities to develop the military-industrial complex but also in terms of its entire philosophy,"" Grushko asserted.

""This is ideological, and that bothers us a lot because we would indeed have to deal with a new military organization which harbors aggressive intentions against Russia and develops its military strategy and organization accordingly, fosters military opportunities which directly create threats to us against which we have to defend. And we will do so,"" the senior Russian diplomat emphasized.

That said, Grushko expressed doubts that Brussels' plans would result in the emergence of an ""independent NATO."" ""One must keep in mind that the US controls NATO and NATO controls the European Union.

Former staff likened offices of video game company in Paris to a ‘boys' club above the law'

Three former executives at the video game company Ubisoft have been given suspended prison sentences for enabling a culture of sexual and psychological harassment in the workplace at the end of the first big trial to stem from the #MeToo movement in the gaming industry.

The court in Bobigny, north of Paris, had heard how the former executives used their position to bully or sexually harass staff, leaving women terrified and feeling like pieces of meat.

Former staff had said that between 2012 and 2020, the company's offices in Montreuil, east of Paris, were run with a toxic culture of bullying and sexism that one worker likened to a “boys' club above the law”.

Ubisoft is a French family business that rose to become one of the biggest video game creators in the world. The company has been behind several blockbusters including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and the children's favourite Just Dance.

The state prosecutor, Antoine Haushalter, had told the court the world of video games and its subculture had an element of “systemic” sexism and potential abuse and called the trial a “turning point” for the gaming world.

Thomas François, 52, a former Ubisoft editorial vice-president, was found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment and an attempted sexual assault. He was given a three-year suspended prison sentence and fined €30,000 (£26,000).

The court heard how he once tied a female member of staff to a chair with tape, pushed the chair into a lift and pressed a button at random. He was also accused of forcing one woman wearing a skirt to do handstands.

She told the court: “He was my superior and I was afraid of him. He made me do handstands. I did it to get it over with and get rid of him.”

At a 2015 office Christmas party with a Back to the Future theme, François allegedly told a member of staff that he liked her 1950s dress. He then allegedly stepped towards her to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her by the arms and back. She shouted and broke free.

François had told the court there was a “culture of joking around”. He said: “I never tried to harm anyone.”

Serge Hascoët, 59, Ubisoft's former chief creative officer and second-in-command, was found guilty of psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment.

He was acquitted of sexual harassment and complicity in psychological harassment. He was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a fine of €45,000.

The court heard he once handed a young female member of staff a tissue in which he had blown his nose, saying: “You can resell it, it's worth gold at Ubisoft.” The court heard that Hascoët bullied assistants by making them carry out personal tasks for him such as going to his home to wait for parcel deliveries.

Hascoët had told the court he was unaware of any harassment, saying: “I have never wanted to harass anyone and I don't think I have.”

Hascoët's lawyer, Jean-Guillaume Le Mintier, said his client was considering an appeal.

The former Ubisoft game director, Guillaume Patrux, 41, was found guilty of psychological harassment and given a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €10,000.

The court heard he had punched walls, mimed hitting staff, cracked a whip near colleagues' faces, threatened to carry out an office shooting and played with a cigarette lighter near workers' faces, setting alight a man's beard. He had denied the charges.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The detention center visit seemed to represent a landmark in a defining issue since even before his first term: migration

Donald Trump's tour of the bloodcurdlingly-monikered – and hastily-constructed – “Alligator Alcatraz” migrants detention center in Florida's Everglades had the hallmarks of a calculatedly provocative celebration of the dystopian.

Accompanied by Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, the Florida governor Ron DeSantis and a phalanx of journalists, the US president saw only virtue in the vista of mesh fencing, barbed wire and forbidding steel bunk beds.

“Between Kristi and Ron, it's really government working together,” he said. “They have done an amazing job. I'm proud of them.”

Not that Trump was blind to the intimidating nature of the facility his long crusade against undocumented people had willed into existence in this hot, steamy part of southern Florida, prized by environmentalists as a crucial nature preserve but now redesigned to be a location of dread to those lacking documentary proof of their right to be in the US.

“Biden wanted me in here,” he said, snidely referring to his predecessor in the White House, who he accuses – without evidence – of orchestrating criminal prosecutions against him. “It didn't work out that way, but he wanted me in here, the son of a bitch.”

Tuesday's visit seemed to represent a new landmark in the administration's embrace of unabashedly authoritarian solutions to meet what has been Trump's defining issue since even before his first term: migration.

Recent weeks have seen several escalations as the White House and law enforcement agencies have sought to project an ever more draconian approach.

Deaths have been recorded of several detainees who had been taken into custody by Immigration, Customs and Enforcement (Ice) officials.

Footage of masked officers without insignia arresting people in the streets has sent shockwaves through immigrant communities nationwide.

National guards troops and marines have been deployed against demonstrators protesting migrant roundups on the streets of Los Angeles, even as local authorities and California's Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, insisted they were not needed.

In what has seemed like performative acts of political intimidation, several Democrats have been arrested and handcuffed by Ice and FBI agents near detention facilities or immigration courts. Senator Alex Padilla of California was pinned to the ground and handcuffed after trying to ask a question of Noem at a press conference, even after identifying himself.

The administration's schtick was clear when Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador and self-proclaimed “world's coolest dictator”, was feted in the White House in April days after more than 200 Venezuelan alleged gang members were summarily deported from the US to the sprawling Cecot facility in El Salvador.

Shortly afterwards, Noem compounded the message by traveling to the center – said to have capacity for 40,000 prisoners – where she posed outside a cell into which large numbers shaven-headed detainees were herded.

All of the this has drawn howls of condemnation from critics as signaling red flags for the state of US democracy and constitutional guarantees.

Tuesday's event indicated the strength of the administration's contempt for such concerns. It was case of all-in on the Bukele approach, at least in imagery if not in scale.

Enough beds have been installed in two separate areas of the facility to house 5,000 prisoners.

Seized from its owners, Miami Dade county, by DeSantis using emergency powers as governor, the setting has drawn accusations of cruelty from immigrants rights organizations who point to the area's extreme heat and humidity and surrounding marshlands, which contains alligators, Burmese pythons and swarms of mosquitoes.

Trump seemed to revel in the potential for detainees' misery at what was termed a round-table discussion but which devolved into fawning praise of his leadership from administration and state officials and obsequious questions from journalists representing friendly rightwing news outlets.

“It might be as good as the real Alcatraz site,” he said. “That's a spooky one too, isn't it? That's a tough site.”

As if in confirmation that this was an event designed to showcase ruthlessness, Trump handed the floor to Stephen Miller, the powerful White House deputy chief of staff and widely-acknowledged mastermind of the anti-immigrant offensive, calling him “our superstar”.

Miller responded with a pithy summation of the policy's raison d'être.

“What you've done over the last five months [is] to deliver on a 50-year hope and dream of the American people to secure the border,” he said. “There's a 2,000 mile border with one of the poorest countries in the world, and you have open travel from 150 countries into Central America and South America.

“There are 2 billion people in the world that would economically benefit from illegally coming to the United States. Through the deployment of the military, through … novel legal and diplomatic tools, through the building of physical infrastructure, through the empowering of Ice and border patrol and the entire federal law enforcement apparatus, President Trump achieved absolute border security.”

And there would be more to come – courtesy of funds secured for deportations in Trump's sweeping spending bill, which secured narrow Senate passage during Trump's visit to the facility.

“Once this legislation is passed, he will be able to make that, with those resources, permanent,” Miller said.

PBS reported that the bill envisions roughly $150bn being spent on the administration's deportation agenda over the next four years.

Taking the soft cop line, Noem on Tuesday told undocumented people that it didn't have to be this way; they could still, to use the administration's terminology, take the “self-deport” option by returning voluntarily to their home countries – where she said the governments were waiting with open arms.

“Anybody who sees these news clips should know you could still go home on your own, you can self-deport,” she said, adding that they could apply to return to the United States “the right way”.

A more telling attitude to accountability was displayed by Trump himself at the end of the media question and answer session when a Fox News reporter asked how long detainees could expect to spend at the Florida facility – days, weeks or months.

After clarifying the question, Trump seemed – or perhaps decided – to misunderstand it.

“This is my home state,” he said. “I love it … I'll spend a lot of time here. I'll be here as much as I can. Very nice question.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Special soil spray is used to increase amount of water grass can absorb to prevent courts from drying out 

A special chemical is being used at Wimbledon to make “water wetter” to try to reduce water bills and tackle rising temperatures.

As the championship welcomed rain on Wednesday after opening with scorching temperatures, Neil Stubley, Wimbledon's head of courts and horticulture, said the tournament uses a soil spray to adjust the amount of water a plant root system can absorb.

Stubley said: “It sounds a weird term but it makes water wetter. The surface tension of a water molecule, a plant root system, at a certain point, can't penetrate it as the moisture gets smaller, because the surface tension is more. We can adjust that so that actually a plant root can tap into that water.”

On Wednesday, tennis fans poured into Wimbledon under light rain after the hottest start to the championship on record as temperatures soared to 32C on Monday and 34.2C on Tuesday.

The high temperatures meant extra water was needed to avoid the rapid drying of courts, which could lead to cracks. But with cooler temperatures expected to come, Stubley anticipates a “routine championship” will follow.

Stubley and the team of 20 full-time grounds staff, who have 250 championships' worth of experience between them, are used to being reactive and adaptive to Britain's temperamental weather.

To maintain the delicate balance between the whims of mother nature and conditions required for elite tennis, data is collected each day, including considerations of the ball's rebound, soil firmness and moisture content, to determine how the courts are managed in the evening. By morning, mowers are set and the grass is tailored to a precise 8mm.

While irrigation is the key to controlling how the surface is played, it is just one of many considerations Stubley and his team take into account. In addition to water conservation, they have also looked toward more “drought tolerant” plants.

Stubley said: “We actually made a conscious effort that the hydrangeas – and those types of flowers we've used historically here that actually do need a lot of water to survive – if you look at the grounds over the last 10 to 15 years, although they're still in areas, there's a lot less of them.

“We're now selecting grasses that are more wear-tolerant, more drought-tolerant grasses that we can use in the UK that have been used elsewhere.”

Compared with other sports, namely those using winter or full pitches, the amount of water used throughout the summer championship will be less, he said.

“It's a living surface, the environment will always have an impact on how it plays,” said Stubley. “It's just being reactive and making sure you adapt.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Chinese intimidation of Taiwan has entered a chilling new phase: bolder, more multifaceted and unconstrained by diplomatic norms. For years, Taiwan has weathered economic coercion, military threats, diplomatic isolation, political interference, espionage and disinformation, but the direct targeting of elected leaders abroad signals an alarming escalation in Beijing's campaign of hostility.

Czech military intelligence recently uncovered a plot that reads like fiction, but is all too real. Chinese diplomats and civil secret service in Prague had planned to ram the motorcade of then-vice president-elect Hsiao Bi-khim (蕭美琴) and physically assault her during her visit to the Czech Republic in March last year. 

Taiwanese officials have rightly labeled this as “transnational repression.” We should call it what it is: endangering the life of a democratically elected leader. Although Czech authorities thwarted the plot, the warning is clear: Beijing is willing to cross any line to threaten and silence Taiwanese leadership. This cannot be allowed to become the new normal. In a world that claims to be governed by a rules-based international order, this was nothing short of a planned political attack, one that must not be dismissed or normalized under the cover of the “one China” policy.

China's cross-border harassment is not new. Its officials have long targeted Taiwanese diplomats and students abroad, as well as Hong Kong dissidents, sometimes violently. In 2020, Chinese diplomats disrupted Taiwan's Double Ten National Day event in Fiji and physically assaulted Taiwanese staff. The Prague incident marks a new threshold: What was once intimidation is now premeditated violence. This is not diplomacy; it is state-sponsored coercion.

This is happening now because Beijing's traditional tactics are faltering. Taiwan has grown more resilient, deepening its partnerships across Europe and Asia, and garnering broader international support. As diplomatic poaching yields diminishing returns, China is resorting to more extreme measures to intimidate Taiwanese leaders and deter others from engaging with Taipei. The strategy is plain: To keep Taiwan off the international stage and isolate it by any means necessary. 

The international outrage to the Prague plot has been swift, but coverage alone is not enough. China's actions are not merely Taiwan's problem; they are a direct challenge to democratic norms and the global rules-based order. What happens to Taiwan today could happen to other liberal democracies tomorrow. A collective response is essential.

What can be done?

First, liberal democracies must speak with one voice. This was a violent threat against a democratically elected leader. The world must condemn it clearly and forcefully.

Second, there must be accountability. Chinese officials involved in such plots should face consequences, including the possibility of diplomatic expulsions. When red lines are crossed, there must be repercussions and a clear message that China is not immune to such illegal activities, not on foreign soil at least. 

Third, democratic countries must strengthen security coordination concerning Taiwan. Although Taipei lacks formal diplomatic recognition, it maintains extensive unofficial relations worldwide. It is a key economic and technological partner to many, as well as a hub for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Its leaders and officials deserve the same protection given to any visiting dignitary. Ensuring their safety is a duty and responsibility.

Fourth, there must be legal deterrents. In the US, the TAIPEI Act and the Taiwan Peace and Stability Act offer valuable models. Similar frameworks should be adopted in other countries to protect partners facing coercion and interference.

Fifth, countries must not back down from legitimate engagement with Taiwan. Beijing has no authority to dictate who may communicate with whom. The Czech Republic has demonstrated admirable resolve, from Czech Senate President Milos Vystrcil's visit to Taipei in 2020 to its warm welcome of Hsiao last year. These actions are more than mere gestures; they stand as powerful affirmations that democratic values cannot be silenced through intimidation and bullying. 

If the world is serious about upholding a rules-based order, now is the time to draw firm boundaries and stand together in its defense.

“Taiwan will not be isolated by intimidation,” Hsiao said. 

Indeed, Taiwan will neither be intimidated nor silenced. However, the international community must do its part: Support Taiwan's right to exist, engage and remain secure. A stable Indo-Pacific region and a functioning international order are impossible if Taiwan is left vulnerable to violence, coercion and repression.

With all the social media buzz, it is worth asking if we are witnessing the rise of a new-age collectible, or whether Labubu is a mere fad destined to fade.

Throughout the past two years, whenever I have brought him his luggage or picked him up for the end of a semester or the start of a break, I have stayed at a hotel near his campus. In doing so, I have noticed a strange phenomenon: The hotel's TV contained an unusual number of Chinese channels, filled with accents that would make a person feel as if they are in China. It is quite exhausting.
A few days ago, while staying in the hotel, I found that of the 50 available TV channels,

This trope has gained traction in the world of Taiwanese news, likely with the best intentions. Anything that breaks the China-controlled narrative that Taiwan is doomed to be conquered is welcome, but after observing its rise in recent months, I now believe that the “silicon shield” is a myth — one that is ultimately working against Taiwan.
The basic silicon shield idea is that the world, particularly the US, would rush to defend Taiwan against a Chinese invasion because they do not want Beijing to seize the nation's vital and unique chip industry.

With rows of beauty counters and a full lineup of brands, they once served as a powerful draw for customers. However, since last year, the halo surrounding the sector has begun to fade. It is not an isolated issue affecting one retailer — it is a widespread phenomenon across department stores in Taiwan.

Russia's full-scale invasion may have turned Ukraine into the world's largest minefield.

As of March 2025, Ukraine's mine-affected land spans an estimated 139,000 square kilometers — or 23% of its territory — covering more ground than all of Greece and posing an immense threat to civilian life and recovery efforts.

Clearing landmines and unexploded ordnance is essential to preventing civilian casualties and enabling the safe use of land and infrastructure, fostering the country's recovery and future development.

Demining in Ukraine is primarily carried out by the State Emergency Service and the Armed Forces, with both international and domestic non-governmental organizations contributing to the effort.

The world's largest demining non-governmental organization, the HALO Trust, has operated in Ukraine since 2015 and scaled up its efforts after the full-scale invasion began.

The HALO Trust has cleared nearly 7.9 million square meters of land and located over 41,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance since Feb. 24, 2022.

The organization has grown from a small team of 400 in Kramatorsk, a front-line city in Donetsk Oblast, to a workforce of 1,500 people operating in eight regions across Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent spoke with James Cowan, the CEO of HALO Trust, about the organization's ongoing effort to rid Ukraine of landmines, his assessment of how long it might take, and what new technology could revolutionize the process.

Editor's note: This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

The Kyiv Independent: How would you describe the scale of landmine contamination in Ukraine today, and how does it compare to other conflict zones you've worked in?

James Cowan: The HALO Trust has existed since 1988. We are the world's largest NGO that clears landmines, so we know about other areas of the world.

This is the biggest landmine challenge since World War II.

Unless it's done quickly, it's going to take hundreds of years.

The nearest example is the minefield between North and South Korea — it's 178 kilometers long. Ukraine's front line is 1,000 kilometers long, and that is not the only contamination.

There are landmines well inside free Ukraine and landmines well inside Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine.

The Kyiv Independent: Can you describe how your team operates in Ukraine — which regions you're active in, and what the process looks like from detection to removal when a mine or unexploded ordnance is found?

James Cowan: There are three units: one in the north, one in the northeast, and one in the south. We want to expand further, and when it is possible, we would be happy to help Ukraine clear even more parts of the country.

We have survey teams that confirm the contamination and are also trying to shrink the area to the absolute minimum. We then bring in our teams to conduct the clearance.

This is an area where there could be improvement. We work in countries like Afghanistan, which is mountainous; in countries like Cambodia, which is jungle; and in countries like Angola, which is African bush. In those places, mechanical methods are not easy to use. But in Ukraine, there are open fields — some of the best agricultural land in the world. They are the most suitable and optimized environment for mechanical clearance.

We have mechanical diggers, but we're not allowed to deploy them because authorization is very slow. We would ask the Ukrainian government to speed that up because currently, it is very bureaucratic and takes too long. We need to be able to use all the assets available.

Ukraine does not want to be like Afghanistan, where HALO has worked since 1988 and is still working.

The Kyiv Independent: Why is it so difficult to speed up the process?

James Cowan: Every country has its own bureaucracy. Sometimes, government officials aren't as entrepreneurial as those in the private sector. But it would be good to see more speed. This is not a conscious decision but more a bureaucratic inertia.

But Ukraine needs to act because its land is covered in landmines. Without action, Ukraine can't export its grain, open its roads, or bring its population back. Unless it's done quickly, it's going to take hundreds of years.

The Kyiv Independent: Given the ongoing ceasefire negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, do you think demining should also be part of the talks?

James Cowan: If a ceasefire happens, that is the inflection point. It is the point at which everyone's efforts move from a war to a defensive posture, in which, of course, Ukraine's army will continue to protect the sovereignty of their country. Still, the civilian effort will move toward reconstruction and away from the fighting.

At that moment, Ukraine's priority will be to restart its economy, get all that land that hasn't been farmed for three or four years back into use, and allow communities to return to their homes. And it's not just about large-scale farming — it's also about local, small-scale agriculture. Some people haven't been able to grow vegetables, raise goats or sheep, or use their cows and donkeys. They need access to their land again.

It's also about reopening roads, schools, shops, and factories. All these things need to be cleared (from mines), and the whole economy needs to be helped to get up and going.

There is a lot of emphasis on the mineral deal, but you can't mine for minerals without demining for landmines.

The Kyiv Independent: If the war were to end tomorrow, would it be realistic to fully clear all mines in Ukraine within the next 10 years?

James Cowan: If the war were to stop tomorrow along the current front line, it wouldn't be possible to clear landmines on the Russian-occupied side, despite it being sovereign Ukrainian territory, unless Russia allows it.


Combining artificial intelligence with imagery is a key development.
    

Regarding territory under Ukrainian control, whether all landmines can be cleared within 10 years remains open — but I believe it's possible. If Ukraine applies the same level of innovation and energy to mechanizing demining as it has to advancing drone technology, then yes, I think it's achievable. That said, it's still too early to be certain.

The Kyiv Independent: How do you assess Ukraine's National Mine Action Strategy (approved in June 2024)? In your view, how realistic and effective is it given the current scale of contamination? Has HALO Trust been involved in shaping or advising on the strategy?

James Cowan: I've worked alongside Ukraine's First Deputy Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko. The strategy she's built is a good one.

But all strategies need to evolve; they're not just documents on a dusty shelf, and this one will. I'd particularly like to see the adoption of mechanical clearance.

The Kyiv Independent: What emerging technologies do you see as having the greatest potential to transform demining efforts in Ukraine?

James Cowan: Combining artificial intelligence with imagery is a key development. In terms of detection, there are several exciting technologies, such as synthetic aperture radar, ground-penetrating radar, and magnetic resonance — especially the magnetic resonance methods developed in Australia for detecting rare earth elements like gold, which can also be applied to finding landmines.

There are also cutting-edge nuclear industry technologies, like the neutron-associated particle imaging (NAPI), which could be game-changing. The problem is that these technologies are very good at finding mines, but also find mines that aren't there. This means they produce false alarms, which slows the process. So, the technology needs to become better at only detecting real landmines, not fake ones.

The Kyiv Independent: As the CEO of a leading humanitarian organization, you chose not to publicly condemn the U.S. decision to provide Ukraine with anti-personnel mines in 2024. Could you explain why? Has your position on this changed since then?

James Cowan: Ukraine's fundamental right to self-defense is something everyone should respect. Your country is fighting for its very existence. Who am I to question your right to exist? I wasn't willing to condemn you for that.

Yes, my organization's mission is to clear landmines, but I'm not here to judge who is right or wrong. My role is simply to clear the landmines.

Ukrainian prosecutors have documented cases of Russian forces summarily executing 273 Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs), the Liga.net news outlet reported, citing a statement from the Prosecutor General's Office.

Kyiv and the U.N. have raised alarm over the rising number of such cases, saying they point to a systematic policy by Russia to murder Ukrainian captives. Half of the document cases were recorded this year alone.

Seventy-seven criminal cases have been launched in connection with the killings of POWs, while only two people were convicted, and a trial against a third person is ongoing. The statement did not clarify whether the convictions were issued in absentia.

A total of 188 people have been convicted of various war crimes, including 18 captured Russian soldiers and one civilian, who were convicted in person. The rest were convicted in absentia.

Earlier this week, Ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets reported a case of the likely murder of a Ukrainian POW who was apparently tied to a motorcycle by Russian soldiers and dragged along the road. 

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) said in May that it alone had documented more than 150 cases of Ukrainian soldiers being executed after surrendering to Russian forces. Multiple intelligence reports suggest that Russian soldiers have received explicit orders to kill prisoners of war.

The United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine confirmed in March growing numbers of incidents in which Russian forces killed or maimed surrendering Ukrainian troops.

A separate Ukrainian investigation is also underway into the killing of around 50 Ukrainian POWs in the Russian-run Olenivka prison in 2022. Kyiv blamed the killings on Russia, saying Moscow's forces deliberately put Azov fighters in a separate building that was later destroyed.

Russia denied responsibility, claiming the explosion was caused by a Ukrainian HIMARS strike—a version U.N. investigators have rejected. 

Although Moscow blocked an independent investigation by denying U.N. monitors access, Lubinets recently said that an internal U.N. analysis concluded Russia was to blame.

According to Bloomberg, some European allies hope the Trump administration will soften or reverse the decision.

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry told U.S. Charge d'Affaires John Ginkel that any delays in U.S. military aid would only prolong the war, the Foreign Ministry said on July 2 after the Pentagon reportedly paused some weapons shipments.

Ginkel met Deputy Foreign Minister Mariana Betsa at the request of Ukraine's chief diplomat, Andrii Sybiha. 

During the meeting, the Ukrainian side warned that ""any delay or hesitation in supporting Ukraine's defense capabilities will only encourage Russia to continue war and terror, rather than pursue peace.""

The meeting came amid reporting in the U.S. media that the U.S. Defense Department had paused some of the previously allocated shipments of weapons to Kyiv as part of a review. Among the withheld items are Patriot air defense missiles, precision artillery rounds, Hellfire missiles, and other munitions used by Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly later confirmed the move, saying that the decision ""was made to put America's interests first following a (Defense Department) review of our nation's military support and assistance to other countries across the globe.""

The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry did not explicitly confirm the pause in its statement. According to the ministry's readout, Betsa underscored Ukraine's gratitude for U.S. aid and stressed the critical importance of continued deliveries, namely air defenses.

Separately, parliamentary defense committee member Fedir Venislavskyi told RBK-Ukraine that Ukraine has not received an official confirmation of the suspension.

""Any restrictions on the supply of those resources that are very important to us are undoubtedly negative,"" Venislavskyi said, adding that Ukraine nevertheless has some ""reserve capacities.""

In the conversation with Ginkel, Betsa also stressed that Russia continues to reject a U.S.-proposed ceasefire that Kyiv agreed to during talks in Jeddah on March 11 and only intensifies its aerial attacks and ground offensives against Ukraine.

""Ukraine supports peace efforts and supports the U.S. calls for an immediate end to the killings and the war, stressing the need to compel Russia to seek peace,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

""Under these circumstances, strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities and ramping up coordinated transatlantic pressure on Russia are critically important.""

The aid pause comes in a critical moment as Russia is ramping up its aerial strikes across Ukraine and intensifying offensive operations along the front line. In June, Russia launched a record 5,337 Shahed-type attack drones at Ukrainian targets, the highest monthly total since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The Trump administration has yet to approve any new major aid package for Ukraine and revealed plans to reduce military assistance in next year's budget. The pause comes despite U.S. President Donald Trump recently signaling support for further Patriot supplies to Kyiv.

According to Bloomberg, some European allies hope the Trump administration will soften or reverse the decision.

We can build a strong, sovereign Canada by recruiting talented foreigners to play for our team.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

Daniel Bernhard is CEO of the Institute for Canadian Citizenship. 

Many of the sweeping reflections and recommendations in this year's Canada Day opinion pieces dealt with trade: internal barriers to it, American tariffs upon it, the attending need to diversify it, et cetera. But in a modern knowledge economy, where more than 90 per cent of the S&P 500's value is comprised of intangible assets, Canada's most important import is not any one good or service – it is people, and the knowledge they bring. 

The Carney cabinet's mandate letter acknowledges this, setting a goal of “attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy.” But that sentence concludes with a crucial caveat of doing this “while returning our overall immigration rates to sustainable levels.” 

This neatly captures Canada's confused immigration policy. We want to attract global talent. Just not too much. Our awkward aversion to too much talent gives rise to niche proposals like the Canada Discovery Visa, which would fund 1,000 of “the world's top scientists and engineers” to live and work in Canada. It's a good idea from Canadian tech entrepreneur Michael Serbinis. Let's do it. But why stop at scientists? Broader calls to systematically poach U.S. talent are also smart. But why just Americans? The world is full of people with proven experience in solving Canada's thorniest problems. They should be playing for our team. 

Canada's per capita health care spending is about 20 per cent higher than Japan's, yet the Japanese, on average, live a full two years longer. Iceland, Italy, Israel, South Korea and Spain likewise boast higher life expectancies at dramatically lower costs. Shouldn't we recruit people who know how to deliver better care at lower costs to provide these improvements for Canada? Ontario's plan to allow American health care workers to practise immediately upon arrival is a start. (It would also help to move globally trained health care professionals who are already here from the sidelines to the front lines. In Ontario alone, an estimated 20,000 globally trained nurses are prevented from practising – mostly without good reason.) But why just Americans, and only front-line workers? Why not the hospital administrators and civil servants who manage these evidently superior systems? 

Canadian housing also suffers from serious productivity issues. In Sweden, 90 per cent of housing fabrication occurs in factories. In Canada, we bring each piece to a lot and assemble it on site, which is both more expensive and takes longer.

We could entice Swedish companies to set up branch plants here, driving profits and intellectual property out of Canada, but wouldn't it be better to recruit Swedish experts to move here and build businesses that don't just deliver cheaper housing fast, but also accrue knowledge, capital and intellectual property for our economy?

No matter what, our ambitious housing targets are not achievable without a major influx of skilled labour. Many believe that Canada lacks the housing to support greater immigration, but perhaps Canada lacks the immigrants to support greater housing construction. We will lack about 85,000 construction workers in the next decade, with an estimated 134,000 residential construction workers set to retire by 2033. Yet Canada is selecting 75 per cent fewer immigrants with construction skills than we did in the 1980s.

Transport is another example. In a modern, sovereign economy, people move quickly and cheaply between cities to build connections and close deals. The Canadian narrative is that high-speed rail is too expensive to build. But excellent research by the University of Toronto shows that Italy, Turkey, Sweden, Finland, Spain and South Korea “deliver transit projects comparable to those in Canada at as low as one-10th the price per kilometre.” The people behind those projects should be playing for Team Canada, especially the civil servants. 

A confident Canada would stop dwelling on arbitrary immigration targets and instead recruit people who have solved the very challenges we're currently stuck on, in whatever numbers are required. Fundamentally, we have a mindset problem. We're stuck in the antiquated paradigm where hardscrabble immigrants arrive with $5 in their pockets and build good lives upon hard work and Canadian generosity. In this paradigm, immigration is a favour we do for immigrants. 

But today's truth is that immigration is one of Canada's top three talent development pathways, alongside our education system and our innovation industries. We often fault immigrants for lacking Canadian experience, while ironically overlooking the pre-Canadian experience they have in solving the precise problems we face.

Canada is a great country, but we face many serious challenges. Talented people around the world have solved our problems – only they've done it elsewhere. They know how to do what we don't. We can build a strong, sovereign Canada by recruiting them to play for our team.

North Korea has opened a massive beach resort to domestic tourists, with Russian tourists expected next week. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area is believed to be one of Kim Jong Un's pet projects.

North Korea has opened a massive ""world-class cultural resort"" on its eastern coast, state media said on Wednesday.

The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) shared images of tourists enjoying the beach in swimwear as the tourist zone opened to domestic visitors on Tuesday.

""The guests' hearts were filled with overwhelming emotion as they felt the astonishing new heights of our-style tourism culture blossoming under the era of the Workers' Party,"" KCNA said.

The agency said tourists were ""astonished by the grandeur and splendor of the tourist city, which can accommodate nearly 20,000 people.

South Korean media referred to the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area as ""North Korea's Waikiki.""

Analysts say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is very keen on developing the tourism industry, especially the coastal areas. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area is believed to be one of his pet projects. 

Kim said construction of the site would go down as ""one of the greatest successes this year"" and that Pyongyang will build more large-scale tourist zones.

Images of Kim with his daughter Ju Ae and wife Ri Sol Ju watching a man flying off a water slide in the resort were shared days ahead of the opening.

Russian tourists are also expected to visit the zone from July 7 for an 8-day trip which includes a visit to Pyongyang, as per a statement from Russia's Primorsky region.

South Korea's Unification Ministry said the site is expected to expand over time. But given limited transportation to the destination via Pyongyang, the resort is ""likely to remain small in scale,"" with around 170 visitors per day.  

Experts say Pyongyang has received some aid from Russia to develop this site, in exchange for help with Moscow's war in Ukraine. 

For North Korea, tourism is potentially a good source of acquiring foreign currency.

After remaining closed since the COVID-19 pandemic, North Korea finally opened its borders to visitors. But even before that, the number of foreign tourists was very limited.

Chinese tourists made up about 90% of visitors with only about 5,000 western tourists being allowed. But Chinese tourists seem to have stayed away as questions remain about ties between Beijing and Pyongyang.

After the pandemic, Russian tourists were only allowed last year and Western tourists briefly returned in February 2025.

US tourists used to make up about 20% of foreign tourists. But Washington banned travel to North Korea after the imprisonment and death of student Otto Warmbier.

South Koreans traveled to Mount Kumgang at the border until 2008, when a tourist was shot dead by a North Korean soldier.

Germany's chancellor supported the move not to fly the rainbow flag on the Reichstag building, saying ""the Bundestag is not a circus tent."" Meanwhile, Germans try to keep cool amid heatwave conditions. DW has more.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said only the national flag and the European flag could be flown on the building housing Parliament and that people could fly whatever flag they wished on their own doorstep.

A few days ago, conservative Bundestag President Julia Klöckner announced the flag would not be flown on the Reichstag building to mark Pride celebrations.

Meanwhile, Germany along with other European countries, is bracing for more extreme heat, with temperatures expected to reach 40-degrees in some parts.

Below, you can catch up with the latest mix of news, analysis and background articles that has Germany talking on Wednesday, July 2.

The German government has approved a new bill that prohibits minors from purchasing or possessing nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, for anyone under 18.

Additionally, online sales and purchases from self-service machines will be banned entirely.

Children and teenagers risk experiencing unconsciousness and even permanent damage to the nervous system from using laughing gas.

""It is not a harmless party gag,"" Federal Drug Commissioner Hendrik Streeck warned.

The manufacture, sale, and trade of chemical sedatives commonly referred to as ""date rape drugs"" will also be banned under the proposed legislation.

According to the bill, which now heads to parliament for a vote, these new regulations will take effect three months after being passed by lawmakers.

Customs officials at Frankfurt airport seized around 160kb of crystal meth concealed and smuggled inside machinery from Mexico destined for the Netherlands.

Customs officers discovered the drugs hidden inside a metal box inside a construction machine used to make paving stones on June 19.

The crystal meth was removed ""one shovelful at a time,"" a customs spokeswoman said.

The drugs are believed to have a street value of around €10 million ($11.8 million).

Authorities said the haul is likely the largest seizure of drugs of this kind by air in Germany.

The Dutch police managed to arrest  four suspects last Thursday, as part of a joint operation involving German and Belgian authorities.

As Germany and Europe grapple with a days-long heat wave, some 48 passengers had to be rescued from a train in the town of Elsfleth in northern Germany on Tuesday evening after it became stuck on a rail bridge.

The train was forced to make the unplanned stop due to a technical fault, which also caused the air conditioning to work at limited capacity.

As the carriages became hotter and hotter, the passengers called the local emergency rescue services, who were able to extract them from the bridge.

State police and ambulances rushed to the site to attend to the passengers and crew. Two teenage passengers had to be taken to a local hospital but no one was seriously hurt.

Extreme heat warnings have been issued for parts of the country by the German Weather Service (DWD) with temperatures forecast to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).

""It is quite possible that we will locally reach 40 degrees,"" A DWD spokesman said.

As a result of the high temperatures, the risk of forest fires would rise on Wednesday, the DWD said, however, that would drop on Thursday, when cooler weather was expected.

According to the DWD, it is not just the heat that is cause for concern; thunderstorms are also expected in parts of the south by midday.

Health experts have cautioned that young children and older adults are particularly vulnerable to higher temperatures.

Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz has supported a move not to fly the rainbow flag — a symbol of the LGBTQI+ community — on the Reichstag building in Berlin during Pride celebrations.

Days ago, Bundestag President Julia Klöckner of the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) announced that the rainbow Pride flag would not fly from the parliament building, the Reichstag, on Christopher Street Day on July 26, as it has done for the past couple of years.

Klöckner also decided that LGBTQ+ members of the Bundestag administration were not to attend the CSD parade in an official capacity.

The decision not to raise the flag at parliament was criticized by opposition parties the environmentalist Greens and the socialist Left Party, among others.

When asked about that decision, Merz told German public broadcaster ARD on Tuesday that ""the Bundestag is not a circus tent"" on which flags can be hoisted at will.

""On all other days, the German flag and the European flag are flown on the German Bundestag, and no others. And this decision is the right one,"" Merz said.

Everyone can fly whatever flags they want on their own doorstep, said the chancellor. ""But we're talking about the German parliament here, and in the German parliament, we don't fly any flags every day, but the German national flag and the European flag,"" he said.

Commercial vehicle manufacturing giant, Daimler Truck, announced that it had signed a letter of intent to have lorries from various Mercedes-Benz series assembled in the West African country of Senegal. 

The manufacturer said it is supporting the establishment of an assembly plant in the West African state and will then supply components that will be assembled there.

""With this project, our vehicles will enter the Senegalese market in close coordination with the German Federal Government. The delivery of CKD kits for on-site assembly, the transfer of know-how and comprehensive technical advice are our contributions to a successful, partnership-based cooperation,"" said Franziska Cusumano, CEO of Mercedes-Benz Special Trucks.

The plant is intended to supply special vehicles for defence, disaster relief and municipal tasks for the Senegalese market. 

Daimler Truck currently has locations on the continent in South Africa and Kenya.

Elon Musk wants to shake up the two-party system in the US after clashing with Donald Trump — but history hasn't been kind to third parties.

It appears the world's wealthiest person has set his mind to a new startup: his own political party.

As the ongoing public fracturing of the relationship between the US President Donald Trump and his top election financier continues to play out in public, Elon Musk has again vented his opposition to the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" a tax and spending bill, which he believes undoes the efficiency mantra he sought to instill in Washington.

Musk has gone as far to warn Republican lawmakers who pass the bill that he'll run candidates against them in next year's primaries.

And he also threatened the broader US two-party system with the promise he'll form a faction of his own.

""If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,"" he wrote on X. ""Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.""

A genuinely competitive third party would upend more than a century of Democrats-Republicans dominance at all levels of government. 

Yet few have come close, despite dozens of minor parties operating across the US for decades.

The Libertarian Party, established in 1971, is the third biggest in America. Campaigning for free markets, small government and personal freedoms, it had its best presidential election performance in 2016 with candidate Gary Johnson, who won 3.27% of the nationwide vote.

But that's a long way from the tens of millions of votes needed to win the White House, a governorship or even a state legislature seat.

The Green Party is another long-running party that has run candidates in state and federal races. Like the Libertarians, it too holds no seats in government.

The very nature of the American political system is the ""winner takes all"" principle through the widespread use of a ""first past the post"" voting system. This delivers victory to candidates with the most votes — almost always a Republican or Democrat.

There are other factors hampering success, according to Bernard Tamas, a political scientist at Valdosta State University, US, who has written extensively on the subject.

Tamas said it's fundamental for a third party to tap into popular unrest — a large number of people who are dissatisfied with the current political options — and build a groundswell grassroots movement.

""One of the biggest problems with the parties that have emerged is that they're not really tapping into that anger,"" Tamas said. Upstart parties instead ""tend to be more wishy-washy and [are] not really focusing in on that strong urge for change.""

If tapping into grassroots is essential, so is money.

Parties spend billions of dollars to get their candidates elected. According to donations watchdog OpenSecrets, nearly $16 billion (about €13.58 billion) was spent across the 2024 presidential and congressional races.

Musk himself was the biggest donor in the 2023-24 election cycle. He gave more than $291 million to Republicans across all races.

Massive campaign war chests help parties ""get out the vote"" — buying the advertising and campaigning materials that expose candidates to the public and earn their vote.

It doesn't guarantee a win — the Democrats spent more than the Republicans in 2024 — but it certainly helps.

""You need money for things like ballot access and a number of other things, but no third party would ever have enough money to compete against the Republicans and Democrats on their own terms,"" said Tamas.

Could a genuine third party supplant the Democrats or Republicans? It's unlikely in Tamas's view. 

Instead of winning seats and building long-term success, Tamas said they instead ""sting like a bee.""

""They emerge very quickly, they run a bunch of candidates all over the country and then they cause one or both major parties major pain,"" Tamas said. ""They basically are pulling away votes.""

This is called the ""spoiler effect"", where protest candidates leech votes away from an often ideologically similar mainstream candidate. In some cases, they could pull away enough votes that a frontrunner loses the lead and falls to second place.

It's the fear of a third party groundswell that causes the major parties to alter their policies to appease these voters.

Once the change is achieved, like a bee that's stung its victim,""it dies.""

""The most successful third parties in America last about a decade. Once they become too much of a threat, the major parties start stealing their rhetoric, their ideology,"" said Tamas.

Not all Americans are happy with their options.

Donald Trump's net approval rating is in negative territory and YouGov's latest polls found almost 3 in 5 Americans view the Democratic Party unfavorably. In 2022, a Pew Research analysis found overall support for more parties in the political system.

But it doesn't mean a new party would succeed. A study by two US political scientists in May 2024 found ""disaffected partisans"" — Republicans and Democrats unsatisfied with their own parties — were less likely to vote for a third, more centrist alternative.

Tapping into popular anger and frustration with the status quo, Tamas said, is the fastest pathway to success. For a person like Musk, he might do well to look towards the ""Fight Oligarchy"" movement of left-wing opponents like Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders currently touring America, or the original MAGA movement, if he wants to start a party.

""These are very good examples to follow… the tapping into people's grievances is really it,"" Tamas said.

""They force the [major] parties to respond by threatening their careers and their livelihood.""

Sean “Diddy” Combs has been cleared of sex trafficking his ex-girlfriends through a decades-long criminal enterprise, in a case that has rocked the music industry.

He was convicted on two counts of transportation for prostitution, but cleared of the most serious charges, including racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.

Had he been convicted, the 55-year-old was facing the possibility of dying in jail.

The verdict is something of a partial victory for the music mogul, who has spent 10 months in federal prison vehemently denying the allegations.

His alleged victims, including his ex-girlfriend, the singer Cassie Ventura, now face the reality of having aired some of their most harrowing and intimate moments during one of the most closely-watched celebrity trials of the last decade.

The mogul is also facing a number of civil suits relating to coercion and sexual misconduct. Questions now abound over the likelihood he ever sees the light of day.

After he was cleared on the most serious charges, Combs clutched his lawyer Teny Geragos's hand before clenching and shaking his fists and later holding his head in his hands in relief.

Combs then got on his knees, his forearms planted on the black leather defence chair, and appeared to pray.

Over the last two months the jury was shown reams of text messages between Combs and his exes, images and clips of freak-offs – drug-fuelled sex parties – and one particularly harrowing video of Ventura being beaten and dragged by him.

“Mr Combs has been given his life by this jury,” Marc Agnifilo, his lawyer, told the court as he made a case for his client to be released on bail today.

“In light of the fact that Mr Combs is no longer charged with sex trafficking... he should be released,” Marc Agnifilo said.

The music mogul vigorously shook his head as the judge said he was aware Combs did not want to return to federal prison in Brooklyn.

As he left the courtroom, Combs turned to face his family and said: “I'll be home soon.” He added: “I love you, baby” and, “I love you, Mom.”

The lawyer of Cassie Ventura, an R&B singer and Combs's former girlfriend who testified in court, responded to the verdict by saying her testimony had “paved the way” for him to be found guilty on two counts.

Praising the courage of her client, Doug Wigdor said she had “left an indelible mark” on the entertainment industry through speaking out, and had “brought attention” to the actions of Combs.

Mr Wigdor said Ventura had shown “exemplary courage throughout this trial,” and “brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussion”.

“This case proved that change is long overdue, and we will continue to fight on behalf of survivors,” he said.

Prosecutors had argued Combs ran a decades-long criminal enterprise in which he used his power in the music industry, along with violence and money, to coerce girlfriends into taking part in days-long sex parties involving male sex workers.

The defence argued these sexual encounters were consensual and amounted to nothing more than a “swinger's lifestyle”.

For the past two months, in a wood-panelled courtroom on the 26th floor of Manhattan federal court, the world of glamour, excess and celebrity has collided with allegations of heinous sex crimes.

A jury of eight men and four women sat through weeks of disturbing testimony describing alleged brazen and brutal beatings carried out by a man so powerful he was deemed untouchable.

But after just over 14 hours of deliberation, while they found Combs guilty of two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, they acquitted him of the most serious charges. Had Combs been found guilty of sex trafficking or racketeering conspiracy, he could have spent the rest of his life in prison.

It had been a spectacular and disturbing fall from grace for the star.

At a film premiere in 2003, Combs wore a T-shirt that proclaimed “I am the American dream”. For a time, the university dropout really was.

The Grammy winner has 11 number one hits and is a multi-millionaire. He became well-known in the industry for hosting extravagant white parties attended by the A-list.

Combs, 55, surrounded himself with a small group of Hollywood's party boys at these events, including Ashton Kutcher and Leonardo DiCaprio.

Hugely successful in his own right, he has also been credited with shaping the careers of the Notorious B.I.G., Mary J Blige, and Faith Evans, among others. Later, he adopted Usher and Justin Bieber as proteges.

In the weeks leading up to the trial, Bieber's team released a statement saying that he was not one of Combs's victims after rumours had circulated online about the nature of his relationship with his much older mentor.

The charges against Combs, which stretch back more than a decade, included allegations that he intimidated women into days-long orgies with male prostitutes – events he called “freak-offs”.

He allegedly doled out drugs to keep the participants compliant.

With scores of witnesses testifying about Combs's alleged horrific and sometimes public abuse, questions have lingered about how his web of secrets remained hidden until now.

He pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations against him.

The jury watched videos of the highly choreographed “freak-offs”, involving dozens of bottles of baby oil, mood lighting and an array of illegal drugs.

Combs would take control of his victims' lives, the prosecution argued. He paid their rent and, in Ventura's case, had her career in his hands as she signed up with his label Bad Boy Records aged 20 in 2006.

If anyone expressed a desire to get “off the hamster wheel” of drug-fuelled sex parties, he frequently became violent and threatened to release videos of the encounters, prosecutors alleged.

The court was told that he once allegedly beat Ventura so savagely that her injuries brought his security guards to tears. Another time, she required plastic surgery, the court heard.

Once the epitome of glamour and excess, Combs, who was known at times as Puff Daddy, Puffy, P Diddy, Diddy, and Love, appeared a shadow of his former self in court.

The man who once called himself the “king” had his throne reduced to a chair at the defence table in the Lower Manhattan federal courtroom.

During his 10 months at the Metropolitan Detention Centrev in Brooklyn, his previously dyed black hair and beard had grown out and turned white.

His prison-issued jumpers a far cry from the black suit adorned with 600 Swarovski crystals and matching cape he wore in 2023.

The only members of his once abundant entourage to show up in support of Combs in court were his family – save for a brief appearance from Kanye West, who himself has suffered a public fall from grace.

Packed into the court's front rows, his mother and six of his seven children sat in the courtroom adorned in designer clothing while Combs blew them kisses from the defence table.

The rapper was born in Harlem, New York, in 1969 to Janice, a kindergarten teacher, and Melvin, a drug dealer.

When his father was shot dead in his car in 1972, he and his mother moved to Mount Vernon, a middle-class suburb north of the Bronx.

His classmates at Mount Saint Michael Academy, an all-boys private Catholic high school, remember him as a popular teenager who moved effortlessly between every group.

Giovanni Zagrelli, who was in Combs's year at school, told The Telegraph: “He was always a really good kid, always had a smile on his face.

“I remember during lunch, he would go from table to table, he talked to everybody.”

But signs of his volatility were already there.

Combs said he earned the nickname Puffy as a child because he had a “temper” and was known to “huff and puff” when he was angry.

After school, Combs went to the prestigious Howard University in Washington DC, Kamala Harris's alma mater, where he gained a reputation for throwing raucous parties and met several of his future label executives.

He dropped out after two years to pursue a music career, and quickly became a rising star at Uptown Records when he helped Mary J Blige and Jodeci go multi-platinum.

He was fired in 1993 and went on to launch Bad Boy Entertainment with a reported $10 million investment. From there, his career soared.

“It is a Horatio Alga story like none other that I've seen in front of me, and I've seen quite a few,” said Prince Charles Alexander, 66, a producer who worked with Combs from 1990 until 2004.

The “young kid” he first met was “detail-oriented, focused and a hustler”.

“He had something,” he told The Telegraph, reflecting on Combs's ability to make and market a music star.

One of Combs's defining career moments was the discovery of Christopher Wallace, the late rapper known as the Notorious B.I.G., which cemented his position as a force in the music industry.

His empire continued to grow. He launched a solo album, a clothing line and signed a deal to promote Ciroc Vodka.

As his star rose, Combs became “more coarse” and “extra”, according to Mr Alexander, who described himself as an uncle or big brother figure to Combs.

“There came a point in his life where listening to anyone was just not his reality any more because he had made moves that nobody around him could make,” he added.

“So who do you listen to when you are the one making all the right moves?”

In 2004, Mr Alexander walked. “I felt like any minute now he's getting a little bit too rambunctious, any minute now he's gonna probably come at me... and we will fight.”

Combs met Ventura, a 19-year-old model from Connecticut, the following year.

Shortly after they began dating, Ventura alleges that Combs coerced her into taking part in “freak-offs” that would last up to four days and became her full-time job, she told the court.

Ventura would have to wear high heels and lingerie during these drug-fuelled, sordid nights in luxury hotel rooms, the jury was told.

She slept with several male escorts at Combs's direction during these “parties”, with his assistants testifying they would get the rooms ready and clean up the mess afterwards.

On the stand, she described how Combs would subject her to savage beatings, sometimes in public.

“He would mash me on my head, knock me over, drag me, kick me, stomp me on the head if I was down … I would get knots on my forehead, bruised lips … black eyes and the whites of my eyes would be red. Bruises all over my body,” she said.

The jury was shown CCTV footage of him dragging and kicking her outside the lifts at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016, she told the jury she was attempting to leave a freak-off and he would not allow it.

One witness testified Combs violently attacked Ventura at a lavish 2010 dinner in West Hollywood filled R&B superstars and music executives.

Music royalty, including Grammy-winning stars Usher and Ne-Yo, were among the guests, as well as Jimmy Iovine, the chief executive of Interscope Records, according to court testimony.

But as the Hollywood dinner was in full swing, things took a turn.

Combs allegedly beat Ventura, his girlfriend at the time, in front of the A-list guests, punching her so hard in the stomach that she doubled over in pain.

“No one intervened,” said Dawn Richard, a singer present at the dinner, during her testimony at Manhattan federal court.

Another victim, who testified under the pseudonym Jane, described a similar pattern of abuse. She claimed Combs wooed her on a glamorous trip to Turks and Caicos and the Bahamas before asking her to take part in “hotel nights”, which became more and more frequent.

A few years later, they entered into a “love contract” where he would pay her $10,000 a month in the form of rent payments. If she told him she did not want to take part in “freak-offs” any more, he would threaten to stop paying.

One night in June 2024, Jane said Combs kicked down four doors in her home after they argued, attacked her and then told her to have sex with an escort.

The defence tried to paint Ventura and Jane as willing participants in the “parties” who were driven by money.

The jury reached a verdict after weeks of gruelling testimony, though Combs still has dozens of outstanding lawsuits against him, which include allegations from men and women that he drugged and raped them.

Combs has vehemently denied all the claims.

When this trial started nearly two months ago, defence lawyer Ms Geragos made an extraordinary admission in her opening statement: Combs was a domestic abuser with a vicious temper.

Combs's beating of Ventura at the InterContinental was “indefensible, horrible, dehumanising and violent”, she said.

“But it is not evidence of sex trafficking,” she added, “It is evidence of domestic violence.”

It was a bold and unconventional legal strategy, painting her client as a domestic abuser from the outset.

In the end, it was one that paid off.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

One summer day in 2017, a front-page story in the StarNews of Wilmington, North Carolina, shook up the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals.

It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Few knew about the contaminated water until the article described the discoveries of scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency and a state university. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger.

In the onslaught of legal action and activism that followed, the EPA during President Donald Trump's first term took an assertive stance, vowing to combat the spread of PFAS nationwide.

In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. It would, for example, consider limiting the presence of two of the best-known compounds — PFOA and PFOS — in drinking water. And, it said, it would find out more about the potential harm of GenX, which was virtually unregulated.

By the time Trump was sworn in for his second term, many of the plan's suggestions had been put in place. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits.

But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. The EPA said in May that it will delay enforcement on the drinking water limits for PFOA and PFOS until 2031, and it will rescind and reconsider the limits on the other four. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn't follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX.

These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. The agency also slowed down a process for finding out how industries have used the chemicals, a step prompted by a law signed by Trump in 2019.

At the same time, the EPA is hampering its ability to research pollutants — the kind of research that made it possible for its own scientists to investigate GenX. As the Trump administration seeks severe reductions in the EPA's budget, the agency has terminated grants for PFAS studies and paralyzed its scientists with spending restrictions.

Pointing to earlier announcements on its approach to the chemicals, the EPA told ProPublica that it's “committed to addressing PFAS in drinking water and ensuring that regulations issued under the Safe Drinking Water Act follow the law, follow the science, and can be implemented by water systems to strengthen public health protections.”

“If anything,” the agency added, “the Trump administration's historic PFAS plan in 2019 laid the groundwork for the first steps to comprehensively address this contamination across media and we will continue to do so this term.”

In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent.

“What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said.

That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. The EPA reviewed GenX, for example, during both the first Trump and Biden administrations. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.)

Scientists and advocates also said it's unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research.

“I don't understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. “I don't understand it.”

Favored for their nonstick and liquid-resistant qualities, synthetic PFAS chemicals are widely used in products like raincoats, cookware and fast food wrappers. Manufacturers made the chemicals for decades without disclosing how certain types are toxic at extremely low levels, can accumulate in the body and will scarcely break down over time — hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”

The chemicals persist in soil and water too, making them complicated and costly to clean up, leading to a yearslong push to get such sites covered by the EPA's Superfund program, which is designed to handle toxic swaths of land. During the first Trump administration, the EPA said it was taking steps toward designating the two legacy compounds, PFOA and PFOS, as “hazardous substances” under the Superfund program. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up.

Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump's first term. Zeldin's EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step.

The designation became official under Biden. But business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and organizations representing the construction, recycling and chemical industries, sued. Project 2025, The Heritage Foundation's playbook for the new administration, also questioned it.

Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible.

The agency said in a recent motion it needed the latest pause because new leadership is still reviewing the issues and evaluating the designation in context of its “comprehensive strategy to address PFOA and PFOS.”

The EPA also delayed a rule requiring manufacturers and importers to report details about their PFAS use between 2011 and 2022. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process.

When Biden's EPA finalized it, the agency said the rule would provide the largest-ever dataset of PFAS manufactured and used in the United States. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted.

Businesses were supposed to start reporting this month. But in a May 2 letter, a coalition of chemical companies petitioned the EPA to withdraw the deadline, reconsider the rule and issue a revised one with narrowed scope.

When the EPA delayed the rule less than two weeks later, it said it needed time to prepare for data collection and to consider changes to aspects of the rule.

In an email to ProPublica, the agency said it will address PFAS in many ways. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don't benefit public health.”

The court expects an update from the EPA in the Superfund designation case by Wednesday, and in the legal challenges to the drinking water standards by July 21. The EPA could continue defending the rules. It could ask the court for permission to reverse its position or to send the rules back to the agency for reconsideration. Or it could also ask for further pauses.

“It's just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases.

Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out.

A consent order between the state and Chemours required the manufacturer to drastically reduce the release of GenX and other PFAS into the environment. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.)

Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.”

PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water.

Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they're held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. In the fast-growing region, new residents are just learning about the chemicals, she said, and they're angry.

“I feel like we're walking backwards,” Donovan said. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.”

“It's one thing to say you're going to focus on PFAS,” she added. “It's another thing to never let it cross the finish line and become any meaningful regulation.”

The EPA of Trump's first term didn't just call for more regulation of PFAS, it also stressed the importance of better understanding the forever chemicals through research and testing.

In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina's investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. And it described its efforts to develop the science on PFAS issues affecting rural economies with “first-of-its-kind funding for the agriculture sector.”

Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said.

At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois.

Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year's growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. Then the EPA canceled two grants.

In virtually identical letters, the agency said that each grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities. The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”

The contrast between the agency's words and actions raises questions about the process behind its decisions, said Cheryl Murphy, head of Michigan State's Center for PFAS Research and co-lead of one of the projects.

“If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we're doing is we're undermining our ability to translate the science that we're developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.”

At least some of the researchers are appealing the terminations.

About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. The EPA told ProPublica that “there will be more updates on research-related grants in the future.”

Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. “We will miss the season for this year,” he said in an email, “and could lose the livestock on the farm for the research.”

Federal researchers are also in limbo. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don't know how much longer we will be operating as is.”

The EPA told ProPublica that it's “continuing to invest in research and labs, including Duluth, to advance the mission of protecting human health and the environment.”

Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. One dates back to President Ronald Reagan's administration. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump's first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey.

The EPA lost 727 employees in voluntary separations between Jan. 1 and late June, according to numbers the agency provided to ProPublica. It said it received more than 2,600 applications for the second round of deferred resignations and voluntary early retirements.

“These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.”

The shake-up also worries DeWitt, who was one of the scientists who helped investigate the Cape Fear River contamination and who has served on an EPA science advisory board. Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA's workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.

“Taking away this talent from our federal sector,” she said, will have “profound effects on the agency's ability to protect people in the United States from hazardous chemicals in air, in water, in soil and potentially in food.”

“Speak plainly!” Russian President Vladimir Putin snapped at his foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, at a televised security council meeting on the eve of his shambolic full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Naryshkin was visibly nervous. Once he had finally stammered out his support for recognizing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states—the words Putin was waiting for—he was abruptly told to sit down, like an unprepared pupil flubbing an oral exam. Naryshkin's apparent ambivalence about embracing Putin's pretext for the war was likely due to the lack of solid intelligence that Putin's “special military operation” would return Kyiv to Moscow's imperial orbit. But rather than air any misgivings, Naryshkin chose compliance and conformity. The intelligence may have been hazy, but the risks of contradicting Putin were clear.

Putin's unwavering belief that Ukraine would swiftly capitulate represents the greatest intelligence failure of his quarter-century tenure in power. He was furious when his invasion did not unfold as he envisioned, casting blame on and even arresting some senior security officials. But Putin had laid his own trap. Like many authoritarians, he had fostered conditions in which subordinates told him only what he wanted to hear. Intelligence, in its best form, encourages political leaders to ask the right questions, challenge their assumptions, and consider what might go wrong. Although intelligence officers have a professional responsibility to adapt to the interests, foreign policy priorities, and preferred briefing style of the leaders they serve, sometimes the highest form of service an intelligence agency can provide is to disabuse its political masters of a strongly held but false idea.

The United States possesses an intelligence community that is the envy of the world. But under President Donald Trump, some of the same pathologies that make authoritarian regimes prone to intelligence failures are making the U.S. system similarly vulnerable. His populist, personalist style has led him to disregard the value of intelligence and abuse the agencies that produce it. In late June, the day before he sent U.S. bombers to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump dismissed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's congressional testimony that Iran was not close to developing a nuclear weapon—an assessment that conflicted with the president's own claims. “I don't care what she says,” Trump said. After the U.S. strikes, he triumphantly declared that the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were “completely and totally obliterated,” whereas a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report made a more conservative estimation of the damage.

The problem is not just that Trump himself belittles intelligence. His administration is also creating conditions in which senior officials tailor their assessments to please him. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth repeated Trump's hyperbolic claims of obliteration, brushing aside his own intelligence agency's report. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the “alleged ‘assessment' is flat-out wrong.” Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, quickly claimed to find “new intelligence” to support Trump's interpretation of events but declined to share it publicly.

Increasingly staffed by loyalists rather than seasoned professionals—one critical counterterrorism office in the Department of Homeland Security suddenly found itself under the command of a recent university graduate with no national security experience—intelligence agencies risk becoming overly politicized, providing justification for policy decisions rather than informing them. Meanwhile, the United States faces serious national security threats, not least a heightened terrorism threat as Iranian-backed groups seek retaliation for the United States' strikes on Iran. Whether it results in a terrorist or cyber attack, a foreign policy miscalculation, or a military surprise, the consequences of an intelligence failure could be profound. And the risk is only growing.

Intelligence failures are inevitable even in healthy systems. Uncovering and properly assessing secrets is hard at the best of times; human fallibility guarantees that there will be errors in process and analysis. But distortions within the system increase the likelihood of failure. The classic case is an authoritarian regime in which the self-assured ruler does not tolerate other views. Intelligence officers in such systems operate in an environment where speaking truth to power is not tolerated, acquiescence is preferred over expertise, sycophancy trumps insight, and “alternative facts” must be presented to maintain the leader's preferred narrative. Offering good-faith assessments that contradict the ruler's views is considered disloyalty and invites punishment. Without space for analytical dissent and the presentation of unvarnished views, leaders can receive and act on faulty intelligence, as the hapless Naryshkin could attest.

The United States today faces a similar risk. Trump's populism is characterized by deep skepticism toward credentialed authority and an intolerance of experts who present inconvenient facts or analysis that challenge his movement's core beliefs. As authoritarian leaders do, Trump has surrounded himself with loyalists who pass ideological litmus tests, such as by insisting that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. The resulting culture of politicized analysis, self-censorship, and suppression of unwelcome truths mirrors the conditions in autocracies that generate intelligence failure.



The most important qualification to serve Trump is personal loyalty, not competence or relevant experience. Of course, a U.S. president should be able to expect a degree of loyalty from federal employees. But the expectations of the Trump administration place personal allegiance above the truth. Several long-serving professionals have been asked who they voted for as a prerequisite for traditionally apolitical national security positions—a kind of loyalty test that disqualifies capable officers and sends a message to those who remain that continued service means compliance.

Loyal senior intelligence officials serving a populist or an autocrat will often tailor their agencies' activities on the basis of what the leader may or may not want to hear. This can cause intelligence resources to be directed away from actual threats. As director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, Kash Patel has reorganized the agency to divert special agents and analysts toward immigration enforcement and the reduction of violent crime, leaving investigations into threats with more serious national security implications—counterterrorism, cybercrime, Chinese or Russian intelligence activity in the United States—underresourced. Although curtailing violent crime is a laudable goal, protecting U.S. national security requires that the FBI and other agencies manage a far wider array of risks.

This is not the only example of the Trump administration's sidelining or shuttering intelligence units that focus on foreign malign influence operations, nor is it the only redirection of resources away from serious threats to serve political interests. In early May, Gabbard directed U.S. intelligence agencies to increase their intelligence collection in Greenland, specifically to assess the strength of the island's independence movement. Greenland, an autonomous territory of a NATO ally, is not a security threat to the United States; the reason for gathering such intelligence is to support Trump's proposal that the United States annex the island. Intelligence agencies do not have unlimited bandwidth. If they are wasting valuable resources on nonexistent threats or dubious schemes to take control of other countries' territories, they are more likely to be surprised by the plans and intentions of adversaries such as China, Iran, and Russia.

Politicians are always tempted to strip out caveats, overstate analytical confidence levels, or downplay dissenting views, as Trump did when he dismissed as “inconclusive” the DIA's initial report on damage to the Iranian nuclear program. His is not the first U.S. administration to prefer intelligence that fits around a particular policy narrative. In the late 1960s, frustrated with the United States' lack of progress during the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson preferred the Pentagon's rosier assessments of the war's trajectory to the CIA's more pessimistic views—which distorted his understanding of the war and caused him to hold out false hope for a failing escalation strategy. And in 2002, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld set up the Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon to establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaeda—a connection the CIA did not find credible—to support the case for a U.S. invasion of Iraq.

In both cases, cherry-picking intelligence led U.S. presidents toward strategic failure. But the lessons of history have apparently been lost in the present White House. In May, Gabbard fired the acting chair of the National Intelligence Council and his deputy after they assessed that the Venezuelan-based criminal group Tren de Aragua was not controlled by the Venezuelan government, contrary to the claim the Trump administration has used to justify its deportation of Venezuelans. When they first reached this conclusion, Gabbard's chief of staff, a Trump loyalist, asked the council to “relook” at the evidence and “do some rewriting” so that the assessment would not be “used against” Gabbard or Trump—a nakedly political request. The NIC leaders broadly maintained their initial judgment rather than amend their assessment to suit the president's policy, and it cost them their jobs.

It is easy to foresee how firing intelligence officials for making evidence-based assessments could drive those still serving to engage in self-censorship and groupthink, both key ingredients in intelligence failure that are prevalent in autocratic systems. Brave analysts may no longer be willing to stick their heads above the parapet to provide intelligence that Trump needs to know, even if he doesn't want to hear it. And if the president only receives assessments designed to please him, he will become stuck in his own echo chamber, unable to make fully informed decisions based on hard reality.

The blatant politicization of intelligence has consequences beyond the halls of the White House. During the dark days of the Bush administration's clamor for war in Iraq, the U.S. intelligence community lost credibility not only with the American people but also with partners abroad. The same corrosion of civic trust and falling confidence of allies is underway today. If the United States' allies and partners consider U.S. intelligence untrustworthy or worry that their own intelligence may become politicized, they may choose to share less with Washington, which could rob U.S. intelligence agencies of a vital clue they may need to foil a plot or understand a key development. Cooperation with foreign agencies is a central part of U.S. intelligence gathering. Washington itself has enormous capabilities, but it cannot replace the collection and analysis provided by its partners.

While publicly claiming that its actions are meant to depoliticize U.S. intelligence agencies, the Trump administration has in fact politicized them further by pressuring them to produce assessments that reinforce preferred policy narratives, dismissing assessments that don't, purging staff members who are perceived to be disloyal, and harassing the workforce through methods such as random polygraph tests conducted under the guise of leak investigations. It is clear to members of the civil service that their positions are subject to the administration's whims. Like the NIC leaders, they could be fired for simply doing their jobs. Like staff members working in diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, they could be fired for doing a job the administration did not want done. Like six National Security Council staffers who were let go after Trump met with the far-right activist Laura Loomer, they could be fired for perceived disloyalty. Or, like the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, they could be fired for no stated reason at all.

Administrative chaos masquerading as cost-cutting has sapped morale. In March, Trump's adviser Elon Musk and staffers at his so-called Department of Government Efficiency visited the CIA and the NSA headquarters, sending shivers down the spines of career professionals. Shortly afterward, both agencies announced thousands of job cuts, mostly in the form of rescinded job offers, layoffs of new hires, routine retirements, and voluntary buyouts. The buyout offer enticed several senior intelligence officers out of public service, although many stated privately that the offer only made the difficult decision to resign easier to swallow. Not only does their premature departure deprive the administration of their expertise and experience, but the cancellation of job offers means they will not be replaced by promising young officers brimming with passion and patriotism.

Ideally, intelligence agencies should welcome and harness talent from all corners. Narrowing the talent pool robs the country of the opportunity to tap the full potential of its citizens, undermining the potential contributions of intelligence to statecraft. In the Soviet Union, only Communist Party members were permitted to join the primary intelligence agency, the KGB. That commitment to Marxist-Leninist ideological purity damaged the KGB's analytical performance: the agency routinely underestimated the resilience of Western cohesion and overestimated the strength of Soviet client states and revolutionary movements. During World War II, British intelligence benefited from Alan Turing's codebreaking genius in part because he kept his homosexuality hidden. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is repelling talent by making it clear that it no longer values diverse perspectives in U.S. intelligence agencies. Instead of simply reassigning officers who had had been temporarily detailed to work on DEI initiatives in the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the administration fired them when those initiatives were shut down, sending the message that it expects ideological conformity.



A U.S. intelligence community that increasingly operates like that of an autocratic country will struggle to retain employees and recruit new ones. At the moment, public service may not look appealing to America's best and brightest. Worse, the current workforce is demoralized and distracted by the purges and the abuse of the system that they witness. Thousands of intelligence officers are tapping their professional networks and getting their secret resumes cleared so that they can apply for private-sector jobs. A nervous and preoccupied workforce will hardly deliver peak performance.

The Trump administration's proximity to conspiracy theorizing also corrodes its relationship to intelligence. Loomer, whose meeting with Trump prompted several high-profile intelligence agency firings, is known for promoting conspiracy theories, including the unsubstantiated claim that the 9/11 attacks were an “inside job.” Other members of the Trump administration, such as Dan Bongino, the deputy FBI director, have openly floated conspiracy theories accusing the “deep state” of withholding the truth from the American people on every topic from the prison death of the criminal defendant Jeffrey Epstein to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. No genuine conspiracies have been uncovered, but the vilification of U.S. intelligence agencies deemed part of the “deep state” has a lasting effect on the perceived legitimacy of the work they do.

Demonizing intelligence ultimately makes the United States less safe. Intelligence agencies need the support of the public if they are to do their jobs well. Federal law enforcement, for instance, relies on tips from citizens; repeatedly calling the FBI “irredeemably corrupt”—in the words of its deputy director—may dissuade people from cooperating when approached by special agents. And if Trump-aligned media outlets are spouting populist rhetoric about the threat from within—specifically, the threat that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies pose to civil liberties—politicians may find it difficult to support legislation that enables necessary intelligence gathering. Early last year, when it came time to reauthorize Section 702 of a 2008 amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a key provision that permits the U.S. government to surveil foreign citizens outside the United States, the same people who are now leading the FBI joined far-right media outlets to misleadingly paint the law as providing Orwellian power to an unaccountable deep state. The provision was eventually renewed for two more years, but the episode illustrated the vulnerability of intelligence agencies' most valuable tools to exaggerated political rhetoric.

Trump is not a born intelligence consumer. Judging by the infrequency of his briefings in this area—his public schedule has not included more than one per week, in contrast to the six per week that his predecessors typically received—he seems uninterested in the advantages good intelligence can confer. He operates on instinct and often justifies his polices as “common sense,” which is the sort of populist heuristic approach that does not align with the methodical process of intelligence analysts. Trump prefers slogans over substance, narrative over nuance, and conspiracy over curiosity. He avoids digging into details. His ideological positions run headlong into empiricism, as the administration's fight with economists over the effects of its tariff policy has shown. Trump seems to value intelligence only when it validates his own instinct; he does not look to it to challenge his beliefs or to help him consider different angles.

The way the Trump administration is managing the U.S. intelligence system increases the likelihood of an intelligence failure. It could take the form of a surprise attack, a misreading of an adversary, or an inability to anticipate another consequential event. Trump has ignored warnings before. During his first term, he was slow to respond to alerts about the spread of COVID-19, hindering the United States' early pandemic response, and he was dismissive of the security risks of aggressive homegrown nativism presented to him by intelligence analysts at the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in the lead-up to the storming of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.



Something similar could happen today. Warnings, repeatedly dismissed with prejudice, may eventually stop arriving. Intelligence may fail because critical information may not reach Trump. Fear of retribution could cause officials to self-censor or avoid providing assessments that may provoke an ideologically motivated backlash, such as alerts about domestic violent extremism among far-right groups or about Russian information operations. As the former senior CIA analyst Brian O'Neill wrote in Just Security last month, “the next intelligence failure will not be a surprise. It will be a choice.”

An intelligence failure on his watch may not compel Trump to fix the problems that caused it. Instead, he could blame U.S. intelligence agencies for falling down on the job or even falsely suggest that they were always out to get him. Any reform his administration introduced after an intelligence failure would likely be designed to further politicize the intelligence community, weaken its independence, and give the executive branch greater control of its budgets, personnel, and authorities.

A talented sports team coached badly can still squeak out a win. If the United States avoids a major intelligence failure in the next few years, it will be thanks to the enduring professional ethos of its intelligence agencies. But those agencies will not be reaching their highest potential; if they are consistently misused, ignored, and politicized, they will not be able to produce the information advantage that the intelligence community was designed to deliver to the U.S. president. Trump is enamored of the United States' natural resources—its oil and natural gas, its timber, its agriculture. The country's unparalleled intelligence community is another precious resource, a pillar of the “greatness” Trump strives for. Ensuring American security today and for future generations depends on his good stewardship of this national treasure.

    Editor's Note: Design for Impact is a series spotlighting innovative solutions for communities affected by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies.



            In the multibillion-dollar global fight against wildfires, early detection is critical. Satellites, drones, thermal cameras and manned lookout towers are just some of the tools currently used to alert authorities and first responders to imminent threats.
    


            In under-resourced areas, however, these defenses can be prohibitively expensive. That's why a group of recent design graduates has developed a smaller, simpler and, they say, cheaper solution: A pinecone-sized fire detector that can give vulnerable communities an invaluable head start in the race to escape or contain major blazes.
    


            Made primarily from wax and charcoal composites, Pyri's sensors are designed to blend in with — and leave no footprint on — the environment. The device can be deployed in fire-prone areas and left for years without maintenance, according to its creators. When a fire occurs, the heat melts an internal trigger, producing a low-frequency signal that raises the alarm.
    


            “It can help people evacuate sooner, and it can stop fires from growing before they're uncontrollable — before they're really devastating,” Pyri co-founder Karina Gunadi told CNN in a video interview. “If you can catch a fire small, it's a lot easier to put out.”

            Pyri started in London as a college assignment between four design engineering students, three of whom decided to pursue it as a commercial venture beyond their graduation last year. Their company's name comes from the scientific word “pyriscence,” which describes the ways nature adapts to wildfires.
    


            As an example of a “fire-dependent species,” Gunadi pointed to various types of pine tree that not only thrive in fire-prone areas — they need blazes to reproduce, as their seeds are only released when the resin sealing their pinecones melts in high heat.
    


            This idea directly influenced Gunadi and her fellow designers. “What if we can be inspired by how nature already responds to fire, take that, use nature-based materials and create the simplest form of wildfire detection we can?” she said, recalling the genesis of the group's design.
    


            Pyri's pinecone-like appearance is also functional: The lightweight sensors' shape and ribbed structure helps protect them against impact, especially if deployed from the air when covering large or hard-to reach areas. But the designers also wanted them to escape the attention of passersby, whether human or animal.
    


            “We've actually lost one in the environment. So, in terms of camouflage, we're doing maybe a little too well!” Gunadi joked.
    


            Another major challenge stems from the co-founders' commitment to non-toxic materials — especially when it comes to the electronics required to produce a signal. Although Pyri is not publicly detailing its trigger technology or disclosing its precise material composition (a patent application is pending), the designers looked to organic electronics and are avoiding rare earth metals and lithium-ion batteries. Once the devices “burn up,” Gunadi wants to ensure they are “not going to leave any negative impact on the environment.”
    


            Extreme wildfires are becoming more frequent globally, with fire seasons now longer, hotter and drier than before. Climate change is a major contributor, as drought and rising global temperatures make the infernos bigger, faster and harder to stop. This, in turn, may worsen the climate crisis. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), wildfires were responsible for an estimated 6,687 megatons of carbon dioxide pollution in 2023 — seven times more than was emitted by global aviation that year.

            UNEP predicts a 30% increase in extreme fires by the end of 2050 — and a 50% increase by the end of the century. Major blazes are also occurring in places that have not, historically, been considered fire-prone, from America's eastern seaboard to Siberia, Russia.
    


            The impact of wildfires is, for Pyri's creators, personal. One of the company's co-founders, Richard Alexandre, hails from Brazil, where he witnessed first-hand the devastation of forest fires in Pantanal, a region that experienced a record-breaking number of blazes last summer. Gunadi, meanwhile, grew up in Palo Alto, California. She was living in San Francisco during the 2020 North Complex Fire that engulfed the city in smoke.
    


            “I woke up and the sky was dark orange, and it was like that for days,” she recalled. “That was really scary.”
    


            Wildfires spread at speeds of up to 14 miles per hour, so every minute counts. A 2020 study into early bushfire detection by the Australian National University found that a one-hour reduction in response time could reduce the frequency of large fires by 16%.

            Earlier this year, the outgoing Biden-Harris administration earmarked $15 million in funding to construct and deploy a “new suite of fire weather observing systems” in high-risk US locations (though it is unclear what impact, if any, President Donald Trump's attempts to block funds associated with the bipartisan infrastructure law will have on these programs). Google, meanwhile, recently announced $13 million in funding for its FireSat initiative, which will use a “constellation of satellites” to track fires as small as 5 square meters (54 square feet) using realtime images that refresh every 20 minutes.
    


            Pyri is by no means the only company developing simpler, on-the-ground sensor technology. Since 2019, the US Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) has been researching and trialing new wildfire detectors in collaboration with small businesses including Maryland-based N5 Sensors, which says it can detect ignition within five minutes, even if a fire is “only a few square meters in size.”
    


            Traditionally, sensors have relied on optical cameras or thermal imaging that could “see” the flames, but S&T says it hopes its new devices can “sniff” gases or solid particles in the air. It is also using data from earlier trials to inform artificial intelligence algorithms used in its latest sensors.
    


            Pyri's designers are also looking to artificial intelligence: When one of their devices is triggered, AI can analyze available weather and satellite data to assess the likelihood that the signal was indeed the result of a wildfire.
    


            The number of devices required in any given area will depend greatly on the geography of the site, including topography and vegetation, Gunadi said, adding that “fire dynamics are very complicated.” Pyri is hoping to sell a per-kilometer subscription package that bundle together sensors with installation and monitoring software. Declining to reveal the startup's future pricing, Gunadi said it is aiming for fees that are “half the cost of our nearest competitor.”
    


            As such, Pyri hopes to target customers with fewer resources — whether that is money, skilled labor, infrastructure or time — to tackle wildfires. It aims to start with the forestry, agriculture and utility sectors in the US, but has fielded queries from around the world.
    


            Since graduating, Pyri's co-founders have been carrying out research and development and raising funds — including a £5,000 ($6,677) prize from winning a James Dyson Award, an international student design competition founded by the titular British inventor and Dyson founder. The company hopes to run small-scale tests and demonstrations later this year, with a view to operating larger pilots next year and launching commercially in 2027.

            CBS News parent Paramount Global has agreed to pay $16 million to resolve an extraordinary lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” news report last fall.
    


            The long-gestating and highly controversial settlement payment was announced by Paramount late Tuesday night.
    


            Paramount said the $16 million sum “includes plaintiffs' fees and costs,” and will not be paid to Trump directly, but instead will be allocated to Trump's future presidential library — mirroring a settlement agreement that Disney's ABC struck with Trump last December.
    


            “The settlement does not include a statement of apology or regret,” Paramount specified.
    


            But it is still an embarrassing episode for CBS, because legal experts maintained that Trump's suit was frivolous and that CBS was on solid ground to fight and win the case in court.
    


            “This is a very sad moment for '60 Minutes,' CBS News and journalism,” a CBS News staffer told CNN on condition of anonymity.
    


            Other employees also described widespread outrage and disgust about the payment to Trump. But there is also “a slight sense of relief that we can start to put this behind us,” the staffer added.
    


            A spokesman for Trump's legal team, meanwhile, celebrated the deal as a victory, even though Trump had claimed billions of dollars in damages, and wound up settling for a tiny fraction as much.
    


            “With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,” the spokesman said. “CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle.”
    


            Outside analysts have framed it very differently – as an instance of corporate priorities trumping journalistic principles.
    


            Paramount has been trying for months to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, and the deal requires approval from the Trump administration, in part because CBS owns local stations that are licensed by the government.
    


            This gave Trump a form of leverage over Paramount — and may have put more pressure on the company to pay up.
    


            The Writers Guild of America East, which represents writers at “60 Minutes” and across the news division, said the settlement was a “transparent attempt to curry favors with an administration in the hopes it will allow Paramount Global and Skydance Media merger to be cleared for approval.”
    


            Paramount said Tuesday night that “this lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process. We will abide by the legal process to defend our case.”
    


            FCC chair Brendan Carr has also repeatedly said that his merger review process is separate. But before being promoted to chairman, the Trump appointee said complaints over the “60 Minutes” edit would be “likely to arise” as part of the FCC's merger review.
    


            Carr did not respond to a CNN request for comment about the status of the review on Wednesday.
    


            Press advocacy groups, meanwhile, blasted Paramount for deciding to settle.
    


            “Paramount's spineless decision to settle Trump's patently unconstitutional lawsuit is an insult to the First Amendment and to the journalists and viewers of '60 Minutes,'” the Freedom of the Press Foundation said. The group has vowed to file a shareholder's derivative lawsuit over the settlement, meaning the litigation over the matter is not over yet.
    


            The settlement deal included a promise from CBS that “in the future, ‘60 Minutes' will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.”
    


            This is notable because the lawsuit at issue is all about a contested transcript.
    


            Trump's complaint was about a single question and answer in a lengthy “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. He claimed without evidence that the Harris exchange was deliberately edited to benefit the Democratic candidate and hurt him.
    


            Conservative media watchdogs had noticed that CBS aired two different soundbites from Harris in response to correspondent Bill Whitaker's question about the Biden administration's relationship with Israel amid the war in Gaza. One clip aired on “Face the Nation” and another clip aired on “60 Minutes,” which generated confusion on the part of the viewing public.
    


            As criticism mounted and Trump threatened to sue, CBS said it merely edited the vice president's answer for time, in accordance with television news standards, and it declined to release the full transcript.
    


            Trump went on the warpath, claiming “election interference” and calling it “the biggest scandal in broadcast history.” He accused CBS News of violating a Texas consumer protection law and demanded $10 billion in damages. His lawyers later raised the total to $20 billion.
    


            Legal experts slammed the suit as “frivolous and dangerous,” and CBS defended “60 Minutes” on First Amendment grounds.
    


            Under pressure from the FCC last winter, CBS released the tapes and transcript of the interview, and the raw materials confirmed that it engaged in normal editing, not any nefarious activity like Trump alleged.
    


            Nevertheless, the lawsuit posed a serious problem for Paramount, especially its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, who stands to make hundreds of millions of dollars through the Skydance deal.
    


            So once Trump took office for a second term, Paramount executives sought to make the lawsuit disappear. Critics of the settlement effort, inside and outside CBS, used words like payoff and bribe to describe the proposed settlement.
    


            At “60 Minutes,” “everyone thinks this lawsuit is an act of extortion, everyone,” a network correspondent told CNN earlier this year.
    


            Several Democratic lawmakers even raised concerns that a settlement might run afoul of anti-bribery laws. The media company may be guarding against those warnings by paying the same amount as Disney.
    


            Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks, speaking at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, observed that companies settle litigation all the time for all sorts of reasons.
    


            “Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial, as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction.”
    


            Normally, however, the beneficiary of the settlement is not a sitting president.
    


            Trump's CBS lawsuit was part of his larger and ongoing effort to attack major media organizations he deemed unfavorable to him. He sued The Des Moines Register and pollster J. Ann Selzer last December over a pre-election survey that showed Harris leading Trump in Iowa, which he ultimately won by double digits. Trump claimed the poll violated consumer fraud protections; the Register is currently fighting the suit in court.
    


            He also sued ABC News, alleging that anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him, and the network ultimately settled that case, creating a blueprint of sorts for the Paramount agreement.
    


            In recent months, the CBS newsroom has been consumed by Trump's pressure, the prospect of a settlement and the corporate maneuvering aimed at securing the merger's approval.

            That internal strife spilled out into the public view in late April when “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned, citing a loss of editorial independence. Days later, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley called out Paramount on-air, revealing that executives “began to supervise our content in new ways” amid the pending merger. “No one here is happy about it,” he said.
    


            A month later, Wendy McMahon, the executive in charge of CBS News, also resigned. She alluded to a “challenging” past few months in her farewell memo to employees, adding that “It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.”
    


            All the while, “60 Minutes” kept producing substantive investigations about Trump and other subjects, including a probe of his efforts to punish law firms he dislikes.
    


            On the news division's daily editorial conference call Wednesday morning, CBS News president Tom Cibrowski thanked staffers for “blocking out the noise” of the past few months and said it is important to “lock arms” and move forward reporting the news.

BANGKOK (AP) — A U.S. judge has ruled that China's Huawei Technologies, a leading telecoms equipment company, must face criminal charges in a wide reaching case alleging it stole technology and engaged in racketeering, wire and bank fraud and other crimes. 

U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly on Tuesday rejected Huawei's request to dismiss the allegations in a 16-count federal indictment against the company, saying in a 52-page ruling that its arguments were premature. 

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

The U.S. accuses Huawei and some of its subsidiaries of plotting to steal U.S. trade secrets, installing surveillance equipment that enabled Iran to spy on protesters during 2009 anti-government demonstrations in Iran, and of doing business in North Korea despite U.S. sanctions there. 

During President Donald Trump's first term in office, his administration raised national security concerns and began lobbying Western allies against including Huawei in their wireless, high-speed networks. 

In its January 2019 indictment, the Justice Department accused Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company called Skycom to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions and charged its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, with fraud by misleading the HSBC bank about the company's business dealings in Iran. 

Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested in Canada in late 2018 on a U.S. extradition request but released in September 2021 in a high-stakes prisoner swap that freed two Canadians held by China and allowed her to return home.

Chinese officials have accused the U.S. government of “economic bullying” and of improperly using national security as a pretext for “oppressing Chinese companies.” In their motion to dismiss the broad criminal case, among other arguments Huawei's lawyers contended that the U.S. allegations were too vague and some were ”impermissibly extraterritorial,” and do not involve domestic wire and bank fraud. 




The biggest maker of network gear, Huawei struggled to hold onto its market share under sanctions that have blocked its access to most U.S. processor chips and other technology. The limits led it to ramp up its own development of computer chips and other advanced technologies. 

The company also shifted its focus to the Chinese market and to network technology for hospitals, factories and other industrial customers and other products that would not be affected by U.S. sanctions.

MANILA, Philippines (AP) — A Philippine campaign aimed at exposing China's aggression in the disputed South China Sea has shattered “the illusion of China being peaceful and friendly,” Lithuania's defense chief said Wednesday, urging democratic countries to stand united against an emerging axis of authoritarian countries led by China and Russia. 

Beginning in 2023, the campaign, which Manila calls a “transparency initiative,” includes publicizing images of China's aggressive actions in the disputed waters. 

“I believe that, in this case, revealing to the world how China is harassing the Philippine's navy and fishermen of the Philippines in their own waters is very important because it shatters the illusion of China being a peaceful and friendly neighbor,” Defense Minister Dovilė Šakalienė said.

“It's nothing peaceful when you see water cannons being used against peaceful fishermen and there's nothing peaceful about ramming the ships of Philippines in the territorial waters of the Philippines,” she added.

Šakalienė expressed support to former Filipino senator Francis Tolentino while in the capital for talks aimed at deepening defense ties between the two countries.

Tolentino was sanctioned by China on Tuesday for his strong criticisms of Beijing's acts of aggression and for his work on two new laws, which demarcated Philippine territorial zones, including in parts of the South China Sea that Beijing claims.

Šakalienė said she and her family had also been sanctioned by China and banned from entering the country for her strong criticisms of China's aggression and human rights record.




“Welcome to the club,” Šakalienė said in an interview with a small group of journalists, including from The Associated Press, in response to China's sanction against Tolentino. “Talking about China's crimes is what gets you into the blacklist.”

“Pressure, coercion and threats is their usual method of operation,” she said.

Chinese officials did not immediately comment on Šakalienė's remarks.

During President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration, which began in mid-2022, the Philippines invited Filipino and foreign journalists to join its coast guard and navy patrols in the disputed South China Sea. They have witnessed an increasingly alarming spike of confrontations in the waters in recent years, with China using water cannons and dangerous maneuvers to defend its claim to the global trade route.

China blames the Philippines for instigating the clashes. A 2016 international arbitration decision invalidated China's claims based on the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, but Beijing has rejected the ruling and continues to defy it.

Šakalienė said that in the Baltic Sea, Chinese ships and crew members have helped suspected Russian fleets damage undersea oil pipelines, and data and electricity cables belonging to rival European nations like Lithuania by dragging steel anchors on the seafloor. She warned that such acts of sabotage could also be carried out in Asia by China and Russia.

Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have also been involved in the long-simmering territorial disputes in the South China Sea but they have not been as vocal against China's aggression as the Philippines.

The United States does not lay claim to the disputed waters but has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to defend the Philippines — Washington's oldest treaty ally in Asia — if it comes under an armed attack.

Šakalienė warned that it's crucial for countries to band together and fight an emerging authoritarian bloc consisting of China, Russia, Iran and North Korea which she said is a threat to democracy.

TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.

That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.

“It's an exceptionally good technology,” said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. “It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.”

The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies — sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.

It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.

The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.

Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers — and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.

“A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,” said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.

Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant — and cripple an animal with pain.

Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.

“It smelled nasty,” he said. “Like rotting meat.”

The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.

The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.

One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.

Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.

But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.

Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.

The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.

In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.

But, she added, “You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.”

Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.

In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.

Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.

Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.

In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a “Whiz Packer.”

The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.

Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's “crowning achievements.”

Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.

“Something we think we have complete control over — and we have declared a triumph and victory over — can always rear its ugly head again,” Burgess said.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — More than 60 years after a white supremacist assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers, his daughter still sees the same strain of political violence at work in American society.

“It's painful,” said Reena Evers-Everette. “It's very painful.”

Evers-Everette was 8 years old when her father, a field secretary for the NAACP, was shot to death in the driveway of his home in Jackson, Mississippi.

A few months after Evers' killing in 1963, President John F. Kennedy was gunned down. The deaths of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy followed later that decade.

Now, experts say the level of political violence in America over the past few years is likely the highest it's been since the 1960s and 1970s. The past year alone has seen the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, the killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers, and two assassination attempts on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump.

At a four-day conference celebrating Evers' life just before what would have been his 100th birthday on July 2, his daughter was joined by the daughters of slain civil rights leaders: Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and Bettie Dahmer, the daughter of civil and voting rights activist Vernon Dahmer. The 2025 Democracy in Action Convening, “Medgar Evers at 100: a Legacy of Justice, a Future of Change,” was held in Jackson.

“I just was feeling so much pain, and I didn't want anyone else to have to go through that,” Kennedy said, recalling that after her father died, she prayed for the man who killed him. “I was saying, ‘Please don't — please don't kill the guy that killed him.'”




Two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams spoke at the event, denouncing efforts by the Trump administration to strip the names of activists from Navy vessels, including possibly Evers. 

“They want to take his name off a boat because they don't want us to have a reminder of how far he sailed us forward,” Abrams told the conference crowd. 

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has undertaken an effort to change the names of ships and military bases that were given by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, which often honored service members who were women, people of color, or from the LGBTQ+ community. 

Abrams drew parallels between acts of radical political violence and the Trump administration's use of military resources against protesters in Los Angeles who were demonstrating against immigration enforcement actions.

“Unfortunately, we cannot decry political violence and then sanction the sending of the Marines and the National Guard to stop protesters and not believe that that conflicting message doesn't communicate itself,” Abrams told The Associated Press. “What I want us to remember is that whether it is Medgar Evers or Melissa Hortman, no one who is willing to speak for the people should have their lives cut short because of what they say.”

In addition to her father's life and legacy, Evers-Everette wants people to remember the hatred that led to his assassination. 

“We have to make sure we know what our history is,” she said. “So we don't repeat the crazy, nasty, racist mess.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The University of Pennsylvania on Tuesday modified a trio of school records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and said it would apologize to female athletes “disadvantaged” by her participation on the women's swimming team, part of a resolution of a federal civil rights case.

The U.S. Education Department and Penn announced the voluntary agreement of the high-profile case that focused on Thomas, who last competed for the Ivy League school in 2022, when she became the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title.

The department investigated Penn as part of the Trump administration's broader attempt to remove transgender athletes from girls' and women's sports, concluding the university in Philadelphia had violated the rights of female athletes.

Under the agreement, Penn agreed to restore all individual Division I records and titles to female athletes who lost to Thomas and send a personalized apology letter to each of those swimmers, the Education Department said. 

By Tuesday afternoon, the Penn website showed other athletes holding the school's top times in Thomas' events. The site was annotated with a note that read, “Competing under eligibility rules in effect at the time, Lia Thomas set program records in the 100, 200 and 500 freestyle during the 2021-22 season.”

“While Penn's policies during the 2021-2022 swim season were in accordance with NCAA eligibility rules at the time, we acknowledge that some student-athletes were disadvantaged by these rules,” Penn President J. Larry Jameson said. “We recognize this and will apologize to those who experienced a competitive disadvantage or experienced anxiety because of the policies in effect at the time.”




As part of the settlement, the university must also announce that it “will not allow males to compete in female athletic programs” and it must adopt “biology-based” definitions of male and female, the department said. 

In his statement, Jameson said Penn has always been in compliance with NCAA and Title IX rules as they were interpreted at the time, and that the university has never had its own policies around transgender athlete participation. The school has followed changes to eligibility guidelines as they were issued earlier this year, he said. The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes in February, limiting competition in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth.

“Our commitment to ensuring a respectful and welcoming environment for all of our students is unwavering,” Jameson said. “At the same time, we must comply with federal requirements, including executive orders, and NCAA eligibility rules, so our teams and student-athletes may engage in competitive intercollegiate sports.”

Education Secretary Linda McMahon called it a victory for women and girls.

“The Department commends UPenn for rectifying its past harms against women and girls, and we will continue to fight relentlessly to restore Title IX's proper application and enforce it to the fullest extent of the law,” McMahon said in a statement.

Former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines thanked President Donald Trump on social media and wrote of the settlement, “ Are pigs flying?” Gaines has said she started her activism against transgender athletes competing in women's sports after sharing a locker room with Thomas at the 2022 NCAA championships.

The Education Department opened its investigation in February and concluded in April that Penn had violated Title IX, a 1972 law forbidding sex discrimination in education. Such findings have almost always been resolved through voluntary agreements. If Penn had fought the finding, the department could have moved to refer the case to the Justice Department or pursued a separate process to cut the school's federal funding.

In February, the Education Department asked the NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations, or NFSHSA, to restore titles, awards and records it says have been “misappropriated by biological males competing in female categories.”

The most obvious target at the college level was in women's swimming, where Thomas won the national title in the 500-yard freestyle in 2022.

The NCAA has updated its record books when recruiting and other violations have stripped titles from certain schools, but the organization, like the NFSHSA, has not responded to the federal government's request and did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. It was not clear how either would determine which events had a transgender athlete participating years later.

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — On St. John the Baptist's feast day in late June, an extended Tohono O'odham family attends Mass out at their desert camp, where they gather to harvest saguaro fruit in a process sacred in their Native spirituality.

“When you're raised as being a Catholic and raised as being an O'odham, you have both of those within your home, you have both of those within your family,” said Maria Francisco. “So it's a combination.”

With her cousin, Tanisha Tucker Lohse, and about three dozen other family members and friends, Francisco worshipped at the early morning Mass in a ramada — a canopy topped with saguaro ribs to provide shade, this one decorated with paper flowers. A folding table covered by a white and gold tablecloth served as an altar. A priest visited from Tucson to celebrate the Mass.

A statuette of St. John the Baptist stood by a bunch of fresh flowers, candles and burning desert sage in lieu of incense. There also were photographs of Tucker's late mom and their great-great-aunt, known as “Grandma Juanita,” whose advocacy preserved the camp. Juana is Spanish for Jane, so she celebrated her name day on St. John's and the family is continuing the tradition.

A dozen cross-shaped saguaro fruit-picking poles leaned behind the table. Made from saguaro ribs, they're used to hook the fruits and push or pull them down from the towering plants.

The history of encounters between Catholicism and Native spirituality has often been marred by violence and oppression. But many members of the Tohono O'odham Nation hold onto both faith traditions as they were passed down since the late 17th century, when an Italian-born Jesuit missionary, the Rev. Eusebio Kino, introduced Christianity to these remote deserts in what now are the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. 




“To me, it's the lived consequence of trying to do Catholicism on their own,” said Seth Schermerhorn, a Hamilton College professor who studies Indigenous adoption of Christian practices.

Many O'odham villages have mission churches, though a shortage of priests means regular Mass is a rarity. The Rev. Aro Varnabas came from his parish, Saint Kateri, to celebrate this service.

“Making people feel connected to God through the things they're familiar with, that's what I see,” he said.

Michael Enis, who works for the O'odham's San Xavier's district — home to one of the most beautifully decorated colonial Catholic churches in the Southwest, San Xavier del Bac — brought his three young children.

He sees a special kinship between his nation and Jesus' cousin, who lived off the desert, calling for repentance at the risk of his life, and baptized Christ himself in the Jordan River.

“You connect the story of St. John and O'odham life, and you're stronger for it,” Enis said.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., discusses the success of Operation Midnight Hammer, Iranian regime change and more on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.'

A top Senate ally of President Donald Trump is facing a primary challenge from the right. 

Former South Carolina Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer is running for the Senate in 2026, mounting a Republican primary challenge against longtime GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham.

""Lindsey Graham has lost his way, and South Carolinians deserve a true conservative fighter to represent them in the United States Senate – 100% guaranteed,"" Bauer, a wealthy developer and longtime Trump backer, charged in a statement early Wednesday, as he declared his candidacy.

Graham in February kicked off his campaign for a fifth six-year term representing the red state of South Carolina in the Senate.

The senator was endorsed by Trump in March and this week he announced that veteran Republican consultant Chris LaCivita, who served as co-chair of the president's 2024 campaign to win back the White House, was coming on board as his re-election campaign's senior advisor.

Bauer – who unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010 (in an election won by now-former governor, former ambassador to the U.N. and 2024 GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley) and Congress in 2012 after serving eight years as the Palmetto State's lieutenant governor – touted his Trump and MAGA credentials.

FIRST ON FOX: FORMER TRUMP AMBASSADOR LAUNCHES SENATE BID

""One of the first leaders in the country to endorse Trump in early 2016, André has been on the front lines of the America First movement, and has stood firmly with Trump on every issue,"" his campaign touted in their email release. ""André is a proven conservative fighter who will unapologetically stand with President Trump and put South Carolina first.""

Bauer stood alongside Trump at the South Carolina Statehouse in January 2023, as the former president announced his leadership team in the key early-voting primary state.

Trump, at the time, called Bauer ""a friend of mine, somebody that could I think run for almost any office and win.""

Graham, along with Republican Gov. Howie McMaster of South Carolina, also stood alongside Trump at that event.

Eight years earlier, Graham was highly critical of Trump as he was part of a large field of rivals who ran against the real estate mogul and reality TV star for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.

But Graham became a close friend and top ally to Trump during the president's first term.

The senator has survived primary challenges from the right in his past re-election campaigns, and has been attacked for his more moderate stances on the issues of illegal immigration and climate change, as well as his advocacy for a muscular U.S. national security and foreign policy.

Ahead of last month's U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, Graham urged Trump to ""go all-in"" to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Bauer, in his campaign launch, attacked the senator as ""Globalist Lindsey Graham"" and charged that he ""has spent three decades sending your tax dollars overseas and funding regime change wars all over the world instead of helping South Carolinians. Lindsey voted over and over again for big spending and that has grown the national debt by trillions.""

Bauer also argued that ""Graham has repeatedly called for amnesty for illegal immigrants.""

Graham, on Tuesday, hours ahead of Bauer's launch, spotlighted his efforts to help Trump's so-called ""big beautiful"" landmark spending and tax cut bill pass the Senate by a razor-thin one-vote margin.

""I just had a great phone call with President @realDonaldTrump about his excitement regarding the Senate's passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill,"" Graham wrote in a social media post. 

And he highlighted that he's ""incredibly proud to have led the fight to move President Trump's ‘One Big Beautiful Bill' through the Senate Budget Committee and onto full passage by the United States Senate.""

Graham re-election campaign spokeswoman Abby Zilch also took aim at Bauer.

""Andre Bauer has spent his career chasing titles to feed his ego, running for five different offices and even trying to leverage Senator Graham and the White House for an ambassadorship. When that failed, he launched his sixth campaign – proving once again, this is all about Making Andre Great Again,"" Zilch claimed in a statement.

Republicans dominate statewide elections in South Carolina and the winner of next year's GOP Senate primary will be considered the clear frontrunner in the 2026 general election.

Riley Gaines and Keith Olbermann were at it again on social media this week after the ex-ESPN host took aim at the former University of Kentucky swimmer following the resolution agreement between the University of Pennsylvania and the Education Department that resulted in the school stripping program records previously held by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. 

Olbermann posted a message on X on Tuesday calling Gaines ""whiny"" in response to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announcement that it had reached an agreement with UPenn following its investigation into Title IX violations that centered on Thomas' participation on the women's swimming team during the 2021-22 season.

""Wanted to congratulate Whiny Gaines on now being able to say she finished tied for FOURTH not tied for FIFTH in the Lia Thomas race,"" Olbermann wrote in his post, referencing the 2022 NCAA Division I swimming championships when Gaines tied with Thomas for fifth place in the 200 free.

Gaines, the host of OutKick's ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast and a 12-time NCAA All-American swimmer, responded promptly to Olbermann's slight and reminded the ex-ESPN host that Thomas ranked lower in the men's competition before transitioning to the women's team.

""Thank you! And while you're keeping track, make sure to congratulate Emma Weyant, the right National Champ in the 500 freestyle, too,"" Gaines said, referring to Thomas' title in the 2022 championships.

Gaines continued, ""(If you're insinuating 5th in the nation is bad, what do you call a man who ranks 462nd nationally in the men's category?)""  

UPENN STILL ACKNOWLEDGES LIA THOMAS RECORDS IN UPDATE AFTER RESOLUTION WITH EDUCATION DEPARTMENT

Thomas became the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title. During competition, Thomas set multiple individual program records. On Tuesday, UPenn announced that a trio of records set by Thomas that season would be updated to reflect the female competitor's records. 

A note on the school's website, however, still recognized Thomas' records based on the NCAA's eligibility requirements at the time. 

""NOTE: Competing under eligibility rules in effect at the time, Lia Thomas set program records in the 100, 200 and 500 freestyle during the 2021-22 season,"" the annotation read.

Earlier this year, in compliance with President Donald Trump's executive order, the NCAA announced it was updating its gender eligibility policies to ban all biological males from competing in women's competition.

In UPenn's statement on Tuesday, Penn President J. Larry Jameson said the university plans to ""fully comply"" with Title IX and the NCAA's current policies. 

""The University will not – on the basis of sex – exclude female students from participation in, deny female students the benefits of, or subject female students to discrimination under, any athletics programs. In addition, in providing to female student-athletes intimate facilities such as locker rooms and bathrooms in connection with Penn Athletics, such facilities shall be strictly separated on the basis of sex and comparably provided to each sex,"" the school wrote.

Emmanuel Acho reacts to the growing concern around how the WNBA is handling Caitlin Clark. From intense physical play to mounting injuries, Acho questions whether the league is pushing her too far.

Caitlin Clark has finally snapped back at her opponents.

Since making her WNBA debut last year, Clark has been the victim of hard fouls on the court and cultural wars off of it.

The cries from fans saying Clark's opponents are jealous of her have been loud and clear, and they were recently amplified when players ranked her the ninth-best All-Star guard in the WNBA.

Well, it appears Clark is hitting back.

The Indiana Fever won the WNBA's Commissioner's Cup, an in-season tournament, with their 74-59 win over the Minnesota Lynx on Tuesday night, and the team celebrated in the locker room with some champagne and vodka seltzers.

Fever forward Aaliyah Boston took to Instagram Live to give a behind-the-scenes look at the celebration when Clark, who did not play due to a groin injury, took a shot.

""Guys, I just know everybody in the league is sick,"" Clark is heard saying from out of the shot.

The teammates replied with laughter, with Boston adding, ""They're p---ed.""

SOCIAL MEDIA ERUPTS AS FELLOW PLAYERS RANK CAITLIN CLARK 9TH-BEST ALL-STAR GUARD: 'THESE GIRLS ARE LAUGHABLE'

While celebrating, Clark also voiced an opinion on the tournament and the $500,000 prize for the winning team.

""You get more (money) for this than you do if you're the (WNBA Finals) champion. It makes no sense. Someone tell [WNBA commissioner] Cathy [Engelbert] to help us out,"" she said in another video.

It's been reported that WNBA champions win an extra $20,000, but the in-season tournament winnings come out to around $30,000 per player.

Clark was the first overall pick last year after becoming the NCAA's all-time leading scorer in both men's and women's Division I basketball. Her games in both college and the pros have been among some of the most-watched of all time. Her return from a calf injury on June 14 garnered 2.2 million viewers, the third-most watched WNBA game ever on ABC. The game peaked at 2.8 million viewers, a 76% increase from last season's regular-season average on the network.

The WNBA had its most-watched regular season in 24 years last season and its highest attendance in 22 years.

Ahead of the WNBA season, the Fever had the 10 most in-demand games on StubHub, with most of their games being moved to larger capacity venues.

Despite this, Angel Reese once said that the rise of women's basketball ""is not just because of one person - it's because of me, too."" A'ja Wilson also once said that Clark's race was a ""huge thing"" when it came to her popularity.

The Arizona Diamondbacks have finally had enough with one of their most loyal fans.

Dave McCaskill is a season-ticket holder for his beloved D-Backs and owns an Advantage Membership account, which grants him access to specific events, early postseason ticket access and discounts throughout the ballpark.

However, after being involved in yet another fan-interference dilemma, the Diamondbacks banned him for the remainder of the year and terminated his membership account.

""This particular fan has been involved in multiple offenses at Chase Field…"" the team said in a statement. ""This fan will have the opportunity to return to Chase Field in 2026 so long as he meets certain terms and abides by our Fan Code of Conduct.""

McCaskill reached for a ball that was off the bat of San Francisco Giants third baseman Christian Koss. The ball just missed the outstretched glove of left fielder Tim Tawa. Center fielder Alek Thomas appeared to exchange words with McCaskill, who tossed the ball to Thomas. Thomas then tossed it back up. Koss was initially ruled out, but after review, he was awarded a double, and McCaskill was booted from the ballpark.

Recent videos of McCaskill making plays on borderline home run balls resurfaced on social media shortly after the D-Backs' announcement.

""I'm a D-Backs fan. I would never want to do anything to hurt the D-backs or to have them lose the game,"" McCaskill told Fox 10 Phoenix.

However, he admitted to being ""ejected three times."" (He later corrected himself to ""technically… twice."")

""I caught the ball, came right down, and you see my glove hit the yellow, the top. So I think the ball would have bounced on top and gone over,"" McCaskill explained.

Fans are not allowed to reach over the wall, or the imaginary line directly above it, to catch a ball. But, it is fair game once the ball crosses said imaginary line. Jomboy Media pointed out a total of four instances, with other social media accounts saying he's been involved in five such reviews.

""What I can comment on is last night, the play happened, I want the play to play. I want the play to be played out… I want plays to be made by the players,"" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said.

McCaskill, according to the New York Post, said he has ""followed"" notorious ballhawk Zack Hample, who has garnered plenty of controversy throughout his game-attending days. Hample has caught over 10,000 baseballs.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports on U.S. military planning for possible involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, including what it would take to deploy bunker buster bombs.

FIRST ON FOX: A bipartisan pair of lawmakers has proposed authorizing President Donald Trump to transfer B-2 stealth bombers and 30,000-pound ""bunker buster"" bombs to Israel if Iran is found to still be developing a nuclear weapon after last week's strikes. 

Proposed by Reps. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., and Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., the Bunker Buster Act would allow Trump to ""take actions to ensure Israel is prepared for all contingencies if Iran seeks to develop a nuclear weapon."" 

B-2 bomber pilots launched 14 bunker buster bombs on Iran's top three nuclear sites, in a move that Trump claims ""totally obliterated"" the Iranian regime's nuclear program. 

Israel, for its part, hit a number of Iranian sites and took out top military brass. However, it doesn't possess the 30,000-pound GBU 57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, precision-guided munition bombs developed for the U.S. Air Force. The 20-foot-long weapons can travel 200 feet deep inside a target before exploding. 

TRUMP WOULD STRIKE IRAN 'WITHOUT QUESTION' IF IT RESTARTS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM

As of 2024, the U.S. had 19 B-2s in operation. It does not transfer custody of its B-2 stealth bombers to any of its allies. 

""Iran, the leading state sponsor of terror, and one of America's top enemies, can never have a nuclear weapon. That's why I strongly supported our military actions earlier this month. Iran has killed scores of Americans, including our service members, and repeatedly attacked our key democratic ally, Israel. Israel must be able to defend herself against Iran, and ensure that Iran cannot rebuild its nuclear capabilities,"" Gottheimer said in a statement. 

""This bill gives the President the authority to equip Israel with the tools and training they need to deter Tehran and make the world a safer place,"" said Lawler. 

The International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) Chair Rafael Grossi told Radio France Internationale the centrifuges at Iran's underground Fordow nuclear site are ""no longer operational,"" after the U.S. strikes.

However, some have questioned whether Iran may have attempted to move its stock of enriched uranium away from the sites that were targeted, but Grossi told CBS over the weekend that Iran may again begin enriching uranium in a ""matter of months."" 

""The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that. But as I said, frankly speaking, one cannot claim that everything has disappeared and there is nothing there,"" he said.

""It is clear that there has been severe damage, but it's not total damage,"" Grossi added. ""Iran has the capacities there; industrial and technological capacities. So if they so wish, they will be able to start doing this again.""

Meanwhile, after a Houthi strike on Israel, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee suggested the U.S. send B-2 bombers to Yemen to strike Houthi targets.

""We thought we were done with missiles coming to Israel, but Houthis just lit one up over us in Israel. Fortunately, Israel's incredible interception system means we go to the shelter & wait until all clear. Maybe those B2 bombers need to visit Yemen!"" 

B-2 bomber planes traveled to Yemen to strike Houthi targets in October 2024.

Nearly 75% of all freight in the United States is moved by trucks. They deliver everything from construction materials to hospital supplies to the packages on your porch. But the system is overworked and under-resourced, which slows down deliveries and drives up prices.

Autonomous trucking — yes, self-driving big rigs — is the solution to this challenge. But this sector has been hamstrung by senseless and outdated regulations, resulting in China-based companies taking the lead in developing autonomous vehicles. And here's the truth we can't afford to ignore: If we let China win on this matter, we won't just be buying their trucks. We'll be buying our supply chain from them, too.

That may be about to change. A Trump administration policy change that took effect earlier this week levels the playing field for domestic autonomous vehicle developers and is a step toward bringing American innovation back to America's highways.

Until recently, autonomous trucking may have seemed like a tech-world pipe dream. Today, it is a very real economic battleground. Now, here's the kicker: America invented this technology. Our engineers, innovators, and investors took autonomous vehicles from science fiction to functioning prototypes. But thanks to regulatory gridlock and outdated rules, we're falling behind. China, by contrast, is moving full throttle.

Chinese companies are already deploying autonomous driving systems at scale across over 85% of China's national highways. These trucks are hauling freight for some of the country's largest logistics firms and even international brands, all while operating with human drivers present only as a legal formality. 

Meanwhile, here at home, fully driverless freight trucks have just begun to hit the road in a limited fashion. American companies sparked this industry, but now we're watching China commercialize it faster, more efficiently, and on a national scale. 

The U.S. is already facing a chronic driver shortage, an estimated 80,000 today, with a projected need for one million more over the next decade, according to the American Trucking Association.

That's where autonomous trucks come in. Unlike human drivers, these rigs don't need to sleep. They don't get distracted or delayed. They can run nearly 24/7, doubling the distance a truck can cover in a single day from around 600 miles to 1,200. The result? Lower costs. Greater capacity. And reliable delivery, even when systems break down.

Texas is a model for the rest of the country. In 2017, the state's lawmakers passed straightforward legislation to allow autonomous trucks on the road, provided they obey the same rules as human drivers. That simple framework gave companies the green light to innovate. Today, Texas is the world's proving ground for autonomous freight. These trucks are already hauling goods for real businesses and real people, everything from restaurant supplies to consumer goods, and they're doing it safely and efficiently.

While some critics argue that autonomous trucks threaten jobs, the numbers tell a different story. According to a recent study by the Department of Transportation, autonomous trucking is expected to create between 26,000 and 35,000 new jobs annually — not just software engineers but technicians, remote operators, and logistics managers, the kind of work that builds careers and feeds families.

Autonomous trucks won't replace workers; they'll help fill the gap. As the economy grows, we'll need both human drivers and autonomous ones to keep up. With the proper training and transition programs, we can ensure that workers aren't left behind but lifted by the next wave of innovation.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS REQUEST TESLA DELAY ROLLOUT OF ROBOTAXIS UNTIL NEW GUIDELINES TAKE EFFECT

Until recently, foreign-made autonomous vehicles were eligible for fast-tracked exemptions, while American-made trucks had to crawl through a bureaucratic gauntlet. That made no sense. As Scientific American points out, the rule “has often resulted in U.S. companies building experimental robo cars overseas and then shipping them back, a process that can be onerous for start-ups without hefty budgets.”

The Trump administration is correct in expanding the exemption program to include U.S.-manufactured vehicles. This will enable American companies to seize the autonomous trucking opportunity. Additionally, the program will strengthen our supply chain, create jobs, reduce costs, and boost safety — all while keeping the future of trucking in the USA.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","What's so bad about regime change?","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3460282/high-time-for-regime-change-in-cuba/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

U.S. officials fear regime change. They dread instability and the unknown. In reality, naysayers are seldom right. Post-World War II Germany and Japan show that regime change can work. The problem in Afghanistan and Iraq was less regime change than misguided nation-building and wishful blindness to Iranian and Pakistani interference. Regardless, today, Iraq is not the failed state many Americans assume; it has a booming economy and youthful energy, even if it has a Wild West-meets-1930s Chicago vibe. The verdict is not yet in on Syria as Ahmad al-Sharaa's sectarian vigilantism and his family's monopolization of the economy suggest he is little more than a Sunni version of Bashar Assad.

Some regime change is inevitable. Even prior to the 12-day Israel-Iran war, the Islamic Republic's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, 86, is in poor health as he has had cancer and is partially paralyzed. Iranians were openly discussing his succession. Sudden hand-wringing that a further extremist Islamist regime might replace Khamenei is not realistic, and is meant to derail support for regime collapse. At worst, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps shares the same ideology of the clergy without its theological claims to legitimacy. To rescue the Islamic Republic, a state sponsor of terror and nuclear aspirant, would be to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

While President Donald Trump's inner circle may believe they have successfully side-stepped regime change in Iran, a misguided decision as the Islamic Republic has embarked upon a campaign of arrests and summary execution that could turn one of most pro-American peoples against the U.S., whom they see as guilty of betrayal, there will be no avoiding Cuba's coming collapse.

As Juan Belt, a specialist in Latin American energy and economics, points out, Cuba's current electricity crisis could be the death knell for a crumbling regime. Over the past 14 months, there have been 12 nationwide blackouts, some lasting several days. Cuba's energy infrastructure is on life support. Even though Venezuela replaced the Soviet Union as a source of subsidized oil, a lack of maintenance and the use of high-sulfur crude oil as fuel have damaged Cuba's generating plants beyond repair. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela will likely suppress its ability to subsidize Cuba.

Meanwhile, the Communist triumvirate that governs Cuba behind figurehead President Miguel Díaz-Canel makes Khamenei look like a spring chicken. Raúl Castro, for example, is 94.

Twenty years ago, as health problems forced Fidel Castro's resignation, the George W. Bush administration planned actively for the Communist regime's collapse. Today, neither President Donald Trump nor Secretary of State Marco Rubio has a plan for Cuba's transition, even though the flight of 10% of the population in just two years shows Cuba's human capital is bleeding out.

As the government loses control, Cuba's economy will crash. As Belt points out, the Communist government forces doctors and other professionals to serve overseas essentially as slaves for the state, which pockets their salaries. This scheme would end overnight, losing Cuba perhaps $3.6 billion. The loss of profits from state-managed dollar stores and taxes on remittances will cost Cuba another $2 billion. Absent such revenue streams, the government will not be able to pay for its 79,000 soldiers, 17,000 Interior Ministry employees, or 9,000 national police.

The danger is not only humanitarian but also strategic. Organized crime, gangs, and drug cartels could seek to establish themselves in any vacuum that a lack of U.S. preparation enables. In a worst-case scenario, should the United States not deploy forces, Cuba could become a second Haiti.

STATE DEPARTMENT LISTS CUBA AS NONCOOPERATING COUNTRY OVER HARBORING TERRORISTS

Meanwhile, the international community will need to jumpstart Cuba's economy with $5-10 billion. Managed privatization can blunt costs. Dispatching diaspora experts could help Cuba modernize and reintegrate, while updated zoning and laws can protect its unique culture.

After 65 years of stasis, Communist rule in Cuba is ending, perhaps even this year. Avoiding planning will not stop a regime change. It will only guarantee the worst possible outcome for both the Cuban people and the United States.

When will the Air Force's B-2 bombers pay another visit to Iran?

That decision is actually up to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Iranian supreme leader,  and his now-smaller inner ring of advisers, some of whom probably remain agents of Israel's Mossad foreign intelligence service.

It is a useful skill to be able to put yourself in an adversary's shoes. Lawyers try to do it on a daily basis. Political campaigns are all about the anticipation of attacks and the imagination of counterattacks. Militaries spend a great deal of time considering operational plans and counterplans. It's the oldest game in the world: What will your opponent do?

And Khamenei has no specific idea what President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will do if the ayatollah begins to rebuild his nuclear weapons program. Or, indeed, if he launches a terrorist attack on Israel or the United States, or their citizens anywhere in the world. He's only got a good idea that the reprisals would be swift and devastating.

Trump's decision to bomb parts of the Iranian regime's nuclear weapons assembly line mattered, of course, because it disrupted the mullahs' dash for a nuclear weapon. It also shattered Khamenei's wrongly assumed immunity from U.S. attacks at home. Trump's move also reestablished a level of U.S. deterrence badly damaged by four years of former President Joe Biden's infirmity and fecklessness.

When Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, the first assumption, that Israel could never launch this operation on its own, was shattered. When Trump dispatched the bombers, a second, far more significant threshold was breached: U.S. presidents have long talked and talked about “every option being on the table” when it came to Iran's nuclear weapons program, but you couldn't blame the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for not believing it.

The regime had, with the exception of two incidents, been largely unmolested by the U.S. for its 46-year history.

On April 18, 1988, President Ronald Reagan ordered Operation Praying Mantis in response to Iran's mining of the Strait of Hormuz. American warplanes destroyed, damaged, or sank two Iranian oil platforms, three warships of the Islamic Republic, a variety of Iranian armed boats, and two fighter jets.

More than 30 years passed before another kinetic action between the U.S. and Iran. On Jan. 3, 2020, Trump ordered a drone strike on mastermind terrorist Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the long-serving leader of the IRGC Quds Force, Iran's preeminent apparatus for terrorist attacks abroad.

Still, Iran's nuclear weapons program has long been declared a “red line” for both the U.S. and Israel. What Iran suspected, especially after former President Barack Obama erased his own declared red line in Syria and after Biden's feckless scamper from Afghanistan, is that the U.S. would never regain the sort of resolve that Reagan displayed or much more than the one-off body blow to a key regime figure such as the one Trump delivered in early 2020.

Iran did not expect, and could not stop, America's B-2s. Indeed, for 12 days, all of Iran was defenseless beneath the pummeling delivered by the Israeli Air Force from the skies and the havoc dealt out by Israel's Mossad on the ground.

The world has now witnessed that the emperors of Iran have only the clothes of terrorism left. Their vaunted proxies have been defeated in every theater, the regime's closest ally, Syria's Bashar Assad, has been toppled into an ignominious exile in Moscow, and the Israeli and U.S. militaries can resume on a moment's notice the military strikes with very little to fear from the Iranian air defenses.

Now 86, Khamenei, a shocked and desperate cleric, must decide how to end his time on this earth: Resigned to being exposed as an impotent fanatic or blindly striking out via the remnants of his terrorist network only to trigger more shock and awe raining down on him?

If Khamenei chooses the latter course, Trump and Netanyahu will very likely respond with even more devastating force. The energy infrastructure of Iran was left largely intact through the recent 12-day conflict, but would almost certainly be the next up on a target list if Iran dares to strike American or Israeli citizens. This must surely make Khamenei ponder whether standing down is an embarrassing but preferable alternative to lying down, permanently.

Now that the U.S. has reached out and touched Iran in its most sensitive facilities, notice has been served. Could Iran restart its nuclear assembly line? Of course. Could it try to recapitalize and rearm Hamas and Hezbollah? Of course. Will it?

NEPA IS BROKEN BUT THE STATES CAN FIX IT

There have got to be at least a few senior military officers and clerics who are wondering whether it's time for Khamenei to simply go the way of Nikita Khrushchev in October 1964, when the then-leader of the Soviet Union suddenly found himself retired by his colleagues for leading it recklessly.

Khamenei probably doesn't sit with his back to any door these days. And the generals and scientists who are left? Perhaps they'd like to enjoy retirement and not wait for the next Israeli surprise. You can bet that the Mossad will be reveling in this new opportunity to use regime friction and fear to recruit even more valuable sources.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Make Medicaid great again","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3458913/make-medicaid-great-again/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 04:01:00 GMT","

Medicaid's original purpose was to be a safety net for people who could not adequately provide themselves with healthcare. The federal government matched funds from states to ensure eligible residents could get hospital care and physician visits. The partnership sought to strengthen state-led efforts to cover poor people who could not afford private insurance.

This idea of Medicaid being a lifeline for the poorest members of society persists in political debate and public memory, but it is no longer true. Medicaid today is the nation's largest single source of healthcare funding, with 70 million-80 million enrolled, just less than a quarter of the population. It is the largest payer for long-term services and for mental health and substance use disorder services. In fiscal 2023, it cost taxpayers about $890 billion, with the federal government covering 69% and states contributing the remaining 31%. Medicaid spending will top $1 trillion a year by 2030, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The program's explosive growth since the passage of Obamacare in 2010 has greatly increased the federal deficit, creating a fiscal wreck and undermining the economy. Obamacare expanded Medicaid coverage to most non-elderly adults with incomes up to 38 percentage points above the Federal Poverty Level, which was dramatically above the previous threshold. It entitled a large new category of adult beneficiaries, including childless adults, and encouraged states to expand coverage by topping up their outlays with generous federal funding. A 2012 Supreme Court ruling allowed states not to expand their programs, but 41 states did so.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed the Senate, includes much-needed reform of the 60-year-old program. Crucially, it changes eligibility and verification to cut abuse. It would help preserve and strengthen the program and realign it with its original purpose of providing a safety net to the poor. It would become less of an abused program that has, for a generation, eroded the successful 1996 Clinton-Gingrich welfare reforms.

A recent CBO report found that Medicaid includes 2.6 million ineligible people, and other studies suggest the number is even higher. Tens of billions of dollars are wasted each year because of administrative sloppiness and improper payments to ineligible adults who provide insufficient documentation.

FACT CHECK: THE TRUTH BEHIND CLAIMS THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ACT WILL CUT MEDICAID

Millions of able-bodied adults draw benefits without working, draining the overstretched system. The Senate bill required recipients to work 80 hours a month. This will discourage lazy and feckless people from applying for Medicaid, and it will help ensure that help can go to the truly vulnerable for years to come. Healthy people choosing not to work in a robust job market are defrauding the system and endangering people who truly need help. Republican politicians wavering in their support of the bill because of these reforms should understand that Medicaid fraudsters don't vote Republican anyway. Support for unnecessary government handouts generally goes to Democrats. Imposing reasonable work requirements — those enacted by former President Bill Clinton in 1994 were far more stringent — ensures the solvency of Medicaid and fosters a culture that values individual responsibility, without which prosperity is impossible.

No rightful recipient of Medicaid should be “kicked off” the rolls. But that's not what the new legislation does. Only those who should not have been on Medicaid will lose their handouts. Congress designed the program to protect only the most vulnerable. The Senate bill helps restore this original vision. Congress should adopt these measures to ensure America's fiscal health and help the truly needy.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","White House says ‘every' nationwide injunction to be revisited","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3458495/white-house-trump-every-nationwide-injunction-revisited-supreme-court/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The Trump administration is pushing for the lifting of all previous nationwide injunctions that restricted President Donald Trump‘s agenda after a major Supreme Court ruling in favor of executive authority.

A White House official told the Washington Examiner that, in light of the ruling, all pending nationwide injunctions will face new scrutiny.

“[The administration] began working immediately to have every injunction revisited,” the official said. “All of these injunctions are obstructing President Trump's agenda, which the American people gave him a mandate to implement.”

The official also included a list of 32 injunctions and other executive orders that could see new life under the ruling. Among those are rulings related to layoffs attempted by the Department of Government Efficiency, several executive orders on border security, and orders related to election integrity.

The news comes after Trump's win at the Supreme Court last week.

“Thanks to this decision, we can now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,” Trump said Friday in an impromptu press conference at the White House.

The high court ruled that district courts cannot issue nationwide injunctions, a significant victory for the president's agenda in the face of mounting legal challenges. Local judges had handed down dozens of injunctions during Trump's presidency, which administration officials described as a “colossal abuse of power.”

“These injunctions have blocked our policies from tariffs to military readiness, to immigration, to foreign affairs, fraud, abuse, and many other issues,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the same news briefing. “The judges have tried to seize the executive branch's power, and they cannot do that. No longer.”

Going forward, Trump said he plans to implement policies that would end birthright citizenship, end sanctuary city funding, suspend refugee resettlement, freeze “unnecessary” funding, and stop taxpayers from “paying for transgender surgeries,” among other things. 

In the DOGE cases, the Trump administration has proposed sweeping layoffs to vast sections of the federal workforce to save taxpayer money and “drain the swamp.” However, Democrats and government employee unions have pushed back through lawsuits, and judges have blocked portions of DOGE's work, saying it violates the Constitution's appointments clause and separation of powers.

In the birthright citizenship case, which Trump says is related to border security because it will lessen the incentive for people to enter the U.S. illegally, district judges have ruled that the order violates the plain text of the 14th Amendment, which reads that “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

The Trump administration argues that children of undocumented immigrants and temporary visa holders are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States, and that the amendment was intended for the children of formerly enslaved people.

To the president's opponents, last week's ruling from a conservative-dominated Supreme Court means Trump is free to pursue what they view as extreme policies with fewer legal restraints. They also point to what they say is hypocrisy from Republicans, who did not complain when President Joe Biden saw his student loan forgiveness plans scuttled by nationwide injunctions.

Others point to the underlying issue in the case and vow to protect birthright citizenship with the tools still available to them.

“The Supreme Court's opinion does not address whether President Trump's order is constitutional, nor does it declare that a nationwide injunction is unavailable to the states,” Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford wrote in response to the ruling. 

“The court merely says that a universal injunction against the order may not be appropriate in some cases and sets forth standards for the district court to use in making that determination,” he added. “Either way, Nevadans remain protected.”

Democratic strategist Tom Cochran argues that the ruling may prove to be a mixed bag for Trump, who can no longer point to courts for blocking his policies and instead will bear their full burden.

“It changes the game and Trump gains significant operational freedom,” Cochran said. “But, I'll add that power cuts both ways. When controversial policies move faster without judicial speed bumps, the political backlash will land squarely on him with no possibility of a blame game.”

For Democrats, the key will be to stop fighting the process and start winning on substance, he added.

“When Trump's policies hurt real families, that's the story,” Cochran said. “Executives without immediate checks tend to overreach. That's the scary part, but also it creates political opportunity for Democrats, if they can properly mobilize people.”

The majority opinion in Trump v. CASA held that universal injunctions, blocking laws or policies from being enforced against anyone, “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts.”

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the court's 6-3 majority, reined in the rulings of lower courts to issue universal injunctions. She also slammed Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissent, which decried “an imperial Executive,” but Barrett noted Jackson's dissent seemed to embrace “an imperial judiciary.”

In a scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that Republicans would live to regret the ruling.

“Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship,” she wrote. “Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.”

John Shu, a constitutional law expert and former official in both Bush administrations, said that one immediate effect of the ruling was the DOJ's lawsuit against Los Angeles's sanctuary laws that was filed on Monday, positing that it likely would not have happened without the high court ruling.

“It's related in the sense that if the Supreme Court had ruled the other way, I think the DOJ would not have been so aggressive in filing the lawsuit,” Shu said, noting the DOJ can now file suit in more localities without the risk of losing a nationwide injunction.

MSNBC legal analyst Melissa Murray took things a step further, calling the ruling a “death blow to the rule of law” with lower courts now “kneecapped” from stopping the Trump administration.

Shu took issue with this characterization as well.

“It is definitely not a blow to the rule of law. If anything, it enhances the rule of law,” Shu said, pointing to the Judiciary Act of 1789. “The statute doesn't authorize nationwide injunctions. Congress could amend the Judiciary Act, but they haven't done that.”

The ruling does not entirely end nationwide injunctions, with judges instructed to use them only in cases where doing so is the only way to provide “complete relief.” However, it could result in more work for the administration and its opponents, who will battle more local jurisdictions in the future and in more complex class action lawsuits.

The attorneys leading the birthright citizenship case have already taken steps to seek class action status, which would cover all children who would be denied citizenship under Trump's executive order.

The broader issue of executive vs. judicial power came up during last Friday's press briefing, with a reporter asking Trump what his message was to Americans who fear the ruling will give the White House and the executive branch more power.

Trump quickly dismissed the notion.

“It gives power back to people that should have it, including Congress, including the presidency,” Trump said. “And it only takes bad power away from judges.”

‘Thank you for your attention to this matter': Trump's latest viral moment

Republicans, such as GOP strategist John Feehery, say the ruling is long overdue. 

“What the Democrats have been doing to the Trump White House has been completely outrageous and anti-democratic,” Feehery said. “The Supreme Court should have stepped in earlier, in my humble opinion. But I am glad that they finally intervened.”

Feehery predicted that the ruling will benefit both Republican and Democratic administrations alike going forward.

“This will help Trump, but also help all future Presidents to implement the agenda that they campaigned on and that the voters voted for,” Feehery said. “District judges are not a good stand-in for the President. Nobody elected them to anything.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Several centrist House Republicans could defect to sink President Donald Trump‘s “big, beautiful bill.” The bill can only survive three GOP defectors if all members are present and voting, and numerous Republicans have expressed hesitation to support it.

The bill narrowly passed in May after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) included some sweeteners to win over reluctant Republicans. After a marathon session, the Senate passed the significantly revised bill on Tuesday in a 51-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.

House Republicans are less enthused with the new version of the bill despite Trump's threats and his July 4 deadline to pass it. Centrists expressed dismay with welfare cuts, while fiscal hawks were uneasy with its potential to raise the deficit, which was the main problem that triggered Elon Musk's fallout with Trump.

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) appeared to be the firmest “no” outside of Massie and Davidson, responding in the negative twice when reporters asked if he would vote for the bill as he did in May.

“What we ought to do is take exactly the House bill that we sent over and go home and say ‘when you're serious, come back,'” Norman said, according to the New York Times.

Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) heavily implied that he would not vote in favor of the bill unless significant changes were made, which would require it to be sent back to the Senate.

“The changes the Senate made to the House passed Beautiful Bill, including unacceptable increases to the national debt and the deficit, are going to make passage in the House difficult,” he said, expressing his willingness to work past the July 4 deadline to make it acceptable. “We cannot in good faith pass a bill through our chamber that hinges on cut corners and earmarks. The American people won't stand for it.”

Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) took issue with the bill's treatment of green energy subsidies, saying the Senate's changes in favor of them are “a deal-killer of an already bad deal.”

Roy was careful to portray his opposition as out of support for Trump.

“The President's team has worked hard with us. … I love the president and what he's doing. I want to deliver. But here we sit, and I didn't come to Washington to increase deficits. I didn't come to Washington to continue the Great New Scam,” Roy said, asking why they couldn't just repeal the green subsidies. “The president is kicking ass. Congress is up here dithering.”

Roy clarified that rejecting the Senate's version of the bill would not “kill” it. He suggested the House write a new version and send it back to the upper chamber.

Rep. Roy: ""The President's team has worked hard with us… I want to deliver. But here we sit, and I didn't come to Washington to increase deficits. I didn't come to Washington to continue the Great New Scam…The President is kicking ass. Congress is up here dithering."" pic.twitter.com/qfxDycrGnD

Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) also opposed the bill in support of Trump, favorably quoting Stutzman's X post explaining his opposition to the current version of the bill.

The House Freedom Caucus has adopted this position, even releasing an ad portraying opposition to the Senate's version of Trump's bill as support for the president.

“The House Freedom Caucus says no” to the reinstituted subsidies, the ad said. “The message: Stand firm. Stand with President Trump and end the Green New Scam now.”

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) said the Senate's version of the bill “is not ready for prime time.”

“We support the president's agenda. The president's agenda was not to raise the deficit by three-quarters of a trillion dollars over the next 10 years,” he told Fox News in an interview. “The bottom line is the House will have its say, and this will not sail through the House. We're going to have to negotiate with the Senate one more time.”

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate's version would add $3.4 trillion to the national deficit, compared to the $2.4 trillion the House version would add.

On the other end of the conservative spectrum, centrist Rep. David Valadao (R-CA) also portrayed his opposition to the bill as in line with Trump's position.

“I've been clear from the start that I will not support a final reconciliation bill that makes harmful cuts to Medicaid, puts critical funding at risk, or threatens the stability of healthcare providers across CA-22,” he said in a statement on X released before the Senate's version of the bill passed.

“President Trump was clear when he said to root out waste, fraud, and abuse without cutting Medicaid, and I wholeheartedly agree. I urge my Senate colleagues to stick to the Medicaid provisions in H.R. 1 — otherwise, I will vote no,” Valadao added.

On Tuesday, Johnson expressed dissatisfaction with the Senate's version of the bill, saying he was “not happy” but “we understand this is the process.” Nevertheless, the House speaker said he would push to get all Republicans to vote “yes.”

Meanwhile, Trump is working overtime to push reluctant House Republicans to support the bill. He cleared his Wednesday schedule in order to meet with holdouts.

“Our Country will make a fortune this year, more than any of our competitors, but only if the Big, Beautiful Bill is PASSED!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social. “As they say, Trump's been right about everything, and this is the easiest of them all to predict. Republicans, don't let the Radical Left Democrats push you around. We've got all the cards, and we are going to use them.”

TRUMP CLEARS SCHEDULE TO CONVINCE HOUSE GOP HOLDOUTS TO PASS ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Despite widespread doubts in the House, Trump suggested on Tuesday that the new version of the bill would “do very well in the House.”

“We thought the Senate was going to be tougher than the House. We got there, and we got pretty much what we wanted,” he said when asked if he thought it would be a struggle to wrestle House Republicans to vote in favor.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Surveillance, censorship, detention were things to worry about back home. Now they're here.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

“I need to get my degree safely,” the student told me. A Chinese national and doctoral candidate in social sciences at an American university, she'd recently heard that her social-media messages might be checked at the U.S. border. “Safely,” for her, meant a series of measures to avoid anything incriminating: She downloaded the end-to-end-encrypted messaging app Signal and set her messages to disappear after 24 hours, and she also no longer sends sensitive links in group chats—that is, anything involving Donald Trump, Israel, or DEI. She's not the only one with a new sense of anxiety. Whenever her Chinese classmates talk about American politics at the campus cafeteria or in school, she told me, they lower their voices.

The day she and I spoke, June 10, was the final day of China's university-entrance exams. She had been watching videos on the Chinese social-media platform Weibo of students back home being cheered on to the examination venues by crowds, of flowers being handed out, and of police asking motorists not to honk so that students could concentrate on their test. She said it felt as though the whole society was behind them, willing their success.

Earlier that day, she had received an email from her U.S. university department that provided an emergency plan for sudden visa revocation. The memo included a recommendation to make a contact list of immigration attorneys, and a notice to save both digital and printed copies of the plan. The email even came with guidance on securing temporary housing, implying that students needed a backup plan. Seeking clarification, students were told that they were responsible for covering any costs.

“We're students; we don't have lawyers,” she said. “We just don't know how to navigate this.”

The administration's actions had led to rising defensiveness and pessimism in her circle. And the housing advice prompted her to ask, half-jokingly, “Are we at war, or what?”

I spoke with five Chinese nationals for this article: an undergraduate, a master's student, two people pursuing Ph.D.s, and one newly tenured faculty member. None of them wanted their name used. The younger students—less tethered to the United States—spoke openly about considering other options: countries with clearer rules, less visa ambiguity and angst. The doctoral students were more invested in trying to stay and, despite growing uncertainty, wanted to build a career in the United States. I have been writing about China, from Beijing, for the past few years, so I'm used to my sources asking for anonymity. People in China are acutely conscious of the limits of permissible speech there and how crossing those lines can affect their future. But this time, I wasn't speaking with Chinese people in China; I was speaking with Chinese people in the United States. This time, they weren't afraid of their own government back home, but the American one they were living under.

The grounds for their fear were not hypothetical. The United States is trying to draw a red line to keep out Chinese students it perceives as a national-security threat. The problem is that no one knows exactly where the line is.

From 2009 to 2022, Chinese students were the largest group of international students in the United States. At peak, in the 2019–20 academic year, some 370,000 Chinese students were enrolled at American universities. Numbers have since tapered off, initially because of the pandemic. Then, on May 28, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. would begin “aggressively” revoking visas of Chinese students, including those studying in “sensitive” fields or with Chinese Communist Party links.

A Republican-backed bill currently in Congress goes further still—it would ban visas for all Chinese nationals looking to study in the United States. The authors of the bill point to China's 2017 National Intelligence Law, which requires citizens to support intelligence-gathering for their home country even when abroad. Although the GOP bill may not pass, its hard-line stance underlines the level of uncertainty students now face.

In June, President Donald Trump appeared to give Chinese students in the U.S. a reprieve when he announced that they would remain welcome, pending a putative trade deal with China. But by making plain that the students were a token in his trade war, Trump only increased the uncertainty of their predicament.

The Chinese students I spoke with were intently parsing official edicts in an effort to work out which course subjects were sensitive and which weren't. What I detected from my conversations with them was their sense of being caught in a guessing game. A formerly innocuous decision about whether to leave the U.S. for a trip now seemed like a high-stakes gamble. In the country that they had believed offered the freest and most resource-rich research environment, they were now carefully policing their own discourse. Back in China, students know the score, but they never expected to be contending with these worries in the United States. In its nationalist rhetoric and sweeping use of state-security justifications, the U.S. was starting to mirror aspects of the very system it has long denounced.

“The White House website looks like a Chinese government site now,” the newly tenured professor told me, referring to the oversize portraits of President Trump.

When the social-sciences Ph.D. student first applied to study abroad, she regarded the U.S. as the world leader for research in her field. Among her peers, the opportunity to pursue postgraduate studies at an American university was the runaway first choice. She had graduated from China's elite Tsinghua University, known especially for its STEM programs, so America's close ties between research and business, with proximity to venture capital, were part of the draw. “You want to see your work realized in real life,” she told me.

That optimism has faded as she's seen the heightened U.S.-China tensions filtering down into life on an American campus. “You always walk with your Chinese identity,” she said. “It's hard to isolate yourself from ongoing chaos.”

Even during the first Trump administration, some of her friends from China had sensed that the environment in the U.S. was growing more hostile. Those who were studying subjects with potential military applications, such as robotics and information systems, applied to European programs instead. But they faced difficulties there too: After initially receiving offers from universities in the European Union, they saw their visa prospects vanish into a bureaucratic thicket of vetting checks. European countries have also increased their scrutiny of Chinese students who conduct STEM research with potential military, as well as civilian, applications.

A Chinese student at New York University told me that he'd considered joining a “No Kings” rally this month but decided to stay away, fearing that he might endanger his visa. “It's becoming the same as the situation in China,” he said. “You can talk about foreign policy, but not domestic policy.”

After his positive experience of a year at a U.S. high school, he'd had no hesitation about applying only to American universities—which ranked highly for the engineering degree he expected to graduate with. But he told me he might have applied elsewhere if he had known how quickly American government policy would turn against international students, and Chinese students in particular. Now he was living with the same visa-status anxiety facing friends of his—Chinese nationals or people raised in China—who were seeing their renewals denied or delayed with vague demands for additional paperwork. He wasn't privy to their full applications, but he believed that these obstacles were a result of their Chinese ties.

The NYU student wasn't alone in sensing a shift. A master's student told me that during her reentry to the U.S. last year, she was pulled aside into what Chinese students colloquially call the “little black room,” an immigration-interview room at the airport. This reflects a pattern of heightened scrutiny at the border that began under the Biden administration, but Chinese citizens are familiar with the “little black room” because it's what security officers back home use if they suspect some kind of anti-government conduct.

The U.S. immigration officer checking her passport said she could leave after the student declared she was studying graphic design. If her answer had been computer science, she believed from accounts she'd seen on social media, “I'd definitely stay there for a few hours.”

A Ph.D. student in a Republican state who has planned a research trip out of the country this summer told me that her adviser expressly warned her not to get involved in protests or post anything pro-Palestine online, and to watch her driving speed. She said these warnings began last year, as red states anticipated Trump's return to power. Fearing that she could be denied reentry, she was ready to cancel her trip entirely if official U.S. announcements became more hard-line.

The master's student has exercised similar precautions. Knowing that social-media accounts are checked and have a bearing on visa issuance, she restricts herself to sharing internet memes that broadly hint at her frustration without specifically criticizing federal immigration policy. Memes live in a “gray area,” she said. Being vague makes them “safer.”

This moment is by no means the first time that the U.S. has viewed Chinese students with suspicion. In the 1950s, American officials placed the scientist Qian Xuesen under house arrest and eventually deported him. The U.S. authorities came to regret their action: Back in China, Qian became the father of its missile-and-space program.

Relations began to thaw in the '70s after President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China. In 1979, China's leader Deng Xiaoping met with President Jimmy Carter and agreed to step up scientific exchanges. Implicit in the U.S. government's motivation was a belief that if Chinese students were exposed to the benefits of democracy, they would recognize what they were missing and create a political constituency for reforming China.

This spirit of engagement persisted through China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. By then, the aspiration of studying abroad had been normalized for Chinese young people—as a personal choice. The wildly popular 1990s TV show A Beijinger in New York, which aired on the state broadcaster China Central Television, was a testament to that generation's curiosity about the outside world. This cultural trend continued into the early 2000s, when “Harvard Girl” Liu Yiting became a national sensation as an American-educated success story. Her parents' best-selling book chronicling how they'd raised her was a model for millions of other Chinese families, all hoping to nurture their own Harvard Girl.

The recently U.S.-tenured professor I spoke with came of age during China's relatively liberal era of the late 1990s and early 2000s, under the premierships of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, so he had earned his master's at a very different time in U.S. politics, during Barack Obama's presidency. His own research field is national security—and he acknowledged that the United States had legitimate concerns about Chinese government–sponsored actions, citing instances of intellectual-property theft.

“I just don't think the administration is dealing with this in a targeted way,” he told me. Refusing students a visa simply because of links to the CCP was too broad, he argued, given China's condition as a one-party state in which almost every institution has a formal party presence. He supported the vetting of students, based on solid evidence and with due process.

In the student-deportation cases he was following, some were being removed because they had once been charged with a minor offense, even if the charge had subsequently been dismissed. “It's shocking,” he said. “Their status was revoked overnight.” He said, in most instances, the Chinese students' universities received no prior notice.

“My guess is the government has adopted some kind of screening system,” he said, but one that seemed to him crude and unreliable. “There are a lot of false positives.” (I requested comment from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, but received no response.)

This student's home country, he added, was not making things easier for Chinese students abroad. “The National Intelligence Law is not doing us a favor,” he said: The law includes penalties for obstructing intelligence work, which puts Chinese nationals abroad in a very awkward position. I asked what he'd do if the Chinese government asked him to share information; he said he'd call an American lawyer.

On RedNote, a social-media app popular with Chinese students, posts continue to circulate about deportations over such minor infractions as speeding tickets. Some fear that if they travel abroad, they will be denied reentry to the United States. Chinese students are familiar with surveillance, scrutiny, and expansive definitions of national security. They just didn't expect all of that from the U.S. government, as well.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Small towns have tried public grocery stores. How would they fare in a major city?

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

New York City—where takeout is a food group and ovens are for storing clothes—may soon get into the grocery business. If he wins the general election this November, Zohran Mamdani, the new Democratic nominee for mayor, has said he will build a network of municipally owned, affordable grocery stores, one in each of the city's five boroughs. According to Mamdani, the city could help pay for the stores' rent and operating costs by taxing the wealthy, and the stores won't seek to turn a profit, enabling them to sell food at wholesale cost. In the vision Mamdani laid out in a campaign video, the stores' mission would be combating “price gouging” by offering lower prices than corporate grocery stores.



If Mamdani is able to pull this off—a huge if, given the economic considerations, as critics are quick to point out—it will be the first time in American history that a city of New York's size has commanded its own grocery stores. New Yorkers are in favor of the idea: Two-thirds of them, including 54 percent of Republicans, support public groceries, according to a March poll by the Climate and Community Institute, a progressive think tank. But because nothing exactly like Mamdani's plan has ever been tried before in a large city, no one can be certain whether it will really be able to sell more affordable food, let alone help address food insecurity and health disparities in the city. What Mamdani has proposed is a $60 million experiment, with New Yorkers as test subjects.



A couple of other large American cities are trying out similar plans, but what little real precedent exists for Mamdani's plan comes mostly from rural America. A handful of towns have opened municipally owned groceries, mostly because they had no choice: Small towns once relied on mom-and-pop shops, but these are vanishing as dollar stores proliferate and big-box retailers in larger rural cities monopolize the wholesale supply. Without a supermarket, residents have to either drive out of town for food or rely on convenience stores and dollar stores, which don't stock many healthy options. In 2018, the town of Baldwin, Florida (current population 1,366), lost its only grocery when the local IGA closed. It became a food desert: The next-closest supermarket was 10 miles away—not a simple trip for older adults who don't drive or for people without a car. The mayor proposed a municipally owned store, which opened the next year. In Kansas, the cities of St. Paul (population 603) and Erie (population 1,019) started their own grocery stores in 2008 and 2021, respectively. St. Paul had not had a supermarket since 1985.



The fates of these stores and their hometowns have varied. Baldwin Market became a lifeline for many residents, particularly during the pandemic. But it struggled to break even and closed in 2024. Now the town largely relies on a handful of convenience stores and a Dollar General as it awaits the rumored opening of a new private grocery. Erie Market similarly struggled to balance its books. Operations were a challenge; the store sometimes stocked expired food, and its refrigerated section lost power after a thunderstorm. Last year, the city leased it to a private owner, who has yet to reopen the store.



By contrast, St. Paul Supermarket has operated as a fully municipally owned grocery since 2013 (before that, it was funded by a community-development group) and shows no signs of closing. Its success has been attributed to community buy-in. Locals were motivated by the desire to preserve their city, fearing that the lack of a grocery store would drive away current residents and scare off potential new ones. “It's a retention strategy, but it's also a recruitment strategy,” Rial Carver, the program leader at Kansas State University's Rural Grocery Initiative, told me.



The primary goal of a municipally owned store is to get food to people who need it. But the city will have to decide which food to stock and, inevitably, will face questions about how those choices influence the diet or health of potential customers. (Imagine the criticism a Mamdani administration might face for subsidizing Cheetos—or, for that matter, organic, gluten-free cheese puffs.) Theoretically, getting people better access to any sort of food can have health benefits, Craig Willingham, the managing director of CUNY's Urban Food Policy Institute, told me. But so few examples of successful municipal grocery stores exist that there is virtually no research on their health effects.



Research on the health impact of opening a privately owned grocery in a food desert has had mixed results. An ongoing study of a food-desert neighborhood in Pittsburgh has found that after a supermarket opened, residents consumed fewer calories overall—less added sugar, but also fewer whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. A 2018 study set in a Bronx neighborhood with few grocery stores linked the opening of a new supermarket to residents eating more vegetables and fruit and consuming fewer soft drinks, salty snacks, and pastries, but their spending on unhealthy foods increased along with their purchases of healthy ones.



A new grocery alone won't change food habits, according to a 2019 study led by Hunt Allcott, an economist at Stanford. “People shop at the new store, but they buy the same kinds of groceries they had been buying before,” Allcott told me. What does help nudge people toward buying healthier foods, he said, is making those foods affordable—while also taxing unhealthy items such as soda.



With so little background information to go on, there's no telling how Mamdani's experiment will play out in a big city—or whether it will even get off the ground. New York differs from the sites of other municipal-grocery experiments not only in its size and density but also in its general abundance of grocery stores. Proximity isn't the major reason people can't get food, healthy or otherwise, Allcott said—cost is. From 2013 to 2023, the amount of money New Yorkers spent on groceries rose nearly 66 percent—far higher than the national average. The city's poverty rate—a metric based on the price of a minimal diet—is nearly twice that of the national average; from 2020 to 2023, one in three New Yorkers used food pantries. In Chelsea, a Manhattan neighborhood that is known for its luxury high-rises and is also home to a large housing project, some residents would rather take the train into New Jersey to buy groceries than shop at the expensive local supermarkets, Willingham said.



Grocery stores are tough business. Profit margins are as slim as 1 to 3 percent, and prices are largely determined by suppliers, who tend to privilege volume. A single grocer (or the small network that Mamdani envisions) won't get as good a deal as a large chain. And running a store is hard, Carver told me: A manager needs to be nimble and adjust to customer demands, skills that municipal bodies are not exactly known for. In New York, at least, there's reason to expect that public groceries wouldn't actually be cheaper.



Mamdani (whose campaign did not respond to a request for comment) has acknowledged that New York's city government might not be cut out for stocking shelves. If the pilot plan doesn't work, he said on the podcast Plain English last week, he won't try to scale it up. Yet he believes that it's worth trying. “This is a proposal of reasonable policy experimentation,” he said.



National grocery costs are expected to increase 2.2 percent this year, according to the USDA. Price hikes will hit poor Americans even harder if Congress passes President Donald Trump's megabill, which includes cuts to federal food-assistance programs such as SNAP. Among such threats to food affordability, the mere possibility of change could justify a trial of something new. Other large cities, too, are signing up as guinea pigs: Madison, Wisconsin, is in the process of opening a municipally owned store. Last year, Atlanta addressed food insecurity among public-school students and their families by opening a free grocery store—it functions like a food pantry but is stocked like a supermarket—funded by a public-private partnership. Its impact on health hasn't yet been studied, but demand is high. “We do slots for appointments, and they're immediately gone,” Chelsea Montgomery, the adviser to operations of Atlanta Public Schools, told me.



Mamdani's proposal is hardly the first unorthodox policy experiment New York has considered. The city took a chance on congestion pricing to reduce traffic and fund public transit, on universal pre-K to guarantee access to early childhood education, and on supervised injection sites to curb the overdose crisis. All have achieved their objectives. Perhaps, in a decade, millions of New Yorkers will get their organic, gluten-free cheese puffs on the cheap at a city-owned market. Or perhaps the whole project will go the way of the city's failed attempt to end poverty by offering cash in exchange for efforts to build healthy habits. The point of experimentation is to find out.

Dispatches from the Iranian capital under bombardment.

On June 13, 2025, Israel launched air strikes on nuclear and military sites in Iran. Over the 12 days that followed, the Israeli campaign expanded to include energy and other infrastructure; Iran retaliated with drone and missile strikes inside Israel; and the United States entered the conflict with strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities on June 22. Alireza Iranmehr is a novelist and an essayist who lives in the north of Iran but returned to Tehran to witness and document the bombardment. He sent the following series of short dispatches to his translator throughout the conflict.

The enormous roundabout at Azadi Square was full of cars, yet still felt somehow deserted. Then it dawned on me: Humans—they were mostly missing. Where normally tens of thousands of pedestrians thronged, now there were only a scattered few. Even many of the cars sat empty.

Azadi Square is commonly the first place one sees upon arriving in Tehran and the last upon departure; several major expressways pass through it, and it is not far from Mehrabad Airport, which serves domestic flights. The airport reportedly had been bombarded a couple of days before, but I could not discern any sign of destruction from where I stood—just the smell of burned plastic cutting through the usual city smog.

Earlier that day, in Bandar Anzali, on the Caspian shore, I had been lucky to find a cab driver willing to bring me all the way to Tehran. The driver told me that he'd made the opposite trip with three young women in the middle of the night—and charged them 25 times the going rate. “You can see what's going on,” he said. “There's no gas. All the cars are stuck on the road. This is a five-hour trip, and it took us 15 hours.”

He wasn't lying: The stream of cars trying to get out of Tehran appeared endless. Some vehicles were stranded on the sides of the road, having run out of fuel. Men banded together to move huge concrete barriers out of the way, so that they could turn their vehicles around to head back into the city. My driver pointed to the rear of his car and said, “I had an extra four 20-gallon cans of gasoline just in case. I didn't want to get stranded.”

I asked why he didn't just stay in Bandar Anzali after dropping off the women.

“And stay where? My wife and kids are back in Tehran,” he said. “And you? Why are you going to Tehran?”

I wanted to tell him that I was going back to Tehran to witness the most important event in Iran's recent history, so that I could write about it. But that suddenly seemed ridiculous and unbelievable. I said instead, “I'm going to see some of my friends.”

He nodded. “Be careful,” he said, with a note of suspicion. “There are a lot of spies around these days in Tehran.”

Was he suggesting that I might be one of those spies? It rubbed me the wrong way, but I didn't say anything.

Now, nearly alone in the middle of Azadi Square, I was seized with doubt, and then fear. The streets and sidewalks seemed wider than before, and newly ominous. I started to walk toward Azadi Boulevard when an ear-splitting sound threw me suddenly off balance.

I looked up at the sky: Anti-aircraft fire and tracers appeared, clusters of little dots that ascended and then turned into flashes of white. There was nothing else in that sky. No airplanes. Down the road, I saw another man standing, looking up with intense curiosity, as though mesmerized.

Read: The invisible city of Tehran

No sirens sounded. No crowds ran looking for shelter. There was only the vacant expanse above, and an eerie noise like the buzzing of flies after the anti-aircraft guns went quiet. I'd heard somewhere that this was the sound of Israeli drones searching for their targets. Somewhere far away, an explosion boomed, and then came the anti-aircraft fire again, even farther away.

Strange to say, but my fear lifted. I felt calm as I headed for the home of a friend on Jeyhoon Street—one who had decided to remain in Tehran and said I could spend the night. So I strolled, knowing the sky would light up again before long.

At 2 a.m., after a long break, explosions came, one after another. I had left Jeyhoon Street and was now staying with Mostafa and Sahar, two of my best friends, in an apartment on the top floor of a building at the Ghasr Crossroad. This area of the city was packed with military and security sites that made likely targets for bombardment.

Mostafa worked for the Tehran municipality. Sahar, after years of trying, was finally pregnant. When I'd called to ask if I could stay the night, they were delighted—at last, company in their anxiety. They'd remained in Tehran because Sahar had been prescribed strict bed rest.

“If we stay, we may or may not get killed,” Mostafa told me. “But if we leave, our child will definitely not make it. So we've stayed.”

By 2:30 a.m., the sound of anti-aircraft fire was relentless. I saw a shadow moving in the hallway: Mostafa. He asked if I was awake, then made for my window, opening it. Now the sounds were exponentially louder, and a pungent odor of something burning entered the room. He'd come in here to smoke a cigarette, and in the effort to keep the smoke away from Sahar and their bedroom, he had allowed the entire apartment to be permeated by the scorching smell of war.

“Sahar isn't afraid?” I asked him.

“Sahar is afraid of everything since the pregnancy,” he replied.

A flash brightened the sky, and a few moments later, the sound of a distant blast swept over us. Mostafa left his half-smoked cigarette on the edge of the sill and hurried to check on Sahar. I saw a bright orange flame to the east of us outside. Apropos of nothing, or everything, I thought of “The Wall,” Jean-Paul Sartre's short story set during the Spanish Civil War: Several prisoners huddle in a basement, waiting to be shot and wondering about the pain to come—whether it would be better to take a bullet to the face or to the gut. I imagined myself in the midst of that explosion, wondered whether shattered glass or falling steel beams and concrete would be what killed me.

Mostafa reappeared. I asked how Sahar was doing.

“She's still reading,” he said. “I think it was the Tehranpars district they just hit.”

“No, it looked to me like it was Resalat,” I said. Then, after a pause: “You remember how during the war with Iraq, if anyone ever smoked in front of a window they'd say the guy is suicidal? For years, my father had blankets nailed over all our windows, to make sure our lights weren't visible from outside.”

“They say the same thing now,” Mostafa said. “‘Don't stand in front of windows.' But I think it makes no difference. The more advanced technology gets, the less room you have to hide. Window or no window means nothing.”

I'd imagined that getting inside Shariati Hospital without a press ID would be impossible. But as with just about everything else in Iran, access was a matter of having a contact.

The hallways were packed with injured people, staff running every which way—more than one TV crew looked utterly lost on first entering the building. At one point, someone announced that the hospital was full and would have to redirect the newly injured elsewhere.

I stuck my head into rooms, as though looking for someone I'd lost. That was plausible enough under the circumstances that no one paid me any mind. After a while, I began to feel as though I really had lost somebody. The hospital had become a field of haphazard body parts, the smell of Betadine infusing everything.

A man sat quite still in the hallway, most of his face seemingly gone and wrapped in gauze. Another man had lost a hand. He stared quietly at the ceiling with a strangely beatific look, as though his face was made of clay that was now drying with the impression of an old smile that wouldn't go away.

In one room, a TV crew interviewed a woman. She described the moment her home exploded. First, she'd heard multiple blasts in the distance. She told her husband and child to get away from the window. Then a flash, and the entire building trembled. Their apartment had been on the third floor, but when she opened her eyes, she was in the first-floor parking lot. Rescue workers still hadn't found a trace of her husband or child. She began to cry, and I retreated back into the hallway, where an old man sat on his knees, praying. He was wearing a thick, black winter skullcap despite the heat. He looked up at me and said, “Half the house is gone. The other half remains. My son and daughter-in-law were in the other half.”

“Are they all right?” I asked him.

The old man didn't answer and went back to his praying. After a while, he started to weep. A half minute later came the sounds of air defenses. A woman screamed, pointing at the window, while several others tried to calm her down.

Outside, an ambulance wailed into the lot. Two days earlier, ambulances had been directed to turn off their sirens so as not to add to the general anxiety. But today, the alarms were back. I was in no special hurry to get to my next destination, but somehow I found myself speed-walking, even running, toward the address.

Arash Azizi: Iran's stunning incompetence

The woman people had been calling the “cat lady” stood at her door, looking past me as though into a burning forest. I followed her to the kitchen, where she handed me a glass of lemonade. There had to be several dozen cats in that house—maybe 60 or more. The woman tiptoed among them like someone walking in a shallow pool of water. “Only 12 are mine,” she said. “The rest—their owners have been dropping off here the past few days.”

“How come they don't fight with each other?” I asked. I've had my share of cats and know that they don't readily share space with their own kind.

She said, “In normal times, yes. They'd fight. But it's as if they know what's going on. When they first get here, they take one look around and then find a corner and sit quietly and wait.” During explosions, the cats would huddle together or hide under the furniture.

I asked her whether she was also afraid. She smiled. “When you have to take care of this many cats, you don't have time to be afraid.”

A tabby with big, orange eyes rubbed against her ankles. She bent down to pick up the animal and caress it. Some people had abandoned their house pets on the streets when they left the city, she told me. They had little chance of surviving. She'd become the cat lady by posting an ad: For absolutely free, she was willing to take care of anyone's cat.

“My biggest problem right now is finding enough litter and dry food for them,” she told me. “All the pet shops are closed. I try to give them wet food that I cook myself. But a lot of them are not used to it and get diarrhea.”

She told me that one pet-shop owner she knew had promised to come back to Tehran that night with supplies. I contemplated that as I finished a second lemonade: A pet-shop owner returning to Tehran under bombardment to make sure these cats have litter and food.

Back outside, the sky was quiet. Moving through the back alleys of the Yusefabad neighborhood, I found myself hurrying again, although I had no idea why.

A seemingly continuous flood of cars was returning to the city. Here and there, an anti-aircraft gun would go off for a second, but no one looked up at the sky anymore. Taxicabs were still rare and very expensive, but the metro and buses had been made free for everyone, at all hours.

I decided to visit my publisher, Cheshmeh bookstore, on Karim Khan Avenue. My latest book came out just a month ago, but the war froze everything, book launches especially.

Cheshmeh had hung a white banner outside. It read: Our shelter is the bookstore. The words gave me a warm feeling after days of fear. Inside, the store smelled of paper. Several of my old writer friends were there, amid a crowd talking about politics.

A young man with tired eyes was showing his cellphone screen to two others and saying, “Look at what they're writing about me. ‘He's in the regime's pay.' Look at all these horrible emojis and comments. And why? Just because I posted something saying, ‘I pity our country and I'm against any foreigners attacking it.'”

“They write this sort of garbage about all of us,” a middle-aged man offered. “Don't take it seriously. For all we know, they're just pressure groups and bots.”

The young man didn't want to hear it. “If I was in the pay of the government, don't you think I should own a home by now at least? I've lost count of how many pages of my books they've censored over the years. Folk like us, we take beatings from both sides.”

A gray-haired woman with a blue shawl over her shoulders said to him, “Do and say what you think is right, my son. Some people want to mix everything together.” She had a kindly voice that seemed to calm the young man down a little bit.

From behind me, someone said, “I fear this cease-fire is a hoax.”

Another voice replied, “No, it's really over. America entered to make sure they wrap it up.”

I bought a newly translated book by a Korean author, chatted a little more with friends, and left, taking one last look at that miraculous white banner: Our shelter is our bookstore.

I had hardly slept since the U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites two days earlier. At my friend Nasser's house, during the long night of explosions, I'd fixed my gaze on a small chandelier that never stopped quivering. The last night of the war was the absolute worst. A few hours after the world had announced an imminent cease-fire, Nasser's windows were open. The familiar flash, the ensuing rattle and jolt. Nasser ran out of the kitchen with wet hands, shouting, “Didn't the fools announce a cease-fire?”

The explosions came in seemingly endless waves. I was in the bathroom when one shook the building to what felt like the point of collapse. The lights went out, and there was a sound of shattering glass. I spotted Nasser in the living room. He was trying to stand up but couldn't. That chandelier had finally broken into a hundred little pieces. Nasser said nothing, which was strange. I turned on my phone's flashlight and shone it at him. He didn't look right and kept his hand over the side of his abdomen. I turned the light to that area and saw blood.

“What happened?”

“I have little pieces of glass inside me.”

“We have to go to the hospital.”

“We can't go now. Let's go sit under the stairway. It's safer there.”

Arash Azizi: A cease-fire without a conclusion

The building was empty. Everyone else seemed to have left the city. Nasser couldn't: He was an electrical engineer for the national railway and had to remain at his post.

Under the stairs did not feel safer. The building was old and flimsy. I had the feeling that one more blast would send the whole thing crashing down on us. I examined Nasser's wound under the flashlight. It was about eight inches long, but not very deep and not bleeding too much. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine that we were somewhere else when, from outside, I started to hear laughter and voices. I looked at Nasser to see whether I was imagining things. His face was chalk white, but he, too, had heard them.

I opened the door to the outside. Four teenagers were standing right there, in the middle of the street, watching the fireworks in the skies over Tehran with excitement. One of the boys was holding a huge sandwich, and the girls were decked out in the regalia of young goth and metal fans the world over. If it hadn't been for the sound of explosions, I would have imagined I'd been thrown into another time and dimension altogether.

The kids looked thrilled to have run into us. One of the boys asked, “What's happening, hajji?”

“My friend's been injured.”

“Dangerous?”

“I'm not sure. I'm thinking I should take him to a hospital.”

“You need help?”

I backed Nasser's car out of the garage. It was caked with dust and bits of chipped wall. The kids helped us, and two of them even volunteered to ride along to the hospital. The sounds of explosions retreated as we drove, but the silence that followed was deep and somehow foreboding.

Nasser got stitched up fairly quickly. Dawn light was filtering into the emergency-room waiting area as we prepared to leave, people murmuring to one another that the cease-fire had begun. I looked around for the kids who'd come with us to the hospital. They were gone. I thought about how, years from now, they'd think back on that night, and I wondered how their memories would compare with Nasser's and mine.

That was the last night. Now, leaving the bookstore, I went to the bus terminal at Azadi Square. Tehran was back in full swing; coming and going were easy too. I bought a ticket to Bandar Anzali and, as I boarded, took one last look at the Azadi Square monument—an elegant testimonial to the long suffering of modern Iran. The very next day, June 25, the Tehran Symphonic Orchestra was set to hold a free concert in the square. It was already hard to believe that this city had just experienced a war.

How the novelist turned the violence and randomness of war into a cosmic joke

On August 5, 1945—the day before the world ended—Frank Sinatra was at a yacht club in San Pedro, California. There, he is reported to have rescued a 3-year-old boy from drowning.

On the other side of the country, Albert Einstein—the father of relativity—was staying in Cabin No. 6 at the Knollwood Club on Lower Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks. Einstein couldn't swim a stroke, and (in a reverse Sinatra) was once saved from drowning by a 10-year-old boy.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

What neither of them realized when they woke up on the morning of August 6 was that at 8:15 a.m. Japan Standard Time, the first atomic bomb, nicknamed “Little Boy,” had been dropped on the city of Hiroshima, obliterating standing structures and killing close to 80,000 people.

“The day the world ended” is how Kurt Vonnegut described it in his novel Cat's Cradle, published in 1963. Vonnegut had served in the U.S. Army during World War II, and was one of a handful of survivors of a different American attack: the firebombing of the German city of Dresden, which killed as many as 35,000 people and leveled the town once described as “Florence on the Elbe.”

“The sky was black with smoke,” Vonnegut later wrote in Slaughterhouse-Five, the novel that fictionalized his experience. “The sun was an angry little pinhead. Dresden was like the moon now, nothing but minerals. The stones were hot. Everybody else in the neighborhood was dead.”

The atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima is believed, by some estimates, to have killed as many as 146,000 people, once injuries, burns, and long-term radiation poisoning were factored in—approximately the population of Gainesville, Florida, today.

Here is a photograph of the children who dropped it:

I say “children” because the mission commander, Colonel Paul Tibbets, was 30. Robert A. Lewis, the co-pilot, was 27. Thomas Ferebee, the bombardier, was 26. The navigator, Theodore “Dutch” Van Kirk, was 24. Here is a picture of what happened to the children down below:

President Harry Truman was on the USS Augusta at the time, returning from a conference in Potsdam, Germany, following that country's surrender. The ship's captain interrupted Truman's lunch to give him a message announcing the attack.

That afternoon, Truman attended a program of entertainment and boxing held on the well deck. The ship's orchestra played. The boxing ended abruptly when the ring posts collapsed, slightly injuring a spectator. Such was the nature of human suffering that day.

Cat's Cradle was Vonnegut's fourth novel. He had started it nearly a decade earlier, in 1954, when he was just 31 years old. It is the story of Jonah, a journalist who has set out to write a book about what famous people were doing the day of the Hiroshima bombing. In the book, Jonah tracks down the three living descendants of Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the so-called fathers of the atomic bomb. Hoenikker is an eccentric scientist who once left a tip for his wife by his coffee cup and would go on to create a substance called Ice 9, which could freeze all water on Earth at room temperature—thus ending the world.

From the July 1955 issue: Kurt Vonnegut's short story ‘Der Arme Dolmetscher'

Cat's Cradle made about as much impact on popular culture when it came out as Vonnegut's previous books had, which is to say not much. His first novel, Player Piano, had been published more than 10 years prior, to little acclaim, and Vonnegut was scrambling to make ends meet for his growing family. After the war he had made a pretty good living writing short stories, until that market softened. Since then he had worked as an English teacher at a school for wayward boys and as a publicist for General Electric; in a fit of optimism, he had even started a doomed Saab dealership on Cape Cod. An apt word to describe Vonnegut's state of mind in those years would be desperate. Little did he know that Slaughterhouse-Five, published in 1969, would make him one of the most famous writers in the world.

Vonnegut was similarly unaware that World War II would be the last war of what historians call the Industrial Age. In the 19th century, steam-powered machines had revolutionized human enterprise. Then, following the development of electricity, came a wave of innovation never before seen—the telegraph, telephone, automobile, airplane—as physicists such as Einstein and his successors illuminated the very fabric of the universe. Many of those same physicists would later join the Manhattan Project, harnessing the power of the atom and creating the first atomic weapon.

In some ways, Little Boy was the ultimate invention of the Industrial Age, which ended a few years later. What replaced it? The Atomic Age, of course, followed in the 1970s by the Information Age. Were Vonnegut alive today, he might say that whatever they call the age you live in is actually the name of the weapon they're using to try to kill you.

In 1943, two years before the bombing of Hiroshima, Kurt Vonnegut dropped out of Cornell University and enlisted in the Army. He was 20 years old. Here is a photo of him:

The Army taught him to fire howitzers, then sent him to Europe as a scout. Before he left, Vonnegut surprised his mother, Edith, by going home for Mother's Day 1944. In return, Edith surprised Vonnegut by killing herself. That Saturday night, she took sleeping pills while he lay unaware in another room. Seven months later, Private First Class Vonnegut was crossing the beach at Le Havre with the 423rd Infantry Regiment of the 106th Infantry Division.

They marched to Belgium, taking up position in the Ardennes Forest near the town of St. Vith. It was one of the coldest winters on record, and death was all around them. On December 16, the Germans attacked. Inexperienced American troops holding the front buckled, creating a bulge in the line, thus giving the ensuing battle its name. When it was over, about 80,000 American soldiers had been killed or wounded. But Vonnegut didn't make it to the end. He barely made it three days. Cut off and outnumbered, his regiment was forced to surrender; Vonnegut and more than 6,000 other soldiers were captured. As the Germans advanced, his buddy Bernard O'Hare shouted, “Nein scheissen! ” to the advancing German troops. This did not mean “Don't shoot!,” as he thought. What he yelled instead was “Don't shit!”

After a long forced march, Vonnegut and thousands of other American POWs were packed into boxcars. The dark cars smelled of cow shit, and the soldiers were crammed so tightly, they were forced to stand. It took two days to load them. Vonnegut later recounted how, 18 hours after their departure, the unmarked German train was attacked by the Royal Air Force. It was Christmas Eve. Strafed by RAF fighters, bombs dropping all around them, dozens of American prisoners were killed by Allied planes. Against all odds, Vonnegut was still alive.

The name Little Boy was chosen by Robert Serber, a Los Alamos physicist who worked on the bomb's design. It seems only fitting for a weapon dropped by children from a plane named after the pilot's mother, Enola Gay. Ten feet long and weighing close to 10,000 pounds, “the gadget”—as the scientists called it—was a plug-ugly sumbitch, made of riveted steel and wires. Nothing like the sleek, gleaming technology of today. See for yourself:

Little Boy was a gun-type bomb, its explosive power triggered by firing a “bullet” of uranium into a target of uranium. When the projectile and target combined, they formed a supercritical mass capable of sustaining a rapid nuclear chain reaction. That's a fancy scientist way of saying “massive explosion,” and boy howdy, was it.

Fission reactions occur so fast that it's hard to describe them using our human sense of time. Within one-millionth of a second of the uranium bullet hitting its target, a fireball of several million degrees was formed, spawning a shock wave with a blast equivalent to 15 kilotons of TNT that pushed the atmosphere at supersonic speeds, and that traveled outward at two miles per second from the hypocenter. The fiery shock wave flattened everything in its path, igniting birds in midair. About a third of the bomb's energy was released as thermal radiation: gamma and infrared rays that flashed through clothing, burning textile patterns into victims' skin and causing severe burns up to a mile away. In the time it takes to say “boom,” roughly 80,000 people were reduced to ash, and 4.4 square miles of city were obliterated.

Wilfred Burchett was the first Western reporter to reach Hiroshima after the bombing. On September 2, sitting on a piece of rubble, he wrote, “Hiroshima does not look like a bombed city. It looks as if a monster steamroller had passed over it and squashed it out of existence.”

For clarity, a steamroller was an Industrial Age machine used for compacting dirt and gravel in order to create smooth surfaces upon which vehicles could drive.

And so the world ended, if not in fact then in theory.

When he arrived in Dresden, Vonnegut and his fellow POWs were put to work in a malted-syrup factory, making food for Germans that the POWs were not themselves allowed to eat. The guards were cruel, the work exhausting. Vonnegut was singled out and badly beaten. One night, as air-raid sirens roared, Vonnegut and the other POWs were herded into the basement of a slaughterhouse, huddling among the sides of beef as the city above them was bombed.

All told, British and American bombers dropped more than 3,900 tons of highly explosive and incendiary bombs on Dresden that night.

Vonnegut described it this way in a letter to his family: “On about February 14th the Americans came over, followed by the R.A.F.” The combined forces “destroyed all of Dresden—possibly the world's most beautiful city. But not me.”

Here is a photo of the city before the bombing:

And here is what it looked like when the Allies were done with it:

To destroy the city of Dresden took hundreds of bombs dropped over multiple hours. To destroy the city of Hiroshima, all it took was one. This, a cynical man might say, is what progress looks like.

In his 1967 collection of essays about the Atomic Age, The Ghost in the Machine, Arthur Koestler, a Hungarian British author and journalist, wrote, “The crisis of our time can be summed up in a single sentence. From the dawn of consciousness until the middle of our century man had to live with the prospect of his death as an individual; since Hiroshima, mankind as a whole has to live with the prospect of its extinction as a biological species.”

Throughout human history, children have adopted a rule of engagement called “not in the face.” Think of it as the first Geneva Convention. Violating the not-in-the-face rule opens the offender up to serious retribution. It is an act of war. Now I get to hit you in the face, or worse. In fact, maybe I should kick you in the balls to teach you a lesson and restore the balance of power. Maybe I need to make the cost of hitting me in the face so high, you never take another swing. If Pearl Harbor was an unprovoked face punch, then Hiroshima was the kick in the balls to end all future wars. Scientists of the Industrial Age made that kick possible.

Vonnegut's relationship with his own children after the war was mixed at best. There would be seven in total, three biological and four of his sister's boys, who had come to live with him and his wife, Jane, in 1958, when Vonnegut's brother-in-law, Jim, died in a train derailment, his commuter train launching itself from the Newark Bay Bridge into Newark Bay. Two days later, Vonnegut's sister, Alice, died of breast cancer. So it goes. It was Alice who had shaken Vonnegut awake on Mother's Day 1944 to tell him their mother was dead. Vonnegut considered Alice his muse, and later wrote in Slapstick : “I had never told her so, but she was the person I had always written for. She was the secret of whatever artistic unity I had ever achieved.”

Suddenly the house was overstuffed with children between the ages of 2 and 14. For the next five years, Vonnegut tried (and mostly failed) to write Cat's Cradle. The stress of supporting that large a family as a writer, while still processing trauma from the war, made him irritable. Never a hands-on dad, he left most of the actual parenting to Jane, and as the chaos of family life filled the house, he would hole up in his study all day, chain-smoking. The slightest noise from the children could propel him from the room, ranting.

Vonnegut himself had been raised in a house of math and science. His father was an architect. As a scientist, his brother would pioneer the field of cloud seeding. But Vonnegut had a complicated relationship with the word progress. His experience in the war had soured him on the idea that science was exclusively a force for good. Too often, he believed, scientists and engineers focused on the question Can we do something? rather than Should we? He saw this when he looked at the Manhattan Project. Though scientists at Los Alamos knew that the bomb they were designing was meant to be dropped on people, they rarely thought about the consequences of dropping it.

After the war, the physicist Victor Weisskopf, who'd worked on the bomb at Los Alamos, admitted that he was “ashamed to say that few of us even thought of quitting. It was the attraction of the task. It was impossible to quit at that time.” The task, he said, was “technically sweet.”

J. Robert Oppenheimer himself used this phrase during testimony at his security-clearance hearing after the war. “It is my judgment in these things that when you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb. I do not think anybody opposed making it.”

“Nice, nice, very nice,” as Bokonon wrote in his “53rd Calypso.” “So many different people in the same device.” Bokonon was the fictional founder of a religion that Vonnegut invented for Cat's Cradle, a novel as much about the hypocrisy of organized religion as it was about war. Bokonon's first dictum is this: “All of the true things I am about to tell you are shameless lies.”

Here's another shameless lie: The atomic bomb was dropped to save lives. This is an ancillary thing that war does; it inverts language. See, the lives that mattered to scientists at Los Alamos were American. So they chose to focus on the lives they would spare—the GIs who would theoretically die in a conventional invasion—instead of the Japanese citizens who would actually die when the bomb was dropped. This made the morality of their actions easier to justify. In this way, they kept things sweet.

And yet, to quote a survivor, those scientists who invented the atomic bomb—“what did they think would happen if they dropped it?”

Here are some things that happened. Day turned to night. In a flash, the bomb destroyed 60,000 of the 90,000 structures in a 10-mile radius. Of the 2,370 doctors and nurses in Hiroshima, 2,168 were killed or injured too badly to work.

This is what the atomic bomb did to survivors: “They had no hair because their hair was burned, and at a glance you couldn't tell whether you were looking at them from in front or in back,” a survivor told The New York Times in 1981. “Their skin—not only on their hands, but on their faces and bodies too—hung down.” In this way they stumbled down the road, going nowhere, “like walking ghosts.”

Only a few of the survivors were children, as most school-age kids near ground zero were killed on impact. This is because at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, they had gathered outside their schools to help create firebreaks to slow the spread of flames in the event of firebomb raids like the ones that had destroyed Tokyo and so many other Japanese cities. Did they hear the distant roar of the B-29, I wonder, flying overhead? An air-raid siren had gone off an hour earlier, but no planes had come, so now, when the Enola Gay approached, many didn't even look up.

Picture the children of Hiroshima on that sunny morning, thousands of little haircuts, thousands of gap-toothed smiles. Thousands of children trying to be good citizens, wondering what the morning snack would be. This is whom the child pilots flying overhead dropped the bomb on: schoolchildren and their parents. What else are we to think? The city of Hiroshima had no real military or technological value. It was a population center, chosen to send a message to the emperor.

So it goes—or, as the survivors of Hiroshima used to say, “Shikata ga nai,” which loosely translates to “It can't be helped.” This sentiment was born from the Japanese practice of Zen Buddhism—an even older made-up religion than Bokononism, Vonnegut might say. And yet, what else can one say about a world in which children drop bombs on other children?

In Slaughterhouse-Five, Vonnegut writes of an argument he had with his old Army buddy Bernard's wife, Mary. Vonnegut has gone to their house to drink and trade war stories, and when he tells them he is writing a novel about the war, Mary erupts:

Later, thinking back on Cat's Cradle's amoral physicist, Dr. Felix Hoenikker, Vonnegut said, “What I feel about him now is that he was allowed to concentrate on one part of life more than any human being should be. He was overspecialized and became amoral on that account … If a scientist does this, he can inadvertently become a very destructive person.”

This overspecialization is a feature, not a bug, of our Information Age.

What are our phones and tablets, our social-media platforms, if not technically sweet? They are so sleek and sophisticated technologically, with their invisible code and awesome computing power, that they have become, as Arthur C. Clarke once wrote, indistinguishable from magic. And this may, in the end, prove to be the biggest danger.

Because so little thought has been given to the Should we? of the Information Age (what will happen if we give human beings an entertainment device they can fit in their pocket, one that connects them instantly to every truth and every lie ever conceived?), we have, as a society, been caught unprepared. If the atomic bomb, riveted from steel plates and visible wires, was irrefutable proof of the power of science, how is it possible that even more sophisticated modern devices have decreased our faith in science and given rise to the wholesale rejection of expertise?

Talk about a shameless lie! And yet how else to explain the fact that misinformation spread through our magic gadgets seems to be undermining people's belief in the very science that powers them?

To put it simply, if the bomb was a machine through which we looked into the future, our phones have become a looking glass through which we are pulled back into the past.

Shikata ga nai.

After the war, Vonnegut wrestled with what he saw as hereditary depression, made worse by his mother's suicide, his sister's death, and the trauma of war. Unable to justify why he had survived when so many around him had died, and unwilling to ascribe his good fortune to God, Vonnegut settled instead on the absurd. I live, you die. So it goes.

If it had been cloudy in Hiroshima that morning, the bomb would have fallen somewhere else. If POW Vonnegut had been shoved into a different train car, if he had picked a different foxhole, if the Germans hadn't herded him into the slaughterhouse basement when the sirens sounded—so many ifs that would have ended in death. Instead, somehow, he danced between the raindrops. Because of this, for Vonnegut, survival became a kind of cosmic joke, with death being the setup and life being the punch line.

On May 11, 1955, the Hiroshima survivor Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a Methodist minister, was featured on the American television program This Is Your Life. He had come to the U.S. to raise money for victims of the atomic bomb known as the Keloid Girls or the Atomic Maidens.

Seated on a sofa beside the host, Ralph Edwards, Tanimoto wears a baggy suit and looks stunned. After an introductory segment, the camera cuts to the silhouette of a man behind a screen. He speaks into a microphone.

“Looking down from thousands of feet over Hiroshima,” he says, “all I could think of was ‘My God, what have we done?' ”

The camera cuts back to Edwards and Tanimoto. “Now, you've never met him,” the host tells the Hiroshima survivor sitting next to him, “never seen him, but he's here tonight to clasp your hand in friendship. Captain Robert Lewis, United States Air Force, who along with Paul Tibbets piloted the plane from which the first atomic power was dropped over Hiroshima.”

The camera pans across the stage as the screen retracts and Captain Lewis emerges from shadow. Tanimoto steps into frame and shakes his hand. Both men appear as if they want to throw up:

“Captain Lewis,” Edwards says, “come in here close, and would you tell us, sir, of your experience on August 6, 1945?”

There is an uncomfortable beat, in which we wonder if Lewis will be able to continue. The camera cuts to a close-up of Lewis. He is unable to make eye contact with Tanimoto.

“Well, Mr. Edwards, when we left Tinian, in the Mariana Islands, at about eight—at 2:45 in the morning on August the 6th, 1945, our destination was Japan. We had three targets. One was Hiroshima. One was Nagasaki. One was Kurkura.

“About an hour before we hit the coastline of Japan, we were notified that Hiroshima was clear. Therefore, Hiroshima became our target.”

The camera cuts to Tanimoto, listening, horrified. The social contract of human behavior freezes him in place.

“Just before 8:15 a.m. Tokyo time,” Lewis continues, “Tom Ferebee, our very able bombardier, carefully aimed at his target, which was the second Imperial Japanese Army Headquarters. At 8:15 promptly, the bomb was dropped.

“We turned fast to get out of the way of the deadly radiation and bomb effects. First was a thick flash that we got, and then the two concussion waves hit the ship. Shortly after, we turned back to see what had happened, and there in front of our eyes, the city of Hiroshima disappeared.”

“And,” Edwards says, “you entered something in your log at that time?”

Lewis's voice breaks and he rubs his temples, trying to compose himself.

“As I said before, Mr. Edwards, I wrote down later: ‘My God, what have we done?' ”

After retiring from the Air Force, Captain Lewis went to work in the candy business, where he patented various improvements to candy-manufacturing machinery. Sweet treats for kids. Picture them. All those happy kids.

Picture them putting quarters in the vending machine. Picture them in store-bought costumes holding out their Halloween sacks. They are no more theoretical than the children of Hiroshima, but unlike them, these children would grow up.

They would come of age practicing duck-and-cover drills, diving under their desks at the shriek of a whistle; come of age hiding in the bomb shelters their parents had built, terrified of the theoretical deaths that the A-bomb had made all but inevitable.

Nice, nice, very nice. So many different people in the same device.

How a 1965 prediction of impending Canadian doom sheds light on Trump's talk of the 51st state.

I've always found something charming about Canada Day, the July 1 national celebration, landing just three days before America's Independence Day.

The two holidays are ideologically opposed: Canada Day celebrates the country's 1867 confederation under British law, while July Fourth celebrates a violent revolution against the crown. Yet after centuries of peace, with the two countries now sharing the longest undefended border in the world, the timing normally feels less like dueling celebrations than a week-long joint birthday party.

So leave it to Donald Trump to reintroduce tension to the holidays.

Last Friday, just as Canadians were getting ready for the pre-holiday weekend, Trump declared that the United States is renewing hostilities in the briefly suspended trade war. “We are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,” he wrote on Truth Social, adding that “we will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period.”

The ideas and trends driving the conservative movement, from senior correspondent Zack Beauchamp.

And then, in a Sunday interview on Fox News, he renewed the rhetoric that most infuriated Canadians: his claim that Canada should be annexed by the United States. “Frankly, Canada should be the 51st state. It really should,” he told anchor Maria Bartiromo. “Because Canada relies entirely on the United States. We don't rely on Canada.”

In thinking through all of this, I've found one voice especially clarifying: the Canadian conservative philosopher George Grant.

In 1965, Grant published a short book — titled Lament for a Nation — arguing that Canada's increasing integration with the United States was a kind of national suicide. This was, in part, a political matter: By hitching its economy and defense to those of a much larger neighbor, Canada effectively surrendered its ability to set its own political course.

But it was also a kind of spiritual death: By embracing free trade and open borders with the United States, Grant argued, Canada was selling its conservative soul to the American ethos of never-ending revolutionary progress. It was, in effect, turning Canada Day into an early July Fourth.

Given the Trump threat, Grant's argument feels more vital than it has in decades — prompting a round of intellectual reconsiderations. Recent pieces by Patrick Deneen, a leading American “postliberal,” and Michael Ignatieff, a leading Canadian liberal intellectual (and Grant's nephew), have highlighted elements of the argument that feel especially relevant in the current moment.

Yet Lament for a Nation is also notable for what it failed to foresee. While Grant predicted America's liberalism would swallow Canada, it is, in fact, the most philosophically illiberal administration in modern American history that threatens Canadian sovereignty.

And Canadian resistance to Yankee imperialism has rallied under the banner of Liberal Party Prime Minister Mark Carney — a central banker who fully embraces Canada's modern identity as the most tolerant and multicultural country on the planet.

Lament for a Nation takes, as its central event, the 1963 defeat of then-Prime Minister John Diefenbaker. His defeat, per Grant, was the moment that Canada's fate was sealed.

Diefenbaker was the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party (now more simply called the Conservative Party). Grant writes about him a bit the way that some on the intellectual right talk about Trump today: as an imperfect but basically necessary bulwark against the depredations of the liberal elite.

A “prairie populist” raised in Saskatchewan, Diefenbaker was culturally and politically distinct from the traditional power elite in cities like Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. These elites, per Grant, believed that Canada benefited from increasing economic and military interconnections with the US, such as eliminating trade barriers and joint participation in the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).

Diefenbaker, in Grant's telling, took a different approach — one that valued Canadian self-determination over the material benefits of trade and security cooperation. On key issues, most notably the 1962–'63 debate over stationing American nuclear weapons on Canadian soil, Diefenbaker resisted the intellectual and political elite's “continentalist” approach — instead raising concerns that too much integration with the United States would threaten Canadian nationhood.

It is this hesitancy, Grant argues, that brought the wrath of the elite class down on his head, ultimately leading to the Progressive Conservatives' defeat in the 1963 election. With Diefenbaker cleared away, there was no longer any barrier to a policy of economic and political integration with the United States.

“Lamenting for Canada is inevitably associated with the tragedy of Diefenbaker. His inability to govern is linked with the inability of this country to be sovereign,” Grant writes.

It's easy to ridicule this sentiment in hindsight. After all, Canada remains standing 60 years after Grant's predictions of doom. Wasn't he just wrong that integration with the US meant national suicide?

But to take this line is to misunderstand Grant's argument. His position was not that the integration with the United States would literally lead to Canadian annexation. Rather, it's that Canada would lose the ability to chart its own course, surrendering its effective sovereignty and, more fundamentally, sacrificing what made it culturally distinct from the United States.

The United States, per Grant, is the physical avatar of Enlightenment liberalism: a worldview that he described as celebrating the emancipation of the individual from whatever fetters society might put on them. The American ideology of capitalist freedom was a solvent dissolving local cultures and national borders, homogenizing everything into a single mass of modern technological sameness.

Canada, by contrast, took its core identity from British conservatism — a sense that politics is not about individual freedom but rather conserving and incrementally improving the traditions and cultural inheritance that define its essence and maintain its good functioning.

In Canada, Grant says, this conservatism was “a kind of suspicion that we in Canada could be less lawless and have a greater sense of propriety than those in the United States.” Partnering with the French speakers in Quebec (Lament for a Nation made scant reference to indigenous Canadians), the new country was in opposition to the American vision of frenetic capitalist change.

Yet this conservative identity, Grant feared, was weakly rooted — and vulnerable to American imperial influence in the absence of a political class willing to wield nationalist policies in its defense. He narrated its ideological decline in three steps:

First, men everywhere move ineluctably toward membership in the universal and homogenous liberal state. Second, Canadians live next to a society that is the heart of modernity. Third, nearly all Canadians think that modernity is good, so nothing distinguishes Canadians from Americans. When they oblate themselves before “the American way of life,” they offer themselves on the altar of the reigning Western goddess.

Diefenbaker was, per Grant, the last gasp of authentic Canadian conservative resistance to this process. His defeat marked the moment that Canada's spiritual death at American hands became inevitable.

Today, Canada is facing a nakedly imperialist American president who is attempting to weaponize Canadian dependence on American markets into political submission. Grant, the liberal Ignatieff writes, was “the first to warn us that this was how continental integration would end.”

Yet the circumstances are very different from what Grant might have expected. While Grant warned that American ideology was seductive, that Canadians risked voluntarily submitting to a liberalism that would subtly alienate them from themselves, they are today facing a brash American illiberalism led by a right-wing populist most Canadians revile.

“Even in the fury of Lament for a Nation, America was seen as a benign hegemon — at least to us — who respected the fiction of our sovereignty. Today's President disdains his allies and can't stop telling Canada he wishes we didn't exist,” Ignatieff writes. 

For this reason, the anti-Trump resistance has been led not by Canada's Conservatives but by the Liberal Party.

Prime Minister Mark Carney's Liberals won Canada's April election on the back of anti-Trump resistance. This was not only because Carney took vocally anti-Trump positions, but because his chief rival — Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre — was a right-wing populist whose political style seemed far too close to Trump's for Canadian comfort.

Carney won, in short, because Canadians saw conservatism as too American — and Carney's liberalism a better representation of Canadianness in the current moment.

This irony owes itself, in part, to Canada's national reinvention since Grant's original publication. In the past several decades, Canada has engaged in a collective nation-building project to redefine its national identity around ideas of tolerance and multiculturalism. This effort has been extraordinarily successful: Canada has a notably higher percentage of foreign-born residents than the United States, yet faces a far weaker anti-immigrant backlash.

Grant would surely see this as vindication of his thesis: Canada has abandoned its traditional identity in favor of a Canadian copy of America's Ellis Island narrative. Yet what Grant didn't foresee is that this kind of liberalism could form an effective resistance against Yankee imperialism. 

Canadian nationalism today is not just about symbols, like the flag or the crown, but about a sense that Canadians do not want their politics to take on the bitter ugliness of Trumpified American politics. Their attraction to what Grant identified as too-American liberal ideals of freedom and progress forms a key part of the hard ideological core uniting Canadians against American pressure.

In this sense, and perhaps this sense only, Canadians have become more American than the Americans. This year, July Fourth may have come three days early.

Trying to keep track of all the chaos is overwhelming. So here's a one-stop guide to the turmoil this Court caused.

There are two big winners in the Supreme Court's most recent term.

One is social and religious conservatives. In the last two days of its term, the Court imposed heavy new burdens on public schools at the request of religious conservatives, and it rendered much of federal Medicaid law unenforceable in a case lashing out at Planned Parenthood. It heard its first major pornography case in over two decades, upholding a Texas law that seeks to limit youth access to porn. And the Republican justices handed a historic defeat to transgender Americans, permitting states to block at least some trans people from receiving gender-affirming medical care.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

Four justices also voted that the Constitution requires most states to fund religious public charter schools. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was recused from this case, is likely to provide the fifth vote for religious public schools in the future.

Indeed, as I'll explain in more detail below, the Court's Republican majority is willing to tear down major American institutions in order to advance the cultural right's political goals.

Another winner is President Donald Trump. One year after the Republican justices ruled that Trump is allowed to use the powers of the presidency to commit crimes, these same justices continue to treat him as the special favorite of the laws.

The Court's most high-profile Trump-related decision, Trump v. CASA, placed vague new restrictions on lower courts' power to block Trump administration policies. This decision is defensible — the Biden administration sought a similar ruling while it was in power — but it is notable that the justices waited until a Republican was president before weakening lower courts' power to rein in the executive.

Even before the CASA decision, however, the Court frequently blocked lower courts that ruled against the Trump administration. When lower courts block Trump's policies, the Republican justices routinely reinstate those policies on the Supreme Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices consider on an expedited basis.

There was also one unexpected loser this term: the business and fiscal conservatives that have historically dominated the Republican Party. In the same week that the Court handed down most of its biggest decisions, it also rejected an attack on Obamacare. And it waved away a request to put drastic new limits on federal agencies' power to regulate business. 

So, while the Court now hands out victories to the cultural right as if it were passing out candy on Halloween, several of the GOP justices did show more moderation on the kinds of issues that preoccupied Republicans as recently as a decade ago. It was a lot to keep track of, especially given Trump's ability to dominate the news, so here's a quick rundown of how the Court reshaped the law during its recent term.

At least two cases this term did serious harm to institutions that millions of Americans depend upon, both in decisions that benefited cultural conservatives. 

In Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Court's Republican majority ruled that public schools must inform parents before their children are taught a lesson those parents might object to on religious grounds, and that those parents must be given an opportunity to opt their child out of that lesson.

The Supreme Court used to treat public schools with more respect.

Mahmoud arose out of a dispute over queer-themed books — Montgomery County, Maryland, approved several books with LGBTQ characters that could be used in classroom instruction. But the First Amendment prohibits discrimination among people with different religious beliefs. So, if parents with anti-LGBTQ religious views have a right to notification and an opt-out, so too does every parent who might object to any lesson on any religious ground.

This rule, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor warns in a dissenting opinion, is likely to cause “chaos for this Nation's public schools.” Requiring every public school teacher to anticipate which lessons might implicate a parent's religious beliefs “will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,” especially in a nation as diverse as the United States.

In the past, courts have rejected similar lawsuits brought by parents who object to books or lessons that feature magic, women who have achievements outside the home, and include topics as diverse as divorce, interfaith couples, “immodest dress,” and “false views of death.” After Mahmoud, however, all of these parents now have a right to advance notice.

Schools that fail to predict that a lesson about a Jewish woman with a career, a Hindu husband, or an immodest wardrobe will offend a parent's religious belief will now face very serious financial consequences. Federal law often lets the “prevailing party” in a suit about constitutional rights collect attorney's fees from the losing party. So lawyers can hunt for parents with idiosyncratic religious views, file a lawsuit against a school, and demand payment to avoid litigation that will be even more expensive for the school district.

The Supreme Court used to treat public schools with more respect, out of concern that the Constitution should not be read to prevent such an important institution from functioning. 

Like the right to free exercise of religion, the right to free speech is also protected by the First Amendment. That is why the Court held in Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) that public school students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”

But Tinker recognized that free speech should not be used as a weapon that can shut down classroom instruction altogether — if any student could get up in the middle of class and start yelling, for example, their right to free speech would destroy every one of their classmates' right to an education. 

And so Tinker also held that public school students may not engage in speech that “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.” The Court struck an appropriate balance between protecting free expression by young people, and making sure that public schools continue to produce an educated workforce that ultimately benefits every single American.

That decision stands in stark contrast to Mahmoud, which establishes that the rights of religious objectors must be advanced at all costs, even if it would mean imposing such enormous burdens on public schools that every child receives an inferior education.

A similar dynamic was in play in Medina, which pitted the GOP's disdain for abortion providers against a federal law permitting Medicaid patients to choose their own doctors. Just as in Mahmoud, the Republican justices handed a sweeping victory to social conservatives — seemingly without any regard for how their decision would damage Medicaid.

Federal Medicaid statutes are riddled with provisions establishing who must be covered by Medicaid, how that coverage should be provided, and what minimum standards of care Medicaid patients are entitled to receive. South Carolina illegally forbade Medicaid patients from choosing Planned Parenthood as their health care provider. Rather than ordering South Carolina to comply with the law, in Medina the Republican justices effectively repealed the choice-of-provider provision.

The question of which Medicaid laws can be enforced through federal lawsuits, and which provisions are essentially worthless, is one of the most important questions in American poverty and elder law and has been litigated for decades. But two years ago, in Talevski, the Supreme Court finally settled on a clear rule that judges could apply to identify which provisions are enforceable. 

If you want to know more about these many decades of litigation, I explain many of those details here. But the most important thing to know about Talevski is that it established that Medicaid laws which are “phrased in terms of the persons benefitted” and that “focus on the benefitted class” are enforceable. So, if a specific provision of Medicaid law mentions Medicaid patients, or otherwise names the individuals who are supposed to benefit from that law, it is enforceable.

The choice-of-provider provision at issue in Medina refers to “any individual eligible for medical assistance.” So it was enforceable under Talevski. Medina should have been an open and shut case.

Yet, instead of following Talevski, the Republican justices produced an incoherent opinion that does not even announce a new legal rule, beyond a vague statement that Medicaid laws are “especially unlikely” to be enforceable. Much of Justice Neil Gorsuch's opinion in Medina fixates on seemingly random facts about the choice-of-provider provision, such as the fact that it “appears in a subsection titled ‘Contents,'” as if that's somehow relevant to the question of whether this provision is a meaningless husk.

It is impossible to come up with a principled explanation for why, two years after Talevski, the Republican justices decided to abandon that decision and replace it with a new legal standard that renders much of federal law completely useless. But it's certainly possible to come up with a political explanation. Unlike Medina, Talevski did not involve an abortion provider. Several of the Court's Republicans appear to have flipped their votes between Talevski and Medina in order to lash out at Planned Parenthood.

The worst thing about the Medina decision is that the Republican justices could have come up with some good-for-this-ride-only legal reasoning that denied Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, but that otherwise left Talevski intact. Instead, they appear to have overruled Talevski and replaced it with a vague new rule that does little more than tell lower court judges that Medicaid plaintiffs should nearly always lose.

It seems that, in order to spite Planned Parenthood, the Supreme Court stripped tens of millions of Americans of countless rights protected by federal law.

Many of the Court's most consequential decisions were handed down on its shadow docket, a process that allows a party that lost in a lower court to seek an immediate Supreme Court order blocking that decision. 

This term, the Republican justices used the shadow docket to temporarily nullify the Convention Against Torture, a treaty that is supposed to prevent the United States from deporting noncitizens to countries where they may be tortured. The Court also used its shadow docket to effectively repeal federal laws protecting the leaders of several federal agencies from being fired by Trump, and to prevent lower courts from interfering with the chaotic work of Elon Musk's former office, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). (In an unusual liberal victory on the shadow docket, the justices also ruled that Trump must give certain immigrants due process before he ships them off to a notorious Salvadorian prison.)

Traditionally, the Supreme Court takes months or even longer before it decides a case. With rare exceptions, a case must be heard by a trial court and at least one appeals court before the justices will even consider taking it up. And getting the justices to hear a case is a bit like winning the lottery. 

Lawyers hoping the Court will review their case file over 8,000 petitions seeking such review in any given year, but the justices only grant about 60–70 of these petitions. Then, once a case is granted, that's only the beginning of a months-long process where lawyers submit briefs, the justices review them and hold oral arguments, and then they spend months working on the final decision. Contentious suits can wait an entire year for a decision, even after the justices announce that they will hear the case.

The reason for this slow, highly selective process is that the Supreme Court has the final word on questions of US law. So if it gets a case wrong, that mistake can linger uncorrected for decades. The Court's plodding deliberation is supposed to minimize the risk of that happening.

Beginning in Trump's first term, however, the Court started relying heavily on a separate, much less cautious process to decide cases involving Trump and his government. 

Historically, the Court's shadow docket was used primarily for death penalty appeals, where the petitioner seeking Supreme Court review would be killed if the justices did not act very swiftly. Litigants in non-death penalty cases could seek expedited review on the shadow docket, but it was so discouraged, and shadow docket petitions were so rarely granted, that smart lawyers typically decided not to annoy the justices with them. During the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, the Justice Department sought shadow docket review about once every other year.

Now, however, whenever the Trump administration claims that it must have a Supreme Court order blocking a lower court's decision, the Court treats that claim as an emergency that must be tended to immediately. 

In Nken v. Holder (2009), the Supreme Court held that a party seeking shadow docket relief must do more than simply show they are likely to prevail if the Court hears their case on the merits. Among other things, they must also show that they “will be irreparably injured” if the justices do not immediately block the lower court's decision.

But, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pointed out in a pair of opinions dissenting from two shadow docket orders, the Republican justices seem to have decided that the Trump administration is exempt from Nken, as they often grant shadow docket relief to Trump even when he cannot show irreparable injury. In Social Security Administration v. AFSCME, a case about whether DOGE may access highly sensitive Social Security data, Trump's lawyers didn't even make an argument that his administration would experience irreparable harm without Supreme Court intervention. Yet the Republican justices intervened anyway. 

As law professor Steven Vladeck has pointed out, the Court granted, at least in part, “each of the last 14 [shadow docket] applications filed by the Department of Justice.”

The federal government's exemption from Nken, moreover, only appears to be in effect when a Republican occupies the White House. In one dissenting opinion, Jackson pointed to several Biden-era cases where the Justice Department sought shadow docket relief from lower court orders. In some of those cases, the Court left the lower court's injunction in place for as much as a year, before finally concluding that the injunction was illegal after the case went through the much slower, traditional appeals process.

The Republican justices, in other words, are manipulating the Court's calendar to benefit Trump. When ordinary litigants — or a Democratic administration — seek shadow docket relief, the justices often apply the traditional rules and norms that prevent them from granting those requests. But when Trump asks the Supreme Court to do him a favor, the Republican justices swiftly oblige.

While the cultural right was one of the biggest winners in the Court's recent term, the Republican Party's traditional business constituency fared less well. On the final decision day of the term, the Court handed down a ruling upholding provisions of Obamacare that require health insurers to cover certain treatments, as well as a decision rejecting an aggressive attempt to limit federal agencies' power to regulate business. Earlier in the term, a unanimous Court also rejected a suit challenging the FDA's decision to pull many nicotine vaping devices off the market.

The Court's Obamacare decision, known as Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, aligns with broader trends within the Republican Party. During Trump's first term, the GOP famously tried and failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act in its entirety. Eight years later, the party has a more modest health care agenda, at least when compared to their ideas from 2017. Congressional Republicans are likely to enact deep cuts to Medicaid, but they are not pushing for full repeal of Obamacare.

Decisions like Braidwood and Medina, in other words, closely track the Republican Party's agenda in Congress. Like their counterparts in Congress, the Republican justices voted to drastically cut back on Medicaid in Medina. But many of them voted to uphold key provisions of Obamacare in Braidwood.

One common element in the Braidwood, the agency power case (FCC v. Consumer's Research), and in the vaping case, (FDA v. Wages & White Lion Investments), is that they all arose out of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, a court dominated by MAGA-aligned judges who routinely hand down decisions that are too extreme even for this Supreme Court. 

In recent years, the Fifth Circuit has done everything from declaring entire federal agencies unconstitutional to attempting to pull a popular abortion drug from the market. It once ruled that Texas Republicans may seize control over content moderation at all of the major social media platforms. Many of the Fifth Circuit's judges have taken positions that, if they were embraced by the Supreme Court, risk triggering a second Great Depression.

The Supreme Court frequently balks at the Fifth Circuit's decisions, but it does not do so all of the time. Just last week, for example, in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the Court upheld a Texas law requiring pornographic websites to verify that their users are over age 18, despite a 21-year-old Supreme Court decision that struck down a nearly identical law. The Court took up the Free Speech Coalition case after the Fifth Circuit decided it wasn't bound by that two-decade-old decision.

The best lesson to draw from cases like Braidwood, White Lion, and Consumer's Research, in other words, is that no matter how partisan or ideological the Supreme Court may be, there will likely be other voices within the judiciary pushing the justices to go harder. These voices will even sometimes succeed, as they did in the Free Speech Coalition case.

If Trump gets to replace any members of the current Court, moreover, he could potentially replace relatively moderate justices with the kinds of judges who dominate the Fifth Circuit. No matter how bad the Supreme Court gets, it can always get worse.

Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

The Court's opinion has disturbing things to say about privacy, but the biggest losers are likely to be judges themselves.

The Republican justices' decision fundamentally altered how public schools must operate.

﻿This decision isn't really about birthright citizenship.

The Republican justices just nuked much of federal Medicaid law, in order to spite Planned Parenthood.﻿

The Court picked a hell of a time to give lawsuit immunity to federal law enforcement.

The decision nullifies a treaty designed to protect immigrants from torture.

A bill that will give China the lead in the race for advanced AI.

To hear many smart AI observers tell it, the day of Wednesday, June 25, 2025, represented the moment when Congress started to take the possibility of advanced AI seriously.

The occasion was a hearing of Congress's “we're worried about China” committee (or, more formally, the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party) focused on the US-China AI competition. Members of both parties used the event to express concern that was surprisingly strident and detailed about the near-term risks posed by artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even artificial superintelligence (ASI).

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

Rep. Jill Tokuda (D-HI) expressed fear of “loss of control by any nation-state” that “could give rise to an independent AGI or ASI actor” threatening all nations. Rep. Nathaniel Moran (R-TX) predicted, “AI systems will soon have the capability to conduct their own research and development,” and asked about the risks that might pose. Rep. Dusty Johnson (R-SD) declared, “Anybody who doesn't feel urgency around this issue is not paying attention.”

Shakeel Hashim of Transformer, one of the best reporters working on AI today, summarized the hearing this way: “Washington seems to finally be waking up to the potential arrival of AGI — and the many risks that could accompany it.” Peter Wildeford of the Institute for AI Policy and Strategy headlined his post on the hearing, ”Congress Has Started Taking AGI More Seriously.”

Yet even as that hearing was unfolding, the Senate was frantically putting the finishing touches on the One Big Beautiful Bill, the gargantuan deficit-exploding legislation to cut taxes, boost military and border spending, and cut to the bone various social programs. As part of their effort, culminating in Senate passage on Tuesday, Republican senators managed to worsen some of the safety net cuts in the House version of the bill and tried (unsuccessfully, thank goodness) to add a new tax on clean energy that could make building the energy-hungry data centers AI requires substantially more expensive.

The negotiations were a reminder that, even as some parts of Congress have finally started to appear to take AI seriously, others are on autopilot and taking a series of actions that will make the US less competitive on, and less prepared for, the future of AI.

As I wrote a month ago, the One Big Beautiful Bill, in general, is not the work of policymakers who take the possibility of powerful AI seriously.

The House-passed provision stripping broadband funding from states that regulate AI suggested its authors do not think AI will be a sufficiently important technology that will need to be regulated the way telephones, electrical transmission, the internet, and other major technological breakthroughs have always been by state and local governments. Luckily, the Senate voted to strip this provision from its version of the bill on Monday night, but that hardly means the rest of the bill is harmless.

The bill's cuts to, and imposition of new work requirements upon, safety net programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP (aka food stamps), suggest the authors do not take the risk of automation-caused job loss at all seriously. If huge numbers of Americans are about to be displaced from their jobs due to technological advancements, the last thing we ought to do is condition more support programs on work. Yet that is exactly what the bill does, and the Senate version is in many ways worse than the House one.

While the Medicaid work requirements in the House bill only apply to adults without children, the Senate bill extends them to parents with children 14 and over. It cuts Medicaid funding to states by changes to policies called “provider taxes.” Its food stamp work requirements are slightly less stringent than the House's, but both bills open the door to states opting out of the food stamps program entirely if they so choose.

How does this connect to a future with far more powerful AI?

Imagine you lose your job as an Uber driver because of the increased popularity of Waymo and other self-driving services. You suddenly have no income. If, like most Americans, you live in a state that expanded Medicaid as part of Obamacare, you will be eligible for free health coverage as well as food stamps to help with grocery costs while you get back on your feet. 

But this bill changes that. Your state might not offer you food stamps at all, and if it does, both them and your health coverage could lapse if you don't swiftly get a new job, which will be that much harder in a world where AI eats up more and more labor. 

This is not what a smart policy for people displaced by advances in AI looks like.

But perhaps the most important AI-related changes to the Senate bill are found on the energy side. 

The House bill's cuts to sources like nuclear and geothermal, which can produce the constant stream of power needed for fueling data centers and AI model training, were so severe that even Energy Secretary Chris Wright asked for them to be tapered back.

The Senate version indeed tapered those back a bit by allowing credits for projects that start construction before 2034, a few years later than the House deadlines. But it makes up for that by repealing wind and solar credits faster. In the House bill, wind and solar companies had to be operational by the end of 2028; in the Senate version, by the end of 2027.

In its initial form, the Senate bill would have taken another hatchet to wind and solar by actively taxing them, proposing a provision to tax wind and solar farms coming online after 2027 if they use components from China. The thing is that essentially every wind and solar farm uses components from China, given how dominant that country is in supply chains for these sources, and that will not change any time soon.

The energy tax was struck from the final version of the Senate bill. But its repeal of wind and solar credits remains a threat to AI as an industry.

For one thing, the bill makes everyone's electricity, including that for AI training, more expensive. The Rhodium Group modeled an earlier, less severe version of the bill and found it would increase energy costs for industry by 4 percent to 6 percent annually. Most of this comes in the form of increased spending on fossil fuels. Because the economic case for new wind and solar production is so much worse, natural gas and coal will have to be a bigger part of the energy mix, and because they can be more expensive than renewables, that pushes up costs.

Wind and solar are intermittent sources (it's not always windy, it's not always sunny), which is not ideal for projects that need constant power, such as data centers. But with the addition of batteries, wind and solar can provide more constant wattage, and sure enough, data center users like Google have bet on wind/solar-plus-batteries as an energy source for their facilities.

More to the point, AI is moving very quickly, and the buildout of these data centers and their power sources has to happen fast. Nuclear can provide clean baseload electricity, but the two most recent nuclear plants in the US took a decade to come online. Enhanced geothermal, the kind that can be installed anywhere and not just in seismically active places like Iceland, is still years away from deployment at scale, despite big recent strides.

Solar/wind plus batteries is a technology that can be deployed fast. The Solar Energy Industries Association (hardly a disinterested actor, but I think it's right on this) found that while solar and wind plants take on average less than two years from conception to coming online (as do battery plants), natural gas can take twice as long and coal three times. Small wonder that in 2024, 93 percent of new power capacity in the US last year came from solar, batteries, or wind. It's just about the only electricity source you can get up quickly.

If you can't get fast, clean energy anymore, because Trump's policies have made it uneconomical, then AI firms are going to have to rely on slow-to-build, dirtier energy. There is a huge shortage of natural gas turbines in the US right now, with waiting times doubling in the past year. That shortage will get worse if the tax bill shifts demand currently aiming for wind and solar toward natural gas. That will, in turn, slow the data center buildout.

It might be tempting, if you're skeptical of AI's benefits or worried about its risks, to think that this is a positive. They're slowing down progress, and progress in this field could be dangerous. 

I fear this is failing to think an extra step ahead. The most likely result isn't that no data centers get built, but that they get built in countries that do subsidize solar, wind, and batteries. It would be very good news indeed for China, for one thing, whose AI firms would gain a great opportunity to match US labs, which they're not too far behind as it is. It would also be very good news for the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which are putting huge amounts of oil money behind data center projects for AI firms, projects that inevitably will be subject to the pressures of these dictatorships.

The bill would not increase AI safety. It would simply cede leadership in the race to China, and/or force the US to rely on dirty energy and worsen climate impacts to keep up.

If you put a bill before Congress stating that it is the policy of the United States to fall behind China in AI development and to put American firms like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic at a disadvantage to Chinese companies like DeepSeek, Tencent, and Huawei, it would get no votes. But this is effectively what the One Big Beautiful Bill is offering. 

What Congress seems ready to pass is less an industrial policy than an industrial suicide note. It is truly beyond me that any members of the House or Senate, let alone majorities, are signing it.

President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” is the centerpiece of his legislative agenda, and the stakes are high.

The bill has four major pillars: renewing his 2017 tax cuts, implementing new tax cuts, spending billions on a border wall, US Customs and Border Protection, and the military, and increasing the debt ceiling. The bill itself is a smorgasbord of policy and could also affect clean energy programs, student loans, and food assistance, but perhaps the most consequential changes will be to Medicaid.

The bill was approved by the House in May and passed a key Senate vote on Saturday. Republicans are divided over competing priorities; some want to extend Trump's tax cuts and boost immigration and defense spending, while others worry about the $2.6 trillion cost and cuts to Medicaid. Republican lawmakers aim to pass the bill by Friday using budget reconciliation, but it's unclear if all 53 Republican senators will agree.

This is a developing story. Follow along here for the latest news, explainers, and analysis.

Dylan Matthews

To hear many smart AI observers tell it, the day of Wednesday, June 25, 2025, represented the moment when Congress started to take the possibility of advanced AI seriously.

The occasion was a hearing of Congress's “we're worried about China” committee (or, more formally, the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party) focused on the US-China AI competition. Members of both parties used the event to express concern that was surprisingly strident and detailed about the near-term risks posed by artificial general intelligence (AGI) or even artificial superintelligence (ASI).

Dylan Scott

Senate Republicans have passed President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” a move that will make major changes to Medicaid through establishing a work requirement for the first time and restricting states' ability to finance their share of the program's costs. If the bill ultimately becomes law after passing the House and receiving Trump's signature — which could all happen before Friday — American health care is never going to be the same.

The consequences will be dire. 

Andrew Prokop

Republicans are barreling ahead to try to pass President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” — legislation that somehow manages to combine massive fiscal irresponsibility with devastating spending cuts.

The bill would keep the “Trump tax cuts” originally passed in 2017 in place, while adding some new tax breaks and new spending on immigration enforcement and the military.

Nicole Narea

Three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Republicans in Congress are poised to further erode access to abortion and reproductive care.

President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” would not only directly threaten reproductive care by defunding Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers, it would also incentivize insurers for Affordable Care Act plans in some states to drop abortion coverage or make it significantly more expensive.

Eric Levitz

The Republican Party's saving grace is supposed to be its commitment to economic growth and consumer abundance. 

Sure, the GOP may see unemployed cancer patients as shiftless mooches — and the Lorax as literature's greatest villain — but for precisely those reasons, Republicans are allegedly able stewards of industrial development: Unconstrained by concerns about inequality, the environment, or social justice, the GOP will unleash the private sector's productive potential. Republicans won't balance Americans' hunger for cheap gasoline against their enlightened interest in cleaner air or a cooler planet — they'll get you the cheap fuel now. And they won't weigh America's stake in technological supremacy against the risks of unregulated innovation — they'll give cutting-edge companies whatever they need to achieve global dominance. 

Dylan Scott

While public attention has largely been focused on the Middle East and on President Donald Trump's immigration policy, Republicans in Congress are on the verge of passing massive Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance benefits and, according to one recent estimate, thousands of unnecessary deaths every year.

While the GOP's so-called “big, beautiful” bill is a smorgasbord of policy — potentially including everything from blocking AI regulation to restricting the power of the federal courts — perhaps the most consequential changes would be to Medicaid. The program, which covers low-income Americans of all ages, is now the country's single largest insurer, covering more than 70 million people. The legislation approved by House Republicans, which is now being debated and amended by the Senate, would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years. The upshot is that 10.3 million fewer people would be enrolled in the program by 2034.

Sean Illing

For more than half a century, the American right has preached the virtues of free markets and low taxes and deregulation. But a new wave of conservative thinkers are now arguing that Republicans have been wrong — or at the very least misguided — about the economy. 

This new economic thinking represents a break from what we've come to expect from the American right. Its proponents argue for a new strain of economic populism, one that departs from the GOP's past allegiance to big business and focuses instead on the working class. 

Nicole Narea

The fight over President Donald Trump's so-called big, beautiful bill is turning ugly.

After passing the GOP-controlled House, the bill has moved to the Senate, where Republicans are facing a bitter divide over how to balance their competing priorities.

Abdallah Fayyad

If the “big, beautiful bill,” President Donald Trump's signature legislative priority, eventually becomes law, it would gut some social programs that many people rely on. As my colleague Dylan Scott wrote in a thorough explainer, the package, which House Republicans passed last month, could result in millions of people losing their health care because of proposed work requirements on Medicaid.

There's also another part of the bill that really stands out when it comes to how Trump's domestic policy package will hurt low-income families: its overhaul of student loan programs. From changing eligibility requirements for Pell Grants, which help low-income students pay for college, to capping how much money students can borrow to cover the cost of tuition, the legislation would put a college education further out of reach for many Americans.

Dylan Matthews

To pass a law in the United States, you need to jump through a lot of hurdles. 

A bill has to first clear a committee in the House or Senate. (In the case of Republicans' tax legislation this year, its components had to clear 11 different committees.) The House Rules Committee has to agree for it to come to the floor for a vote. It has to pass that vote. In the Senate, it has to get 60 votes to beat a potential filibuster, or else obey a set of byzantine rules allowing it to pass with a simple majority.

Welcome to The Logoff: President Donald Trump is one step closer to getting his “big, beautiful bill” after it passed the House in a close vote early this morning.

Andrew Prokop

Editor's note, May 22, 8:30 am ET: The House passed a version of Trump's bill early Thursday morning. It now goes to the Senate, where Republicans say they want more changes to the bill. This story was originally published on Monday.

President Donald Trump's second term has so far been dominated by his aggressive use of executive power — but now, he's finally trying to get something through Congress.

Li Zhou

With President Donald Trump's second administration just weeks away, congressional Republicans are gearing up to execute on a wide-ranging legislative agenda touching on everything from taxes to immigration to fossil fuels. In a Monday interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump noted that his preference for doing so was “one big, beautiful bill,” but said he'd be open to two. 

To accomplish that, Republicans intend to use a process known as budget reconciliation, which allows them to approve budget-related legislation with a simple majority in the Senate. Doing so enables them to bypass filibuster rules, which would otherwise require a bill to garner 60 votes to advance in the upper chamber. (In this case, with the Senate divided 53-47 in favor of Republicans, passing a bill through normal order would also require Democratic votes.)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Tesla's delivery numbers are as bad as Wall Street expected — and the stock is up","https://www.businessinsider.com/teslas-delivery-numbers-second-quarter-sales-q2-2025-2025-7","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:12:00 GMT","

Tesla's delivery numbers are in — and they're as bad as Wall Street expected.

The electric automaker delivered 384,000 EVs in the second quarter, narrowly missing analysts' grim expectations.

Wall Street had prepared for disaster, with analysts on average expecting 389,400 vehicles delivered in the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The actual number represents a year-over-year decrease of 13.5% from the roughly 444,000 vehicles it delivered in the second quarter of 2024.

This is the biggest quarterly decline in pure numbers in Tesla's history, representing a drop of 60,000 deliveries compared to Q2 2024.

The latest report follows a bruising first quarter for Tesla. The automaker delivered nearly 336,700 EVs in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 13% decrease from the same period in 2024 and its lowest quarter since 2022.

Tesla's stock was around 3% higher soon after the market opened Wednesday following the announcement.

The challenging quarter came after Tesla experienced its first year-over-year delivery decline in 2024 as the company grappled with an industry-wide EV slowdown, increasing competition, and backlash from some against Elon Musk's political actions.

In the company's first quarter earnings call, CFO Vaibhav Taneja attributed lower delivery numbers to assembly line changeover for the refreshed Model Y and anti-Tesla hostility that had an impact in some markets.

The refreshed Model Y — Tesla's best-selling vehicle — has since launched, fueling an increase in new vehicle sales in April for the automaker as other manufacturers saw a monthly decrease, according to Cox Automotive data. However, it's not the more affordable model that the company previously said was on track to begin production by the end of June.

Although Musk stepped down from his political stint at the White House, the full extent of any brand damage to Tesla is not clear.

The company's stock got a boost after Musk stepped away from his work with DOGE, though the Tesla CEO later ignited a highly public feud with Trump. Tesla's stock has seen volatile swings in recent weeks as the two trade insults.

Tesla's delivery report arrives as the automaker has faced shrinking sales in multiple markets in recent months.

Data from Shanghai-based consultancy ThinkerCar indicated that Tesla's EV sales in China decreased 18% year-over-year between January and May as its rival BYD surged.

The company did get some good news in its second-largest market on Wednesday. According to data from China's Passenger Car Association, the number of cars shipped from Tesla's Shanghai factory rose slightly in June compared to last year, halting an eight-month run of year-over-year sales declines.

Tesla's EU market share dropped year over year from 1.6% to 0.9% in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The automaker saw a 45.2% drop in EV registrations in the first five months of the year in Europe.

When previously asked about declining Tesla sales in Europe, Musk has said that Europe is not a key market for the EV maker and that demand remains strong in other regions.

""Europe is our weakest market,"" Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May.

May data from Cox Automotive suggests that the US EV industry is also facing challenges. New EV sales are down 10.7% year over year despite a 4.2% uptick from the month prior, according to the data. Despite the industrywide headwinds, the report estimated that Tesla remained the market leader in May.

Musk has said that Tesla's bet on solving full vehicle autonomy is key to the company's future growth. The company launched a limited rollout of its robotaxi service in Austin in June, with plans to expand the service in the coming months.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Ukraine has been catapulting drones to strike Russia's million-dollar air defenses deep behind battle lines","https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-catapulting-drones-strike-russia-air-defenses-uj-26-bober-2025-7","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 06:30:00 GMT","

Ukraine's intelligence directorate (GUR) has released footage of Kyiv's UJ-26 ""Bober"" drone being launched via catapult to attack Russian air defenses.

The video, published on Tuesday, shows the locally manufactured 8-foot-long loitering munition being slung into the air from a fixed ramp. GUR said its special forces launched the drones to attack targets in Russian-occupied Crimea.

The new launch method allows the fixed-wing Bober to enter combat without landing gear, which would likely improve its range or maneuverability. Traditionally, the Bobers take off from airstrips like traditional aircraft.

Given that the ramp would likely have to be set up in Ukrainian-held territory west of the Dnieper River, the drone would have to travel a minimum of roughly 60 miles to reach Russian targets in Crimea.

The drones also seem to be equipped with thermal cameras in several first-person view clips uploaded by the defense intelligence agency.

One montage appears to show a drone evading a missile and then flying into a $15 million Pantsir S-1 point air defense system. A second drone is also shown flying into the ground next to a Pantsir S-1 as the vehicle crew scrambles for cover.

GUR described the attack as the ""successful defeat"" of the Pantsir, but did not show footage of the results.

The intelligence agency also said it conducted similar successful attacks on three Russian radar systems — The Niobium-SV, the Pechora-3, and the Provotnik GE — as well as a fourth-generation Su-30 fighter.

It uploaded several first-person view clips of drones approaching these systems with thermal cameras, though many of them can only be seen flying close to their target.

Business Insider could not independently verify the damage caused.

Ukrainian media regularly describe the Niobium-SV as a $100 million system. Earlier Russian estimates from before the full-scale invasion indicated that the Kremlin was acquiring the Niobium-SV in 2016 for about $40 million per unit. However, these may have since been fitted with more expensive upgrades.

Meanwhile, one Bober, which translates to ""beaver"" in Ukrainian, reportedly costs around $110,000 to manufacture. The propeller drone is meant for long-range attacks and is known to carry the KZ-6 charge, a 6.6-pound demolition explosive designed to break through concrete or armor.

It's yet another example of how the war has increasingly featured cheaper systems being used to attack and, at times, destroy expensive high-end equipment, posing difficult questions for the traditional defense procurement model that heavily prioritized advanced technology.

For example, one of Ukraine's biggest community drone funds, run by activist Serhii Sternenko, reported to donors that its crowdfunded drones have damaged at least 11 Buk surface-to-air missile systems in 2025. The fund often publishes footage of such strikes.

Depending on whether they have the latest upgrades, these defenses can cost Russia between $10 and $100 million each. By comparison, Sternenko's fund said it receives roughly $6 million in donations a month for its entire budget.

TikTok and ByteDance employees are bracing for possible layoffs after the company informed staff it would announce ""organizational and personnel changes"" early Wednesday morning, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.

The changes would impact workers in the company's global e-commerce business, TikTok Shop, which has had several rounds of layoffs this year.

""Over the past month, we have assessed how we can best support our evolving Global E-commerce business in alignment with our mission and evolving goals in the market,"" the company wrote in the memo.

These changes come from ""careful analysis of how to create more efficient operating models for the team's long-term growth,"" the company wrote.

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

TikTok's US e-commerce team has been under scrutiny from leadership at its parent company, ByteDance, this year. The division's top executive told staff in a February all-hands call that the country failed to meet its performance goals in 2024. The division has faced new obstacles in 2025 after Trump hiked tariffs on China, where many of TikTok's global sellers are based. Weekly US order volume fell in mid-May compared to mid-April after tariffs went into effect, BI previously reported.

The company has trimmed staff this year through a mix of layoffs and performance reviews, during which TikTok has offered some people a choice between performance-improvement plans or exits with severance. As US team members have left the company, leaders from China and Singapore with experience on TikTok's Chinese sister app, Douyin, have taken their place, staffers previously told BI.

The organizational changes come amid broader uncertainty for TikTok's US team members. The company is negotiating with the Trump administration over a 2024 law that required ByteDance to divest from TikTok's US assets or face a potential ban. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive orders amid discussions.

The uncertainty is taking its toll on one staffer who received the message Tuesday evening that their team would be impacted by the organizational changes. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not permitted to speak about the company, and their identity is known to BI.

""I think for many of us, we just want clarity,"" the employee said. ""These eternal extensions make no sense for anyone who works here. How can we plan our jobs and lives if every 90 days we might get banned or sold?""

Trump's Tariffs:

Vietnam and the US are said to be close to a trade framework that will see goods given a scaled range of tariffs depending on the percentage of foreign content, according to people familiar with the talks.

Exports to the US that contain the highest proportion of foreign components would be charged at the top end of the range, around 20% or above, the people said, asking not to be identified as the talks are confidential. Products that contain a lower percentage of foreign components would be set a slightly reduced rate, while those entirely from Vietnam would face the lowest rate — potentially the existing universal 10% levy, the people said. The details continue to be discussed and could still change.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

GOP Tax Bill:

President Donald Trump is meeting with a faction of conservative lawmakers at the White House who have threatened to sink his signature tax legislation over its $3.4 trillion price tag as lawmakers cast doubt on whether it can pass by July 4.

The president's ambitious timeline to pass the bill is encountering considerable opposition as moderate and ultraconservative Republican lawmakers threaten to defy him and perhaps frustrate his domestic agenda. House lawmakers returned to Washington Wednesday to vote on the Senate version of the measure, which passed the upper chamber 51-50 on Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance's tie-breaking vote.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

Forget Tesla for a moment. Just imagine an anonymous company with the following characteristics. Sales of its main product suddenly stopped growing over a year ago and are down 13% so far this year. Its last big product launch bombed. It reiterated plans for new lower-cost versions of its product as recently as three months ago, and they then didn't materialize. The chief executive dove head-first into divisive political activities that alienated customers and then picked a fight with the US president and his party. Having promised a revolutionary new automated product for a decade, missing repeated deadlines, the company finally launched a limited, somewhat automated pilot that looks years behind the competition.

The debate over shifting the Pentagon's focus to China obscures how strained the US military has become.

It's useful to be reminded, occasionally, that there's only one superpower. Operation Midnight Hammer, the globe-spanning strike against Iran's nuclear program, was a demonstration of power projection that America's rivals can only envy. Unfortunately, the operation is also testament to how badly US military power is being strained, and how unserious the nation's debate on defense strategy has become.

That debate has featured, in recent years, two warring camps. In the first are those who warn that the threat of war with China is rising and that interventions elsewhere make it harder to prepare for that fight. In the second are those who argue that the US has vital stakes outside the western Pacific and that a global power can't simply quit crucial regions such as the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Oddly, recent events show that both groups have a point.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

President Donald Trump said Wednesday that the United States has struck a trade deal with Vietnam that includes a 20% tariff on the southeast Asian country's imports to the U.S. 

Trump's announcement on Truth Social said that the deal will give the U.S. tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets.

Vietnam also agreed that goods would be hit with a 40% tariff rate if they originated in another country and were transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the United States.

The process, known as transshipping, is used to circumvent trade barriers. China, a top exporter to the U.S., has reportedly used Vietnam as a transshipment hub.

Trump wrote that ""Vietnam will pay"" that 20% duty, but tariffs are taxes on foreign goods that are paid by the importers of those products.

The agreement was unveiled less than a week before a 90-day pause on many of Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs was set to expire, sending U.S. duties on imports from dozens of countries soaring.

Under that protectionist trade scheme, Vietnamese imports to the U.S. were subject to a 46% blanket tariff. That rate was lowered to 10% during the 90-day interim. Raising the tariff on Vietnamese goods to 20% will hike costs for U.S. importers, which could be passed on to consumers or suppliers.

The S&P 500 nevertheless rose slightly on news of the trade deal. 

Read Trump's full post:

""It is my Great Honor to announce that I have just made a Trade Deal with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam after speaking with To Lam, the Highly Respected General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. It will be a Great Deal of Cooperation between our two Countries. The Terms are that Vietnam will pay the United States a 20% Tariff on any and all goods sent into our Territory, and a 40% Tariff on any Transshipping. In return, Vietnam will do something that they have never done before, give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade. In other words, they will ""OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,"" meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff. It is my opinion that the SUV or, as it is sometimes referred to, Large Engine Vehicle, which does so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam. Dealing with General Secretary To Lam, which I did personally, was an absolute pleasure. Thank you for your attention to this matter!""

It was unclear from Trump's post when the deal will take effect, or if it has been officially signed by both parties.

Trump has signaled that he may ignore or revise the upcoming deadline for his reciprocal tariffs to snap back higher. The 90-day pause, which lowered tariffs on nearly all other countries to a blanket 10% rate, was imposed in early April to give countries breathing room while they negotiate deals with the U.S.

With the deadline approaching, the Trump administration has only struck revised trade frameworks with China and the United Kingdom, though it has repeatedly said the U.S. is close to deals with numerous other countries.

Vietnam, whose exports to the U.S. reportedly comprised 30% of its gross domestic product last year, is especially vulnerable to Trump's tariffs.

Critics of Trump's unpredictable tariff policies warn that the duties create economic uncertainty and will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers. The Trump administration and its defenders counter that tariffs do not cause inflation and note that the president's duties have brought in billions of dollars to the U.S. government.

A pricing model created for CNBC this month by retail consulting group AlixPartners found that a 10% U.S. tariff on Vietnamese goods would cause the price of an imported men's sweater to rise by about 8%. Under the 46% tariff Trump initially slapped on Vietnam, the price of that same sweater would rise roughly 35%, the group found.

U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that officials expect the impacts of Trump's tariffs will start to show up more during the summer months.

Prices on certain items, including apparel and footwear, are already ticking higher as a result of the tariffs, CNBC has reported.

Some analysts believe the lack of a widespread impact on U.S. prices so far is the result of pre-tariff stockpiling by companies, as well as the time it takes for those tariffs to show up in the economy.

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs was found guilty on Wednesday of prostitution-related offenses but cleared of more serious charges, in a blow to prosecutors who had urged a jury to find him guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.

Combs was convicted of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking, a partial win for the former billionaire known for elevating hip-hop in American culture.

After the judge dismissed the jury and lawyers for both sides, Combs knelt before his chair and appeared to pray. Combs then rose and faced the courtroom gallery.

""I'm gonna be home soon,"" he said, smiling and clasping his hands. ""I love you. Thank you, I love you.""

Combs' family and supporters erupted into applause and cheers.

The verdict followed a criminal trial in which two of the music mogul's former girlfriends testified that he physically and sexually abused them.

Combs faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence on each of the two prostitution counts. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian will determine Combs' sentence at a later date.

The acquittals on the sex trafficking counts mean he will avoid a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. He could have faced life in prison if he were convicted on sex trafficking or racketeering conspiracy.

After the jury read its verdict, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo asked Subramanian to release Combs on bail, which prosecutors opposed. Subramanian asked lawyers for both sides to submit written arguments on whether he should release Combs by 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT).

Combs has been held in federal lockup in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest.

Combs' family left the courthouse to chants of ""love, love, love,"" from Combs' supporters. During his career, Combs' stage monikers included Love, Puff Daddy and P. Diddy.

The trial focused on prosecutors' allegations that Combs for two decades used his business empire to force two of his romantic partners to take part in drug-fueled, days-long sexual performances sometimes known as ""Freak Offs"" with male sex workers in hotel rooms while Combs watched, masturbated and occasionally filmed.

During the seven-week trial in Manhattan federal court, jurors saw some of the 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant authorities found during searches of his homes, which prosecutors said he would use in the performances. They also heard testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends, the rhythm and blues singer Casandra ""Cassie"" Ventura and a woman known in court by the pseudonym Jane, who said Combs beat them and pressured them to take part in the performances.

Combs, 55, had pleaded not guilty to all five counts. His lawyers acknowledged that the Bad Boy Records founder, once famed for hosting lavish parties for the cultural elite in luxurious locales like the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez, was at times violent in his domestic relationships.

But they said the sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual, and accused prosecutors of trying to criminalize Combs' private sex life. They argued that Ventura and Jane were strong, independent women who voluntarily took part in the sexual performances because they wanted to please Combs.

Both women testified they spent time with Combs and took part in sexual performances after he beat them. Defense lawyers argued that Ventura and Jane were retrospectively accusing Combs of forcing their participation in the performances because they were jealous he was seeing other women.

""If he was charged with domestic violence, we wouldn't all be here,"" Combs' defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in his closing argument on June 27. ""He did not do the things he's charged with.""

Combs was convicted of transportation to engage in prostitution related to both Ventura and Jane. Those charges required prosecutors to prove that Combs paid the male escorts for sex, and arranged for their travel across state lines.

Prosecutors had argued that Combs' conduct as to both women amounted to sex trafficking because he compelled Ventura and Jane to take part in the performances using physical violence and threats to withhold financial support or leak sexually explicit images of them.

""The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,"" prosecutor Christy Slavik said in her closing argument on June 26. ""He doesn't take no for an answer.""

At the trial, jurors saw surveillance footage from 2016 showing Combs kicking and dragging Ventura in the hallway of an InterContinental hotel in Los Angeles, where she said she was trying to leave a ""Freak Off.""

Jane later testified that Combs in June 2024 attacked her and directed her to perform oral sex on a male entertainer, even though she told him she did not want to. That alleged attack took place a month after Combs apologized on social media for his 2016 attack of Ventura, footage of which had been broadcast on CNN.

Prosecutors also argued that Combs was guilty of racketeering conspiracy because he and his associates committed crimes to facilitate his abuse and keep evidence of his wrongdoing under wraps.

The defense argued Combs was a successful entrepreneur who used drugs recreationally, but kept his professional and personal lives separate.

The criminal trial is not the only legal problem Combs faces. Ventura sued Combs in November 2023 for sex trafficking, the first of dozens of civil lawsuits accusing him of abuse. Combs, once feted for turning artists like Notorious B.I.G. and Usher into stars, settled with Ventura for $20 million. He has denied all wrongdoing.

""Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution,"" Ventura's lawyer Douglas Wigdor said in a statement after the verdict.

In this article

Microsoft said Wednesday that it will lay off about 9,000 employees. The move will affect less than 4% of its global workforce across different teams, geographies and levels of experience, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.

The announcement comes on the second day of Microsoft's 2026 fiscal year. Executives at the Redmond, Washington-based company typically unveil reorganizations at the time of the new fiscal year.

""We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson said in an email.

Microsoft has held several rounds of layoffs already this calendar year. In January, it cut less than 1% of headcount based on performance. The 50-year-old software company slashed more than 6,000 jobs in May and then at least 300 more in June. As of June 2024 it employed 228,000 people. In 2023, it laid off 10,000.

Perhaps the largest culling of Microsoft workers came in 2014, when the company eliminated 18,000 after acquiring Nokia's devices and services business.

As was the case with the May layoffs, Microsoft is looking to reduce the number of layers of managers that stand between individual contributors and top executives, said the person who asked not to be named while discussing internal matters.

""To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness,"" Phil Spencer, Microsoft's CEO of gaming, wrote in a Wednesday memo to employees in that division.

Microsoft reported nearly $26 billion in net income on $70 billion in revenue for the March quarter. The numbers were well ahead of Wall Street's consensus, keeping Microsoft ranked as one of the most profitable companies in the S&P 500 index, according to data compiled by FactSet.

Executives called for about 14% year-over-year revenue growth in the June quarter, thanks to expected expansion in Azure cloud services and corporate productivity software subscriptions

Microsoft stock closed at a record high of $497.45 per share on June 26. At the start of Wednesday's trading session, the shares were down about 0.6%, while the S&P 500 was roughly flat.

Autodesk, Chegg and CrowdStrike are among the other software providers that have slimmed down in 2025. Earlier on Wednesday, payroll processing company ADP said the U.S. private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June. Economists polled by Dow Jones had predicted an increase of 100,000.

The impact of President Trump's tariffs on prices throughout the economy is expected to increase over the summer. At U.S. department store chains including Macy's, Nordstrom, and Dillard's, the evidence of more sticker price inflation is starting to show up across more items.

Recent price increases in apparel, footwear, and bags across major U.S. department-store websites tracked by DataWeave indicate a turning point in May, when prices started their ascent.

DataWeave analyzes nearly 15,000 SKUs (stock keeping units), a scannable code retailers use to identify and track a product, and has been collecting that data from January to June for signs of price hikes in footwear, apparel, and bags.

""Footwear is now as much as 4% above January levels at some banners, while apparel is roughly half that pace,"" said Karthik Bettadapura, co-founder & CEO of DataWeave.

According to the data, Macy's 1589 SKUs of footwear reported a 4.2% increase in price, followed by Nordstrom (3.1%), and Dillard's (2%.)

Prices in store may vary slightly from online prices, but typically follow the same pricing trend.

Type of product and its sourcing can influence how fast the price hikes arrive.

Private-label lines, many of which are made in China, refresh every few months, so retailers like Macy's and Nordstrom feel higher landed costs sooner, according to Bettadapura. Footwear reacts fastest because it carries some of the steepest baseline duties and relies heavily on China for finished pairs. ""Even a modest levy can ripple through quickly once fresh stock lands in distribution centers,"" Bettadapura said. Apparel, with longer design cycles and a more diversified supply base, ""is moving more gradually,"" she added.

Macy's, Nordstrom and Dillard's did not respond to requests for comment.

The SKU data supports findings from a recent survey conducted by the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, where 55% of respondents said they expect their average retail price to rise between 6%-10% in 2025 as a result of tariffs.

""With all back-to-school styles now facing tariffs of between 10-30 percent, higher prices should not be a surprise this summer,"" said Stephen Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. ""While each company makes their own decisions, these tariff costs are now being felt across the board,"" he said.

In apparel, DSW topped the list in recent price increases, at 2%, followed by Macy's (1.9%), and Nordstrom (1.8%), according to Dataweave.

""If these tariffs persist or increase after July 9, we can expect more of the same in the seasons to come,"" Lamar said.

Trump has been non-committal recently on sticking to the July 9 deadline his White House set for tariff deals with many trading partners or implement additional tariffs. The White House announced on Wednesday morning it has a trade deal with one key retail manufacturing partner, Vietnam.

Trump said in a social post the tariff rate on Vietnamese goods will be 20%, and go to 40% for any goods that are finished in Vietnam but originate in other countries, such as China, in what is called ""transshipment,"" a supply chain strategy that has been used by companies in China to avoid tariffs.

Apparel companies that rely on Vietnam's manufacturing capacity could face higher import costs under the new tariff rate. Nike, Lululemon, Patagonia, Puma, and H&M are among retail industry companies with manufacturing operations in Vietnam.

Vietnam is the second-largest supplier for footwear, apparel, and accessories sold into the U.S. market, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.

""We'll be watching the back-to-school intake closely to gauge whether this pricing momentum accelerates or levels off,"" Bettadapura said.

In the bags category (which includes handbags & shoulder bags, crossbody, sling and belt bags, totes, backpacks, travel & duffel bags, small goods and clutches), outdoor recreation store REI had the top price increase, at 2.6% Dillard's, Macy's, and Nordstrom all had nominal increases.

""Retailers have long warned that tariffs will impact pricing, and some consumers may be starting to see those reflected in key consumer products,"" said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. ""Tariffs continue to be a significant challenge for retailers, especially with the ongoing uncertainty and unknowns regarding the final tariff rates.""

He said retailers have tried to mitigate price increases, but the merchandise subject to the tariffs is working its way through the supply chain and is now being placed on store shelves.

Bill Simon, former CEO of Walmart, said the data correlates with what he is seeing, and the next move in either stoking or stifling the inflation trend across products may be up to the consumer.

""Companies are mitigating what they can and are passing on the rest,"" Simon told CNBC. ""Consumers, who are the final arbiter of tariffs, then come into play. Will they buy the item that has gone up in price, or will they switch to another item in the same category that has less (or no) tariff? The customer gets to decide if they want to leave the category all together,"" he said.

Simon gave an example from the grocery aisle, saying if the price of bananas goes up because of a tariff, customers can decide to either buy them or exit the category and buy oranges from California or Florida instead. ""If you look at the item level, you will see a higher price on banana but when you look at the category, you will see no price increase because consumers switched to oranges. That is why I believe despite seeing item-level price increases, we are not seeing broader inflation increasing. Consumers are using their power to determine what is too much and what is not,"" he said.

Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, says inflation is underway, ""and has been for the last few months,"" citing a recent rise in core import prices, ex food and energy, in April and May. ""The only question is how this will now flow through the supply chain and who gets to eat it,"" Boockvar said. ""[Fed Chair Jerome] Powell has made it clear that he is going to wait as long as possible until the tariffs fully work their way through the supply chain so he can see where they end up in terms of absorption.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","A bare-bones deal is Europe's best hope in trade talks with the U.S., sources say","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/a-bare-bones-deal-is-europes-best-hope-in-trade-talks-with-the-us-sources-say.html","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:36:55 GMT","



The clock is ticking in trade talks between Washington and the European Union, with European officials now saying their best hope is striking a ""political"" deal before a key July 9 deadline, three sources told CNBC.

Concrete details of such a trade arrangement would have to be worked out at a later time.

""The U.S. proposal from last week is aimed at an agreement in principle,"" one EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, told CNBC, adding that this agreement in principle would then ""be negotiated out into a proper trade agreement at a later stage.""

Previously close allies, the U.S. and EU have had a fractious relationship amid disagreements over trade and support for embattled Ukraine in the months since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's second term. Tensions escalated in early April, when White House announced a spate of reciprocal tariffs against most global trade partners, including a 20% levy on the EU. All such duties have been temporarily reduced until July 9 to facilitate talks.

The U.S. sent a new proposal to the EU's negotiating team last week. European negotiators are having face-to-face talks with their American counterparts later this week with the view to get a deal done in the coming days. Total bilateral trade in goods between the EU and the U.S. accounted for 851 billion euros ($1 trillion) in 2023, according to figures from the European Commission.

European officials expect a new update on the negotiations Friday, but the situation is fluid. On Monday, European ambassadors had conversations about the state of play in the trade negotiations. Lithuania's Minister of Finance Rimantas Šadžius told CNBC on Wednesday that he is ""slightly optimistic"" there will be a trade compromise between both sided of the Atlantic.

Despite this, sources told CNBC that, despite efforts to reach a trade compromise, the EU is preparing for any possible outcomes, including the return of reciprocal tariffs.

""The general sense is that in the coming days and weeks, all outcomes, ranging from a successful deal on a framework agreement all the way to higher US tariffs with additional sectors, are still possible,"" the same EU official told CNBC.

This sentiment was also shared by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last Friday.

""We are ready for a deal. At the same time, we are preparing for the possibility that no satisfactory agreement is reached,"" she said at a press conference.

The European Commission was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC Wednesday about an update to the talks.

Another EU official, also speaking to CNBC on the condition of anonymity, said there is an awareness in Brussels that it is almost impossible to return to the trade relationship that the EU and U.S. enjoyed before the April 2 announcement of reciprocal tariffs.

A third EU official, who also chose to speak anonymously, told CNBC that there is a risk that the outcome of the talks will be an ""asymmetrical"" deal, under which the EU will not escape some additional U.S. levies.

Nonetheless, the bloc is looking to get concessions in critical areas for its economy, including automotive, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, all three sources confirmed.

The first EU official added that some member states will only agree to a deal in principle if there is a commitment from the Trump administration to ""upfront tariff relief.""

The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, negotiates trade with other parts of the world, but its proposals and position reflects the thinking of the 27 capitals.

In the wake of high-profile layoffs, many workers are feeling anxious about job security.

U.S. employers reported nearly 700,000 job cuts in the first five months of 2025, according to outplacement services firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, an 80% increase compared to job cuts in the first five months of 2024.

It's little wonder, then, that 46% of Americans report feeling ""concerned"" about layoffs in the next year, according to a recent Indeed survey.

The fear of losing your job can be all-consuming, affecting everything from your productivity to your personal relationships.

According to executive coach and licensed social worker Melody Wilding, layoff anxiety can create a ""vicious cycle"" of overwork for employees.

Concern for their jobs is ""causing people to work much more, maybe in areas that are not productive, and burn out faster,"" she says.

Below, experts share tips to keep layoff anxiety from affecting your well-being, both at work and at home.

Layoff anxiety can make it difficult to stay focused, even on tasks you usually handle with ease, Wilding says.

""It's always in the back of your head, so you're not really bringing your best to anything you're doing,"" she says. ""There's just a hum of anxiety in the background.""

According to career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin, constantly thinking or talking about your job is another red flag.

""If it's something that is just popping into your mind, even at unrelated times, and you're having a hard time distracting yourself or redirecting yourself from that thought, that is definitely a telltale sign that you should probably do something about that anxiety,"" she says.

On a larger scale, layoff anxiety can create a negative environment at work. According to Wilding, when people are on edge, they're more likely to be ""reactive and maybe even defensive or snippy"" with their co-workers, which creates an atmosphere of ""tension and fear.""

Equally, Gavin says, it can strain your personal relationships: if you're constantly ""stress venting"" to your loved ones about your job concerns, you run the risk of overexerting your support system.

""Anxiety from any place in your life is going to seep into the rest of your life,"" she says.

For many of Gavin's clients, the hardest part of layoff anxiety is ""feeling like you have absolutely no control over the situation.""

While anxiety may feel ""paralyzing,"" coming up with a clear action plan can give you a greater sense of stability, she says.

""When my clients are catastrophizing about this sort of thing, I always ask them, 'what would you do? I know you would feel bad, but what would you do?'"" she says. ""Often we're able to come up with a list of actions that we can take.""

If you have a good relationship with your supervisor, Gavin recommends having an honest conversation about the prospect of layoffs, as well as doing some industry research on your own time.

Even if you do get laid off, Wilding says, ""it usually isn't as catastrophic as we make it"" in our minds. You may have to tighten your budget and put more energy into job searching, but being laid off doesn't mean that your career is over.

Wilding suggests sprucing up your resume and reconnecting with your professional network so that you're ready to hit the job market if necessary.

""It can give you a feeling of agency and control that should something bad happen, at least I'm ready to go,"" she says.

Honor on Wednesday touted the slimness and battery capacity of its newly launched thin foldable phone, as it lays down a fresh challenge to market leader Samsung.

The Honor Magic V5 goes will initially go on sale in China, but the Chinese tech firm will likely bring the device to international markets later this year.

The company, which spun off from Chinese tech giant Huawei in 2020, is looking to stand out from rivals with key features of the Magic V5, like artificial intelligence, battery and size.

Honor said the Magic V5 is 8.8 mm to 9mm when folded, depending on the color choice. The phone's predecessor, the Magic V3 — Honor skipped the Magic V4 name — was 9.2 mm when folded. Honor said the Magic V5 weighs 217 grams to 222 grams, again, depending on the color model. The previous version was 226 grams. 

In China, Honor will launch a special 1 terabyte storage size version of the Magic V5, which it says will have a battery capacity of more than 6000 milliampere-hour — among the highest for foldable phones.

Honor has tried hard to tout these features, as competition in foldables ramps up, even as these types of devices have a very small share of the overall smartphone market.

Foldables represented less than 2% of the overall smartphone market in 2024, according to International Data Corporation. Samsung was the biggest player with 34% market share followed by Huawei with just under 24%, IDC added. Honor took the fourth spot with a nearly 11% share. 

Honor is looking to get a head start on Samsung, which has its own foldable launch next week on July 9.

Francisco Jeronimo, a vice president at the International Data Corporation, said the Magic V5 is a strong offering from Honor.

""This is the dream foldable smartphone that any user who is interested in this category will think of,"" Jeronimo told CNBC, pointing to features such as the battery.

""This phone continues to push the bar forward, and it will challenge Samsung as they are about to launch their seventh generation of foldable phones,"" he added.

The thinness of a foldable phone has become a battleground for smartphone makers to appeal to consumers who want the large screen size the device has to offer without extra weight.

At its event next week, Samsung is expected to release a foldable that is thinner than its predecessor and could come close to challenging Honor's offering by way of size, analysts said. If that happens, then Honor will be facing more competition, especially against Samsung, which has a bigger global footprint.

""The biggest challenge for Honor is the brand equity and distribution reach vs Samsung, where the Korean vendor has the edge,"" Neil Shah, co-founder of Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.

Honor's push into international markets beyond China is still fairly young, with the company looking to build up its brand.

""Further, if Samsung catches up with a thinner form-factor in upcoming iterations, as it has been the real pioneer in foldables with its vertical integration expertise from displays to batteries, the differentiating factor might narrow for Honor,"" Shah added.

Vertical integration refers to when a company owns several parts of a product's supply chain. Samsung has a display and battery business which provides the components for its foldables.

Smartphone players, including Honor, have also looked to stand out via the AI features available on their device.

In March, Honor pledged a $10 billion investment in AI over the next five years, with part of that going toward the development of next-generation agents that are seen as more advanced personal assistants.

Honor said its AI assistant Yoyo can interact with other AI models, such as those created by DeepSeek and Alibaba in China, to create presentation decks.

The company also flagged its AI agent can hail a taxi ride across multiple apps in China, automatically accepting the quickest ride to arrive? and cancelling the rest.

In this article

Amazon announced Monday its millionth worker robot, and said its entire fleet will be powered by a newly launched generative artificial intelligence model. The move comes at a time when more tech companies are cutting jobs and warning of automation.

The million robot milestone — which joins Amazon's global network of more than 300 facilities — strengthens the company's position as the world's largest manufacturer and operator of mobile robotics, Scott Dresser, vice president of Amazon Robotics, said in a press release. 

Meanwhile, Dresser said that its new ""DeepFleet"" AI model will coordinate the movement of its robots within its fulfillment centers, reducing the travel time of the fleet by 10% and enabling faster and more cost-effective package deliveries.

Amazon began deploying robots in its facilities in 2012 to move inventory shelves across warehouse floors, according to Dresser. Since then, their roles in factories have grown tremendously, ranging from those able to lift up to 1,250 pounds of inventory to fully autonomous robots that navigate factories with carts of customer orders.

Meanwhile, AI-powered humanoid robots — designed to mimic human movement and shape — could be deployed this year at factories owned by Tesla.

But although advancements in AI robotics like those working in Amazon facilities come with the promise of productivity gains, they have also raised concerns about mass job loss.

A Pew Research survey published in March found that both AI experts and the general public see factory workers as one of the groups most at risk of losing their jobs because of AI.

That's a concern Dresser appeared to attempt to address in his statements. 

""These robots work alongside our employees, handling heavy lifting and repetitive tasks while creating new opportunities for our front-line operators to develop technical skills,"" Dresser said. He added that Amazon's ""next-generation fulfillment center"" in Shreveport, Louisiana, which was launched late last year, required 30% more employees in reliability, maintenance and engineering roles. 

However, the news of Amazon's robot expansion came soon after CEO Andy Jassy told CNBC that Amazon's rapid rollout of generative AI will result in ""fewer people doing some of the jobs that the technology actually starts to automate.""

Jassy said that even as AI eliminates jobs in certain areas, Amazon will continue to hire more employees in AI, robotics and elsewhere. But in a memo to employees earlier in June, the CEO had admitted that he expects the company's workforce to shrink in the coming years in light of technological advancements. 

The decline may have already begun. CNBC reported that Amazon cut more than 27,000 jobs in 2022 and 2023, and had continued to make more targeted cuts across business units. 

Other big tech CEOs such as Shopify's CEO Tobi Lutke also recently warned of the impact that AI will have on staffing. That comes as a vast array of firms investing in and adopting AI execute rounds of layoffs. 

According to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks technology industry layoffs, 551 companies laid off roughly 153,000 employees last year. And a World Economic Forum report in February found that 48% of U.S. employers plan to reduce their workforce due to AI.

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. Each week, we'll explore the biggest business stories in China, give a lowdown on market moves and help you set up for the week ahead. Like what you see? You can subscribe here.

Life in China these days is a story of stark contrasts.

If in one conversation, my counterparts are wringing their hands over a sluggish economy, the next reveals how quickly artificial intelligence is revamping industries.

Case in point: Chinese smartphone company Honor told CNBC its newest foldable set for release Wednesday will be the thinnest phone on the market to date at just 8.8 millimeters when folded — undercutting even the rumored thickness for Samsung's forthcoming foldable — thanks largely to its AI manufacturing tools.

Honor said it found the optimal combination of slimness and strength by using its ""1-billion parameter AI industrial model"" to simulate more than 125,000 options for device assembly. The company said AI-powered 3D scanning allowed it to achieve precision control of 0.003 millimeters, or about 1/20th of a human hair.

In all, that's a 1.1-millimeter slice off its first foldable launched in July 2023, when Honor made waves in the smartphone market with a device that folded up to be nearly as thin as an iPhone.

But it was also two summers ago when I recall that much of the post-Covid economic excitement was fading in China.

Conversations shifted from celebrating the end of lockdowns to bemoaning lackluster consumption. The pessimism also created a domestic market challenge for Honor's foldables, which typically start at the equivalent of over $1,000 each.

Looking back, Honor is not the only major Chinese company to have made strides over the last two years. Chinese smartphone company Xiaomi has launched two electric cars to directly compete with Tesla. DeepSeek was officially registered as a company in July 2023, according to records, before launching its breakthrough AI model in January this year.

AI's pervasiveness has also started to penetrate the ""less flashy"" parts of China's economy.

In July 2023, Huawei launched a dedicated AI model for commercial mining with mining company Yunding Technology and state-owned Shandong Energy Group. The model, based on its foundational ""Pangu"" model, allowed workers to operate mine equipment remotely from an office and develop other tech solutions more quickly.

Fast-forward to 2025, and the AI tech has been integrated in more than 100 mines, according to Huawei's annual report released in March. In May, the company's client in Inner Mongolia launched 100 self-driving electric trucks for a local coal mine.

Huawei last month revealed a new, 5.5 version of its Pangu foundation model, and on Monday, released an open source version for developers.

Foreign companies are also spurring technological innovation on the mainland, such as German industrial giant Siemens.

Out of 18 AI-integration related products Siemens just launched, 16 were developed in China in just nine months, Peter Koerte, the company's chief technology officer and chief strategy officer, said last week during the World Economic Forum conference in Tianjin. He described applications such as AI-powered energy savings systems for buildings.

These technological breakthroughs are the result of years or months of painstaking development, but it's only more recently that businesses are reaping the rewards.

""AI is transforming from isolated technological innovation into something that is core or embedded in the whole business process,"" Janet Tang, Hong Kong-based partner and managing director at AlixPartners, told me last week on the sidelines of the conference in Tianjin.

She stated that the significant integration of AI with business operations began roughly 12 months ago, following extensive trial and error over the past few years.

While China's biggest cities are yet to see a return to the pre-Covid boom days, there are signs that the rapid urban growth has instead spread to smaller cities and even rural areas.

Malipo, a Yunnan county once so poor it has received targeted assistance from the foreign ministry, started revamping its ""Tianbao"" land trading port on the border with Vietnam in 2023. The county even courted Hong Kong's Sunwah Group to invest 50 million yuan to open a tea processing plant in the same year.

The port has since seen a surge in durian trade, while plans are underway to open a tourist attraction with Sunwah in the county, allowing visitors to see tea trees that county head Xiao Changju claims are several hundred years old. She was speaking to reporters during a state-organized trip to the region in May.

Augmented reality glasses startup Xreal invested in its own factory in the southeastern ""tier 2"" city of Wuxi and earlier this year announced a new glasses product running Google's XR operating system.

The company is also moving its headquarters from Beijing to Shanghai this summer to be closer to its specialized factories in Wuxi that make optical parts and other components, CEO and founder Chi Xu told me on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's event in Tianjin last week.

Xu hopes that his products can reach consumers by the end of this year, while noting the U.S. remains the top market for Xreal.

""I'm always impressed by the level of energy, hardworking and openness of the enterprises here in China,"" AlixPartners' Tang said. Despite protectionism or other challenges, ""everyone is still so motivated, so eager to learn new things and to connect with the rest of the world.""

Grant Pan, Group CFO of Noah Holdings, said that investors are looking to diversify their assets away from just the U.S. and China markets.

Tolga Oncu, COO of Ingka Group, which manages IKEA, discussed the competition and opportunities he sees in China, especially in the 'silver' economy.

Aditi Rasquinha, CEO of DHL Global Forwarding Greater China, stated that the region's export growth has remained resilient despite a slowdown in U.S.-China trade.

Mixed signals on growth. The official purchasing managers' index for June showed a third-straight month of contraction in manufacturing, while one from Caixin and S&P Global unexpectedly rebounded into expansionary territory.

U.S. and China inch closer to a trade truce. The two sides signaled last week that they are making progress on conditional agreements to resume some exchanges of rare earths and advanced technology.

Xiaomi snags more than 200,000 EV orders in minutes. The Chinese smartphone company announced the pre-order figures shortly after it revealed Thursday that the YU7 SUV will sell for less than Tesla's Model Y. Xpeng announced it had in June delivered more than 30,000 vehicles for an eighth-straight month.

Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks inched higher amid mixed trading in the region, as investors digested the latest comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

The CSI 300 index, which tracks the top 300 stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, closed flat at 3,943.68, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index — which includes major Chinese companies — gained 0.62%. The mainland benchmark is up 0.22% year to date, data from LSEG showed.

The latest version of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" could make it cheaper for semiconductor manufacturers to build plants in the U.S. as Washington continues its efforts to strengthen its domestic chip supply chain.

Under the bill, passed by the Senate Tuesday, tax credits for those semiconductor firms would rise to 35% from 25%. That's more than the 30% increase that had made it into a draft version of the bill. 

Companies eligible for the credits could include chipmakers such as Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Micron Technology, provided that they expand their advanced manufacturing in the U.S. ahead of a 2026 deadline. 

The new provisions expand on tax incentives under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which provided grants of $39 billion and loans of $75 billion for U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing projects. 

But before the expanded credits come into play, Trump's sweeping domestic policy package will have to be passed again in the House, which narrowly passed its own version last month. The president has urged lawmakers to get the bill passed by July 4.

Since Trump's first term, Washington has been trying to onshore more of the advanced semiconductor supply chain from Asia, support its domestic players and limit China's capabilities. 

Although tax provisions in Trump's sweeping policy bill expand on those in the Biden administration's CHIPS Act, his overall approach to the semiconductor industry has been different.

Earlier this year, the president even called for a repeal of the CHIPS Act, though Republican lawmakers have been reluctant to act on that front. Still, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last month that the administration was renegotiating some of the Biden administration's grants.

Trump has previously stated that tariffs, as opposed to the CHIPS Act grants, would be the best method of onshoring semiconductor production. The Trump administration is currently conducting an investigation into imports of semiconductor technology, which could result in new duties on the industry.

In recent months, a number of chipmakers with projects in the U.S. have ramped up planned investments there. That includes the world's largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, as well as American chip companies such as Nvidia, Micron and GlobalFoundries.  

According to Daniel Newman, CEO at tech advisory firm Futurum Group, the threat of Trump's tariffs has created more urgency for semiconductor companies to expand U.S. capacity. If the increased investment tax credits come into law, those onshoring efforts are only expected to accelerate, he told CNBC. 

""Given the risk of tariffs, increasing manufacturing in the U.S. remains a key consideration for these large semiconductor companies,"" Newman said, adding that the tax credits could be seen as an opportunity to offset certain costs related to U.S.-based projects.

In this article

Pressure is piling on London's stock exchange, with reports that British pharma giant AstraZeneca may move its listing to the U.S. delivering yet another blow this week.

CEO Pascal Soriot is considering moving the company's stock listing from London to the U.S., British newspaper The Times reported on Tuesday afternoon, citing anonymous sources. Soriot's frustrations with the U.K.'s regulatory environment — particularly rules around new medicine approvals and drug pricing systems — are said to be driving the move.

AstraZeneca declined to comment on the Times report.

The company's exit from the U.K. market would spark a major index re-weighting, given AstraZeneca is the most valuable business listed on London's FTSE 100. AstraZeneca's market cap was £161.2 billion ($221.1 billion) as of Tuesday's closing price, according to LSEG data.

AstraZeneca's potential transatlantic move would add to concerns around London's weakening status as a global financial hub. A number of companies have delisted from the London market or reconsidered plans to float shares in the city over the past year.

Toni Meadows, head of investment at London's BRI Wealth Management, labeled AstraZeneca's rumored listing considerations as ""disappointing"" for the U.K. equity market — but he conceded that ""it is not surprising"" given that it would form the latest development in a wider established trend.

Earlier this year, reports emerged that Chinese fast fashion giant Shein was looking to list in Hong Kong instead of London, when it goes public. Last week, news agency Reuters reported that the company was planning to file confidentially for a Hong Kong IPO.

Metals investor Cobalt Holdings, meanwhile, confirmed to CNBC last month that it had scrapped plans for a London IPO, while British fintech giant Wise announced in June that it was moving its primary listing from London to New York.

Kristo Kaarmann, Wise's CEO and co-founder, said in a statement at the time that the move would help raise awareness of the company in the U.S., while giving the firm better access to ""the world's deepest and most liquid capital market.""

Companies listed in London have historically had much lower valuations than their Wall Street counterparts. Research from British investment manager Rathbones last year showed that the forward price-to-earnings ratio for U.K. stocks was 32% lower than those listed in the U.S. on a like-for-like basis.

On the flipside, the Financial Times reported last week that Norwegian software giant Visma had chosen London for its upcoming debut on the public market.

""Large and important companies like AstraZeneca are seeking a valuation uplift from exposure to a wider investor base and they will get that from moving to a US listing,"" BRI's Meadows told CNBC via email on Wednesday.

""The trend to move listing, or the stream of takeovers for UK listed stocks, highlights value in the UK equity market, but it does nothing to encourage a new supply of companies listing here to support the future standing of the index in a Global context,"" Meadows added.

Claire Trachet, founder of M&A advisory Trachet, said AstraZeneca shifting its listing to New York would represent ""a memorable loss"" for the London Stock Exchange.

""Given the complexity of the company, this isn't simply because of liquidity or valuation advantages often cited by departing firms, rather a trifecta of underperforming capital markets, regulatory constraints, and misaligned incentives that make it harder to scale and reward innovation at home,"" she told CNBC by email.

Trachet added that London-listed companies with a combined value in excess of $100 billion had already made the move to New York in recent years — and AstraZeneca's departure alone would more than double that figure.

""The potential move makes it painfully clear to global markets that the UK is losing its edge on the needs of world-class, scale-driven companies,"" she said. ""This isn't an isolated story — and that's the biggest issue. It's part of a broader shift, where founders and boards are increasingly looking to the US for deeper capital, stronger support, and a more ambitious investor base.""

Tom Bacon, a London-based partner at global law firm BCLP — which has a division dedicated to M&A and corporate finance — labeled reports of AstraZeneca's Soriot's desire to shift away from London ""very worrying.""

""I think this should sound the alarm for the UK government that they need to do more both to support the city and our stock market together with our critical industries like life sciences and pharmaceuticals,"" he said.

Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, on Wednesday said that AstraZeneca's reported plans appeared to be driven by business needs rather than chasing a higher valuation — but he added that moving the company's listing across the Atlantic ""won't be an easy move to pull off.""

""Unlike many other UK market 'defectors' with a dominant US shareholder base like CRH and Flutter, AstraZeneca has a more geographically diverse pool of investors,"" he explained in an email.  

However, Coatsworth noted that AstraZeneca generates around 42% of its sales from the U.S., and already has plans to increase its operational footprint in the country.

Earlier this year, CEO Soriot told CNBC AstraZeneca was ""very committed to the United States,"" where the company has two large research and development centers.

AJ Bell's Coatsworth told CNBC that AstraZeneca's CEO could also see a full U.S. stock listing as a ""stepping stone to receiving better treatment Stateside.""

European pharmaceutical companies are facing uncertainty around their future in the American market, where U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose sector-specific tariffs on drug imports.

While the industry was exempted from Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs plans when they were unveiled in April, the White House leader has since placed the sector under investigation by the U.S. Commerce Department, warned tariffs on pharma are ""coming soon,"" and signed an executive order directing medicine manufacturers to lower the price of some drugs in line with costs paid overseas.

In one move, Santander has silenced months of speculation over it's allegiance to the British high street – and complicated a year-long consolidation saga in Spain's banking sector.

On Tuesday, Spain's largest lender said it agreed to buy British high street lender TSB for £2.65 billion ($3.6 billion) from Catalonia's Sabadell in an all-cash deal subject to approval. The transaction will generate a return on invested capital of more than 20%, bringing its return on tangible equity in the U.K. from 11% last year to 16% by 2028, Santander said.

Acquisitions have been at the heart of Santander's British expansion after it entered the market in 2004 through the purchase of Abbey National. But the profitability of the U.K. branch has faltered — with pre-tax profit down by an annual 38% last year — sparking questions over Santander's long-term presence in Britain. A March announcement of potential layoffs and 95 branch closures did little to abate the rumors despite CEO Ana Botin's frequent denials.

""We never thought of leaving the U.K. The U.K. is very important for us,"" Santander Chief Financial Officer Jose Garcia Cantera told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Wednesday. ""It's actually the largest balance sheet of all the countries [where] we operate. It's a high quality, low-risk business, predictable returns, in hard currency, in sterling, and this helps to stabilize our risk-return profile."" 

He added that the U.K. has ""always been a very important and core component of Santander's diversification strategy.""

The TSB acquisition, meanwhile, ""not only makes sense strategically, as I said, the U.K. helps with our risk-return profile, but it's also financially very, very compelling.""

The deal could work as a defensive play from Sabadell, which only took over TSB from Lloyds in 2015 and seeks to stop a takeover bid from Spanish peer BBVA. The two banks have been locked at odds since Sabadell rejected BBVA's initial all-share merger offer in May last year, on grounds of it undervaluing the acquisition target.

Now entrenched in a potential 14-billion-euro hostile takeover, BBVA has decided to keep its bid alive despite a recent condition from the Spanish government that the takeover may only proceed if the two banks do not integrate their operations for at least three years.

Over this period, ""both entities maintain [must] separate judicial identity and assets, as well as autonomy in the management of their activities,"" Spanish Economist Minister Carlos Cuerpo said during a press briefing, according to a CNBC translation.

Madrid — whose government under Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez depends on parties in Sabadell's home base of Catalonia — has long opposed the deal amid concerns over job losses, received a late-May caution from the European Commission against hindering the merger unduly.

""It is important that banking sector consolidation can take place without undue or inappropriate obstacles being imposed,"" said Olof Gill, the European Commission's spokesperson for financial services, according to Reuters. Spain's antitrust watchdog has already cleared the acquisition. 

It remains to be seen whether the TSB sale will dull BBVA Chairman Carlos Torres Vila's appetite to press ahead with submitting a merger offer to Sabadell shareholders once permissions come through.

RBC analysts on Wednesday assessed that Santander's acquisition of TSB ""seems to be a last major effort to convince [Sabadell]'s shareholders to not accept BBVA's offer during the upcoming take-up period"" and would ""likely further complicate"" BBVA's takeover.

""We are completely neutral on the Sabadell-BBVA transaction,"" Santander's Garcia Cantera told CNBC. ""This is an asset that becomes available in one of the countries where we operate, and it's our fiduciary duty to look at all these opportunities and try to do our best for our shareholders.""

Yet he recognized that competition in Spanish banking at present is ""probably the toughest in Europe,"" citing the weak price of domestic mortgages.

""I don't think this is going to make banking in Spain more comfortable. Probably the opposite,"" Garcia Cantera said.

 Figma has filed to go public in the US, disclosing it holds $69.5 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs and has $30 million in USDC ready to purchase Bitcoin. 

Design software company Figma revealed in a regulatory filing that it owns nearly $70 million worth of shares in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and has set aside $30 million in stablecoins to buy Bitcoin.

Figma filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday to go public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FIG,” with the paperwork detailing the firm's current financial position.

The filing said Figma invested $55 million into the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) on March 3, 2024, and its value stood at $69.5 million with an unrealized profit of 26% as of the quarter ended on March 31.

Figma said it also holds $30 million worth of the stablecoin USDC (USDC), which it intends to use to purchase Bitcoin.

“On May 8, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an investment of  $30.0 million in Bitcoin. Subsequently, the Company purchased 30.0 million USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin, for $1 per USDC totaling $30.0 million,” the filing reads. ”The Company intends to re-invest its stablecoin holdings into Bitcoin at a later date.”

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley applauded Figma for holding 5% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin.

“More and more corporations are going to own Bitcoin as part of their treasury,” he added.

In 2022, the Nasdaq-listed design software giant Adobe looked to acquire Figma for $20 billion; however, the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority knocked back the deal over concerns that Adobe would form a monopoly and that the deal was overvalued.

The transaction was called off in December 2023, with Adobe having to pay $1 billion in cash to Figma as a reverse termination fee.

Demand from companies to hold crypto in their respective treasury reserves has been on the rise in recent months.

On Monday, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, revealed that it had purchased BTC worth $531 million, boosting its holdings to 597,000 BTC.

Meanwhile, Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet bought 1,005 BTC for $108 million, thereby surpassing Cleanspark to become the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not the only asset corporations are flocking to, as firms have started accumulating ETH for their treasury reserves.

Mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies announced that it had raised $250 million via private placement to jumpstart its Ether treasury.

 Bitcoin's bullish outlook strengthens as the US dollar drops 10.8% in its worst H1 performance since 1973. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin could target $170K as global M2 money supply hits a record $55.48 trillion.

BTC price historically lags M2 breakouts, with past patterns suggesting imminent upside.

A weakening US dollar adds fuel for BTC bulls, with DXY down 10.8% in H1 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC) could be on track to reach $170,000 as global liquidity, measured by broad money supply (M2), hits a new record high of $55.48 trillion on July 2.

M2 aggregates US dollar-adjusted liquidity from the US, eurozone, Japan, the UK and Canada. 

When M2 rises, it indicates that more money is circulating in the economy, including in bank accounts, checking deposits, and other liquid assets. Such surplus liquidity can increase capital flowing into “riskier assets” like crypto.

Bitcoin has historically followed global and US M2 supply with a three- to six-month lag, especially during liquidity shifts. In some cases, like the April 2025 breakout above $100,000, the lag was just one to two weeks.

While BTC has rallied during low M2 growth, such moves often prove unsustainable.

In contrast, M2-driven rallies tend to produce longer, more stable uptrends, suggesting the current cycle may be supported by real liquidity, not speculation.

“As global money supply expands, Bitcoin's next target sits around ~$170K, following the flow,” says analyst Crypto Auris.

Multiple analysts have predicted the BTC price to reach the $150,000-$200,000 range by the 2025's end, owing to rising institutional demand via ETFs and corporations.

The growing demand for Bitcoin appears against a weakening US dollar.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) has fallen 10.8% in the first half of 2025, its worst H1 performance since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973. 

In contrast, Bitcoin gained 13.25% in the same period, reflecting a negative correlation with the dollar. 

Historically, major divergences between Bitcoin and the dollar have signaled key trend reversals. 

In April 2018 and March 2022, rising DXY and falling BTC preceded bear markets, while the divergence in November 2020 marked the start of a major rally.

In the current cycle, BTC and DXY have moved almost in lockstep until early 2024. A clear divergence began in April 2025, as DXY fell below 100 for the first time in two years.

If past patterns repeat, this could mark the beginning of a new Bitcoin uptrend. Prolonged dollar weakness could amplify this move beyond Bitcoin's typical cycle behavior.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin wants the crypto industry to grow up fast — stressing that the industry is at an “inflection point.”

Speaking in front of a packed room at the Ethereum Community Conference, in Cannes, France, Buterin used his keynote to deliver a clear-eyed reality check: Decentralization, he argued, must evolve from a catchphrase to a concrete set of user guarantees — or risk becoming another hollow promise.

As the industry has gone mainstream with endorsements from major corporations and political figures, builders need to return to the ecosystem's key ideals surrounding decentralization and building for users' needs, Buterin said.

In his typical jeans and relaxed dark T-shirt uniform, Buterin laid out practical “tests” that he said every crypto project should pass. These include 1) the walk-away test. If the company behind an application disappears, do users keep their assets? And 2) the insider attack test: How much damage can rogue insiders or compromised front-ends cause? And 3) whether it has a trusted computing base: How many lines of code must be trusted to protect users' funds or data?

He warned that too many layer-2 networks, DeFi projects and “decentralized” front-ends rely on hidden backdoors, instant upgrade buttons or insecure interfaces that can be tampered with and hacked.

Even identity and privacy solutions came under his critical eye. Zero-knowledge proofs, he noted, can backfire if users still reveal their entire transaction history when they sign in with centralized providers. Privacy, he added, must flip from being treated as an optional feature to something that reduces data leaks by default. 

It will be 10 years this month since the Ethereum blockchain went live, and Buterin has come under pressure over the past few months from the community to address core protocol issues. If not, the blockchain could lose its edge to competitors.

For Buterin, this next phase in Ethereum's history means building systems that pass the walk-away test, shrink the trusted base of code and resist insider attacks. This includes balancing engineering with simple, robust solutions.

“If we lose that,” he concluded, “Ethereum inevitably just becomes a generational thing, and it inevitably passes like a lot of other things have passed before.”

A new Ethereum Community Foundation aims to fund tokenless projects and boost ETH burning, while criticizing the Ethereum Foundation's political inaction.

Ethereum core developer Zak Cole has launched the Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF), a new initiative aimed at funding “tokenless” projects and promoting ETH burning mechanisms to enhance the digital asset's economic value and institutional adoption.

Cole announced the initiative at the Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes, France, while taking aim at the Ethereum Foundation for its lack of lobbying efforts in Washington DC.

The ECF will only fund projects that are immutable and do not issue new tokens, enforcing a strict tokenless policy to ensure security, decentralization, and alignment with Ethereum's core values.

All supported projects must integrate mechanisms that contribute to the burning of ETH, directly reducing the circulating supply and supporting ETH's monetary integrity and value for holders.

“The Ethereum Foundation won't say it. So we did,” said Cole.

“ETH to $10k is a requirement. Not a meme.”

The Bitcoin dominance remaining on the high side has been one of the major hindrances for the altcoin season. Going by past performances, the Bitcoin dominance would have to crash for altcoins to have a chance to rally, but with the dominance still climbing, the chances of an altcoin season remain slim. As this trend continues, a crypto analyst has predicted a possible turn in the tide for the Bitcoin dominance, predicting a crash that could give altcoins a chance.

Bitcoin Dominance Rejection From Trendline Is Key

Over the years, the Bitcoin dominance has been following a trendline that has often marked the point of resistance. This trendline rises from 2017 and has sloped down past 2021 and now into the year 2025. The significance behind this is the breakdown from the trendline and the Bitcoin dominance receding sharply from here.

Presently, the Bitcoin dominance is still sitting high above 65% at the time of this writing, but this recent rise has seen it touch the resistance trendline. According to crypto analyst CoreCrypto, this is a critical inflection point, especially on the weekly chart. More importantly, this is usually the point where dominance recedes, giving rise to altcoin dominance. 

Some major developments that the analyst tells investors to watch on the dominance chart include a rejection from the resistance trendline, where the dominance currently lies above 65%. There is also support for the dominance, as shown by the yellow line in the chart below. A break below this support is critical for the fall in the dominance.

Another development to watch out for is for rising Ethereum strength. In the past, the Ethereum price starting to outperform the Bitcoin price has often signaled the start of the altcoin season. So, as the ETHBTC chart begins to strengthen and Bitcoin succumbs to sideways movement, it opens the door for altcoins to rally into the next altcoin season.

In the event of a break from the resistance trendline, the analyst sees the possibility of a sharp decline. CoreCrypto predicts a 36.91% drop to the 42%-45% levels. This is lower compared to previous altcoin seasons, but follows the declining trend of a 50.79% drop in 2017 compared to a 45.10% drop in 2021.

“If BTC.D gets rejected from this resistance again, it could mark the start of the long-awaited Altseason 2025,” the crypto analyst explained. “A breakdown from this wedge would likely result in capital rotation from BTC into altcoins — just like in previous cycles.”

Cryptocurrency analyst Benjamin Cowen has argued that an ‘altcoin season‘ has failed to materialize due to monetary policy, liquidity and stubborn Bitcoin BTC/USD dominance.

What Happened: In a podcast published on June 28, Cowen stated, ""Altseason has not happened yet."" 

According to Cowen, a sharp drop in Bitcoin BTC/USD dominance and a relative surge in altcoin performance — the conditions that typically fuel altcoin rallies in coins like Ethereum ETH/USD, XRP CRYPTO: XRP), and Solana SOL/USD — aren't present.

""If you only followed Crypto Twitter, you'd think we're already in our 700th alt season,"" Cowen joked. ""But the data tells a very different story.""

Reviewing historical trends, Cowen noted that true altseasons in 2017 and late 2020 to early 2021 followed clear collapses in Bitcoin dominance, allowing altcoins to outperform BTC on a relative basis. 

""That hasn't happened this cycle. In fact, Bitcoin has continued to dominate,"" he said, referring to this phase as a persistent ‘Bitcoin Season.'

Cowen highlighted that before the last two major alt runs, altcoin-to-Bitcoin valuations dropped to roughly 25% of BTC's market cap. 

“We're nowhere near those levels now,” he explained, suggesting that a reset to those lows might be necessary to ""rip the band-aid off"" and set the stage for a true altcoin cycle.

Why It Matters: Cowen pointed to broader macroeconomic headwinds as the key suppressors of altcoin momentum. 

""We're still in a period of quantitative tightening, and the Fed is holding off on rate cuts,"" he explained. 

""Jerome Powell even acknowledged they're concerned about inflation risk from tariffs, which keeps the door shut on easing.""

Historically, major altcoin rallies have aligned with aggressive rate cuts and liquidity injections, monetary easing that allowed speculative assets to flourish. 

Without that tailwind, Cowen believes altcoins are more likely to bleed lower through September to November, echoing patterns seen in prior cycles.

What's Next: According to Cowen, the setup for altcoins could improve only after a meaningful shift in U.S. monetary policy, especially if the Federal Reserve pivots to rate cuts or renewed liquidity support. 

Until then, Cowen advises caution: ""You probably would have outperformed most of the altcoin market by simply staying Bitcoin-heavy this year.""

The crypto ecosystem crosses a symbolic milestone with the expedited approval by the SEC of the conversion of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) into an ETF. This green light is not limited to Grayscale alone. It marks the entry of altcoins into the regulatory scope. In a context where the political climate is softening towards cryptos, this decision could pave the way for a new generation of ETFs focused on assets like XRP, Solana, or Cardano.

While the approval of many major crypto ETFs was postponed until this summer, on July 1st, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) validated, through an accelerated process, the conversion of the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF).

This change was formalized in a regulatory document, amendment SR-NYSEARCA-2024-87, where one can read : “It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, that the proposed rule change […] be approved on an accelerated basis.”

The fund was previously accessible only via direct transaction for accredited investors. The SEC's approval will now allow its public listing on NYSE Arca, making this product available to individual investors through traditional markets.

The Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund features a notable composition, marking a turning point in crypto ETF structuring. It is distinguished by its multi-asset nature :

This diversity of assets makes the GDLC a vehicle for moderate exposure to altcoins while maintaining a secure base on the two main cryptos.

This hybrid positioning allows the fund to act as a test for regulators, who can observe the gradual integration of other cryptos into listed financial instruments without sliding into overly risky exposure. This configuration, unprecedented in the US market, constitutes a strategic regulatory precedent.

Beyond the approval itself, analyzing sector reactions indicates a possible broadening of the range of spot ETFs to other cryptos.

Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, reacted on social network X on June 30, 2025. He stated that this GDLC approval “could then be followed by approval of individual ETFs for XRP, SOL, ADA, etc.”.

Side benefit for SEC in approving GDLC is that it would provide nice “test run” for addn'l crypto assets in ETF wrapper…xrp, sol, & ada represent < 10% combined of GDLC's holdings.Easy way to slowly step into other assets.

He added that this decision represents an opportunity for the SEC to have a “real-world test for other crypto assets encapsulated within an ETF format.” Furthermore, he highlights that “XRP, SOL, and ADA together represent less than 10 % of GDLC's assets,” a ratio he views as ideal for a gradual increase in exposure.

Such a shift in political atmosphere plays a non-negligible role. Since President Donald Trump's inauguration in January, observers have noted a more favorable climate for the crypto industry within federal bodies.

The SEC is currently examining a series of crypto ETF proposals specifically focusing on altcoins, notably for Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE). The approval of the GDLC could therefore serve as a regulatory precedent, easing the transition to financial products focusing exclusively on these assets.

This momentum could mark a turning point for cryptos beyond the BTC-ETH duo. If the SEC is satisfied with the performance of this mixed fund in public markets, it would then have a concrete argument to justify future approvals centered exclusively on altcoins, as evidenced by the 70 crypto ETFs awaiting its approval this year. However, no decision is guaranteed in the short term, as SEC arbitrations are influenced by political, legal, and systemic considerations.

In a bold move similar to Strategy's $BTC playbook, DeFi Development (formerly Janover) announced a $100M convertible note offering yesterday to fund large-scale purchases of $SOL.

Such a move could significantly boost investor appetite for $SOL. It may also act as a powerful catalyst for top Solana-based altcoins.

A portion of the proceeds raised from the $100M will be allocated toward stock buybacks through a prepaid forward transaction.

Its crypto playbook is similar to Strategy in the sense that it'll sell equity to buy crypto. But the asset of choice isn't $BTC this time around, it's $SOL.

Known as the ‘Ethereum killer,' Solana remains popular among retail and DeFi users. However, it has so far lacked strong institutional backing compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin.

Yet, the market's reaction to the big $SOL announcement wasn't glowing. Within thirty minutes of announcing its plans to accumulate more $SOL on X, DeFi Development's stock price dropped by 9% in after-hours trading.

This sharp decline reveals skepticism among investors who might be wary of $SOL's recent market volatility. Over the past 24 hours alone, its trading volume has dropped by over 40%.

That said, large institutional buy-ins, such as DeFi Development's, could be precisely what $SOL needs to find its footing.

The company's $100M approach, which came after the SEC rejected its earlier attempt to raise $1B $SOL via securities sales, suggests it's in it for the long haul.

If DeFi Development's plan pans out, it doesn't just suggest a rosy future for $SOL but also Solana-based coins like Snorter Token ($SNORT), Grass ($GRASS), and BIO Token ($BIO).

Reason being is that it could drive liquidity, visibility, and developer activity across the entire network.

Don't be fooled by the cartoon aardvark. Snorter Token ($SNORT) is more than just another meme coin; it powers Snorter Bot, an advanced Telegram-based trading assistant launching on Solana in Q3 2025.

Built for speed and precision, Snorter Bot sniffs out the best Solana meme coins, manage your crypto portfolio, and automates strategies seamlessly on a unified Telegram interface.

Boasting the highest speeds and lowest fees at 0.85% on Solana, it's built to outperform competitors like Maestro, Trojan, Banana Gun, and Bonk Bot.

Moreover, it's backed by MEV-protection and 85% accurate rug-pull detection, so you can rest easy knowing that your trades are safeguarded against frontrunning and scams.

It's also getting set to launch across major EVM-compatible chains, as part of its plan to become a multi-chain trading powerhouse.

To deploy the bot on day one, you can purchase $SNORT on presale for just $0.0969. With top exchange listings ahead, it's projected to reach 0.94%, and achieve possibly gains of up to 868%.

Also making waves in the Solana ecosystem is Grass ($GRASS), which is up by over 17% compared to yesterday.

$GRASS attracts the eyes of investors by building the first open, internet-scale web crawl.

In a nutshell, it leverages a network of over 3M users who run nodes to collect vast amounts of public web data for AI models.

It challenges the current landscape, where only a few large companies, such as Google (with Googlebot) and Microsoft (with Bingbot), control extensive web crawling capabilities. Instead, it relies on user participation instead of corporate control.

The initiative seeks to replace these centralized entities by creating a user-owned knowledge graph of the entire internet.

You can contribute by downloading and running the Grass application to share your unused internet bandwidth.

In return, you'll earn ‘Grass Points,' which track your contributions. These points will then be converted into $GRASS, typically through airdrops.

You can also boost your earnings by referring new users to the platform, partaking in community activities, and maintaining consistent uptime for your node.

Get involved by purchasing $GRASS for approximately $1.13 on some of the best crypto exchanges, including MEXC and Bybit.

BIO Token ($BIO) is a multi-chain asset held across Solana, Ethereum, and other major networks. As a result, it offers you broad access to the fast-growing decentralized science (DeSci) movement.

Following the news of DeFi Development's $SOL acquisition, its native token, $BIO, is up by roughly 10%.

Fueling its popularity is BioDAO, a community-governed initiative that funds early-stage biotech and scientific innovations.

Once you hold $BIO, you can vote on grant proposals and help fund promising scientific research. When a project is successful, it may generate valuable intellectual property (IP) or products.

Then, the proceeds flow back into the BioDAO treasury, creating a self-sustaining cycle that continuously funds the next wave of biotech innovation.

By doing so, it aims to challenge traditional, centralized models of scientific funding, which are dominated by governments, universities, and large corporations.

It'll also make science more transparent, efficient, and globally inclusive, unlocking innovation at scale that traditional systems often stifle.

Join the movement by purchasing $BIO on top exchanges like Binance and OKX for roughly $0.05196.

Another day, another company goes all in on crypto. But this time, it's not $BTC or $ETH in the spotlight, it's $SOL.

With DeFi Development pledging $100M toward $SOL purchases, the so-called Ethereum Killer may finally get the institutional attention that it has long been denied.

Despite an initially lousy market reaction following the move, this move could lay the groundwork for heightened buzz across the Solana ecosystem.

If that plays out, the biggest beneficiaries might not just be $SOL but also coins that leverage the Solana network, such as $SNORT, $GRASS, and $BIO.

Don't forget to DYOR and invest only as much as you can afford to lose. This is not financial advice.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Ponzi VCs Are Strangling Blockchain","https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/02/ponzi-vcs-are-strangling-blockchain","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:24:14 GMT","

Web3 promises an internet owned by its users, when in reality, the cash behind it now resembles a carnival barker's till. Regulators are accelerating enforcement, courts are handing down multi-year sentences, and talent is migrating to sectors where equity rewards genuine traction.

Global venture financing declined to $23 billion in April this year, according to Crunchbase data, representing barely a third of its total in March. Yet, a stubborn share of that smaller pie still pours into token deals explicitly designed for rapid exit rather than durable revenue.

Unless capital breaks this fixation on high-velocity token churn, the idealized decentralized future will suffocate under the weight of its own exploitation.

Traditional venture capital (VC) tolerates early losses to cultivate long-term value, while token-centric funds invert that equation entirely.

Liquidity is pulled forward through initial exchange offerings, staking subsidies, and insider unlock schedules, while product-market fit is often put on the back burner — sometimes permanently.

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) case in April highlights this fact quite clearly. The $198 million fraud case, in which the SEC alleged that insiders had siphoned $57 million from investors, all while touting ""risk-free"" yields.

This example is not an outlier but a blueprint, as these structures function as rolling Ponzi schemes that demand a constant inflow of fresh buyers to subsidize yesterday's promised rewards.

When macro funding tightens, there are too few latecomers left to fleece. The result: a graveyard of zombie protocols kept on life support by artificial emissions and empty liquidity pools.

In a healthy network, a token serves as a coordination device that fuels governance, staking, or bandwidth, among other functions. One thing it is not is a golden parachute for insiders.

Despite this, 2025 term sheets routinely demand one-year cliffs and two-year full vesting, effectively guaranteeing early investors a liquid market long before a product ever even reaches beta.

The consequences may have slipped by before, but now they come backed by legislative force.

Criminal liability is no longer hypothetical, as evidenced by a New York federal judge sentencing the co-owner of three virtual-currency platforms to a 97-month prison term after he raised over $40 million on promises of guaranteed returns.

It should come as no surprise that the money was recycled to pay earlier investors and finance personal luxuries. The case turned on classic Ponzi scheme hallmarks, including fabricated trading bots, forged account screenshots, and relentless reference bonuses.

No amount of glossy branding can disguise the emptiness that held it all together. It's a painstaking space to navigate through, as talent drain accelerates, reputational discount compounds, and Web3's social license steadily erodes.

Engineers lured by inflated token grants soon discover that maintaining an abandoned codebase is professional quicksand. Institutional allocators, once happy to sprinkle 5% of a portfolio into digital assets, are quietly writing down those positions and redirecting risk capital to sectors with more transparent accounting. The list goes on…

Each collapse or indictment in Web3 hardens public scepticism and furnishes ammunition for critics who argue that all tokens are thinly veiled gambling chips.

Developers building decentralized identity or supply chain provenance tools are now finding themselves guilty by association. They're forced to justify the very existence of tokens before audiences that no longer distinguish between utility coins and outright scams.

The common denominator among all these determining factors is a funding model that rewards narrative over substance. As long as term sheets treat the tokens as the exit, entrepreneurs will optimize for hype cycles instead of actual user needs.

Code quality will remain an afterthought, and every bull market will give birth to a larger class of disgruntled bagholders in the current state of the industry.

Regulation can raise the cost of hollow token launches, but capital must finish the job.

The European Commission's decision to tighten stablecoin oversight under MiCA, despite the European Central Bank's objections, signals the arrival of adult supervision and a real recognition that consumer protection matters more than maximalist ideology.

Circle's IPO in June raised over $1 billion at $31 per share and doubled its share price on the first trading day. It was just another echo of the same fast-exit dynamics that dominate token rounds that show that even ""mature"" crypto listings still provide VCs with near-instant liquidity.

Precise reserve requirements and pan-E.U. disclosure rules will force issuers to prove collateral rather than continue to print promises.

Limited partners should now demand utility milestones, such as measurable throughput gains, audited security proofs, and real user adoption, before any token unlocks.

Funds that replace 24-month vesting calendars with five-year lockups linked to protocol fee share will filter out rent-seekers and redirect resources to genuine engineering.

Web3 still has potential. It offers censorship-resistant finance, novel coordination tools, and programmable ownership. However, potential is not destiny, and the gears need to turn in harmony and the right direction.

If the money continues to chase quick-flip ponzinomics, the movement of Web3 will remain a slot machine masquerading as progress, while innovators capable of delivering the future steadily walk away.

Break the cycle now so that the next decade can see Web3 fulfill its promise of an internet that serves people, rather than serving them up for Ponzi VCs as exit liquidity.

Your AI policy sleuth, connecting dots between economic decisions and your portfolio's pulse—with a side of snark.

The voluntary carbon market, a critical tool for global climate action, has long been hamstrung by fragmentation, opacity, and skepticism. But a groundbreaking collaboration between S&P Global and JPMorgan's Kinexys unit is now positioning blockchain technology to transform this $200 billion sector into a transparent, liquid, and investor-friendly ecosystem. By tokenizing carbon credits, the partnership aims to unlock trillions in climate finance while addressing systemic inefficiencies that have stifled institutional participation. For investors, this represents a rare convergence of innovation, regulatory momentum, and existential demand.  

Voluntary carbon credits—financial instruments representing avoided or removed CO₂ emissions—are central to corporate net-zero pledges and climate accountability. Yet the market suffers from three critical flaws:1. Fragmentation: Over 30 registries and standards complicate comparability.2. Transparency Gaps: Fraudulent credits and double-counting erode trust.3. Liquidity Constraints: Illiquid markets deter institutional investors seeking scalable, tradable assets.  

These issues create a “greenwashing risk premium” that deters capital, even as demand for credible climate solutions surges. S&P Global and Kinexys' exploratory pilot, set to launch in July 2025, targets these pain points head-on.  

 

The collaboration leverages S&P Global's Environmental Registry—a trusted platform for carbon project data—and integrates it with Kinexys' blockchain infrastructure. The result? A system that turns carbon credits into programmable, tokenized assets, governed by smart contracts and recorded on an immutable ledger.  

Key Innovations:- Standardization: A unified data model ensures credits from reforestation, renewable energy, or carbon capture projects are comparable.- Fraud Prevention: Blockchain's “single source of truth” eliminates double-counting and ensures credits are retired upon purchase.- Streamlined Settlements: Cross-chain capabilities enable frictionless transfers, mirroring the efficiency of traditional financial markets.  

The pilot's success hinges on demonstrating interoperability with existing registries like EcoRegistry and the International Carbon Registry. If achieved, this could establish a global standard, enabling carbon credits to trade as seamlessly as stocks or bonds.  

For investors, the implications are profound:  

Tokenization creates an audit trail, enabling investors to verify a credit's origin, additionality, and permanence. This aligns with growing regulatory scrutiny—e.g., the EU's proposed Carbon Removal Certification Framework—and rising ESG accountability demands.  

By digitizing credits, the partnership taps into institutional demand for “real-world asset” (RWA) tokenization. The RWA market, projected to hit $18.9 trillion by 2033, is increasingly viewed as a bridge between physical assets and digital finance. Kinexys' prior success with tokenized U.S. Treasuries ($1.5 trillion in transactions since 2015) underscores its technical credibility.  

Tokenized credits directly support Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which mandates integrity and transparency in carbon markets. Institutional capital flowing into these instruments could accelerate the voluntary market's growth to over $2 trillion by 2030—a trajectory amplified by corporate net-zero commitments and sovereign climate bonds.  



While the partnership's vision is compelling, challenges remain. Regulatory divergence between regions like the EU and U.S. could fragment standards, while overhyping tokenization may lead to speculative bubbles. Investors should:- Focus on Infrastructure Players: Companies like S&P Global and JPMorgan, with established climate finance expertise, stand to benefit disproportionately.- Monitor Regulatory Developments: Track the EU's Carbon Removal Certification and U.S. SEC guidance on tokenized assets.- Prioritize Liquidity: Seek platforms offering tradable carbon credit tokens, akin to ETFs or futures contracts.  

The S&P-Kinexys collaboration is not just a tech upgrade—it's a paradigm shift. By digitizing carbon credits, they're creating a financial instrument that marries environmental impact with market discipline. For investors, this is a “first-mover” opportunity: a chance to align portfolios with climate goals while capitalizing on a nascent trillion-dollar market.  

The window to position portfolios is narrowing. As the pilot unfolds this summer, institutional investors should act decisively:- Buy SPGI and JPM: Their leadership in standard-setting and infrastructure will command premium valuations.- Explore Carbon Credit ETFs: Products like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) hint at future specialization.- Advocate for Policy Clarity: Lobby for global carbon accounting rules to solidify the market's foundation.  

Blockchain's green revolution is here. The question is no longer if tokenized carbon credits will reshape climate finance—but who will profit first.

While the majority of coins, including Bitcoin (BTC), are in the red following the Senate's passage of President Donald Trump's ‘Big, Beautiful Bill' and escalating tensions between Trump and Elon Musk, PENGU has bucked the trend.

Over the past week, it has risen 56.2%, outperforming the broader market. This has led analysts to speculate that PENGU could be on the verge of a rally similar to what happened with Pepe (PEPE).

Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), a Solana-based meme coin tied to the popular Pudgy Penguins NFT collection, has been on a notable rally for over a week. According to data from BeInCrypto, it was trading at $0.015 at press time. This represented an appreciation of 8.58% over the past day alone. 

At the same time, the total crypto market capitalization has dipped 3.18%, highlighting PENGU's strength in a market otherwise in decline. Moreover, the altcoin has also secured a spot among the top trending coins on CoinGecko.

But what's causing this massive rise? Several factors could be contributing to PENGU's performance. First, the NFT market is showing strong growth overall. According to Artemis data, NFT has been the top-performing sector over the last week, with a 33.8% uptick. 

Additionally, interest in Pudgy Penguins is notably high. As per Cryptoslam, the trading volume of Pudgy Penguins NFTs is up 157% over the past 24 hours.

Meanwhile, institutional interest in the meme coin is also growing. Last week, Cboe BZX filed a 19b-4 form with the SEC to list and trade shares of Canary Capital's proposed PENGU ETF.

“With this filing, the PENGU and Pudgy Penguins NFTs ETF becomes only the second meme coin-style ETF, after DOGE, and first filing with NFTs to enter the SEC's formal review process, joining coins such as BTC, SOL, XRP, and DOGE,” an analyst wrote.

Additionally, PENGU's availability on RevolutApp has significantly increased its accessibility. The mascot's appearance at NASDAQ alongside VanEck, a major asset management firm, has also amplified its visibility. 

Furthermore, the team is preparing to launch a mobile game, Pudgy Party, which could again draw substantial interest.

“Real studio. Real game. Built for a mainstream audience. Penguins everywhere. Don't be surprised when it tops the App Store,” a product designer, Steve, stated.

But that's not all. This increased attention has translated into actual accumulation. On-chain data from Nansen indicated significant whale activity. Over the past week, wallets holding over $1 million in tokens have acquired 240 million PENGU tokens. This is a bullish signal that suggests large investors anticipate further gains.

Amid these catalysts and strong price growth, analysts are drawing parallels to the explosive rally of PEPE, another meme coin that experienced a dramatic surge in 2024.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) highlight optimism, with some market watchers suggesting PENGU's viral potential could mirror PEPE's trajectory. 

“Many aren't ready for what PENGU is about to pull. The similarities with PEPE chart is uncanny. The narrative and momentum is there. The stars have never been so aligned,” an analyst posted.

Another analyst highlighted that the conditions for a short squeeze on PENGU are aligning. This could drive the price of the meme coin even higher.

“Chart looks amazing & funding flipping super negative. Think this rips soon,” he said.

Thus, while the current conditions appear favorable, whether PENGU can sustain its upward trend or replicate PEPE's success remains to be seen.

VIEW ALL

Is Lionel Messi an artist? Plenty of Barcelona, Argentina and Inter Miami fans will tell you that he is. And now you can buy an artwork jointly credited to him at auction.

The piece, Living Memory: Messi – A Goal in Life is credited to Refik Anadol and Lionel Messi and is being listed by Christie's as an NFT (a non-fungible token), a type of digital work.

Christie's aren't underselling the piece, which they describe as “a hybrid of memory and machine, fact and feeling, it collapses the divide between body and data, between the spectator and the moment itself. It functions as a “digital pineal gland,” a portal between the physical and metaphysical, an emotional interface through which the viewer doesn't just remember history but inhabits it.”

They add: “the piece transcends the realm of traditional art, transforming an iconic moment in football history into a living, breathing portal. It is not merely a depiction of the past, but a dynamic architecture of feeling, where raw memory becomes an experiential environment.”

The work uses multiple cutting edge technologies to create an immersive record of Lionel Messi's winning goal against Manchester United in the 2009 Champions League Final. Image courtesy of Christie's. 

The work is an attempt to reconstruct the Argentinian player's goal in the 2009 Champions League Final, when his Barcelona team beat Manchester United in the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. The finish was a rare headed goal for the 5' 7” striker, who is renowned for his dazzling footwork.

The work uses AI in a way that Christie's say ”establishes a benchmark for ethical AI creation”.

And, it can be bought with crypto. Unless you live in mainland China.

Earlier this year, artists protested against a Christies sale of AI art. The sale went ahead and realised more than $700,000, with the auction house celebrating the arrival of a new generation of art buyers.

Refik Anadol is jointly credited with Lionel Messi for the piece. Image courtesy of Christie's. 

This piece is being sold with no estimate at an online-only auction that begins on July 8 and runs until July 22.

The buyer will receive the digital information from the artwork, but not the hardware on which to run it, though the artist will work with them to get the piece installed where they want it.

Refik Anadol is a Turkish-American artist, whose most valuable work thus far is the NFT Machine Hallucinations – Space : Metaverse that was sold for $2.3 million in Hong Kong in 2021.

Crypto World News

July 2, 2025 by Vaigha Varghese 

Have you ever looked back at a missed crypto opportunity and realized the numbers were right in front of you the whole time? The cryptocurrency market is filled with moments that reward early adoption and punish hesitation. Some of the most recognizable tokens today started as unassuming projects trading for mere cents. OKB was one of them. It quietly gained traction post-ICO, only to become one of the most profitable exchange tokens on the market. Today, a new name is emerging in similar conversations. Qubetics is drawing increasing attention following its strong mainnet debut and may soon be viewed in the same tier of market relevance.

Qubetics has not only achieved a swift post-launch surge but also introduced a blockchain architecture that addresses longstanding issues in crypto. Its seamless interoperability, DPoS-based reward system, and real-world usability have positioned it among serious contenders. 

With solid technical metrics, rising market demand, and early analyst sentiment backing a price target of $10 to $15, Qubetics has emerged as a popular crypto coin to buy now. While the broader market weighs its next move, early participants are taking note of Qubetics' rapid progress, raising the question: could this be the next big project after OKB?

OKB's journey stands out in the history of digital assets. Launched by OKEx, one of the top global crypto exchanges, OKB began as a utility token within its ecosystem. Its initial price during the public sale was modest, with early supporters acquiring tokens at a low valuation. What followed was an impressive climb fueled by exchange-backed adoption, token burn mechanisms, and integration into broader trading services. Over the years, OKB evolved from a simple fee-discount utility into a multi-functional asset powering key services across trading, staking, and ecosystem governance.

What makes OKB's growth notable is the consistency of its upward momentum in response to real development and strategic integrations. It has managed to remain relevant through market shifts and regulatory cycles. Even though it started quietly, the coin has cemented itself among the top-tier exchange tokens by demonstrating utility beyond trading. Those who participated early experienced exponential returns. From its humble ICO entry to its highest point, OKB served as a case study in how platform-native tokens can deliver real returns when backed by infrastructure and adoption.

Qubetics integrates a Decentralized Virtual Private Network (dVPN) directly within its ecosystem, offering a privacy-focused infrastructure for blockchain users. The dVPN feature routes traffic through a decentralized network of nodes rather than centralized internet providers, shielding user metadata, wallet addresses, and transaction origins from surveillance or tracking. This model enhances both privacy and security, especially when moving assets across different blockchains.

For example, a user transferring assets between Bitcoin and Ethereum through the Qubetics Wallet benefits from dVPN encryption, which prevents their IP address and transaction activity from being exposed or intercepted. This eliminates the need to rely on third-party VPNs or external tools to maintain anonymity. The integration of dVPN into Qubetics' core structure provides end-to-end privacy, making it an attractive option for those prioritizing confidentiality in their digital activities. The privacy-first infrastructure adds another layer of value to the project, reinforcing its reputation as a popular crypto coin to buy for those focused on secure, decentralized functionality.

Qubetics launched at $0.40 and reached its all-time high of $4.20 within the first 60 minutes. That 950 percent increase or 10.5x return caught immediate attention across trading platforms. Trade volume on MEXC exceeded $700,000 within the first day, signaling strong entry demand. A support level has already formed at $2, showing that this was not a one-time spike but the start of a longer-term trend.

Participants who secured tokens during early distribution rounds at $0.01 saw extraordinary returns. A $10,000 allocation at that stage would have yielded 1 million tokens. At the all-time high, that position would have been worth $4.2 million. These early gains reflect the market's response to Qubetics' fundamentals rather than hype. Delegators with at least 5,000 tokens can begin earning passive rewards from validators, who themselves require 25,000 tokens to participate. With a 30 percent APY, the staking economy further incentivizes network contribution and token retention.

As a top altcoin to invest in this year, its system also introduces simplified cross-chain transfers without KYC requirements or complex bridge configurations. Participants can move between chains securely, cost-effectively, and without waiting for third-party confirmations. The combined utility of passive income, multi-chain support, and institutional-grade performance has made Qubetics a popular crypto coin to buy. Analysts now believe the $10 to $15 price target is realistic based on structural demand and transaction-level functionality.

OKB's rise from a modest exchange token to a widely integrated utility asset demonstrates what is possible when token design meets ecosystem strategy. It showed that a long-term commitment to usability and performance can transform an early investment into a market staple. Now, Qubetics is drawing similar attention, with its mainnet launch performance and wallet infrastructure revealing a blueprint for broad adoption.

With features like 30% staking APY, high-frequency trading volume, cross-chain privacy, and real-time stablecoin conversion, Qubetics is establishing itself not just as a new project but as a functioning ecosystem. Its governance model through DPoS further positions the network for sustained participation, while price levels at support show that early momentum is finding stability. For those tracking performance and real utility, Qubetics is proving to be a popular crypto coin to buy, and one of the top altcoins to invest in this year. As market sentiment turns toward substance over speculation, this project may hold a central role in what comes next.

Quick Summary

This article compared Qubetics and OKB to highlight missed crypto opportunities and emerging potential. OKB started modestly but became a top-performing exchange token through consistent development and ecosystem utility. Qubetics ($TICS), now being recognized as a popular crypto coin to buy, launched at $0.40 and reached $4.20 in its first hour, delivering a 950% return. Its wallet supports DVPN-based cross-chain interaction without KYC, stablecoin conversion at point-of-sale, and a 30% APY for staking via DPoS. With strong buy pressure at the $2 level and analyst targets of $10 to $15, Qubetics is shaping up to be a top altcoin to invest in this year.

Relevant DUA Act Provisions: Section 81 DUA Act: amendment to Article 25(1) UK GDPR to include “children's higher protection matters”

The DUA Act introduces key reforms that reinforce the legal framework protecting children's data online, particularly through amendments to the UK GDPR and the DPA 2018. While it does not directly elevate the ICO's Age Appropriate Design Code (“Children's Code”) to binding legislative status, it enhances the Code's regulatory effect by embedding its core principles into primary legislation.

First, Section 81 of the DUA Act amends Article 25(1) UK GDPR (Data protection by design and by default) to require that, when designing and developing processing systems, controllers must have “particular regard to children's higher protection matters” where their services are likely to be accessed by children. These matters are defined to include:

These statutory elements reflect the substantive content of the ICO's Children's Code but are now expressly required by UK GDPR, even for services not expressly captured by the Children's Code.

Second, although the DUA Act does not amend Section 123 DPA 2018, it reinforces the status of the Children's Code by embedding its themes into primary data protection law and by strengthening the ICO's regulatory basis to consider compliance with the Code in enforcement actions, particularly where breaches affect children's data.

The reform embeds into Article 25(1) UK GDPR a duty to have particular regard to “children's higher protection matters” when designing data processing systems likely to be accessed by children. These matters, defined in the DUA Act and aligned with the Children's Code, include age-appropriate presentation of information, default privacy settings, restrictions on profiling, and minimisation of geolocation. This amendment preserves the general structure of Article 25 but makes it explicitly child-centric in UK law.

The reform expands the regulatory scope: online services with a general audience - such as gaming platforms, social networks, and e-commerce applications - must assess whether children under the age of 18 are likely to access the services. If so, they are expected to implement measures aligned with both the Children's Code and amended Article 25(1) UK GDPR. The DUA Act does not define a numeric age threshold, but services must treat individuals under 18 as children for this purpose, subject to ICO scrutiny of the controller's risk-based assessment.

The DUA Act marks a clear divergence from the EU GDPR, which does not impose a statutory data-protection-by-design obligation specifically focused on children. While codes of conduct under Article 40 GDPR remain voluntary and sector-led, the UK now imposes a baseline legally binding child-specific design obligation across the digital economy. This introduces a two-tier compliance burden for international platforms that must treat the UK's obligation under Article 25(1) as a legal requirement, even where equivalent EU obligations remain interpretive or guidance-based.

The ICO commented on the reform in relation to the DUA Bill, stating the amended requirement to consider “children's higher protection matters” when designing online services likely to be accessed by children aims to strengthen accountability. It noted that:

“The new obligation to consider ‘children's higher protection matters' is specific to organisations falling within the scope of the AADC[Age Appropriate Design Code of Practice]” and requires controllers to take account of these matters…when assessing what are appropriate technical and organisational measures”.

This article is part of a twelve-part series analysing the key legal reforms introduced by the Data Use and Access Act (DUA Act), which came into force on 19 June 2025. The series examines the most significant areas of divergence and convergence between the DUA Act and the EU GDPR, drawing on both the legislation itself and provisional guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Each article provides legal context, highlights regulatory shifts, and offers practical compliance insights. The twelve core areas covered in this series are:

Riyadh, Jul 2 (SPA/APP): The International Camel Organization (ICO) participated in the closing ceremony of the International Year of Camelids (IYC), organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) at its headquarters in Rome.
The global event marked the culmination of a year dedicated to highlighting the importance of camelids in enhancing food security, economic development, cultural heritage, and climate resilience across more than 90 countries.
As a full member of the International Year of Camelids' Steering Committee, the ICO has played an active role throughout the year by supporting awareness in the camel sector.
ICO Founder and Chairman Fahd bin Falah bin Hathleen stated: “Our involvement in the International Year of Camelids has been rooted in our mission to elevate the camel sector on the global stage. Camels are considered a symbol of cultural identity and supporters of rural communities' sustainability and livelihoods. We remain committed to supporting their role across all scientific, cultural, sport, economic, and welfare sectors.”
ICO Secretary General Abdulrahman Alieedan added: “The closing ceremony was an opportunity to reflect on a year of achievements and to look ahead. We are dedicated to ensuring that the momentum built during the IYC continues through international cooperation, knowledge exchange, and strategic partnerships to strengthen camel-based economies and communities.”

Notabene has introduced Notabene Transact for real-time transaction authorisation for regulated entities managing complex digital asset flows.

Notabene Transact is a secure real-time transaction authorisation solution designed for regulated entities managing complex digital asset flows. It utilises the Transaction Authorisation Protocol (TAP) to transform transaction authorisation from a reactive obligation into a strategic growth tool. Specifically tailored for cryptocurrency transactions, Notabene Transact handles multi-party transactions, allowing institutions to scale in a compliant manner and accelerate their operations.

Clear regulatory guidelines are expected to drive institutional adoption; however, the increasing complexity of transactions necessitates robust compliance measures. Institutions will require a powerful authorisation infrastructure to facilitate simplified real-time transactions. Many existing tools fall short in managing today's digital asset flows. Notabene Transact addresses this gap by focusing on practical applications, streamlining multi-party transactions, and automating compliance across various jurisdictions, thereby enabling scalable and compliant real-time transactions.

One key feature of Notabene Transact is its integration of two capabilities: a discovery and verification system that identifies all counterparties within a transaction flow, and a customisable policy engine that automates decisions following an institution's risk appetite, regulatory responsibilities, and established business relationships. This trust-based system facilitates quicker approvals, reduces friction, and increases transaction throughput, thereby promoting growth across international borders.

The Transaction Authorisation Protocol (TAP) is an open-source, decentralised messaging system that, unlike traditional systems such as SWIFT, enables secure, policy-based data exchange across any blockchain or protocol without restricting institutions to closed infrastructures. TAP features an end-to-end encrypted data model, avoids central control, and ensures interoperability within varying regulatory environments. When paired with the Notabene Network, TAP allows businesses to authorise global transactions, scale operations, and adapt to future challenges.

The Bank of Korea's first phase of central bank digital currency (CBDC) experiment, conducted from April to the end of June this year, is estimated to have incurred marketing costs of at least 21 billion won. During this period, about 80,000 deposit token wallets were opened, resulting in an average acquisition cost of about 260,000 won per wallet. Considering the substantial costs incurred even at the experimental stage, it is anticipated that a fierce marketing war for market share will unfold when the Korean won stablecoin market is established in the future.

According to financial industry sources on July 1, each of the seven commercial banks participating in the Bank of Korea's first phase CBDC deposit token experiment executed a marketing budget of at least 3 billion won. This amounts to a simple sum of about 21 billion won invested. The total cost is likely to be much higher when including the Bank of Korea's separate budget.

CBDC-based deposit tokens are evaluated to be similar to stablecoins in that they are designed to maintain stable prices. Given that hundreds of billions of won in marketing costs were invested in a short period during the first test conducted jointly by the Bank of Korea and commercial banks, it is expected that a full-scale competition for customer acquisition will unfold when Korean won stablecoins are introduced domestically.

The financial sector has already begun preliminary work to preempt the Korean won-based stablecoin market. KakaoBank, KB Kookmin Bank, and KakaoPay are accelerating their market entry by successively filing trademarks for various combinations including “KRW.”

This move references global precedents. In the United States, Tether and Circle have successfully launched “USDT” and “USDC,” respectively, establishing a duopoly in the USD-based stablecoin market through early market preemption.

Considering the scale of marketing in the virtual asset industry for customer acquisition, the marketing costs related to Korean won stablecoins are expected to be substantial. Dunamu, the operator of Upbit, Korea's largest virtual asset exchange, invested a total of 75.1 billion won in advertising and promotional expenses and IT operating expenses to attract about 820,000 new customers last year. Bithumb, the second-largest operator, spent 28.5 billion won on advertising and promotional expenses and 163.7 billion won on sales promotion expenses last year.

A financial industry official said, “In the virtual asset industry, early preemption effect is important, so astronomical costs are incurred in securing customers. The stablecoin market is likely to develop in a similar pattern.”

In particular, integrated customer acquisition strategies utilizing existing customer networks and platform business networks are expected to be fully implemented. Shinhan Bank encouraged participation in this CBDC experiment by offering discount coupons for its delivery app “Ttaenggeoyo.” There is a possibility that KakaoPay and NaverPay may consider expanding their payment platforms based on stablecoins, benchmarking Hong Kong's “Li.Pay” model. Li.Pay is a global payment platform that allows users to top up with Tether, link with Apple Pay and Google Pay, and use physical cards at Visa merchants. If a similar model is introduced in Korea, it is observed that stablecoins could rapidly spread as a means of payment in everyday life.

Marketing methods are also expected to become more sophisticated. Beyond simple discount coupons or point accumulation, some operators may consider applying methods such as refunding interest on deposits to consumers. This is predicted as a new incentive that is worth considering, given that the main source of revenue for fiat currency-backed stablecoins is interest income from safe assets such as government bonds.

However, this method may be considered “similar reception” under current law, raising regulatory issues as a prerequisite. The UK has strictly limited private money creation profits and incorporated stablecoins under the regulation of the Bank of England. It is expected to apply a strong monetary unity principle, such as requiring full deposit of reserve assets with the central bank and mandating 1:1 exchange.

The Bank of Korea is also deliberating on designing a system where CBDC and private stablecoins coexist. There are concerns that excessive regulation could stifle the private ecosystem, while overly relaxed regulation could exclude domestic small and medium-sized businesses from global platforms or undermine financial stability.

A high-ranking financial official familiar with the Bank of Korea's situation said, “Extreme regulatory cases like the Bank of England could rather discourage private operators from entering the market,” but added, “However, without regulations, we could become prey to global operators backed by large funds entering the domestic market, so finding a compromise is important.”

Stablecoin firm Circle has applied to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) for a trust bank licence.

If approved, the national trust bank, First National Digital Currency Bank, N.A., would be authorised to operate as a federally regulated trust institution, with OCC oversight. It would also oversee the management of the USDC Reserve on behalf of Circle's US issuer.

Circle aims to strengthen the infrastructure that supports the issuance of USDC, offering digital asset custody services to institutional customers. A federally regulated trust charter would enable Circle to meet requirements under the proposed GENIUS Act legislation, reflecting a step forward in integrating digital assets into the US financial system.

The fintech views the creation of a national digital currency trust bank as a key step in its mission to build a transparent, efficient, and accessible internet-based financial ecosystem. This initiative reinforces the USDC infrastructure and aligns with evolving US regulations on payment stablecoins, which Circle believes can enhance USD adoption, boost resilience, and support the development of neutral financial infrastructure for global institutions.

Circle's OCC application aligns with its goal of seeking key licenses and authorisations in multiple jurisdictions. In 2015, the fintech secured the first NYDFS BitLicense and remains committed to working with NYDFS, a digital asset regulator in the US, to this day. Last year, the company became a stablecoin issuer that complies with the EU's landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, and, recently, it received in-principle approval from the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of the Abu Dhabi Global Market to operate as a money services provider.

The whole initiative follows Circle's IPO, which valued the company at USD 18 billion. Circle offered 14.8 million shares in the IPO, while existing shareholders sold 19.2 million. The IPO terms were revised earlier in the week to offer 32 million shares at a price range of USD 27 to USD 28 per share, up from a previous plan of 24 million shares priced between USD 24 and USD 26.

The currencies available include EUR, GBP, USD, SEK, and DKK. Additionally, users can issue payouts in fiat or stablecoins.

Circle believes that this partnership strengthens the utility of USDC and EURS in Europe, offering businesses more flexibility, speed, and transparency in how they move money worldwide. By leveraging real-time conversions between fiat and stablecoins, users can unlock new efficiencies in cross-border transactions and accelerate their transition into a more inclusive financial system.

USDC is a fully reserved digital dollar, redeemable 1:1 for USD, and backed by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent reserves held at regulated financial institutions. Circle provides monthly attestations of its reserve composition, offering transparency and trust for Ivy's customers. Through its partnership with Circle, Ivy is among the first instant bank payment platforms to enable seamless settlement in USDC or EURC.

Recently, global stablecoin payment volumes reached USD 27.6 trillion, a total that surpasses Visa and Mastercard transaction volume combined in 2024. This highlights the inefficiencies of legacy payment systems and the need to connect Europe's real-time payment rails with stablecoins to make transactions faster, cheaper, and more accessible.

Ivy notes that real-time payment networks and stablecoins are meant to work together, as merchants are already utilising Ivy's global API for instant bank payments. Leveraging Circle's EURC and USDC, Ivy's customers can instantly mint and burn stablecoins from fiat via a 24/7/365 settlement layer. The collaboration reflects a shared commitment to set a new standard for money movement, one that is global and instant.

While the two appear similar, China's digital currency is quite different from the cryptocurrencies many economies are rushing to regulate

When South Korea reportedly halted its digital currency pilot programme this week in favour of stablecoins – cryptocurrencies pegged to a reference asset, typically a fiat currency – it sent shock waves through central banks across the world.

At first glance, stablecoins appear to have similar qualities to the digital yuan or other digital currencies, but there are significant differences in their design, purpose and management.

First piloted in 2020, it had been used in 26 cities for transactions worth a total of 7 trillion yuan (US$977 billion) by June last year.

The digital yuan is largely intended for small domestic retail payments, and it cannot be exchanged for foreign currencies. Its cross-border use is being developed through the mBridge project, coordinated by the multinational Bank for International Settlements.

Unlike the digital yuan, which is entirely under the umbrella of a central bank, stablecoins are blockchain-based and privately issued cryptocurrency tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the United States or Hong Kong dollars. Issuers hold reserve assets, such as US Treasury bills, to back the total value of the tokens at a ratio of one to one.","{'href': 'https://www.scmp.com', 'title': 'South China Morning Post'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=digital+currency","Bitcoin Vs. Stablecoins showdown looms as GENIUS Act nears","https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/bitcoin-stablecoins-showdown-looms-genius-act-nears/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:30:37 GMT","

There's been an unprecedented tailwind in Washington DC this year for stablecoins. From the embrace of the assets by politicians and the industry to the GENIUS stablecoin legislation passing the Senate, 2025 marks an important turning point.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent even tasked stablecoins with nothing less important than ensuring the greenback remains the world's number one currency. “As President Trump has directed, we are going to keep the U.S. the dominant reserve currency in the world, and we will use stablecoins to do that,” he said at the Digital Assets Summit in March.

Which is why it's almost bizarre to realize that stablecoins a descendant of Bitcoin — a decentralized currency designed to level the playing field in a world of rigged centralized banking systems and overzealous governments. Stablecoins and Bitcoin would seem to have two irreconcilable aims — the former supports the existing fiat based financial system and the latter wants to overthrow it.So what happens once the GENIUS Act is enacted? Are we headed for a showdown between stablecoins and Bitcoin? 

FalconX Head of Research David Lawant says that's probably the wrong way to think about it… at least in the short term. 

“Rather than competing, the two can complement each other,” Lawant tells Magazine. 

“As finance becomes increasingly digital, it makes sense to have both a digital fiat equivalent for transactions and a digital gold equivalent for storing value.”

Bitcoin Policy Institute head of policy Zack Shapiro agrees, saying that Bitcoin and stablecoins are “fundamentally different” with non-competing selling points. 

“Stablecoins are dollar-denominated assets that live on blockchains, enabling fiat to move more efficiently over the internet, akin to digitized cash that settles quickly and cheaply. They solve inefficiencies in the traditional banking system, where settlement can take days and involve multiple intermediaries,” he explains. 

While they share blockchain infrastructure with Bitcoin, this is where the similarities end, he adds.

“Bitcoin is a radically new form of money—decentralized, scarce, censorship-resistant, and governed by code, not policy. It's better understood as a digital commodity or a monetary asset like gold, whereas stablecoins are simply tokenized representations of fiat currency, functioning more like payment infrastructure than a new asset class.”

Also read: GENIUS Act reopens the door for a Meta stablecoin, but will it work?

The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which establishes a clear legal framework for stablecoins, is making its way through the US Congress and is expected to reach Trump's desk by August, according to Galaxy Head of Research Alex Thorn.

Following the passage of the GENIUS Act in the US Senate, US President Donald Trump claimed, “This is American Brilliance at its best, and we are going to show the World how to WIN with Digital Assets like never before!”

The bill lays the groundwork for a comprehensive oversight system surrounding stablecoins pegged to the US dollar. A key feature of the legislation is its strict criteria for who can issue these stablecoins: only federally or state-qualified entities, or subsidiaries of insured depository institutions.

It mandates one-to-one reserve backing of stablecoins with US currency or similarly liquid assets, and notably, stablecoins under this bill are excluded from being treated as securities. 

“The GENIUS Act is a reasonable, bipartisan bill that reflects a pragmatic step forward in digital asset regulation,” says Shapiro.

“While stablecoins are already legal under existing US law, the bill would enhance consumer protections […] and would provide long-term regulatory clarity for institutions that want to use stablecoins for payments infrastructure. 

“It's especially valuable in reducing regulatory uncertainty for traditional financial players that are currently hesitant to engage.”

However, Shapiro notes the bill won't have a direct effect on Bitcoin. 

“But its passage could bolster the perception, both domestically and internationally, that the US is embracing digital assets in a bipartisan, rules-based manner,” he says. 

“That perception may generate a modest tailwind for Bitcoin as part of a broader legitimization of the space.”

According to Lawant, Bitcoin and stablecoins will coexist and grow in a mutually reinforcing way. He specifically pointed to Taproot Assets as a development that should be watched closely. Taproot Assets are a way of using non-bitcoin tokens, such as stablecoins, on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Interestingly Tether began on Bitcoin's Omni layer back in 2014.

At the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas in May, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino argued out that channel-based systems like the Lightning Network, and not the layer-2 networks found on alternative blockchains like Ethereum, are the correct approach to scaling.

“Stablecoins also play a key role in expanding Bitcoin adoption,” said Lawant. “For many users, stablecoins' lack of fiat price volatility makes them a more familiar on-ramp to digital wallet infrastructure and maybe even to blockchain-based finance. This can eventually lead them to explore Bitcoin.”

Stablecoin issuers, such as Tether, whose Tether (USDT) stablecoin has grown to more than $150 billion in size, are getting more comfortable with the GENIUS Act, as Ardoino told Bloomberg in May. Tether may launch an offshoot for the US market to ensure compliance with the legislation.

Tether may be the best real-world illustration of how Bitcoin and stablecoins can not only coexist but thrive together. 

The stablecoin issuer is known to put a portion of the interest earned from its US treasury bond holdings and other sources of profit into Bitcoin. 

Pakistan will deploy Bitcoin reserve in DeFi for yield, says Bilal Bin Saqib

Bitcoin is on a collision course with ‘Net Zero' promises

A Tether spokesperson tells Magazine it views “Bitcoin as the cornerstone of a decentralized financial future,” pointing to its accumulation of 100,000 Bitcoin for its treasury and its sustainable Bitcoin mining operations.

“In many emerging markets, USDT has become an essential tool in the face of economic instability and currency depreciation, often serving as a reliable hedge against inflation,” says the spokesperson. 

“While USDT delivers immediate financial stability, Bitcoin represents long-term sovereignty, and I do believe in its long-term role as a global reserve asset.”

Shapiro also sees a similar interplay between the two.

“In the US, stablecoins will likely be used behind the scenes by banks, fintechs, and payment processors to improve efficiency, often without the end-user even knowing they're interacting with blockchain technology. 

Stablecoins may even act as a gateway currency to Bitcoin. Over time, direct consumer exposure to stablecoins and digital wallets could serve as a soft onboarding mechanism to broader digital asset adoption, including Bitcoin. 

“We view stablecoins not as the end goal, but as a foundational gateway toward the broader adoption of decentralized assets like Bitcoin,” says Tether's spokesperson. 

“That's why we invest in Bitcoin and back educational initiatives that equip communities around the world with the knowledge to use digital assets wisely and confidently.”

Outside the US — especially in the global south — stablecoins (primarily Tether) often serve as critical access to US dollars in places where physical cash or bank accounts are unavailable. 

“There, they function as a short-term, low-volatility store of value, while Bitcoin serves as a long-term hedge against local currency collapse or political instability. In that context, stablecoins and Bitcoin complement each other as ‘risk-off' and ‘risk-on' tools for financial sovereignty.”Also read: Unstablecoins — Depegging, bank runs and other risks loom

Opinions differ on what the end result will be as Bitcoin and stablecoins continue to develop alongside each other over time.

More than a decade ago, Jal Toorey proposed that Bitcoin could serve as the standard or ideal basis from John Forbes Nash Jr's concept of Ideal Money against which fiat currencies are measured and incentivized to improve. 

But Bitcoin megabull and Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor has indicated that the ultimate endgame is not a situation where Bitcoin replaces the US dollar.

In a presentation at Bitcoin 2025, The Bitcoin Standard author Saifedean Ammous outlined a potential scenario where Tether eventually holds more Bitcoin in reserve than US dollars or dollar equivalents. 

From this perspective, Tether looks more like the sort of Bitcoin bank cypherpunk Hal Finney once theorized about issuing its own notes against its reserves rather than simply a technology for the propagation of the US dollar. 

It's also similar to Meta's original intention with the Diem stablecoin concept, as it was thought that the digital currency could be backed by a basket of fiat currencies rather than having a simple peg to the US dollar.

“At Tether, we've made Bitcoin a core part of our strategy because we believe in its long-term value. As the hardest form of money ever created, Bitcoin has outperformed every asset class over the past decade, and its adoption as a reserve asset is only accelerating.”

“Its ability to function as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty makes it a natural complement to traditional reserves like gold and US Treasurys,” the spokesperson adds. 

“Saifedean offers a compelling vision of where global finance could be headed, and we agree that Bitcoin will play a central role in that future.”

AllUnity has received regulatory approval from German regulator BaFin as an E-Money Institution, the license needed to launch a stablecoin under the EU's MiCA regulations. AllUnity is a joint venture between Deutsche Bank's asset management arm DWS, Galaxy and Flow Traders. The company plans to launch its EURAU euro stablecoin imminently, 18 months after first announcing the initiative.

“This license is not just a regulatory hurdle cleared, it's a foundational step towards building a truly secure, transparent and compliant digital cross-border payment ecosystem for Europe and global markets,” said AllUnity CEO Alexander Höptner.

The 1:1 backed stablecoin will target fintech, enterprise and institutional use cases including cross border payments and corporate treasury usage.

“AllUnity's Euro stablecoin, EURAU, will enable frictionless, compliant, and transparent value transfer, unlocking real utility for institutions, fintechs, and enterprises across borders,” said Mike Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Galaxy. 

AllUnity will enter a relatively small but growing European stablecoin market.

Despite MiCA coming into force for electronic money tokens a year ago, to date the dollar still dominates stablecoins with 99% of the market. Circle's EURC is the sector leader with a market capitalization of €178 million ($210m), but that contrasts with its $61 billion USDC stablecoin. 

AllUnity is not the first euro stablecoin affiliated with a systemically important bank. Societe Generale FORGE issued its EURCV more than two years ago and was amongst the first wave of MiCA approvals. Its current market capitalization is €41 million. In recent months it has announced several new alliances. 

However, AllUnity's joint venture structure may give it distinct advantages over existing competitors. It brings the benefit of a variety of institutions to help promote the stablecoin. On top of that, Höptner  has an extensive network from his background at Börse Stuttgart and Börse Stuttgart Digital, one of the first institutional crypto offerings.

We plan to publish an article on AllUnity next week as part of our Ledger Insights Pro offering, following a recent interview with Höptner.

 Binance CEO Richard Teng said crypto aligns with Bhutan's happiness-first policy, highlighting financial freedom and innovation during a visit to the Himalayan kingdom. 

Binance CEO Richard Teng said cryptocurrency and digital asset technology can support the Kingdom of Bhutan's unique development philosophy, known as Gross National Happiness (GNH), during a visit to the Himalayan kingdom.  

During a media roundtable at the Binance Crypto-Powered Tour in Bhutan, Cointelegraph asked Teng how crypto culture aligns or conflicts with the country's unique identity, which is rooted not in economic output, but in well-being.  

Teng said the values of crypto align with Bhutan's GNH and approach to well-being.  

“Fundamentally, it's the same,” Teng said. “At the end of the day, crypto is about financial freedom and financial inclusion. It solves a lot of problems. And ultimately, it brings up the well-being of a person.”

Bhutan's GNH model, introduced by the country's fourth king in the 1970s, emphasizes collective happiness over economic growth and is central to Bhutan's national identity

According to GNH Centre Bhutan, the concept is a sustainable approach to development. It “balances material and non-material values with the conviction that humans want to search for happiness.” This means emotional and spiritual well-being is embedded into the Himalayan kingdom's way of life.

At first glance, crypto's high-paced, often speculative nature might seem at odds with such grounded principles. Still, Teng argued that the technology underlying digital assets can help uplift individuals and communities, especially in regions with limited access to financial services.

Teng said he has met individuals around the world who have achieved financial independence through crypto assets, especially in underbanked regions.

He said that Bhutan's crypto approach may lead to similar results. “The people here, His Majesty and the Kingdom of Bhutan, are believers in innovation,” Teng said, adding that the Bhutanese believe crypto can uplift people's well-being and general happiness.  

He added that as the country embraces digital assets, crypto adoption will lead to more foreign investments flowing into the country, maintaining high happiness levels in “the Kingdom of Happiness.”

Related: Bhutan's DHI to offset halving effects with Bitcoin mining upgrade

Bhutan's government, led by its monarch, King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, has embraced digital assets as part of its development strategy. Under the administration, the country is engaged in projects like hydro-powered Bitcoin mining and setting up a crypto reserve.

The country has also been quietly accumulating Bitcoin (BTC), with figures showing that it holds over 13,000 BTC. Data tracker Bitbo shows that the country's stash makes it the fifth-largest Bitcoin-holding country, surpassing even El Salvador. 

In May, Bhutan also adopted crypto payments via Binance, targeting crypto holders to boost tourism. While the country is eager to adopt payments in digital assets, it must overcome difficulties like shaky internet connectivity, which can impede local crypto adoption.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is planning distributed ledger technology (DLT) for financial settlement, which shows a good intention to modernize the Eurozone's financial infrastructure.

How will they do it? Through a ‘dual-track strategy' that explores immediate and long-term applications of DLT. While the developments will bring novel technology into traditional finance, the conversation around Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) also intensifies.

It begs several questions, mostly regarding financial autonomy and privacy, especially when contrasted with solutions like Best Wallet.

The ECB's dual-track strategy involves two distinct initiatives, ‘Pontes' and ‘Appia'.

1. The Short-term Track (Pontes)

It links DLT platforms and existing TARGET Services for the settlement of wholesale transactions in central bank money.

This approach seeks to leverage DLT to improve efficiency and security within the current financial framework.

2. The long-term vision (Appia)

It shapes a future-ready, innovative, and integrated financial ecosystem within Europe and eventually globally.

This long-term track suggests a more fundamental rethink of the market infrastructure. Which potentially invites tokenized assets and more sophisticated DLT applications.

The duality in approach shows a forward-looking perspective on digital assets.

Simultaneously, central banks (including the ECB) are actively investigating and developing CBDCs. The digital euro, for instance, wants to have a foundation by October 2025.

You might argue that CBDCs are more secure and efficient, and might replace cash in an increasingly cashless society. Their goal – to enable faster interbank settlements, improve cross-border payments, and strengthen monetary sovereignty, of course.

But. And there's a big but here.

The push for CBDCs comes with some significant privacy concerns. For one, centralized control from banks—they'll theoretically see all your transactions and potentially impose limitations on your account.

These contrast sharply with the inherent privacy and control offered by self-custody solutions like Best Wallet (one of the leading non-custodial crypto wallets).

CBDCs inherently allow for surveillance and potential control over your financial transactions. This doesn't happen with cash or decentralized crypto transactions. And it's also where Best Wallet's self-custody solution shines, offering true financial freedom.



Best Wallet is a non-custodial platform that puts the control back into your hands. No more third parties that can freeze or control your transactions, it's all you.

You also eliminate third-party risk, no longer worrying about hacks or insolvency affecting CEXs. Best Wallet made our list of top anonymous crypto wallets for its security, including its Fireblocks MPC, which splits your private key into several shards shared between several parties.

Think of Best Wallet as your vehicle to complete financial control. The Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the key that unlocks a world of exclusive benefits.

Holding $BEST offers significantly reduced transaction fees. You'll also get enhanced staking rewards, which maximizes your earnings on your staked assets, and early access to high-potential crypto presales in the ‘Upcoming Tokens' section.

With this, you can be among the first to invest in promising new projects, potentially front-running the market.



Furthermore, you'll receive priority access to new features like the Best Card, which will allow you to seamlessly spend your cryptocurrency anywhere Mastercard is accepted. In the future, you'll also gain governance rights, influencing the future direction of the Best Wallet platform as the ecosystem evolves.

The ECB's DLT and CBDC advancements aim to modernize finance but raise privacy concerns. Best Wallet offers a self-custody alternative, providing financial freedom and control over your digital assets.

Holding $BEST unlocks even more benefits, providing further incentive. As finance evolves, understanding the implications of centralized versus self-custody solutions is crucial.

Dogecoin DOGE$0.1718, the world's largest meme cryptocurrency by market value, has regained some poise, having formed a bullish double bottom pattern during the overnight trade.

DOGE has gained over 2% to over 16 cents since early Asian hours, reversing part of Monday's slide from 16.63 cents to 15.67 cents, according to data source CoinDesk.

Per CoinDesk's AI research, the cryptocurrency formed a ""double bottom pattern"" around the 15.7-15.8 cents zone with above-average volume. The bounce is consistent with the recovery in market leader bitcoin BTC$109,417.33, which has bounced to $107,000 from the overnight low of around $105,200.

The double bottom forms after a notable sell-off and is characterized by two bottoms at approximately the same level, separated by a brief recovery. An eventual move above the high logged during the interim recovery, as seen in DOGE's case, is said to confirm a bearish-to-bullish trend change.

While the intraday momentum has shifted bearish, the broader bearish lower highs pattern, representing a consistent downtrend since the second half of May, remains intact.

The daily price chart indicates that a convincing move above the lower high of 17 cents, established over the weekend, is required to invalidate the broader bearish setup.

This is a daily technical analysis by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Bitcoin BTC$109,417.33 bulls are optimistic that the U.S. dollar's broader sell-off will continue in the second half of the year, fueling the crypto bull run.

However, one chart warrants caution when relying on bearish dollar predictions. That's the dollar index's weekly chart, which shows the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) is on track to cross below the 200-week SMA in the near term, forming the notorious death cross.

While the ominous-sounding pattern is widely regarded as a long-term bearish signal, historically, it has proven to be a bear trap, consistently marking bottoms and bullish trend reversals in the US dollar.

The chart below shows that DXY has chalked out four weekly chart death crosses since 2009, and each of those marked the end of downtrends (marked by vertical lines), setting the stage for sharp rallies. 

The last one occurred in January 2021, marking the bottom at around 90. The dollar caught the bid in the subsequent months, with the index eventually hitting a high of over 114.00 in September 2022.

Note that price patterns do not always unfold as expected, meaning the impending death cross may not necessarily trap bears; however, being aware of its past tendency can help traders manage their positions more effectively.

The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, tanked by 10.78% in the first half of the year, its worst performance since 1991.

Is It Bullish for BTC or Inflation?","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/02/u-s-m2-money-supply-hits-record-high-of-nearly-usd22t","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 09:34:09 GMT","

A comprehensive measure of money circulation in the U.S. has risen to new highs, a signal of economic growth that posts contradictory messages for the path of bitcoin BTC$109,417.33.

The M2 money supply, which includes hard currency and bank and money market mutual fund deposits that are relatively liquid, rose to a record $21.94 trillion at the end of May, topping the previous peak of $21.72 trillion in March 2022, according to data source barchart.com. Year-on-year growth rate matched April's 4.5%, which is also the highest in nearly three years, according to data source Yahoo Finance.

For cryptocurrencies, the message is muddled. Typically, a growing money supply is taken as a signal of looser financial conditions and a growing economy that promotes greater investor exposure to riskier assets. 

On the other hand, money supply growth can lead to inflation if it outpaces the economy, according to Cyprus-based TIOmarkets. Inflation concerns could reduce investor risk-taking and pressure the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.

In recent years, a rising M2 has had a lagged impact on the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation. The PCE began rising in February 2021, a year after M2 growth began soaring in February 2020 and followed the M2 growth lower in 2023, St. Louis Federal Reserve noted in a blog post.

If history is a guide, the ongoing uptick in the M2 growth rate could contribute to inflation in the coming months, making it more challenging for the Federal Reserve to cut rates to as low as 1%, as recently called for by President Donald Trump.

 The Bitcoin halving cycle is unlikely to hurt the BTC price in the second half of 2025 due to strong ETF and corporate buying, Standard Chartered forecasts. 

Global bank Standard Chartered is bullish on Bitcoin for the rest of the year, citing increasing corporate treasury buying and strong exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows.

Standard Chartered expects Bitcoin (BTC) to print new highs of $135,000 by the end of the third quarter and then break $200,000 by the end of the year, the bank's digital asset research head, Geoff Kendrick, said in a Wednesday report shared with Cointelegraph.

“Thanks to increased investor flows, we believe BTC has moved beyond the previous dynamic whereby prices fell 18 months after a ‘halving' cycle,” Kendrick said, adding that the common halving trend would have led to price declines in September or October 2025.

The latest report reinforces Standard Chartered's bullishness on Bitcoin, with the bank expecting it to hit $500,000 a coin by 2028.

In his new analysis, Standard Chartered's Kendrick focused on the potential impacts of the Bitcoin halving cycle, a price pattern associated with BTC halving events, which occur about every four years.

Cutting the Bitcoin mining reward by 50% each halving, BTC halving events have been historically linked to both subsequent spikes in the price and further corrections.

While the two previous halving cycles in 2016 and 2020 led to Bitcoin prices falling in about 18 months after the halving, the impact of the latest Bitcoin halving in April 2024 will likely be different due to new drivers like strong ETF and corporate buying, Kendrick suggested.

“We expect prices to resume their uptrend, supported by continued strong ETF and Bitcoin treasury buying,” Kendrick wrote in the update, emphasizing that both of these drivers were absent in the previous halving cycles.

At the same time, Standard Chartered still doesn't rule out that the price could be somewhat choppy in late Q3 and early Q4 amid concerns about the correction pattern from the previous halvings.

Kendrick's latest insights on the bullish impact of ETFs and corporate buying against the pressure from the halving cycle came as spot Bitcoin ETF flows turned negative after 15 days of inflows.

According to data from SoSoValue, US spot Bitcoin ETFs posted $342.3 million of outflows on Tuesday, marking their first outflows since June 6. The outflows accounted for 7% of the total $4.8 billion inflows seen in the 15-day run.

According to Kendrick, Bitcoin ETF flows and corporate treasury buying totalled 245,000 BTC in Q2. “We expect that level to be exceeded in both Q3 and Q4,” he added.

 Figma has filed to go public in the US, disclosing it holds $69.5 million worth of Bitcoin ETFs and has $30 million in USDC ready to purchase Bitcoin. 

Design software company Figma revealed in a regulatory filing that it owns nearly $70 million worth of shares in Bitcoin exchange-traded funds and has set aside $30 million in stablecoins to buy Bitcoin.

Figma filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday to go public on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FIG,” with the paperwork detailing the firm's current financial position.

The filing said Figma invested $55 million into the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB) on March 3, 2024, and its value stood at $69.5 million with an unrealized profit of 26% as of the quarter ended on March 31.

Figma said it also holds $30 million worth of the stablecoin USDC (USDC), which it intends to use to purchase Bitcoin.

“On May 8, 2025, the Board of Directors approved an investment of  $30.0 million in Bitcoin. Subsequently, the Company purchased 30.0 million USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin, for $1 per USDC totaling $30.0 million,” the filing reads. ”The Company intends to re-invest its stablecoin holdings into Bitcoin at a later date.”

Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley applauded Figma for holding 5% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin.

“More and more corporations are going to own Bitcoin as part of their treasury,” he added.

In 2022, the Nasdaq-listed design software giant Adobe looked to acquire Figma for $20 billion; however, the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority knocked back the deal over concerns that Adobe would form a monopoly and that the deal was overvalued.

The transaction was called off in December 2023, with Adobe having to pay $1 billion in cash to Figma as a reverse termination fee.

Demand from companies to hold crypto in their respective treasury reserves has been on the rise in recent months.

On Monday, Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, revealed that it had purchased BTC worth $531 million, boosting its holdings to 597,000 BTC.

Meanwhile, Japanese Bitcoin treasury firm Metaplanet bought 1,005 BTC for $108 million, thereby surpassing Cleanspark to become the fifth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not the only asset corporations are flocking to, as firms have started accumulating ETH for their treasury reserves.

Mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies announced that it had raised $250 million via private placement to jumpstart its Ether treasury.

 Binance Pay and Lyzi team up to bring crypto payments to over 80 businesses across the French Riviera, spanning Cannes, Nice, Antibes and Monaco. 

Binance Pay has partnered with French fintech Lyzi to enable over 80 businesses across the French Riviera to embrace cryptocurrency payments, according to a Wednesday press release.

The rollout, spanning cities including Cannes, Nice, Antibes and Monaco, would integrate digital assets into the region's luxury tourism and retail economy. The French Riviera, also known as the Côte d'Azur, is a popular tourist destination.

The partnership gives visitors and locals the ability to pay with stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies at a wide range of establishments, including hotels, restaurants, beach clubs, luxury retailers and service providers.

By scanning a QR code and confirming a transaction, customers can settle their bills instantly without incurring gas fees. Meanwhile, merchants benefit from immediate euro settlement through the system's integration, the press release said.

City officials in Cannes have been vocal in encouraging crypto adoption among local merchants. Earlier this year, Cannes Mayor David Lisnard urged local businesses to start accepting cryptocurrency payments alongside euros, warning they risk missing out if they don't adapt.

“A quick message to inform you that we will be encouraging and especially training Cannes merchants in the integration of cryptocurrencies for payments, as part of our Web3 strategy,” Lisnard announced via a message posted (in French) on LinkedIn.

Binance Pay said the payment system supports over 100 cryptocurrencies, including euro and US dollar-backed stablecoins, while also delivering robust security features such as encrypted transfers, two-factor authentication and real-time confirmations.

“The adoption of crypto payments in a world-class destination like the French Riviera shows that digital assets are becoming part of everyday life,” said David Princay, CEO of Binance France.

Venues including the JW Marriott and Hotel Gray d'Albion in Cannes, beach clubs like Palais Stéphanie Beach, and luxury retailers including Parker and Smith in Monaco now accept crypto payments. Wellness-focused businesses like Palm Gym in Antibes have also joined the initiative.

To support the rollout, Binance Pay launched a promotional campaign running until Sunday, offering shoppers a 5 EURI (a MiCA-regulated stablecoin pegged to the euro) reward for eligible purchases of at least 20 euros in crypto.

Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for comment but had not received a response by publication.

Bhutan also recently embraced crypto for tourism with the launch of a payment system in partnership with Binance Pay and DK Bank. The initiative allows travelers to use over 100 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and BNB (BNB), to pay for hotels, tickets, and local services through simple QR code payments.

In May, Thailand announced plans to let tourists spend cryptocurrency by linking their digital assets to credit cards, enabling seamless local purchases with merchants receiving Thai baht without knowing crypto was used.

How China Could Win the Race to Return Rocks from Mars

Launching in 2028, China's Tianwen-3 Mars sample return mission could bring Red Planet rocks back to Earth as early as 2031—years ahead of competing U.S.-European efforts

By Andrew Jones edited by Lee Billings

China's first Mars rover, Zhurong, with its Tianwen-1 landing platform, which touched down on the Red Planet in May 2021. The mission's success aided China's development of the more ambitious Tianwen-3, which is a Mars-bound sample-return mission slated to launch in 2028.

Xinhua/Alamy Stock Photo

On May 14, 2021, China's Tianwen-1 lander plummeted from space to streak through the skies above Mars's vast plain of Utopia Planitia, with an aeroshell protecting it from the heat and plasma of its high-speed atmospheric entry. After unfurling its parachutes and pulsing its engines to zero in on an amenable landing site, the spacecraft touched down safely onto the Red Planet, where it deployed a rover, Zhurong, to explore the surrounding alien landscape. This engineering feat was hugely significant, confirming China as a major player in planetary exploration. With Tianwen-1's touchdown, China became the only other nation ever to successfully land on Mars besides the U.S. Moreover, the mission also paved the way for a far more ambitious and unprecedented project.

That project, Tianwen-3, is set to launch via two Long March 5 rockets from Wenchang spaceport on the Chinese island of Hainan in late 2028. One launch will carry Tianwen-3's lander, while the other will transport the mission's Mars orbiter, which is also an Earth-return vehicle. The mission aims to collect samples of Martian rock and soil for delivery back to Earth, where subsequent studies could, potentially, redefine our understanding of life itself and our place in the cosmos.

“Tianwen-3 will be the first mission aiming to bring back material from another planet to search for signs of life,” says Li Yiliang, a professor of astrobiology at the University of Hong Kong and one of the authors of a paper published in Nature Astronomy on June 19 that offers new details on the mission. (Tianwen-2, another Chinese sample return mission, launched in May 2025 but is bound for a near-Earth asteroid as well as a comet; China has also pulled off two successful lunar sample return missions, Chang'e 5 and Chang'e 6.)

Tianwen-3 will use the same approach as Tianwen-1 to make planetfall in a yet-to-be-selected landing area. The vagaries of spacecraft engineering, however, demand the site should be somewhere in the midlatitudes of the planet's northern hemisphere; it also must be at an altitude of at least three kilometers below the planet's average elevation so that more of Mars's thin air can serve to slow Tianwen-3's descent. The lander will use proven tech from China's lunar explorations, drilling as deep as two meters for subsurface samples and scooping up material from the surface. Additionally, a helicopter drone—following the lead of NASA's pioneering Ingenuity flights—will collect selected additional rock and loose particle samples from within around 100 meters of Tianwen-3's landing site.

The lander will operate for around two months on the surface, in which it will use scientific payloads such as a ground penetrating radar and a Raman spectrometer to gather more data on the broader geological context for collected samples. When the time comes, it will fire off a solid rocket booster to send a canister containing at least 500 grams of material into Mars orbit to dock with the waiting orbiter-returner spacecraft. The eventual return trip should bring Tianwen-3's samples home sometime in 2031.

Once on Earth, the samples will be swiftly secured and transported to a custom-built Mars sample laboratory, where they'll be extensively analyzed while carefully following “planetary protection” policies meant to prevent any potential otherworldly cross-contamination.

Although Tianwen-3's objectives range from investigating Mars's interior to studying its wispy atmosphere, scientists working on the mission are most eager for what it might reveal about the planet's possible former or even extant life. If, in fact, anything ever dwelled on the Red Planet, then Tianwen-3's samples could conceivably contain various telltale signs of its presence—so-called biosignatures.

A convincing biosignature could come in different types, Li says. For example, Tianwen-3's scientists will be seeking molecules directly produced by Martian organisms to fulfill known biochemical functions, akin to the DNA and RNA molecules that life-forms on Earth rely on to store and transmit genetic information. Another biosignature is biogenic isotope fractionation—the distinctive way that living organisms alter the natural ratios of stable isotopes in their ecosystems; on Earth, for instance, biochemical processes such as photosynthesis prefer the lighter carbon-12 rather than heavier carbon isotopes, leading to detectable shifts in the proportions of these isotopes with respect to the surrounding environment. A third approach, Li adds, would be to look for fossil evidence, such as the imprints that microbes may leave behind in mudstones and other fine-grained sedimentary rocks.

China's astrobiological focus for its Martian explorations is “a laudable, ambitious goal,” says Mahesh Anand, a professor of planetary science and exploration at the Open University in England. “This is exactly what we have been recommending over the years: to look for any signs of biogenic activity or even just to understand that there was a habitable environment. The rest of the global planetary science community would love to get answers to these questions.”

China's approach is simpler in many ways than the U.S.-led Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission, which is a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA). MSR's workhorse, NASA's Perseverance rover, is already on Mars, where it has spent more than four years collecting dozens of carefully selected samples from Jezero Crater, a diverse site harboring an ancient river delta and other complex geological features that may preserve evidence of past life. In contrast, Tianwen-3's sampling will be limited to its immediate surroundings, which will probably be more drab—because although a boring, flat landscape may be of less astrobiological appeal, it is far easier to land on. And the spacecraft's landing ellipse—the area within which Tianwen-3 is most likely to touch down—spans some 50 by 20 kilometers, meaning a precision touchdown to visit any especially alluring targets is highly unlikely.

But, largely because of its greater complexity and cost, MSR is under threat of cancellation from the Trump administration following years of delays and cost overruns. The project's potential elimination, however, would be only one of many grievous blows to NASA's science, the funding for which the Trump administration has proposed to cut by nearly half.

“The reason why NASA went with Perseverance as this first step was so that you would have this curated, intentionally selected and well-recorded process and contextual process of where these rocks came from,” says Casey Dreier, chief of space policy at the Planetary Society, a U.S. space science advocacy group. “This isn't intended in any way to denigrate the achievements of the Chinese robotic program, but in general I think you can characterize a lot of [its] framing as symbol-driven and capability-focused over the direct science return.”

China's more basic engineering-led plan, with the science trailing after, may put limits on the questions Tianwen-3 can realistically answer. But this methodical, step-by-step approach to progressively building and demonstrating critical capabilities is exactly what has now positioned China to take the lead in the race to return rocks from Mars. Meanwhile, the far more elaborate MSR has floundered.

Dreier says that this moment, in which the U.S. appears to be ceding leadership in this area to China, will have implications for global space exploration.

“The U.S. needs to lead and work with its allies to continue to invest in these big, bold efforts to make potentially historic discoveries,” Dreier says. If the White House has its way, he adds, then Perseverance's samples might only find their way back to Earth after an even more complex, expensive and distant human spaceflight program led by SpaceX lands astronauts on Mars. Which means, for now, China will get its shot at a major first in space exploration.

“The way I look at it is that China is starting to explore Mars,” Anand says. The richer science on offer from a complex MSR-style plan is enticing, he says, but sticking to simplicity and clearly achievable near-term results “probably has a higher chance of returning science than planning on something that might take decades.”

U.S. and European scientists have for generations seen obtaining samples as a “holy grail” for Mars exploration. For China, retrieving Martian material fits into the strategic framework of its broader, solar system-encompassing Tianwen program, the name of which translates to “heavenly questions.” Beyond Tianwen-3 and its already-launched asteroid-and-comet-bound sibling Tianwen-2, there is also Tianwen-4, slated for liftoff around 2029, which will target the Jupiter system and its intriguing Galilean moon Callisto. Future missions in the Tianwen series, including to the ice giants Uranus and Neptune, are also under consideration.

For Li, Tianwen-3 remains the Tianwen program's most compelling project, in part because its path to Mars and back is so straightforward; although lofty, its objectives still appear eminently within reach. “It is important for humanity to understand its position in the solar system and the universe,” he says, because this would mark a profound milestone in human history. And, on the threshold of attempting to bring back the first samples from Mars—with the possibility of finding the first-ever evidence for alien life within them—China is now uniquely poised to achieve this milestone.

For Dolphins, Echolocation May Be More Like ‘Touching' Than ‘Seeing'

Dolphins seem to “feel” their way across the sea with narrow, sweeping beams of sonar

It's midnight in a pitch-dark parking lot. Trying to unlock your car, you fumble and drop the keys. You squat down and run your hand across the invisible pavement. To the left, you feel a firm, rubbery tire. Reversing course, you pass over jagged pebbles and papery leaves. Finally your fingers discover—and instantly close around—a notched piece of metal. This kind of tactile exploration may be the closest we can get to imagining the experience of dolphin echolocation, say the authors of a study on dolphin brains that was recently published in PLOS ONE.

We typically imagine echolocation as “seeing” with sound—experiencing auditory signals as a world of images like the ones our brains typically create with light from our eyes. Like sonar, which turns sonic waves into visual representations, echolocators emit sounds and then decode spatial and textural information in the echoes that bounce back. And when Russian scientists inserted electrodes into the heads of dolphins and porpoises in the 1970s and 1980s, they reported detecting brain activity in the visual cortex while the animals heard sounds. “It made a neat little story because you have visual and auditory [brain regions] right next to each other,” says Lori Marino, a neuroscientist and president of the Whale Sanctuary Project, who was not an author of the new study but is mentioned in its acknowledgments section. She adds, however, that thanks to today's more precise technology, “the whole [research] landscape is changing.” Although we still can't translate echolocation perfectly into human terms, the new findings suggest a better metaphor: “touching” with sound.

Dolphin echolocation functions in the brain differently than human echolocation, which, for those who learn the skill, is primarily processed in the visual cortex. To pinpoint the neural mechanisms behind the dolphin variety, the researchers compared preserved brains from three echolocating dolphin species with that of a sei whale, which is closely related but doesn't echolocate. They measured the diffusion of the movement of water molecules along nerve fibers—like cars along a highway, as Marino puts it—to better understand which parts of the brain interact in living dolphins and in sei whales. Contrary to the earlier Russian research, there seemed to be nothing exceptional occurring in the dolphins' visual cortex. Instead an entirely different stretch of neural highway caught their attention: the one linking the inferior colliculus to the cerebellum.

In dolphins, as in humans, the inferior colliculus is a relay point for auditory input after it enters the ear, and the cerebellum is where information from senses and bodily movements gets combined to rapidly calculate the body's next best move. “Anytime you need to move quickly, decisively, and without consciously deliberating, your cerebellum comes alive,” says Peter Cook, a comparative neuroscientist at the New College of Florida and senior author of the new study. He and his colleagues found a strong connection between these two brain structures in the dolphins but not in the sei whale. So just like touch does in humans, echolocation seems to rely heavily on the cerebellum's precise motor control and the tight feedback loop it promotes between sensation and motion—and less so on the visual cortex. “Every time you move, you get different feedback,” Cook says. “And every time the feedback changes, you change how you're moving. It's like this constant circle of sensory, motor, motor, sensory.”

This makes sense to lead author Sophie Flem, a master's student at the New College of Florida. If you need to constantly fine-tune your movements to home in on prey, Flem says, “it does seem intuitive that something like a cerebellum would really help.” And there's another way in which echolocation seems more like touch than vision: a dolphin's sonar beam is far narrower than our visual field. Whereas we take in 180 degrees at a glance, dolphins move their beam around and build spatial understanding gradually—like a human groping for dropped keys in the dark. Still, it would be hubris to presume we know for certain what an animal's echolocation actually feels like. “There may be things other animals do for which there is no model in our sensory system,” Marino says. “We just have to realize that.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Are Trying to Rebuild Humanity From Raw Genetic Code","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65255851/synthetic-genome/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Creating a synthetic human genome has the possibilities of improving human healthspans, but it also comes with extremely dangerous consequences.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The ethical duality of scientific discovery is nothing new. The most dramatic example is, of course, splitting the atom, which delivered a promising new energy source as well as weapons of mass destruction. A more recent example—the internet—was an unprecedented way to access the sum total of human knowledge, and it also became an insidious vector of mass misinformation. Now scientists are embarking on a new scientific journey, one that could bring unimaginable benefits for human health while also providing the tools for immense destruction. 

We're going to synthesize the human genome. 

Over the next five years, the Synthetic Human Genome Project (SynHG), funded by the world's largest medical charity Wellcome Trust (which was also a partner of the Human Genome Project completed in 2003), will work with scientists from Cambridge, Kent, Manchester, Oxford, and Imperial College London to build the foundational tools necessary to rebuild the human genome from scratch. This is different than gene editing, which typically involves much smaller changes to an organism's original DNA.

“With recent technological advances, the SynHG project is at the forefront of one of the most exciting areas of scientific research,” Wellcome's Michael Dunn said in a press statement. “Through creating the necessary tools and methods to synthesize a human genome, we will answer questions about our health and disease that we cannot even anticipate yet, in turn transforming our understanding of life and wellbeing.” 

In an interview with the BBC, Julian Sale, a member of the Molecular Biology in Cambridge who is part of the study, said that a synthetic human genome could improve the lives of humans as they age. This focus on healthspan—improving the quality of life for the years we do have—over lifespan is something medical professionals have been urging for years, and a synthetic human genome could address a wide variety of maladies that impact our quality of life in old age. 

And then, there's the other side of the scientific coin. 

While a synthetic genome could help generate disease-resistant cells or repair damaged organs or the immune system in general, the technology could also be used as a highly efficient biological weapon if it fell into the wrong hands. That's why SynHG will also develop social science programs that will examine the technology's ethical, legal, and social implications.

“The genie is out of the bottle,” Edinburgh University genetic scientist Bill Earnshaw told BBC News. “We could have a set of restrictions now, but if an organization who has access to appropriate machinery decided to start synthesising anything, I don't think we could stop them.”

When it comes to synthetic biology, the genie has actually been out of that proverbial bottle for a while now. In 2002, scientists in the U.S. first synthesized a viral genome, and since then, scientists have increased genomic complexity by synthesizing a bacterium in 2008 and a yeast organism in 2017. Of course, the human genome is leagues beyond these simple synthetic reconstructions, which is why the project scientists estimate that it could take decades to complete. 

Hopefully that provides enough time for humanity to fully grapple with the implications of such a breakthrough and ensure that we don't accidentally create yet another weapon of mass destruction.

A national study published in Environmental Science & Technology finds children aged 2 to 4 years in the United States are routinely exposed to a broad range of potentially harmful chemicals. Many of the chemicals the researchers identified are not routinely monitored and may pose health risks.

The research was conducted by multiple institutions across the United States in coordination with the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO), a program supported by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

The researchers analyzed urine samples from 201 children aged 2 to 4 years. They tested for 111 chemicals. Their study found:

""Our study shows that childhood exposure to potentially harmful chemicals is widespread. This is alarming because we know early childhood is a critical window for brain and body development,"" said Deborah H. Bennett, lead author and UC Davis professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences. ""Many of these chemicals are known or suspected to interfere with hormones, brain development and immune function.""

Children exposed to chemicals through everyday activities

The NIH-funded ECHO Cohort combines data from pregnancy and pediatric cohorts to examine the impacts of early environmental exposures on child health and development. This study looked at samples of 201 children from four states (California, Georgia, New York and Washington).

The researchers looked for childhood exposure to common environmental chemicals, including:

Children are exposed to these environmental chemicals through everyday activities, such as eating, drinking, breathing indoor and outdoor air and touching contaminated surfaces.

Frequent hand-to-mouth contact, playing close to the ground, and higher intake rates relative to their smaller body weight make kids especially vulnerable to chemical exposure.

Trends and disparities

In addition to the widespread exposure, the researchers noted some trends.

Most of the children's mothers had provided urine samples during pregnancy. This allowed the researchers to analyze the chemicals in the mother's urine with the chemicals in the children's urine.

They found the children had higher levels of several chemicals than their mothers did during pregnancy. These included two phthalates, bisphenol S (often used as a BPA replacement) and the pesticide biomarkers 3-PBA and trans-DCCA.

Need for more monitoring and regulation

The researchers emphasize that further studies are necessary to comprehend the long-term health implications of these chemicals.

""Exposure to certain chemicals in early childhood -- such as pesticides, plasticizers and flame retardants -- has been linked to developmental delays, hormone disruption and other long-term health issues,"" said Jiwon Oh, first author of the study and a postdoctoral scholar in the UC Davis Department of Public Health Sciences. ""This new study highlights the urgent need for expanded biomonitoring and stronger regulations to protect children from harmful exposures.""

A complete list of authors and funders appears in the paper.

How to limit chemical exposure

It is impossible to eliminate all chemical exposures. Yet, there are many simple steps parents can take to help reduce their children's contact with harmful chemicals.

A new study challenges the belief in a universal ""pet effect"" on human well-being. Using data collected during COVID-19 lockdowns, researchers found no significant change in respondents' well-being when they acquired or lost a pet in their household. The findings suggest that, even during a time of extreme isolation, human-animal bonds may not be as emotionally transformative as we like to believe.

Humans and their pets, a match made in heaven? Does adopting a new dog make you happier and less lonely? It is now commonplace to associate pet ownership with health and happiness for the human and the animal. Still, science has had a hard time pinning down the 'pet effect' -- a hypothesised boost in life quality for those who surround themselves with cats, dogs, or other companion animals. Only a few years ago, circumstances presented us with a severe test of the importance of human-animal bonds -- a global pandemic, COVID-19, which confined people to their homes, cutting them off from face-to-face contact in both work and personal life.

Researchers at ELTE Eötvös Loránd University have examined how pet acquisition and loss were experienced during the pandemic and the short- and long-term effects of acquiring a pet on the participants. The study was published in Scientific Reports. ""Through a collaboration with a psychologist team led by Zsolt Demetrovics and Róbert Urbán, we had access to a unique data set,"" explains Eniko Kubinyi, head of the MTA-ELTE 'Momentum' Companion Animals Research Group. ""During the 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns, almost three thousand people across Hungary participated three times in data collection, several months apart. We noticed that 65 people acquired a pet and 75 lost one during the study, and decided to investigate how their well-being changed over time.""

The researchers found little support for the romanticised view we hold of pet owners and their emotional well-being. A short-lived boost in cheerfulness appeared after acquiring a dog, however, in a long run, dog owners' calmness, life-satisfaction, cheerfulness, and activity had gone down. Most surprisingly, the researchers found that losing a pet did not leave a mark on the well-being of their former owners.

Ádám Miklósi, who initiated the data collection on companion animals, emphasises, ""We rarely have access to data that documents spontaneous pet acquisition from people unbiased in their attitude toward pet ownership. Usually, pet lovers are identified and studied when the decision to adopt an animal is already settled. It appears that, at least during stressful periods, the average person, who may not be the primary caregiver but simply shares a household with the pet, is not significantly affected by the pet's loss, nor is their well-being a strong predictor of the decision to acquire one.""

""What surprised me most,' adds Judit Mokos, data scientist and one of the paper's first authors, 'was that a new pet in the household had no effect on the respondents' loneliness. Dog adoption is often promoted as a solution for elderly and/or lonely people. Shelters and pet food companies promote adoption as a means of alleviating loneliness. However, our research suggests that dogs do not provide a real solution to loneliness; rather, they make the new owners more anxious.""

Kubinyi concludes, ""Based on the data, most people, living together with a companion animal, do not seem to experience any long-term 'pet effect', nor do they bond strongly with their animal. It is possible that the dynamics of the pandemic have led many to make impulsive choices against their long-term interest, or that only certain groups -- like devoted animal lovers or older adults living alone -- truly benefit from pets in stressful times.""

It appears that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the emotional bonds people formed with animals often fell short of expectations.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","How female friendships help chimp babies survive","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250701020701.htm","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 09:36:08 GMT","

In chimpanzee communities, strong social ties can be a matter of life and death not just for the adults who form them, but for their kids, too.

A new federally-funded study of wild eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) from Gombe National Park shows that female chimpanzees who were more socially integrated with other females in the year before giving birth were more likely to raise surviving offspring.

The findings, published online on June 18 in iScience, show that these survival benefits hold for females even in the absence of close kin. Contrary to many other species, chimpanzee females are the dispersing sex, usually leaving their maternal group at sexual maturity and establishing themselves in a new social group away from their kin.

""In species where females live in groups with their sisters and mothers, it's less surprising that female sociality is beneficial,"" said Joseph Feldblum, assistant research professor of evolutionary anthropology at Duke and lead author on the study. ""But female chimps don't usually have that. They are also less gregarious than males, so the fact that forming strong social connections still matters is striking.""

To test the connection between friendships and offspring survival, researchers analyzed more than three decades of behavioral data from 37 mothers and their 110 offspring. They focused on association and grooming -- how often females spent time near each other or engaged in social grooming behavior -- in the year before birth, to avoid including social behavior from the post-birth period, during which it would be difficult to establish the causal relationship between infant loss and social behavior.

Females who were more socially connected had a considerably better chance of raising their babies through to their first year -- the period of highest infant mortality. A female with a sociality score twice the community average had a 95% chance her infant would survive the first year. One who was halfway below average saw that chance drop to 75%. The effect persisted through age five, which is roughly the age of weaning.

The research team then tested whether having close female kin in the group -- like a sister or mother -- accounted for the survival benefit. The answer was ""no."" They also tested if the key was having bonds with males, who could potentially offer protection. The answer was also ""no."" What mattered the most was having social connections with other females, regardless of kinship.

""That tells us it's not just about being born into a supportive family,"" said Feldblum. ""These are primarily social relationships with non-kin.""

The authors noted that the mechanism of the survival benefit remains unresolved, although there are several possibilities. Social females might receive less harassment from other females, more help defending food patches or protecting their young, or their offspring could be less likely to be killed by another group member. Social connections might also have helped these females stay in better condition -- maybe better fed and less stressed -- through pregnancy, giving their offspring a better chance from the get-go.

And it's not just about the year before birth. Social females stayed social after their babies were born -- a sign of stable relationships, not short-term alliances. ""Our results don't prove causation, but they point to the value of being surrounded by others who support you, or at least tolerate you,"" said Feldblum.

""We humans are remarkably collaborative and cooperative. We cooperate at scales that are pretty much unique in the animal kingdom,"" he said. ""Human females who don't have access to kin -- for example because they moved to a new city or village -- are still able to form strong bonds that can benefit them. Studying these social dynamics in chimpanzees can help us understand how we evolved to be the social, cooperative species we are today.""

A widely-used agricultural chemical sprayed on American and Australian fruits and vegetables to prevent fungal disease is killing beneficial insects critical for pollination and ecosystem health, new Macquarie University research shows.

The study, published in Royal Society Open Science, found chlorothalonil - one of the world's most extensively used fungicides - severely impacts insect reproduction and survival, even at the lowest levels routinely detected on food.

""Even the very lowest concentration has a huge impact on the reproduction of the flies that we tested,"" says lead author Darshika Dissawa, a PhD candidate from Macquarie's School of Natural Sciences.

""This can have a big knock-on population impact over time because it affects both male and female fertility.""

The researchers exposed fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) to chlorothalonil levels matching those typically found in produce from cranberries to wine grapes. Even at the lowest dose, flies showed a 37 percent drop in egg production compared with unexposed individuals.

Chlorothalonil is a widely applied broad-spectrum fungicide in American agriculture, used on crops like:

Supervising author Associate Professor Fleur Ponton says the dramatic decline was unexpected.

""We expected the effect to increase far more gradually with higher amounts. But we found that even a very small amount can have a strong negative effect,"" Associate Professor Ponton says.

Although banned in the European Union, chlorothalonil is extensively applied to Australian crops including orchards and vineyards, often preventatively when no disease is present.

The findings add to mounting evidence of global insect population decline, with some regions reporting drops exceeding 75 percent in recent decades.

""We need bees and flies and other beneficial insects for pollination, and we think this is an important problem for pollinator populations,"" Associate Professor Ponton says.

The research highlights a critical knowledge gap in pesticide regulation, with fewer than 25 scientific papers examining chlorothalonil's effects on insects despite its widespread use.

The researchers recommend more sustainable practices, including reduced application frequency to allow insect population recovery between treatments.

A new technology that uses clinical MRI machines to image metabolic activity in the brain could give researchers and clinicians unique insight into brain function and disease, researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign report. The non-invasive, high-resolution metabolic imaging of the whole brain revealed differences in metabolic activity and neurotransmitter levels among brain regions; found metabolic alterations in brain tumors; and mapped and characterized multiple sclerosis lesions -- with patients only spending minutes in an MRI scanner.

Led by Zhi-Pei Liang, a professor of electrical and computer engineering and a member of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I., the team reported its findings in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering.

""Understanding the brain, how it works and what goes wrong when it is injured or diseased is considered one of the most exciting and challenging scientific endeavors of our time,"" Liang said. ""MRI has played major roles in unlocking the mysteries of the brain over the past four decades. Our new technology adds another dimension to MRI's capability for brain imaging: visualization of brain metabolism and detection of metabolic alterations associated with brain diseases.""

Conventional MRI provides high-resolution, detailed imaging of brain structures. Functional MRI maps brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow and blood oxygenation level, which are closely linked to neural activity. However, they cannot provide information on the metabolic activity in the brain, which is important for understanding function and disease, said postdoctoral researcher Yibo Zhao, the first author of the paper.

""Metabolic and physiological changes often occur before structural and functional abnormalities are visible on conventional MRI and fMRI images,"" Zhao said. ""Metabolic imaging, therefore, can lead to early diagnosis and intervention of brain diseases.""

Both MRI and fMRI techniques are based on magnetic resonance signals from water molecules. The new technology measures signals from brain metabolites and neurotransmitters as well as water molecules, a technique known as magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging. These MRSI images can provide significant new insights into brain function and disease processes, and could improve sensitivity and specificity for the detection and diagnosis of brain diseases, Zhao said.

Other attempts at MRSI have been bogged down by the lengthy times required to capture the images and high levels of noise obscuring the signals from neurotransmitters. The new technique addresses both challenges.

""Our technology overcomes several long-standing technical barriers to fast high-resolution metabolic imaging by synergistically integrating ultrafast data acquisition with physics-based machine learning methods for data processing,"" Liang said. With the new MRSI technology, the Illinois team cut the time required for a whole brain scan to 12 and a half minutes.

The researchers tested their MRSI technique on several populations. In healthy subjects, the researchers found and mapped varying metabolic and neurotransmitter activity across different brain regions, indicating that such activity is not universal. In patients with brain tumors, the researchers found metabolic alterations, such as elevated choline and lactate, in tumors of different grades -- even when the tumors appeared identical on clinical MRI images. In subjects with multiple sclerosis, the technique detected molecular changes associated with neuroinflammatory response and reduced neuronal activity up to 70 days before changes become visible on clinical MRI images, the researchers report.

The researchers foresee potential for broad clinical use of their technique: By tracking metabolic changes over time, clinicians can assess the effectiveness of treatments for neurological conditions, Liang said. Metabolic information also can be used to tailor treatments to individual patients based on their unique metabolic profiles.

""High-resolution whole-brain metabolic imaging has significant clinical potential,"" said Liang, who began his career in the lab of the late Illinois professor Paul Lauterbur, recipient of the Nobel Prize for developing MRI technology. ""Paul envisioned this exciting possibility and the general approach, but it has been very difficult to achieve his dream of fast high-resolution metabolic imaging in the clinical setting.

""As healthcare is moving towards personalized, predictive and precision medicine, this high-speed, high-resolution technology can provide a timely and effective tool to address an urgent unmet need for noninvasive metabolic imaging in clinical applications.""

Researchers have discovered a dramatic and unexpected shift in the Southern Ocean, with surface water salinity rising and sea ice in steep decline.

Since 2015, Antarctica has lost sea ice equal to the size of Greenland -- the largest environmental shift seen anywhere on Earth in the last decades. The Southern Ocean is also getting saltier, and this unexpected change is making the problem worse.

For decades, the ocean's surface freshened (becoming less salty), helping sea ice grow. Now, scientists say that trend has sharply reversed.

Using European satellite data, research led by the University of Southampton has discovered a sudden rise in surface salinity south of 50° latitude.

This has coincided with a dramatic loss of sea ice around Antarctica and the re-emergence of the Maud Rise polynya in the Weddell Sea - a huge hole in the sea ice nearly four times the size of Wales, which hadn't occurred since the 1970s.

The findings were published on June 30 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Dr Alessandro Silvano from the University of Southampton who led the research said: ""Saltier surface water allows deep ocean heat to rise more easily, melting sea ice from below. It's a dangerous feedback loop: less ice leads to more heat, which leads to even less ice.

""The return of the Maud Rise polynya signals just how unusual the current conditions are. If this salty, low-ice state continues, it could permanently reshape the Southern Ocean -- and with it, the planet. The effects are already global: stronger storms, warmer oceans, and shrinking habitats for penguins and other iconic Antarctic wildlife.""

In these polar waters, cold, fresh surface water overlays warmer, saltier waters from the deep. In the winter, as the surface cools and sea ice forms, the density difference (stratification) between water layers weakens, allowing these layers to mix and heat to be transported upward, melting the sea ice from below and limiting its growth.

Since the early 1980s, the surface of the Southern Ocean had been freshening, and stratification had been strengthening, trapping heat below and sustaining more sea ice coverage.

Now, new satellite technology, combined with information from floating robotic devices which travel up and down the water column, shows this trend has reversed; surface salinity is increasing, stratification is weakening, and sea ice has reached multiple record lows -- with large openings of open ocean in the sea ice (polynyas) returning.

It's the first time scientists have been able to monitor these changes in the Southern Ocean in real-time.

Contrary to the new findings, man-made climate change was generally expected to sustain Antarctic Sea ice cover over the coming years.

Aditya Narayanan, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Southampton and co-author on the paper, explains: ""While scientists expected that human-driven climate change would eventually lead to Antarctic Sea ice decline, the timing and nature of this shift remained uncertain.

""Previous projections emphasized enhanced surface freshening and stronger ocean stratification, which could have supported sustained sea ice cover. Instead, a rapid reduction in sea ice -- an important reflector of solar radiation -- has occurred, potentially accelerating global warming.""

Professor Alberto Naveira Garabato, co-author of the study and Regius Professor of Ocean Sciences at the University of Southampton added: ""The new findings suggest that our current understanding may be insufficient to accurately predict future changes.""

""It makes the need for continuous satellite and in-situ monitoring all the more pressing, so we can better understand the drivers of recent and future shifts in the ice-ocean system.""

The paper Rising surface salinity and declining sea ice: a new Southern Ocean state revealed by satellites is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and is available online.

The project was supported by the European Space Agency.

Ancient Egyptian society flourished for millennia, reaching its peak during the Dynastic Period (approximately 3150–30 bce). However, owing to poor DNA preservation, questions about regional interconnectivity over time have not been addressed because whole-genome sequencing has not yet been possible. Here we sequenced a 2× coverage whole genome from an adult male Egyptian excavated at Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات). Radiocarbon dated to 2855–2570 cal. bce, he lived a few centuries after Egyptian unification, bridging the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods. The body was interred in a ceramic pot within a rock-cut tomb1, potentially contributing to the DNA preservation. Most of his genome is best represented by North African Neolithic ancestry, among available sources at present. Yet approximately 20% of his genetic ancestry can be traced to genomes representing the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia and surrounding regions. This genetic affinity is similar to the ancestry appearing in Anatolia and the Levant during the Neolithic and Bronze Age2,3,4,5. Although more genomes are needed to fully understand the genomic diversity of early Egyptians, our results indicate that contacts between Egypt and the eastern Fertile Crescent were not limited to objects and imagery (such as domesticated animals and plants, as well as writing systems)6,7,8,9 but also encompassed human migration.

For thousands of years, the Egyptian Dynastic civilization (approximately 3150–30 bce) developed monumental architecture, sophisticated technology and relatively stable belief systems, becoming the longest-lasting civilization known. Following the political unification of the northern and southern regions of Egypt (Lower and Upper Egypt) at the end of the fourth millennium bce, the Old Kingdom (2686–2125 bce) witnessed considerable advances, including the construction of the first step pyramid complex of King Djoser and the ‘Great Pyramid of Giza' built by King Khufu. The population has been considered to be of local origin, with limited input from neighbouring regions8,10. Yet, more recent archaeological evidence shows that trade connections existed across the Fertile Crescent since at least the sixth millennium bce7, if not earlier, with the advent of the Neolithic package (such as domesticated animals and plants)6,7. Cultural exchange continued to develop through the late fourth millennium bce with the growing Sumerian civilization of Mesopotamia7,8,9. This period overlaps with the appearance of additional innovations in Egypt (such as the pottery wheel)11 and the earliest evidence of hieroglyphic writing in the form of ivory tags in Tomb U-j at Abydos, dated 3320–3150 bce7.

Our knowledge of ancient Egyptians has increased through decades of bioarchaeological analyses12,13,14,15, including dental morphological studies on their relatedness to other populations in North Africa and West Asia16,17,18. However, the lack of ancient genomes, particularly for the early periods of Egyptian Dynastic history, remains a barrier to our understanding of population continuity and gene flow in the region. Although individuals from ancient Egypt were subjected to the first effort to isolate ancient DNA19, direct genome sequencing has remained elusive because of the challenging regional DNA preservation conditions. So far, only three individuals from Abusir el-Meleq (Fig. 1a) have yielded nuclear DNA, all post-dating the emergence of Dynastic Egypt by thousands of years (from 787 cal. bce to 23 cal. ce)20. Moreover, these are not complete genome sequences but are limited to approximately 90,000–400,000 target-enriched genotypes. Over the millennia spanning the Dynastic Period, Egypt witnessed several wide-ranging wars, occupation by foreign rulers and dramatic episodes of internal political collapse (First, Second and Third Intermediate periods)21. Together, these processes may have substantially altered or reshaped the overall genetic structure and ancestry of the Egyptian population. Here we present a whole-genome sequence of an ancient Egyptian individual (2.02× coverage; Supplementary Table 1), recovered from a necropolis at Nuwayrat (نويرات, Nuerat; Fig. 1a).

Nuwayrat is located near the village of Beni Hasan, 265 km south of Cairo (Fig. 1a). Radiocarbon dating of the skeletal remains showed that the Nuwayrat individual died between 2855 and 2570 cal. bce (95.4% probability; Supplementary Information section 1 and Supplementary Table 2), which overlaps with the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods (Fig. 1e). This result supports the initial archaeological assessments that material culture and funerary practices at the site were consistent with those of the Third and Fourth Dynasties of the Old Kingdom1,22. The body was placed in a large pottery vessel inside a rock-cut tomb (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1). This treatment would have ordinarily been reserved for individuals of a higher social class relative to others at the site23, as observed elsewhere during the Early Dynastic Period and at the Old Kingdom royal cemeteries near the city of Memphis (Supplementary Information section 1).

Although acknowledging known limitations in predicting phenotypic traits in understudied populations24, the Nuwayrat individual is predicted to have had brown eyes, brown hair and skin pigmentation ranging from dark to black skin, with a lower probability of intermediate skin colour (Methods and Supplementary Table 10). The individual was genetically male (XY sex chromosomes; Supplementary Table 1), consistent with the expression of standard skeletal features25 (Methods). Our further osteological examination revealed that he would have stood 157.4–160.5 cm tall26. He lived to an advanced age for the time (approximately 44–64 years; the upper end of this range is the most probable25,27), as evidenced by his heavily worn teeth and age-related osteoarthritis in most joints and vertebrae, in some cases severe (Fig. 1c). This and various activity-induced musculoskeletal indicators of stress revealed that he experienced an extended period of physical labour, seemingly in contrast to his high-status tomb burial. The patterns of osteoarthritis and stress indicators further imply the form of physical activity that he routinely engaged in, which some researchers maintain can provide clues concerning occupation28,29. In this case, although circumstantial, they are not inconsistent with those of a potter, as depicted in ancient Egyptian imagery. Estimates of biological affinity based on dental morphological features and cranial measurements parallel the genomic results (below). More detailed information about the Nuwayrat individual is presented in Supplementary Information section 2, with a facial depiction in Supplementary Information section 3 (Extended Data Fig. 2).

Multi-isotope analysis (δ13C, δ15N, δ18O and 87Sr/86Sr) was conducted on dental enamel and dental collagen from the lower-left second molar to determine his childhood diet and geographic origin (Supplementary Information section 5). All results are consistent with having grown up in the hot, dry climate of the Nile Valley (δ18Ocarb VSMOW = 23.6‰, where VSMOW indicates Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water; 87Sr/86Sr = 0.707888)30,31,32 and consuming an omnivorous diet based on terrestrial animal protein and plants, such as wheat and barley (δ13CVPDB = −19.6‰, where VPDB indicates Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite; δ15NAIR = 12.3‰)33, typical for Egyptians until the Coptic period34. An elevated δ15N value, frequently observed in isotope studies of ancient Egyptians, may have been caused by the arid environment35,36,37, eating foods raised on manured fields38 and/or inclusion of Nile fish in the diet34.

Seven cementum-enriched DNA extracts were prepared into single-stranded DNA sequencing libraries39 and screened on an Illumina platform. Five of these libraries showed degradation patterns expected for ancient DNA with evidence of elevated rates of cytosine-to-thymine substitutions at the first base of the sequence alignments (more than 30%) and low contamination estimates for both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (0–3%; Fig. 1d); the two remaining libraries were discarded because of elevated contamination estimates (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1 (Y11473 and Y11476)). The two libraries (Y11475 and Y11477) with the highest proportion of reads mapping to the reference human genome (6.0% and 3.2% of all sequences) were further sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 and NovaSeq X platforms to generate a total of 8.3 billion 2 × 100 sequence read pairs.

We merged the Nuwayrat genome (NUE001) with those of 3,233 present-day individuals that were either whole-genome sequenced or genotyped on the Human Origins Array and 805 ancient individuals with either whole-genome or 1.2 million single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) capture data. We first projected the Nuwayrat genome in a principal component analysis (PCA) using a population panel representing present-day worldwide genetic diversity. The Nuwayrat individual is genetically most similar to present-day people in North Africa and West Asia (Fig. 2a and Extended Data Fig. 4), which is consistent with the results from ADMIXTURE clustering40 (Extended Data Fig. 5). The mitochondrial DNA (haplogroup I/N1a1b2) and chromosome Y (haplogroup E1b1b1b2b~) haplogroups of the Nuwayrat individual are most common in present-day North African and West Asian groups (Supplementary Table 4), consistent with the whole-genome affinities. Furthermore, the Nuwayrat genome had no extended runs of homozygosity above 4 cM, indicating no recent consanguinity in his ancestry41.

Only a subset of genomes corresponding to those used in the qpAdm analysis (Fig. 3) are displayed. The full output of the ADMIXTURE analysis is shown in Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5.

We used the qpAdm42 framework to model the genetic ancestry components that best represent the Nuwayrat genome using a fully rotating model competition approach, in which a set of candidate populations are iteratively used as sources to construct one-source, two-source and three-source population ancestry models, whereas the remaining candidates are set as outgroup (right) populations43,44 (Supplementary Information section 4). We used a set of 13 populations from Neolithic and Chalcolithic West Asia, North Africa and the North Mediterranean region that predate the Nuwayrat individual as potential sources (Fig. 3c,d and Methods). No single-source model fitted the data (maximum P value observed = 2.39 × 10−6 for a model with Morocco_MN as a single source). Instead, a single two-source model (P = 0.12) met the significance criteria (P > 0.05), which consisted of a mixture of 77.6 ± 3.8% ancestry represented by genomes from the Middle Neolithic Moroccan site of Skhirat-Rouazi dated to 4780–4230 bce (Morocco_MN), and the remainder most closely related to genomes from 9000 to 8000 bce Neolithic Mesopotamia (22.4 ± 3.8%; Fig. 3a). In addition, two three-source models showed similar ancestry proportions but with a minor contribution of a third ancestry component represented by genomes from the Neolithic/Chalcolithic Levant (4.7 ± 8.2% at P = 0.11 and 1.1 ± 8.7% at P = 0.07, respectively; Supplementary Table 6).

The timeline in d is based on Egyptian cultural transition dates.

All accepted qpAdm models showed the presence of ancestry related to Middle Neolithic Morocco in the Nuwayrat genome; therefore, our results could indicate shared ancestry across North Africa during this period and, consequently, that local Egyptian Neolithic populations contributed genetically to the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom people, as indicated from material culture7,8,10 and bioarchaeological analyses14,15. However, because the genomes from Middle Neolithic Morocco have previously been modelled to comprise both Iberomaurusian-like and Levantine Neolithic ancestry components45, which we corroborated (Extended Data Fig. 6, Supplementary Information section 4 and Supplementary Table 5), the affinity to Levantine Neolithic groups could reflect several migration events. To explore these alternative hypotheses in detail, further ancient DNA studies on pre-Bronze Age genomes from North Africa are required.

The second genetic ancestry component detected in the Nuwayrat individual is most closely related to Neolithic Mesopotamians, out of the potential sources included in the model competition (Methods). To further examine the putative affinity to Neolithic Mesopotamia, we computed a series of f4 statistics testing whether a set of groups share more derived alleles with Nuwayrat than with Middle Neolithic Morocco in the form f4(NUE001, Morocco_MN; X, Ju_hoan_North.DG); here X represents the rotating sources of the qpAdm model with the addition of Levantine Palaeolithic, Anatolian Palaeolithic and Bronze Age Levantine genomes. The statistic was maximized and statistically significant with Neolithic Mesopotamia as X (Z score = 3.2; Fig. 3b). The affinity is also seen in the statistic f4(NUE001, Morocco_MN; Mesopotamia_N, X), which is positive for all tested populations as X, consistent with an ancestry affinity between the individual from Nuwayrat and Neolithic Mesopotamia, with Z scores > 2 for all, except Zagros and Caucasus groups and Chalcolithic and Bronze Age Levantine groups (Supplementary Table 9).

Although we caution that these results are based on a single Egyptian genome, they mirror another study that found evidence of gene flow from the Mesopotamian and Zagros regions into surrounding areas, including Anatolia, during the Neolithic2. Together with archaeological evidence for cultural exchange6,7, these findings open the possibility that wider cultural and demographic expansion originating in the Mesopotamian region reached both Egypt and Anatolia during this period. However, more recent migrations from the eastern Fertile Crescent during the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age further altered the Anatolian and Levantine genetic landscapes3,4,5. Related movements may have introduced the Mesopotamian-like ancestry more recently in Egypt. We tested this by applying the same full qpAdm model to target groups from the Bronze Age Anatolia and Levant (genomes from the Bronze Age Levant were grouped into eight archaeological sites3,4,5,46,47, of which all models for Megiddo and Yehud were rejected; Supplementary Table 6). Although we replicated previous findings that all Levantine Bronze Age groups trace 18.7–79.8% of their ancestry to Neolithic or Chalcolithic Levantine groups3,4,5,46,47, we also detected ancestry from Neolithic Mesopotamia at three sites (Ebla, Baq'ah and Ashkelon), considering the best-fit models, in proportions (41.8–54.8%) exceeding those in the Nuwayrat genome (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 6). However, the initial full qpAdm model, extended to include the Bronze Age Levant as a potential source, can effectively be rejected for the Nuwayrat genome (P = 0.013; Supplementary Information section 4). Notably, the best model for the Nuwayrat genome fits worse when these groups are included as reference groups (P = 0.021; Supplementary Information section 4). This means that we cannot exclude the possibility that the Neolithic Mesopotamian-like ancestry in the Nuwayrat genome could have arrived by means of more recent unsampled intermediaries in the Levant.

Although the timing of the admixture event cannot be estimated directly (Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary Note 4), this finding provides direct evidence of genetic ancestry related to the eastern Fertile Crescent in ancient Egypt. Archaeological evidence lends support to the Early Neolithic shared regional ancestry between Egypt and West Asia. Given its proximity, Egypt was one of the first external areas to adopt the Neolithic package that emerged across West Asia as early as the sixth millennium bce or before6,48,49, which could have corresponded with movements of people. This period is concomitant with the observed gene flow from Mesopotamia to Anatolia2, which may have expanded into Egypt as well. In support, a substantial change in odontometric and dental tissue proportions occurred approximately 6000 bce in the Nile Valley, with general continuity thereafter50. Along with marked temporal differences in subsistence (such as domesticated plants and greater sedentism) and material culture (such as the introduction of pottery), this is indicative of discontinuity between the Mesolithic (eighth to seventh millennium bce) and Neolithic populations50. Cultural exchange and trade then continued through the fourth millennium bce when Mesopotamian Late Uruk period features filtered into the Nile Valley during the later Predynastic Period7,8,9,51. Trade might have been routed through the Mediterranean and Red Seas rather than the Sinai Desert7,52. Such seaborne mobility could explain a scenario in which the source population did not come into contact with the Chalcolithic/Bronze Age Levantines. Our results indicate that this millennia-long process might not have only included cultural transmission but also migration and subsequent admixture.

Moreover, it is notable that both our qpAdm modelling and ADMIXTURE clustering excluded any substantial ancestry in the Nuwayrat genome related to the 4,500-year-old genome from Mota, Ethiopia or other individuals in central, eastern or southern Africa (Figs. 2 and 3 and Extended Data Fig. 5)53. Nevertheless, we found that the Nuwayrat genome fits as an equally good source as Levant Chalcolithic groups for the West Eurasian-related component of East African pastoralist genomes, but ancient DNA data are still missing for many putative source regions (Extended Data Fig. 7, Supplementary Information section 4 and Supplementary Table 12)54,55.

The Nuwayrat genome extends the genetic record of ancient Egypt beyond previously published data from the Third Intermediate Period (787–544 bce; Fig. 1e). We modelled these latter individuals20 using qpAdm with putative sources from a set of nine populations from North Africa (including Nuwayrat), West Asia and Greece, who lived between the Old Kingdom and the Third Intermediate Period and also included genomes from the Middle Neolithic Morocco and Neolithic Mesopotamia (see Supplementary Information section 4 for more models that tested the potential overfitting of these sources). We can reject all one-source models, including one with 100% continuity from Nuwayrat to the Third Intermediate Period (P = 3.00 × 10−7). Two similar two-source models fit the data (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 7), differing only in whether the Nuwayrat or Middle Neolithic Moroccan individuals are one of the best-fit sources. In both models, the main source of ancestry is the Bronze Age Levant (for example, 64.5 ± 5.6% in the model with Middle Neolithic Morocco; P = 0.32; Supplementary Information section 4). These results are consistent with the Third Intermediate Period genomes deriving part of their ancestry from local groups related to the Nuwayrat individual while evidencing a significant increase in Levantine ancestry.

Evidence of gene flow from the Levant by the time of the Third Intermediate Period could be linked to the proposed Bronze Age Canaanite expansion, starting at the end of the Middle Kingdom period. On the basis of archaeological findings, whether this was a gradual assimilation process56 or a rapid shift, such as the settlement of Hyksos rulers56,57, is still debated. Overall, this period also overlaps with the well-characterized Late Bronze Age collapse that witnessed rapid societal and economic upheaval across the Mediterranean region, leading to or being caused by widespread population movements58,59. However, the temporal and geographical limitations of the current genomic data do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn.

We next tested how present-day Egyptian ancestry could be traced to the Bronze Age populations living in North Africa, including the Nuwayrat individual, West Asia, Europe and sub-Saharan Africa, using qpAdm. Despite substantial heterogeneity, most present-day Egyptian genomes can be modelled as deriving their ancestry from five sources related to (1) Nuwayrat (32.1–74.7%); (2) Middle Neolithic Morocco (28.9–72.7%); (3) Bronze Age Levant (11.6–57.1%); (4) the 4,500-year-old individual from Ethiopia (‘Mota') (7.4–56.0%); and (5) two approximately 230-year-old individuals from Congo (4.8–52.0%) (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 8). Thus, if tracing the ancestry of many present-day Egyptians in our study to the Bronze Age, much of it would be found in groups related to Nuwayrat or alternatively to sources best represented by Middle Neolithic Morocco from which approximately 80% of Nuwayrat's ancestry derives. The second most common ancestry component is related to the Bronze Age Levant, consistent with the ancestry detected in the Third Intermediate Period individuals. Bronze Age Caucasus ancestry is present in a fraction of the present-day Egyptians but is similar to the Bronze Age Levant ancestry60. Our models show a more recent arrival of East and West African ancestries in present-day Egyptians, which has also been previously suggested20 and dated to 27 generations ago using linkage disequilibrium-based admixture dating61. Moreover, we note that there is a substantial diversity in ancestry across Egypt; approximately 20% of the present-day Egyptian genomes included here did not fit the model described above.

Our results demonstrate the feasibility of ancient genome sequencing from the earliest stages of the Egyptian Dynastic civilization. One possible explanation for the successful whole-genome retrieval is the pot burial, which may have favoured a degree of DNA preservation not previously reported in Egypt. This contributes to the road map for future research to obtain ancient DNA from Egypt62. Although our analyses are limited to a single Egyptian individual who, on the basis of his relatively high-status burial, may not be representative of the general population, our results revealed ancestry links to earlier North African groups and populations of the eastern Fertile Crescent. Analogous links were indicated in our biological affinity analyses of dental traits and craniometrics of the Nuwayrat individual, as well as in previous morphological studies based on full samples. The genetic links with the eastern Fertile Crescent also mirror previously documented cultural diffusion (such as domesticated plants and animals, writing systems and the pottery wheel), opening up the possibility of some settlement of people in Egypt during one or more of these periods. The Nuwayrat genome also allowed us to investigate the Bronze Age roots of ancestry in later Egypt, highlighting the interplay between population movement and continuity in the region. Future whole-genome sequencing of DNA from more individuals will allow for a more detailed and nuanced understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization and its inhabitants.

The human remains were excavated from the Nuwayrat necropolis near Beni Hasan, Egypt. They were donated between 1902 and 1904 by the Egyptian Antiquities Service to the members of the Beni Hasan excavation committee and subsequently donated to the Institute of Archaeology, University of Liverpool and exported under the John Garstang export permit. The human remains were then donated to the World Museum (previously the Liverpool City Museum) in 1950. Sampling permit was granted by the World Museum.

Sampling and DNA extraction of seven permanent teeth belonging to an individual from Nuwayrat were carried out in dedicated ancient DNA facilities at Liverpool John Moores University. Library preparation and sequencing were carried out at The Francis Crick Institute (Supplementary Table 1). Before subsampling, the teeth were decontaminated by wiping with 1% sodium hypochlorite, followed by wiping with molecular biology grade water and ethanol. Approximately 44–66 mg of cementum-enriched powder was extracted from each tooth using a Dremel drill at the lowest possible rotations per minute (5,000 rpm).

DNA was extracted using 1 ml of extraction buffer consisting of 0.45 ml of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 10 μl of 10 mg ml−1 proteinase K per 50 mg of bone powder. The mixture was incubated overnight (approximately 18 h) at 37 °C and purified on the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit (Roche) using a binding buffer described in ref. 63 and QIAGEN buffer PE. DNA was eluted in approximately 100 μl of QIAGEN elution buffer.

Extracts were turned into single-stranded DNA libraries39 (without treatment to remove uracils), double-indexed64 and then underwent paired-end sequencing on a HiSeq 4000 to approximately seven million reads per library for initial screening (Supplementary Table 1). All samples were processed alongside negative lysate and extraction controls and positive and negative library controls. On the basis of the assessment of the initial sequencing results, two libraries were selected for extra rounds of deeper sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 and NovaSeq X platforms, following the selection of fragments greater than 35 bp using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis65 for the library built from the NUE001b5e1 extract (Supplementary Table 1), with a resulting total of 8.3 billion 2 × 100 sequence pairs.

New radiocarbon dating was generated for the individual that yielded DNA from Nuwayrat (NUE001) by Beta Analytic using accelerator mass spectrometry. We directly dated the upper-left third molar (NUE001b3) and lower-left first premolar (NUE001b5), both of which yielded DNA that was deep sequenced (Supplementary Table 1). The results are reported in Supplementary Table 2. The femur of this individual was previously radiocarbon dated66,67 (Supplementary Information section 1 and Supplementary Table 2). All dates were calibrated using OxCal v.4.4.4 (ref. 68) with atmospheric data in IntCal20 (ref. 69). We also combined the three independent dates using the R_Combine() function in OxCal70 (Supplementary Table 2). We rounded the calibrated dates outwards to 10 years unless error terms were smaller than ±25 bp, in which case we rounded outwards to 5 years71.

Dental collagen and enamel were extracted from the lower-left second molar. Dentine collagen was extracted for carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope analysis following a modified Longin method72,73. Mass spectrometry was performed using a Flash 1112 series elemental analyser coupled with a Finnigan DELTA V Advantage (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using established protocols74. Analytical precision (1σ) of the in-house calibrated standards74 were 0.08 and 0.07 for δ13C and δ15N, respectively.

For enamel, after surface abrasion, a slice (3.6 mm wide) was extracted, and all adhering dentine was removed. Two fragments were powdered, one of which was pre-ultrasonicated. A minimum of 3.0 mg was analysed for the oxygen isotope composition of enamel carbonate (δ18Oc). Samples were acidified for 5 min with more than 100% ortho-phosphoric acid (density approximately 1.9 g cm–3) at 70 °C and analysed in duplicate using a MAT 253 dual-inlet mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Kiel IV carbonate preparation device using established protocols74. Isotope values are reported as per mille (18O/16O) normalized to the Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite (VPDB) scale using an in-house carbonate standard (BCT63) calibrated against NBS19. The long-term reproducibility for δ18O BCT63 is ±0.04‰ and ±0.03‰ for δ13C (1σ). The oxygen carbonate values (δ18OC VPDB) were converted to the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW) scale75 and phosphate (δ18OP VSMOW)76.

The remaining enamel fragment (56.3 mg) was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath, digested in 8 M HNO3 and heated overnight at 120 °C. Sr-Spec was used for strontium extraction, following the revised version of Font et al.77. Once column-loaded in 1 ml of 8 M HNO3, matrix elements were eluted in washes of 8 M HNO3, and samples were placed on a hotplate (120 °C) overnight, with a repeat pass following. The sample was redissolved in 2% HNO3, and the 87Sr/86S ratio was measured using a Neoma multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with tandem mass spectrometry (MC-ICP–MS/MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Instrumental mass bias was corrected for using the exponential law and a normalization ratio of 8.375209 for 88Sr/86Sr (ref. 78). Residual krypton (Kr) and rubidium (87Rb) interferences were monitored and corrected using 84Kr and 86Kr (83Kr/84Kr = 0.20175 and 83Kr/86Kr = 0.66474; without normalization) and 85Rb (85Rb/87Rb = 2.5926), respectively. The accuracy of the method was assessed by measuring the EC-5 coral standard (87Sr/86Sr: 0.709171 ± 0.000016 (2σ; n = 14), consistent with the expected value for seawater). The data were also corrected against a National Institute of Standards and Technology Standard Reference Material 987 value of 0.710248 (ref. 79). The procedural blank was less than 75 pg of Sr, negligible relative to sample Sr.

Following element inventory, our determination of the Nuwayrat individual's sex was based on standard morphological indicators across the skeleton (protocol in Buikstra and Ubelaker25). Ageing was estimated from the dentition, cranium and postcrania25,27,80,81,82,83,84. For stature, several approaches were used85,86,87, with the most likely estimate based on direct stature reconstruction of ancient Egyptians following ref. 26.

Biological affinity was assessed from two long-recognized methods: dental non-metric traits88 and craniometrics (for example, Howells89). First, the rASUDAS application was accessed (https://osteomics.com/rASUDAS2/)90. It used up to 32 crown and root traits for comparison with data from seven global population samples. Second, the craniometric approach used the CRANID program CR6bIND, with 29 measurements for comparison with a database of 74 premodern through recent global samples, including Late Dynastic Egyptians and ancient West Asians91.

Our recording and description of skeletal pathology, related primarily to age-related breakdown, follow accepted methods25,92,93. This and activity-induced musculoskeletal stress markers (details in previous studies28,29,94) were used to ascertain the level of physical activity. Although not without criticism95,96, they have been used to infer occupation by identifying common positions and movements in life. For that purpose, the latter were compared with illustrations of individuals engaged in a range of common jobs, as depicted on ancient Egyptian tomb walls and in statuary (Supplementary Information section 2).

Craniofacial analysis and facial reconstruction from skeletal remains were carried out using three-dimensional laser scan data of the skull (collected using an Artec Space Spider scanner), Touch X haptic device and Geomagic Freeform software97. Egyptian male data98 were used to estimate facial tissues at anatomical points across the skull surface. The muscles of the head and neck were imported from the Face Lab database and remodelled to fit the skull following anatomical guidelines99. Morphometric standards were used99,100 to estimate facial feature morphology, such as eye and nasal shape, lip and ear pattern and structural creases. A final facial depiction was produced using two-dimensional photo-editing software. It is important not to consider a facial depiction as a portrait or definitive image because it can only visualize the available information101. In this case, although DNA analysis indicated the most probable population of origin, there was no evidence in relation to skin colour and hair colour. Therefore, the facial depiction was produced in black and white without head hair or facial hair (Supplementary Information section 3).

Read alignment was performed following the pipeline in the study of Swali et al.102. Samples were processed through the nf-core/eager v.2.3.3 pipeline103. First, adaptors were removed, paired-end reads were merged and bases with a quality below 20 were trimmed using AdapterRemoval v.2.3.1 (ref. 104) with –trimns –trimqualities –collapse –minadapteroverlap 1 and –preserve5p. Merged reads with a minimum length of 35 bp were mapped to the hs37d5 human reference genome with Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA-0.7.17 aln)105 using -l 16500 -n 0.01 -o 2 -t 1 (ref. 106). Duplicate reads were removed using DeDup v.0.12.8 (ref. 107). Finally, we removed the alignments with mapping quality below 30 and containing indels.

We used mapDamage v.2 (ref. 108) to visualize the substitution distribution along the reads and evidence the presence of deaminated molecules typical of ancient DNA. Contamination was estimated using three different data sources: (1) genome-wide present-day contamination using the conditional substitution rate109 computed using PMDtools v.0.60 (ref. 110); (2) present-day mitochondrial DNA-based contamination using schmutzi (commit be61017)111; and (3) chromosome X contamination on libraries assigned as male using ANGSD v.0.933 (ref. 112), restricted to the non-recombining region of chromosome X. All the libraries from NUE001 show little to no contamination, except two libraries with sequencing identification numbers SKO719A1706 and SKO719A1709 (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 1).

The biological sex of the sequenced individual was determined using the Ry parameter113, which is the ratio of the number of alignments to the Y chromosome (ny) to the total number of alignments to both sex chromosomes (nx + ny), Ry = ny/(nx + ny). All libraries are consistent with NUE001 being karyotypically male, except the results from the library SKO719A1706 consistent with being female, which is probably a result of contamination (Supplementary Table 1).

We merged the sequencing data from five libraries from the Nuwayrat individual showing an absence of present-day human DNA contamination, yielding a total of 135,606,409 mapped unique reads of 44.63 bp on average, resulting in an average genome-wide coverage of 2.02×. We called pseudo-haploid positions using SAMTools v.1.9 mpileup114 with options -B -R -Q30 and SequenceTools 1.5 (ref. 115) with options –randomHaploid and –singleStrandMode. This approach leverages the single-stranded library preparation to computationally remove the effects of cytosine-deamination-derived sequence errors. Specifically, at C/T SNPs, it removes all bases that are aligned onto the forward strand; at G/A SNPs, it removes all bases on that aligned to the reverse strand. This allows for a confident pseudo-haploid genotyping even also at CpG context transitions, which are mostly not repaired by the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) treatment owing to methylation116.

We obtained the mitochondrial DNA consensus of the Nuwayrat individual from endogenous reads, removing the bases with quality below 20 (-q 20) using schmutzi111. The mitochondrial haplogroup was assigned using Haplogrep 3 (ref. 117).

The chromosome Y haplogroup was obtained using pathPhynder118 with the parameter -m ‘no-filter', on the basis of approximately 120,000 SNPs extracted from worldwide present-day and ancient male chromosome Y variation and the International Society of Genetic Genealogy v.15.73 (http://www.isogg.org).

We merged the genome of the Nuwayrat individual with a comparison dataset of 977 ancient individuals2,3,4,5,20,43,45,46,47,53,54,55,60,119,120,121,122,123,124,125,126,127,128,129,130,131,132,133,134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143,144,145,146,147,148,149,150,151,152,153,154,155,156,157,158,159,160 and 4,040 modern individuals43,46,122,141,158,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169 genotyped on either the Human Origins array169 (‘Human Origins' dataset) or the 1.2 million SNP array (‘1240k' dataset)139 (Supplementary Table 3). Most genotypes were directly accessed from the Allen Ancient DNA Resource v.54.1 (ref. 170). We added nine ancient genomes from Morocco45 and 13 ancient genomes from Mesopotamia120 from raw mapped Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files processed following the above-mentioned bioinformatic pipeline, with two modifications: (1) for the double-stranded UDG-treated genomes from ref. 45, we trimmed the first and last three bases of the reads and then called pseudo-haploid genotypes at both transition and transversion sites; and (2) for the non-UDG-treated genomes from ref. 120, we called pseudo-haploid genotypes at transversion sites only. We included 100 present-day Egyptian genomes from ref. 164 in both datasets. Individuals related up to the second degree, as detected in previous studies, were excluded.

We computed two PCA on present-day individuals from the ‘Human Origins' dataset using 593,124 substitutions through SMARTPCA (eigensoft v.6.1.4)169. For the first analysis, we kept 3,233 individuals from across the world and projected NUE001 on the resulting components. For the second PCA, we kept 722 present-day individuals from North Africa, West Asia and the Caucasus and projected NUE001 together with 781 ancient genomes from North Africa, West Asia and the Caucasus. Both analyses used transversions only (111,208 SNPs).

We used a model-based clustering approach from the program ADMIXTURE v.1.2 (ref. 40) to estimate the ancestry components from genomes in the ‘Human Origins' dataset. All genomes were transformed into pseudo-haploid sequences, and transitions were removed. The remaining 111,208 positions were subsequently pruned for SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium using PLINK v.1.9 (ref. 171), with the parameter –indep-pairwise 200 25 0.4 to yield a final set of 71,202 transversion SNPs. ADMIXTURE was run with cross-validation enabled using --cv flag for all ancestral population numbers from K = 3 to K = 20.

The presence and length of runs of homozygosity greater than 4 cM in the Nuwayrat genome were estimated using hapROH v.0.64 (ref. 41) on the 1.2 million SNP set of sites.

For all qpAdm modelling in this study, we estimated the ancestry proportions as a mixture of a set of left (source) rotating populations differentially related to a set of right (outgroup) populations using ADMIXTOOLS 2 (ref. 42) qpadm_rotating() with the option maxmiss = 0.1, removing genotypes missing in more than 10% of populations. We restricted the analysis to genomes with both transitions and transversions (half/plus UDG-treated libraries or single-stranded libraries called using SequenceTools115 --singleStrandMode), removing CpG sites, to increase the robustness of the models. We considered only models with three or less sources. We restricted the fixed set of outgroup to populations distantly related to any left populations and with genomes greater than or equal to 2×: Ju_hoan_North.DG, Ethiopia_4500BP.SG, Latvia_HG_UDG, USA_Ancient_Beringian.SG, Vanuatu_400BP_UDG, Japan_HG_Jomon_UDG and China_NEastAsia_Coastal_EN_UDG. This analysis was conducted on the 1240k dataset. These parameters are always true unless otherwise stated.

We ranked the non-rejected models first on the basis of the minimal number of source populations, assuming that a fewer number of source populations is more parsimonious. Then, if several models with the same number of sources are not rejected, we considered the P value, given that the number of SNPs in the rotating models are nearly equal (10% missingness allowed between populations). Supplementary Information section 4 details all models tested.

We first estimated the Nuwayrat genome (NUE001) and contemporary North African and West Asian populations (Levant_BA (also for each of the eight archaeological sites separately), Anatolia_BA and Morocco_MN) ancestry proportions as a combination of distal Neolithic populations from North Africa and West Asia (Morocco_Epipaleolithic, Anatolia_Neolithic, Levant_Neolithic, Zagros_Neolithic and Caucasus_Neolithic). This analysis was carried out on 433,280–558,848 SNPs. Then, we estimated NUE001, Bronze Age Levant (also for each of the eight archaeological sites separately) and Bronze Age Anatolia ancestry components, adding more proximal Neolithic and Chalcolithic North African and West Asian populations as potential sources (Morocco_EN_ktg, Morocco_MN, Anatolia_Neolithic, Anatolia_Chalcolithic, Levant_Neolithic, Levant_Chalcolithic, Zagros_Neolithic, Zagros_Chalcolithic, Mesopotamia_Neolithic, Caucasus_Neolithic and Caucasus_Chalcolithic) as well as two Neolithic Europeans: Spain_EN and Greece_Neolithic, referred to as the full qpAdm model. This analysis was conducted over 474,731–578,969 SNPs.

We estimated the ancestry proportions of the two Third Intermediate Period Egyptians20 using North African and West Asian populations who lived between the Old Kingdom and Third Intermediate periods as potential sources (NUE001, Anatolia_BA, Levant_BA, Iran_BA and Caucasus_BA), as well as a Bronze Age Greek population (Greece_Minoan). We also added Morocco_MN and Mesopotamia_N to test whether the Third Intermediate Period Egyptians share a closer ancestry with NUE001 or a source more related to one of these two ancestries present in NUE001. This analysis was conducted on 290,262 SNPs.

We directly estimated the proportion of NUE001 ancestry in present-day Egyptians164 as a whole or each individual separately, as well as ancestries from North African (Morocco_MN), West Asian (Caucasus_BA, Iran_BA and Levant_BA) and European (Greece_Minoan) populations, as well as East and West Africa (Ethiopia_4500BP.SG and Congo_Kindoki_Protohistoric). For each region, we selected the representatives closest to NUE001's lifetime. Anatolia_BA was removed from the list of West Asian groups because its inclusion led to a substantial drop-off of genomes having at least one model passing P = 0.05. This analysis was conducted on 767,305 SNPs.

We estimated the ancestry proportion in ancient East African43,54,55,144 using both NUE001 and Levantine Chalcolithic genomes as competing sources for the Eurasian-like component. We used as potential left sources NUE001, Levant_Chalcolithic, Ethiopia_4500BP.SG, Dinka.DG, Congo_Kindoki_Protohistoric and South_Africa_2200BP.SG. For this model, the following fixed right groups were used: Chimp.REF, Latvia_HG_UDG, USA_Ancient_Beringian.SG, Vanuatu_400BP_UDG, Japan_HG_Jomon_UDG and China_NEastAsia_Coastal_EN_UDG. This analysis was conducted on 141,323–350,110 SNPs.

f4 statistics of the form f4(NUE001, Morocco_MN; X, Ju_hoan_North.DG) and f4(NUE001, Morocco_MN; Mesopotamia_N, X), X being the non-North African groups used in the full qpAdm model, Palaeolithic Levant or Palaeolithic Anatolia, were estimated to confirm the probable source of admixture in the Nuwayrat genome when compared with the Middle Neolithic Moroccan group. f4 statistics was computed using ADMIXTOOLS 2 (ref. 42) with the option maxmiss = 0.1. We restricted the analysis to genomes with both transitions and transversions (half/plus UDG-treated libraries or single-stranded libraries called using SequenceTools115 --singleStrandMode). This analysis was conducted on the 1240k dataset on 280,544 SNPs.

The genotypes of the Nuwayrat genome were imputed together with 200 ancient genomes from North Africa and West Asia associated with the Palaeolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age culture (Supplementary Table 3). We restricted the imputation to whole-genome sequencing data greater than 0.5× coverage or 1240k SNP capture data greater than 2× coverage, following recommendations from Sousa da Mota et al.172.

First, we called genotypes using bcftools v.1.19 (ref. 173) with the commands bcftools mpileup with parameters -I -E -a ‘FORMAT/DP' --ignore-RG and bcftools call -Aim -C alleles. We then imputed the missing genotypes using Glimpse v.1.1.0 (ref. 174). First, we used GLIMPSE_chunk to split chromosomes into chunks of 2 Mb and with a 200-kb buffer region. Second, imputation was performed with GLIMPSE_phase on the chunks with default parameters --burn 10, --main 10 and --pbwt-depth 2, with 1000 Genomes175 as the reference panel. We then ligated the imputed chunks with GLIMPSE_ligate.

To remove transitions caused by post-mortem damage before imputation, for the genomes generated with UDG treatment, we first hard-trimmed the first and last three base pairs of each read and removed CpG sites, and for the genome generated without UDG treatment, we removed all transition sites after SNP calling.

We finally restricted the imputed genotypes to those with genotype probability ≥0.99 and minor allele frequency ≥0.01 using the command bcftools filter -i ‘MAX(FORMAT/GP)>=0.99 && INFO/RAF>=0.01&&INFO/RAF<=0.99' --set-GTs ‘.'.

The imputed dataset was used for phenotype prediction (see below) and admixture dating using DATES (Supplementary Information section 4 and Supplementary Table 11).

The genotypes responsible for skin, hair and eye colour prediction were investigated using the HIrisPlex-S system176,177,178 using the imputed genotypes.

Establishing a unified theory of cognition has been an important goal in psychology1,2. A first step towards such a theory is to create a computational model that can predict human behaviour in a wide range of settings. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behaviour in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language model on a large-scale dataset called Psych-101. Psych-101 has an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from more than 60,000 participants performing in excess of 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behaviour of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but it also generalizes to previously unseen cover stories, structural task modifications and entirely new domains. Furthermore, the model's internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after fine-tuning. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behaviour across a wide range of domains. We believe that such models provide tremendous potential for guiding the development of cognitive theories, and we present a case study to demonstrate this.

The human mind is remarkably general3. Not only do we routinely make mundane decisions, such as choosing a breakfast cereal or selecting an outfit, but we also tackle complex challenges, such as figuring out how to cure cancer or explore outer space. We learn skills from only a few demonstrations4, reason causally5 and fuel our actions through curiosity6. Whether we are climbing mountains, playing video games, or creating captivating art, our versatility defines what it means to be human.

By contrast, most contemporary computational models, whether in machine learning or the cognitive sciences, are domain specific. They are designed to excel at one particular problem and only that problem. Consider, for instance, AlphaGo, which is a computer system created by Google DeepMind to master the game of Go7. The system can play this particular game at an impressive level, but it cannot do much beyond that. A similar pattern can be observed in the cognitive sciences. For instance, prospect theory, which is one of the most influential accounts of human cognition, offers valuable insights into how people make choices8, but it tells us nothing about how we learn, plan or explore.

If we want to understand the human mind in its entirety, we must move from domain-specific theories to an integrated one. The importance of such a unified approach has already been recognized by the pioneers of our field. For example, in 1990, it was stated that “unified theories of cognition are the only way to bring [our] wonderful, increasing fund of knowledge under intellectual control”2. How can we make meaningful progress towards such theories?

An important step towards a unified theory of cognition is to build a computational model that can predict and simulate human behaviour in any domain2,9. In this paper, we take up this challenge and introduce Centaur—a foundation model of human cognition10. Centaur was designed in a data-driven manner by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art large language model11 on a large corpus of human behaviour. For this purpose, we curated a large-scale dataset called Psych-101, which covers trial-by-trial data from 160 psychological experiments (see Methods, ‘Data collection' and Extended Data Fig. 1). We transcribed each of these experiments into natural language, which provides a common format for expressing vastly different experimental paradigms12,13. The resulting dataset has an unprecedented scale, containing more than 10,000,000 human choices and including many canonical studies from domains such as multi-armed bandits, decision-making, memory, supervised learning, Markov decision processes and more (see Fig. 1a for an overview and examples).

a, Psych-101 comprises trial-by-trial data from 160 psychological experiments with 60,092 participants making 10,681,650 choices in total and involving 253,597,411 text tokens. It contains domains such as multi-armed bandits, decision-making, memory, supervised learning, Markov decision processes and others (the examples shown have been stylized and abbreviated for readability). b, Centaur is a foundation of model human cognition that is obtained by adding low-rank adapters to a state-of-the-art language model and fine-tuning it on Psych-101.

We subjected Centaur to a series of rigorous tests and demonstrate that it captures human behaviour at several levels of generalization. First, we show that Centaur predicts behaviour of held-out participants (those who are not part of the training data) better than existing cognitive models in almost every single experiment. We then demonstrate that its ability to capture human behaviour also generalizes to held-out experiments. In this context, we find that Centaur accurately predicts human behaviour under modified cover stories, problem structures and even in entirely new domains. Finally, we show that Centaur's internal representations become more human aligned, even though it was never explicitly trained to capture human neural activity.

Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is possible to discover computational models that capture human behaviour across a wide range of domains. We think that such a predictive model offers many direct opportunities to obtain a better understanding of the human mind14,15 and we present a case study that demonstrates this potential.

We built Centaur on top of the open-source language model Llama 3.1 70B, a state-of-the-art model pretrained by Meta AI (hereafter, we refer to this model simply as Llama)11. Having a large language model as the backbone allowed us to rely on the vast amounts of knowledge that is present in these models. The training process involved fine-tuning on Psych-101 using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA)16. QLoRA relies on a frozen four-bit quantized language model as a base model. Although the parameters of the base model are left unchanged, it adds low-rank adapters, which contain only a few additional, trainable parameters (typically represented in a half-precision floating-point format). In our case, we added low-rank adapters of rank r = 8 to all non-embedding layers (that is, all linear layers of the self-attention mechanisms and the feedforward networks), as illustrated in Fig. 1b. With these settings, the newly added parameters amount to 0.15% of the base model's parameters. We then trained the model for one epoch on the entire dataset using a standard cross-entropy loss. We masked out the loss for all tokens that do not correspond to human responses, thereby ensuring that the model focuses on capturing human behaviour and not on completing experimental instructions. The entire training process took approximately five days on an A100 80GB GPU (Methods, ‘Fine-tuning procedure').

We evaluated Centaur on different types of held-out data to demonstrate that it robustly captures human behaviour. In our first analysis, we tested whether it could predict the behaviour of participants who were not part of the training data. For this, we split each transcribed experiment into two parts and used 90% of participants for training and retained 10% for testing. We measured goodness-of-fit to human choices using negative log-likelihoods averaged across responses (Methods, ‘Evaluation metric'). Figure 2a presents the results of this analysis, comparing Centaur with the base model without fine-tuning and a collection of domain-specific models that represent the state-of-the-art in the cognitive-science literature (Extended Data Table 1). Although there was substantial variance in predictability across experiments (Centaur, 0.49; Llama, 0.47), fine-tuning always improved goodness-of-fit. The average difference in log-likelihoods across experiments after fine-tuning was 0.14 (Centaur negative log-likelihood, 0.44; Llama negative log-likelihood, 0.58; one-sided t-test: t(1,985,732) = −144.22, P ≤ 0.0001; Cohen's d, 0.20).

a, Difference in log-likelihood of Centaur and Llama relative to a domain-specific cognitive model for each experiment. A value of zero corresponds to the goodness-of-fit of the domain-specific cognitive model and a value above zero indicates improved goodness-of-fit to human responses. Log-likelihoods are averaged over responses (n = 992,867). Error bars correspond to the standard error of the mean. Centaur outperforms both Llama and a collection of domain-specific cognitive models in almost every experiment (one-sided t-tests: t(1,985,732) = −144.22, P ≤ 0.0001; t(1,985,732) = −127.58, P ≤ 0.0001, respectively). We only included experiments for which we have implemented a domain-specific cognitive model in this graphic and merged different studies using the same paradigm. Extended Data Table 1 contains numerical results for all experiments. b, Model simulations on the horizon task. The plot shows the probability densities over reward and an information bonus parameter for both people and simulated runs of Centaur. c, Model simulations on the two-step task. The plot shows the probability densities over reward and a parameter indicating how model-based learning was for both people and simulated runs of Centaur. d, Model simulations on a social prediction game. The plot shows the probability densities over accuracies of predicting human strategies and strategies of an artificial agent, with matched statistics for both people and simulated runs of Centaur.

Furthermore, we compared Centaur with the previously mentioned collection of domain-specific cognitive models. These models include, among others, the generalized context model17, a prospect theory model18 and various reinforcement learning models19,20 (Methods, ‘Domain-specific cognitive models'). We observed that Centaur outperforms domain-specific cognitive models in all but one experiment. The average difference in predicting human behaviour to the domain-specific cognitive models was 0.13 (cognitive models, negative log-likelihood, 0.56; one-sided t-test: t(1,985,732) = −127.58, P ≤ 0.0001; Cohen's d, 0.18). Extended Data Figs. 2 and 3 contain more comparisons to models fine-tuned on non-behavioural data and a noise-ceiling analysis.

The previous analyses have focused on predicting human responses conditioned on previously executed behaviour. We may ask whether Centaur can also generate human-like behaviour when simulated in an open-loop fashion (that is, when feeding its own responses back into the model). This setting arguably provides a much stronger test of the model's capabilities and is sometimes also referred to as model falsification21. To check whether Centaur survives this test, we ran open-loop simulations in three different experimental paradigms and inspected the distributions of statistics that resulted from these simulations. First, we simulated Centaur on the horizon-task paradigm, a two-armed bandit task used to detect different types of exploration strategies20. We found that Centaur (mean = 54.12, s.d. = 2.89) achieved a performance comparable to human participants (mean = 52.78, s.d. = 2.90), which was supported by an equivalence test using the two one-sided t-tests procedure with a ±3-point margin (P = 0.02). Centaur also engaged in a similar level of uncertainty-guided directed exploration (Fig. 2b), a pattern that is notably absent in many contemporary language models12.

We also observed that Centaur does not merely capture the behaviour of the average participant, but rather the distribution over trajectories produced by the entire population. For example, in the two-step task (a well-known paradigm used to tease apart model-free and model-based reinforcement learning19), Centaur, just like human subjects, produced trajectories in which learning is purely model-free, purely model-based and mixtures thereof (as the bimodal distribution in Fig. 2c shows).

Finally, we verified that Centaur fails at predicting non-human behaviour. For this, we considered a study that required participants to predict either human responses or responses of an artificial agent with matched statistics in four canonical economic games22. Mirroring the results of the original human study, Centaur accurately predicted human responses (64% accuracy) but struggled to predict artificial responses (35% accuracy; one-sided t-test: t(230) = 20.32, P ≤ 0.0001; Fig. 2d). Taken together, these results demonstrate that Centaur exhibits human-like characteristics across various settings, confirming that it can generate meaningful open-loop behaviour.

So far, we have shown that Centaur generalizes to previously unseen participants performing experiments that were part of the training data. A true foundation model of human cognition, however, must also capture behaviour in any arbitrary experiment, even if that experiment was not part of the training data. To probe whether Centaur has this ability, we exposed it to a series of increasingly complex out-of-distribution evaluations.

First, we investigated whether Centaur is robust in the face of changes to the cover story. For this analysis, we relied on data collected in ref. 23, which used the aforementioned two-step task. In addition to the canonical cover story (spaceships travelling to foreign planets in search of treasures), the study introduced a new cover story involving magical carpets. Importantly, Psych-101 includes experiments using the canonical spaceship cover story24 but no experiments with the magic-carpet cover story. Even so, we found that Centaur captured human behaviour in the magic-carpet experiment of ref. 23 (Fig. 3a). As in our previous analysis, we observed an improvement after fine-tuning, as well as a favourable goodness-of-fit when compared with a domain-specific cognitive model (Centaur negative log-likelihood, 0.51; Llama negative log-likelihood, 0.63; cognitive model negative log-likelihood, 0.61; one-sided t-test comparing Centaur with Llama: t(9,701) = −24.7, P ≤ 0.0001; one-sided t-test comparing Centaur with the domain-specific cognitive model: t(9,701) = −20.7, P ≤ 0.0001; the domain-specific cognitive model used in this analysis was a hybrid model that combined model-based and model-free reinforcement learning)19.

Centaur outperforms both Llama and domain-specific cognitive models when faced with modified cover stories, problem structures and entirely new domains. N/A, not applicable. Error bars show the s.e.m. The image in a is reproduced from ref. 23, Springer Nature Limited. The image in c is reproduced from Wikipedia.org.

In a second out-of-distribution evaluation, we probed whether Centaur is robust to modifications in task structure. To test this, we exposed it to a paradigm known as Maggie's farm25. Maggie's farm extends the horizon task paradigm by adding a third option. Psych-101 encompasses several two-armed bandit experiments (including the horizon task) but not Maggie's farm or any other three-armed bandit experiments (it does, however, contain multi-armed bandit experiments with more than three options to choose between). Thus, this analysis provides a test of Centaur's robustness to structural task modifications. We found that Centaur captured human behaviour on Maggie's farm, as shown in Fig. 3b. We again observed a benefit of fine-tuning, as well as a favourable goodness-of-fit compared with a domain-specific cognitive model, which did not generalize well to this setting (Centaur negative log-likelihood, 0.42; Llama negative log-likelihood, 0.62; cognitive model negative log-likelihood, 0.98; one-sided t-test comparing Centaur with Llama: t(510,153) = −204.2, P ≤ 0.0001; one-sided t-test comparing Centaur with the domain-specific cognitive model: t(510,153) = −559.8, P ≤ 0.0001).

Finally, we investigated whether Centaur could capture human behaviour even in entirely new domains. In this context, we considered a study investigating logical reasoning26. Although Psych-101 includes probabilistic and causal reasoning problems, we purposefully excluded any studies involving logical reasoning. As in the previous analyses, there was again a positive effect of fine-tuning (Centaur negative log-likelihood, 1.65; Llama negative log-likelihood, 1.92; one-sided t-test: t(198,406) = −50.39, P ≤ 0.0001; Cohen's d, 0.23; Fig. 3c). Note that we did not compare with any domain-specific cognitive model in this setting, because it is unclear how to construct a model that would make any meaningful transfer from training data that does not include any related problems.

We consolidated these results by analysing Centaur on six more out-of-distribution experimental paradigms that were not part of the training data in any shape or form (including moral decision-making27, economic games28, naturalistic category and reward learning29, behavioural propensities30 and a deep sequential decision task31). Centaur robustly captured human behaviour in all these settings, whereas smaller and non-fine-tuned models did not do so consistently (Extended Data Fig. 4).

As well as analysing human choice data, we also examined whether Centaur could predict human response times. Hick's law32 indicates that individual response times are a linear function of response entropies. Therefore, we extracted nearly 4,000,000 response times for a subset of experiments in Psych-101 and fitted three linear mixed effects models, each predicting log-transformed response times based on log-transformed response entropies derived from a different computational model. We found that the response entropies derived from Centaur captured a larger proportion of the variance in response times (conditional R2, 0.87) than those derived from Llama (conditional R2, 0.75, log[BFCentaur, Llama] = 53,773.5) and the cognitive models (conditional R2, 0.77, log[BFCentaur, cognitive models] = 14,995.5), thereby highlighting Centaur's ability to predict measures beyond pure choice data.

To demonstrate that the model does not degrade on problems it was pretrained for, we furthermore verified it on a collection of benchmarks from the machine-learning literature33,34. We found that Centaur remains stable in performance-based benchmarks, even improving over the base model in some of them34 (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b). Finally, in benchmarks that measure human alignment, we observed a shift towards human-like characteristics (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Figure 4a depicts this improved alignment on a low-dimensional embedding derived from ten behavioural metrics in CogBench, a benchmark to test the cognitive abilities of large language models33.

Control refers to a model that used representations extracted from a randomly initialized transformer model with matched architecture.

Despite being trained to match only human behaviour, we also wondered whether Centaur's internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity. To check whether this is the case, we conducted two analyses in which we predicted human neural activity using the model's internal representations35,36. We first conducted a whole-brain analysis in which we predicted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measurements of people performing the two-step task37. For this, we relied on data collected in a previous study37 involving 94 participants each making 300 choices. Participants were tested on either the magic-carpet cover story (which we had already used in one of our earlier generalization analyses) or an abstract cover story. Neither of these two cover stories was part of Centaur's training data. We extracted recordings from models' residual stream before each choice and after feedback. We then aggregated human neural activity in each region and regressed the aggregated activity on Centaur's internal representations. This procedure was then repeated separately for each participant and region (Methods, ‘Neural alignment'). Figure 4b shows the resulting Pearson correlation coefficients across layers for both Centaur and Llama averaged over measurements (n = 11,374). We found that Centaur's representations consistently outperformed Llama's representations in predicting human neural activity (all pairwise one-sided t-tests, P ≤ 0.001), indicating that fine-tuning a model on large-scale behavioural data aligned its internal representations to human neural activity. It is worth noting that this type of analysis was possible only because of the expressivity of Centaur's representations, and that using representations of a conventional cognitive model led to a substantial drop in performance (dashed line in Fig. 4b). A more fine-grained report of our results is given in Extended Data Fig. 6.

We expanded these results in a second analysis, for which we relied on a previously collected dataset involving fMRI measurements of people reading simple six-word sentences, such as “That is such a beautiful picture!”38. The primary goal of this analysis was to show that neural alignment in unrelated settings remains intact after fine-tuning on cognitive experiments. We focused on a subset of five participants who each passively read 1,000 sentences, spread across 20 experimental runs and two scanning sessions. The presented sentences were extracted from nine corpora and selected to maximize semantic diversity. We closely followed the protocol of the original study and predicted aggregated neural activity across participants in the language network. We repeated this procedure for representations extracted from different layers in both Centaur and Llama. Predictability peaked at around layer 20, as shown in Fig. 4c. This peak is consistent with the hypothesis that the intermediate layers of such models contain the most information. We performed an inverse-weighted meta-analysis39 on the difference in correlations between Centaur and Llama, and this indicated that there was a significant benefit of fine-tuning when pooling across layers (β = 0.007, 95% confidence interval [0.0002, 0.013], P = 0.045). Although this effect was consistent across layers, it was not statistically significant for any individual layer.

Psych-101 and Centaur both constitute valuable tools for scientific discovery. In the following section, we present an example of how each of them can be used to improve our understanding of human decision-making. The individual steps of this process are illustrated in Fig. 5.

a, We used Psych-101 and Centaur to guide the development of a cognitive model for a multi-attribute decision-making study41. Each panel shows the AIC for the set of models considered at the given stage, starting with the models considered in the original study. b, We asked DeepSeek-R1 to generate an explanation for the human responses and formalized the resulting verbal strategy into a formal computational model. c, We refined this model through scientific regret minimization using Centaur as a reference model. Six data points are shown for which Centaur makes accurate predictions but the DeepSeek-R1-discovered model does not. We then used this information to design a domain-specific cognitive model that is as predictive as Centaur but is still interpretable. The bicycle images in a are reproduced from Flaticon.com.

Psych-101 contains human behavioural data in a natural-language format, which means it can be readily processed and analysed by a language-based reasoning model such as DeepSeek-R1 (ref. 40). To demonstrate this use case, we asked DeepSeek-R1 to generate an explanation of participants' behaviour in a multi-attribute decision-making experiment41. In this paradigm, participants are given two different options that are each characterized by various features (in our case, four expert ratings for two products) and they must then decide which of the two options they prefer (Fig. 5a). The model produced several explanations, one of which caught our attention: “The participant employed a two-step decision-making strategy. First, they determined which product had the majority of positive ratings (1 s) across all experts. If the products were tied in the number of positive ratings, the participant then considered the rating from the highest validity expert to break the tie.” This strategy combines two well-known heuristic decision-making strategies that, as far as we know, have not been considered in this combination before. We then took this verbal strategy, implemented it as a formal computational model and found that it explained human response behaviour more accurately than the three strategies considered in the original study (a weighted-additive strategy, equal weighting and take-the-best heuristic; Fig. 5b).

However, the DeepSeek-R1-discovered model Akaike information criterion (AIC; 181.7) still fell short of the goodness-of-fit of Centaur (AIC, 72.5), indicating that there is still room for improvement. We therefore used a method known as scientific regret minimization, which uses a black-box predictive model as a reference to identify responses that are in principle predictable but are not captured by a given model42. Typically, scientific regret minimization requires the collection of a large-scale experiment-specific dataset to train this predictive model. Centaur, however, can be used out-of-the-box and without the need to collect any domain-specific data, thereby circumventing this step and broadening the scope of scientific regret minimization considerably (indeed, the multi-attribute decision-making data set under consideration contained fewer than 100 participants, placing it far out of reach for conventional scientific regret minimization). When inspecting the responses that were well predicted by Centaur but not by the DeepSeek-R1-discovered model, we observed that they all involved problems in which participants chose the option with fewer positive ratings overall but which was rated positively by a higher-validity expert (see Fig. 5c for an illustration of these problems and Methods, ‘Model-guided scientific discovery' for further details). This pattern indicates that the switch between the two heuristics is probably not as strict as initially suggested by the DeepSeek-R1-discovered strategy. To capture this, we replaced the either-or rule with a weighted average of both heuristics. We found that the model that resulted from this process matched Centaur in terms of its goodness-of-fit (AIC, 71.7) but was still interpretable. We entered the resulting AIC values of all the models in a group-level model-selection procedure43 and estimated the protected exceedance probability, which is defined as the probability that a particular model has a higher frequency within a group than all the other candidate models. The protected exceedance probability of the model that resulted from scientific regret minimization was P = 0.83. Notably, the result of this model comparison stands in contrast to the one that was conducted with the original set of models and indicates that people rely on a combination of heuristics when making decisions, as opposed to following a weighted-additive strategy44.

In this paper we have introduced Centaur, a foundation model of human cognition that was obtained by fine-tuning a state-of-the-art language model on Psych-101, which is a large-scale dataset of human behaviour. This approach allowed us to leverage the vast knowledge embedded in large language models and also align them with human behaviour13. Centaur successfully captured human behaviour and passed a wide range of out-of-distribution checks. It generalized not only to unseen participants, but also to different cover stories, structural variations and entirely new domains. In addition to analysing the model on a behavioural level, we also conducted a series of analyses on its internal representations, in which we found increased alignment with human neural activity.

We also conducted a case study demonstrating how both Psych-101 and Centaur can be used for guiding the development of predictive, yet interpretable, cognitive models. The individual steps of our procedure are generic, so it could serve as a blueprint for model-guided scientific discovery in other experimental paradigms in the future. Looking beyond this example, Centaur finds many more applications in the context of automated cognitive science45,46. It may, for instance, be used for in silico prototyping of experimental studies47. In this context, one could use the model to figure out which designs lead to the largest effect sizes, how to design a study to reduce the number of required participants or to estimate the power of an effect.

The present paper takes initial steps in leveraging Centaur to gain deeper insights into human cognition, and it also opens up exciting new avenues for future exploration. First, one could further probe Centaur's internal representations to understand how it represents knowledge and processes information. The resulting insights could, in turn, be used to generate hypotheses about knowledge representation and information processing in humans that could be validated in future experimental studies. We believe that tools such as sparse auto-encoders48 and attention map visualization49 provide promising avenues towards accomplishing this goal, and we hope to explore them in future studies.

Furthermore, it might also be possible to train models with different architectures from scratch using the dataset that we created in the process of this paper. Doing so would enable us to investigate the neural architecture of human cognition at a scale that could not have been done before. We might, for example, ask questions such as whether human information processing is better described by attention-based architectures50 or by architectures with a vector-based memory, or how much we can improve by incorporating theories from the neuroscience literature51. We expect an eventual outcome of such an approach to contain both domain-specific and domain-general modules, thereby allowing us to investigate the interplay between the two.

As far as we know, Psych-101 is already the broadest and largest dataset of human behaviour available, and we view its development as an ongoing process and plan to develop it further. The focus in its current state is largely on learning and decision-making, but we intend to eventually include more domains, such as psycholinguistics, social psychology and economic games. Experiments with information about individual differences are another source of neglected data in the current iteration of Psych-101. Ideally, we want to include all types of relevant information about subjects (including age, personality traits or socioeconomic status) in the prompt, such that a model trained on these data can capture individual differences. Experiments from developmental psychology or computational psychiatry provide an ideal source for this purpose. Finally, although we have already included some cross-cultural and meta-studies52,53,54,55, the current iteration still has a strong bias towards a Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) population56.

Eventually, we hope to provide any psychological data in a standardized format that facilitates benchmarking, thereby complementing existing efforts from the neuroscience community57,58. Although the natural-language format (together with quite a bit of reverse-engineering) used in this work allows us to express a vast range of experimental paradigms, it introduces a selection bias against experiments that cannot be expressed in natural language. The long-term objective should therefore be to move towards a multimodal data format59.

When the idea of a unified model of cognition was first proposed, researchers expressed concern that established areas of cognitive science might react negatively to such a model. In particular, they feared that the approach might be seen as unfamiliar or incompatible with existing theories, just like an “intruder with improper pheromones”60. This could lead to an “attack of the killer bees”, in which researchers in more-conventional fields would fiercely critique or reject the new model to defend their established approaches. To mitigate these concerns, the concept of a cognitive decathlon was proposed: a rigorous evaluation framework in which competing models of cognition are tested across ten experiments and judged on their cumulative performance in them. In the current work, we applied Centaur to the equivalent of 16 such cognitive decathlons, in which it was tested against numerous established models and consistently won every competition. This outcome indicates that the data-driven discovery of domain-general models of cognition is a promising research direction. The next step for future research should be to translate this domain-general computational model into a unified theory of human cognition2.

We constructed Psych-101 by transcribing data from 160 psychological experiments into natural language. Each prompt was designed to include the entire trial-by-trial history of a complete session from a single participant. The experiments included were selected using the following criteria: publicly available data on a trial-by-trial level; the possibility of transcription into text without a significant loss of information; and coverage of a broad spectrum of domains. The transcription of each experiment was done manually by the authors. Approval from the institutional review board was obtained by the individual studies as required. We designed our natural-language prompts using the following principles: instructions should follow the original study as closely as possible; simplifications were made where appropriate; and a maximum prompt length of roughly 32,768 tokens was used. Full information about all the experiments included is provided in the Supplementary Information, Example prompts.

Llama 3.1 70B was the base model for our fine-tuning procedure. We used a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as QLoRA16, which adds so-called low-rank adapters to each layer of a four-bit quantized base model. The base model was kept fixed during fine-tuning and only the parameters of the low-rank adapters were adjusted. We added low-rank adapters of rank r = 8 to all linear layers of the self-attention mechanisms and the feedforward networks. Each low-rank adapter modifies the forward pass as follows:

where XW is the (quantized) linear transformation of the base model and XL1L2 is the low-rank adapter component, with X being the input to the layer with dimensionality h and Y being the output of the layer with dimensionality o. The hyperparameter α controls the trade-off between the two. R is the set of real numbers. Low-rank adapter computations were performed in half-precision floating-point format. For further details on this technique, please see the original work16.

We fine-tuned the model for one epoch on the entire dataset using a standard cross-entropy loss (we experimented with prolonged training but found that this led to overfitting). We only back-propagated the loss at human responses and masked out the loss for all other tokens. The effective batch size was set to 32, the learning rate to 0.00005 and the weight decay to 0.01. We used an 8-bit AdamW optimizer61 with a linearly increasing warm up over the first 100 gradient steps. The fine-tuning procedure was implemented using the unsloth library (https://unsloth.ai/).

We have also trained a smaller version of Centaur, called Minitaur, that uses Llama 3.1 8B as the base model following the same recipe. Minitaur captures human behaviour close to its training distribution but generalizes less robustly than the larger model to out-of-distribution experiments (Extended Data Fig. 7). Nevertheless, we believe that Minitaur is useful for prototyping because it does not require access to any specific hardware (it runs, for instance, on the free GPU instances in Google Colab).

We used (negative) log-likelihoods averaged over responses as our evaluation metric. For experiments with multi-token responses, we summed log-likelihoods within a response and averaged across responses. We used one-sided t-tests whenever we tested whether Centaur outperformed a competing model in predicting human behaviour, because our hypotheses were directional and based on the prior expectation that Centaur would perform better. Because the number of observations in our analyses is generally large, reported significant effects survive after correcting for multiple comparisons where appropriate.

We selected as our baseline models 14 cognitive and statistical models that together cover most of the experiments in Psych-101. Further details regarding the included models and their specifications are provided in Supplementary Information, Modelling details.

For our main analysis, we were interested in predicting the behaviour of held-out participants. Therefore, we fitted a joint set of parameters for all participants in the training data and evaluated how well a model with these parameters predicts the responses of held-out participants. Mirroring the evaluation metric for the language-based models, we evaluated goodness-of-fit using (negative) log-likelihoods averaged over responses.

For the out-of-distribution evaluations, we fitted model parameters using the most similar experiment in the training set, and then we evaluated how well a model with the resulting parameters predicts human responses in the unseen setting. The most similar experiment for the magic-carpet version of the two-step task was a two-step task experiment with the default spaceship cover story. The most similar experiment for Maggie's farm was the horizon task. We included no baseline model for the logical reasoning task, because none of the experiments in the training data were similar to it.

The neural alignment analysis on the two-step task was conducted using data collected in a previous study37. We used a regularized linear regression model to predict fMRI data from internal representations of Centaur and Llama (a separate model was used for each participant and region). We fitted each of these models on data from two scanning blocks and evaluated them on data from the third. The regularization strength was selected using a nested cross-validation procedure. For each run, we split the beta maps into cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROI) using the Schaefer 2018 atlas with 100 ROIs62. We averaged the betas within each ROI, reducing the number of betas from the number of voxels to the number of ROIs. All cortical and subcortical ROIs from the atlas were evaluated. Reported Pearson correlation coefficients correspond to the average across all ROIs.

Internal representations were extracted from the models' residual stream and transformed using a principal component analysis. We set the number of retained components such that they explained 95% of the variance.

The fMRI data were preprocessed using fMRIPrep 24.0 (ref. 63). We used the default settings of fMRIPrep, and all the scans were aligned to the MNI152NLin2009cAsym atlas64. To extract effect estimates for each subtrial of the task (such as the second step of the fifth trial, or the feedback of the tenth trial), we built separate general linear models (GLMs). Each GLM included the subtrial of interest as a separate regressor, whose z-scored beta estimates were used for the alignment analysis. This part of the data was not modelled using other regressors. Furthermore, we included different regressors capturing all the first steps, all the second steps and all the feedback steps. Finally, we used six rotation and translation estimates as well as framewise displacement as noise regressors. The haemodynamic response was modelled using the spm65 model. A high-pass filter of 0.01 Hz and a Gaussian kernel with 6 mm full-width at half-maximum was applied. The GLMs were built using nilearn66.

The neural alignment analysis on the sentence-reading task was conducted using publicly available code from the original study38. No other changes were made apart from replacing GPT2-XL with Centaur and Llama. Please see the original study38 for further details.

In our model-guided scientific discovery analysis, we focused on participants in the test set to avoid any potential contamination issues. We fitted parameters of all cognitive models individually for each participant using a maximum-likelihood estimation. Models were compared with each other using the AIC. The three models from the original study were implemented by the following equations:

where xA and xB are vectors containing four expert ratings (either 0 or 1) and β is a free parameter controlling the noise level.

We prompted DeepSeek-R1 (in the Distill-Llama-70B variant) to generate explanations of human decision-making; the corresponding prompt is provided in Supplementary Information, Model-guided scientific discovery. We then formalized the explanation shown in Fig. 5b into the following computational model:

For the scientific regret minimization pipeline, we computed the difference in log-likelihoods between Centaur and the DeepSeek-R1-discovered model. We visualized and inspected the ten data points with the greatest difference. This process resulted in the following computational model:

where σ is a free parameter constrained between 0 and 1 that controls the trade-off between the two strategies.

a, Proportion of domains included in Psych-101. b, Word cloud of experimental paradigms included in Psych-101. c, We performed a data contamination analysis using the LogProber method67 for every experimental paradigm in Psych-101. LogProber fits a two-parameter exponential model to the cumulative log-likelihood of each sequence being checked for contamination. High acceleration (log B) suggests that a prompt is memorized from the pretraining data. Following the results presented in the original work67, we set a threshold for possible contamination to log B ≥ 1. This analysis indicated no evidence of contamination. d, Two-dimensional embedding of the experiments used in this paper. To obtain this embedding, we took the corresponding natural language prompts up to the point of the first human choice, extracted a vector-based representation for them using ModernBERT68, and finally projected these representations onto two dimensions using multidimensional scaling. Purple dots correspond to experiments from Psych-101, whereas the colored dots correspond to the indicated evaluation experiment.

To rule out the hypothesis that finetuning on any data aligns a model with human behavior, we compared Centaur to various Llama variants finetuned for other purposes (i.e. non-cognitive tasks). Nemotron69 is finetuned for instruction-following. Hermes70 is finetuned for various purposes, including agentic capabilities, roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, and long context coherence. Reflection is finetuned for reasoning. None of the Llama variants captures human behavior better than the base model, ruling out the hypothesis that finetuning generally leads to models that are better at predicting human behavior. Error bars correspond to the standard error of the mean, taken over responses.

We conducted a noise ceiling analysis to better understand the capabilities of Centaur. It is not straightforward to estimate the noise ceiling for experiments with sequential dependencies, which includes the majority of Psych-101. Hence, we focused on two experiments for which such an analysis is possible: a, the choices13k data set18 and b, an intertemporal choice experiment52. In both cases, we found that Centaur substantially exceeds the estimated noise ceiling. This is possible because Centaur can pick up on context-dependent patterns that are not captured by standard noise ceiling analyses. Therefore, we have performed an additional analysis testing how well Centaur can predict human responses if we prompt it to predict each response independently. We use the suffix “ind.” to indicate this way of prompting the model. Centaur still matches the performance of domain-specific cognitive models when context-independent prompts are used, amounting to roughly half of the estimated noise ceiling.

Each subplot shows negative log-likelihoods for a different experiment. None of these paradigms were included in Psych-101, hence they provide a stress test for a model's generalization capabilities. Centaur robustly captured human behavior in all of these settings, while smaller and non-finetuned models did not do so consistently. Error bars correspond to the standard error of the mean, taken over responses. We state one-sided t-tests comparing the negative log-likelihoods of Centaur to those of Llama in brackets. a, Negative log-likelihoods on moral decision-making27 (t(181388) = −103.54, p ≤ 0.0001). b, Negative log-likelihoods on economic games1 (t(7798) = −11.69, p ≤ 0.0001). c, Negative log-likelihoods on naturalistic category learning1 (t(21838) = −14.05, p ≤ 0.0001). d, Negative log-likelihoods on behavioral propensities30 (t(156230) = −11.06, p ≤ 0.0001). e, Negative log-likelihoods on naturalistic reward learning1 (t(9838) = −12.63, p ≤ 0.0001). f, Negative log-likelihoods on a deep sequential decision task31 (t(6092) = −1.06, p = 0.144).

a, Results for metabench34, a sparse benchmark containing several canonical benchmarks from the machine learning literature. We find that Centaur maintains the level of performance of Llama, indicating that finetuning on human behavior did not lead to deterioration in other tasks (ARC: z = −0.126, p = 0.9, GSM8K: z = −0.529, p = 0.597, HellaSwag: z = 0.0, p = 1.0, MMLU: z = 0.0, p = 1.0, Winogrande: z = −0.556, p = 0.578). Performance on TruthfulQA71 – which measures how models mimic human falsehoods – even improved significantly with finetuning (z = 2.312, p = 0.021; all z-test were two-sided). b, Performance-based metrics from CogBench33, a benchmark that includes ten behavioral metrics derived from seven cognitive psychology experiments. We find that – relative to Llama – Centaur's performance improves in all experiments (Probabilistic reasoning: z = 6.371, p ≤ 0.0001, Horizon task: z = 22.176, p ≤ 0.0001, Restless bandit: z = 7.317, p ≤ 0.0001, Instrumental learning: z = 0.126, p = 0.45, Two-step task: z = 1.458, p = 0.072, Balloon analog risk task: z = 1.496, p = 0.067; all z-test were one-sided). c, Behavioral metrics from CogBench. We observe that Centaur becomes more similar to human subjects in all ten behavioral metrics (Prior weighting: z = 2.176, p = 0.015, Likelihood weighting: z = 1.131, p = 0.129, Directed exploration: z = 0.525, p = 0.3, Random exploration: z = 2.014, p = 0.022, Meta-cognition: z = 2.206, p = 0.014, Learning rate: z = 0.477, p = 0.317, Optimism bias: z = 0.78, p = 0.218, Model-basedness: z = 9.608, p ≤ 0.0001, Temporal discounting: z = 2.594, p = 0.005, Risk taking: z = 1.612, p = 0.053; all z-test were one-sided).

a, Pearson correlation coefficients between the predicted activity from Centaur's representations and the BOLD data shown on a surface brain (image created with nilearn66). Centaur achieves the most accurate predictions in the left motor cortex. As participants performed the task with their right hand in the scanner, this effect may be explained by Centaur's strong performance in predicting choices. b, Predictive performance of Centaur's representations against alternatives for ROIs that have been identified as behaviorally relevant in previous work. Cortical scores are averaged over the corresponding bilateral parcels in the Schaefer atlas. The accumbens is defined based on the Harvard-Oxford atlas. Pearson correlation coefficients are shown for layer 20 but exhibit a similar pattern across all layers. Centaur outperformed Llama and the cognitive model in predicting activity in accumbens, the ROI from the original study that showed a reward prediction error effect19,37. We found a similar pattern in the medial PFC, another region that showed an effect in the original article37, as well as in the sensory and motor cortices.

a, Negative log-likelihoods relative to the domain-specific cognitive models on held-out participants from Psych-101. Error bars correspond to the standard error of the mean, taken over responses. b, Negative log-likelihoods for the two-step task with a modified cover story. c, Negative log-likelihoods for a three-armed bandit experiment. d, Negative log-likelihoods for an experiment probing logical reasoning with items based on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).

Supplementary Methods, containing prompts used for the model-guided scientific discovery analysis and details of the domain-specific cognitive models, and Supplementary Notes, containing a discussion of Centaur in the light of the criteria for a unified computational model2, and prompts for each experimental paradigm in Psych-101.

Lung cancer in never smokers (LCINS) accounts for around 25% of all lung cancers1,2 and has been associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke and air pollution in observational studies3,4,5. Here we use data from the Sherlock-Lung study to evaluate mutagenic exposures in LCINS by examining the cancer genomes of 871 treatment-naive individuals with lung cancer who had never smoked, from 28 geographical locations. KRAS mutations were 3.8 times more common in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from North America and Europe than in those from East Asia, whereas a higher prevalence of EGFR and TP53 mutations was observed in adenocarcinomas of never smokers from East Asia. Signature SBS40a, with unknown cause6, contributed the largest proportion of single base substitutions in adenocarcinomas, and was enriched in cases with EGFR mutations. Signature SBS22a, which is associated with exposure to aristolochic acid7,8, was observed almost exclusively in patients from Taiwan. Exposure to secondhand smoke was not associated with individual driver mutations or mutational signatures. By contrast, patients from regions with high levels of air pollution were more likely to have TP53 mutations and shorter telomeres. They also exhibited an increase in most types of mutations, including a 3.9-fold increase in signature SBS4, which has previously been linked with tobacco smoking9, and a 76% increase in the clock-like10 signature SBS5. A positive dose–response effect was observed with air-pollution levels, correlating with both a decrease in telomere length and an increase in somatic mutations, mainly attributed to signatures SBS4 and SBS5. Our results elucidate the diversity of mutational processes shaping the genomic landscape of lung cancer in never smokers.

a, Differences between smoker and never-smoker lung cancer cases across SBS signatures. Volcano plot (top) indicating the enrichment of SBS signature prevalence in never-smokers (left) and smokers (right) with lung cancer. Statistically significant enrichments were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models for smoking status and adjusted by age, sex, histology, genetic ancestry, and tumour purity. Firth's bias-reduced logistic regressions were used for regression presenting complete or quasi-complete separation. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons based on the total number of mutational signatures considered, and adjusted p-values were reported as FDR values. Horizontal lines marking statistically significant thresholds were included at 0.05 (dashed orange line) and 0.01 FDR levels (dashed red line). Bar plot (bottom) indicating prevalence by smoking history. b, Tumour mutational burden differences between SBS4-positive (n = 56) and negative (n = 815) LCINS tumours for SBS, DBS, ID, CN segments, and SV events. Statistical significance was evaluated using two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The line within the box indicates the median, the upper and lower ends indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers show 1.5 × interquartile range, and values outside are shown as individual data points. c–e, Mutational signature landscape for SBS (c), DBS (d) and ID (e) mutation types, including absolute and relative number of mutations assigned to each mutational signature, unsupervised clustering based on the signature contributions, and sample-level annotations of sex, genetic ancestry, passive smoking, and accuracy of signature reconstruction based on cosine similarity. f, Driver mutations landscape, including different types of genomic alterations, as well as sample-level annotations of sex, genetic ancestry, histology, and tumour purity. g, Enrichment of EGFR p.L858R hotspot driver mutations in SBS4-positive tumours from never-smokers compared to smokers using multivariable logistic regressions considering clinical and epidemiological covariates, including age, sex, genetic ancestry, histology, and tumour purity (n = 5 mutated non-smoker cases, n = 1 mutated smoker case, n = 51 non-smoker wild-type cases, n = 301 smoker wild-type tumours). Error bars indicate 95% CIs.

a,b, Distribution of SBS4 mutations with replication timing in our cohort of never-smokers (a) and in the smokers from the PCAWG cohort (b). Data are separated into deciles, with each segment harbouring 10% of the observed replication time signal in the x-axis, and the normalized mutational density displayed in the y-axis. Black dashed lines represent the behaviour of simulated mutations. c,d, Association of SBS4 mutations with nucleosome occupancy in never-smokers (c) and smokers (d). The solid blue line represents real somatic mutations, whereas the dashed grey line indicates the distribution of simulated mutations. Both lines show the average nucleosome signal in the y-axis, using a genomic window of 2 kilobases centred around the SBS4-associated mutations in the x-axis. e,f, Strand asymmetry of SBS4-associated mutations in comparison to simulations and considering lagging and leading DNA strands, transcribed and untranscribed DNA regions and genic and intergenic genomic locations in never-smokers (e) and smokers (f). The number of circles represents the odds ratio and the colour the corresponding strand/region of statistically significant asymmetries.

a–e, Differences in DBS, ID, CN, and SV burden using univariate comparisons based on two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests (a) as well as multivariable linear regressions considering clinical and epidemiological covariates (b–e), including age, sex, genetic ancestry, and tumour purity (n = 250 passive smokers, n = 208 non-passive smokers). The line within the box indicates the median, the upper and lower ends indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers show 1.5 × interquartile range, and values outside are shown as individual data points (a). Error bars indicate 95% CIs (b–e). f, Enrichment of mutational signatures derived from DBS, ID, CN, and SV alterations. Horizontal lines marking statistically significant thresholds were included at 0.05 (dashed orange line) and 0.01 FDR value levels (dashed red line). Statistical significance was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models for passive smoking history and adjusted by age, sex, genetic ancestry, histology and tumour purity.

a,b, Differences in the number of CN segments and SV events using univariate comparisons based on two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests (a) as well as multivariable linear regressions, considering clinical and epidemiological covariates (b), including age, sex, genetic ancestry, histology, and tumour purity, for patients diagnosed in geographical regions with high and low PM2.5 exposure levels (threshold defined at 20 μg m−3; n = 440 high-pollution group, n = 413 low-pollution group; only samples for which the country of origin was known are included). The line within the box indicates the median, the upper and lower ends indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers show 1.5 × interquartile range, and values outside are shown as individual data points (a). Error bars indicate 95% CIs (b). c, Volcano plots indicating enrichment of mutational signatures derived from CN and SV alterations. Horizontal lines marking statistically significant thresholds were included at 0.05 (dashed orange line) and 0.01 FDR value levels (dashed red line). Statistical significance was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models for PM2.5 exposure levels and adjusted by age, sex, genetic ancestry, histology, and tumour purity.

a,b, Box plots comparing the mutations assigned to SBS5 (a) and the estimations for the telomere length ratio between the tumour and normal samples (b). Two-sided Student's t-tests were used to calculate statistical significance. The line within the box indicates the median, the upper and lower ends indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers show 1.5 × interquartile range. n = 5 (control mice) and n = 5 (PM2.5-exposed mice); data from a previous study49.

a, Quantification of SBS burden excluding SBS4 mutations for patients living in geographical regions with high and low PM2.5 exposure levels (threshold defined at 20 μg m−3; n = 440 high-pollution group, n = 413 low-pollution group; only samples for which the country of origin was known are included). Statistical significance was evaluated using two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests. The line within the box indicates the median, the upper and lower ends indicate the 25th and 75th percentiles, whiskers show 1.5 × interquartile range, and values outside are shown as individual data points. b, Forest plot corresponding to a multivariable linear regression considering high or low PM2.5 exposure group, age, sex, genetic ancestry, histology and tumour sample purity as covariates and SBS burden as independent variable (threshold defined at 20 μg m−3; n = 440 high-pollution group, n = 413 low-pollution group; only samples for which the country of origin was known are included). Error bars indicate 95% CIs. c, Scatter plot showing a significant correlation between individual sample estimates of PM2.5 exposure and SBS burden. Statistical significance was evaluated using a multivariable linear regression of the individual PM2.5 estimates per sample and mutation burden (log10 scale), and adjusted by age, sex, genetic ancestry, histology and tumour purity. Blue lines and bands indicate univariate linear regressions and 95% CIs for average mutation burden versus average PM2.5 estimates.

Gene therapy for congenital deafness has shown promising results in children but lacks data in older populations. We conducted a single-arm trial of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-OTOF gene therapy using the Anc80L65 capsid in ten participants with autosomal recessive deafness 9 aged 1.5 to 23.9 years at five sites in China. The primary endpoints were safety and tolerability within 5 years, and secondary endpoints assessed auditory function. Initial findings from the ten patients with 6–12 months of follow-up, including one patient who received two injections, revealed that the therapy was well tolerated, with 162 grade I/II adverse events. Decreased neutrophil percentage was the most common event (16 of 162). All ten participants had at least 6 months of follow-up and improved their pure-tone-average hearing level from baseline 106 ± 9 (mean ± s.d.) to 52 ± 30 decibels (dB). Other secondary endpoints showed similar improvements, including the average click auditory brainstem response (ABR) threshold, the tone-burst ABR threshold and the auditory steady-state response (101 ± 1 to 48 ± 26 dB, 91 ± 4 to 57 ± 19 dB and 80 ± 14 to 64 ± 21 dB, respectively). Post hoc analyses were conducted to evaluate the timecourse and factors contributing to the hearing improvement. Therapeutic effect was rapid, taking 1 month to achieve most of the overall hearing improvement. On an individual level, click and tone-burst ABR thresholds, but not the auditory steady-state response, reliably predicted the behavioral pure-tone-average thresholds after 4 months (R2 = 0.68, 0.73 and 0.17, respectively). An age-dependent therapeutic effect was observed, with optimal outcomes in 5- to 8-year-olds. These preliminary results show that AAV-OTOF was safe and well tolerated in patients ranging from toddlerhood to adulthood. The trial remains ongoing and requires extended follow-up to confirm the long-term safety and efficacy. ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT05901480.

At the outset of the trial, we omitted a data sharing provision from the consent documents signed by participants. As a result, in accordance with our Ethics Committee policies, we are not authorized to release the raw data to the public. Furthermore, the study is still in progress. Instead, de-identified patient characteristics and hearing threshold improvements from raw datasets generated in this study are already included in the paper. Request for more information about the raw data is subject to a confidentiality agreement with Southeast University and Otovia Therapeutics Inc., and must comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Qualified researchers may request access to the trial information by contacting renjiec@seu.edu.cn. The requests will be fulfilled within 120 days, and data transfer agreement may be required.

Arrows indicated the variants in OTOF alleles. Two variants inherited from the same parent are located on the same allele in participants 4 and 8, which represents a cis variant situation. Variants in Participants 1, 6 and 10 were homozygous in biallelic OTOF. Mutation c.1927G>A in participant 8 was confirmed by the sequencing result of antisense chain, so as the c.5108delinsTCTT in participant 9's mother.

The Permian–Triassic Mass Extinction (PTME), the most severe crisis of the Phanerozoic, has been attributed to intense global warming triggered by Siberian Traps volcanism. However, it remains unclear why super-greenhouse conditions persisted for around five million years after the volcanic episode, with one possibility being that the slow recovery of plants limited carbon sequestration. Here we use fossil occurrences and lithological indicators of climate to reconstruct spatio-temporal maps of plant productivity changes through the PTME and employ climate-biogeochemical modelling to investigate the Early Triassic super-greenhouse. Our reconstructions show that terrestrial vegetation loss during the PTME, especially in tropical regions, resulted in an Earth system with low levels of organic carbon sequestration and restricted chemical weathering, resulting in prolonged high CO2 levels. These results support the idea that thresholds exist in the climate-carbon system whereby warming can be amplified by vegetation collapse.

The latest Permian to Early Triassic (~252–247 million years ago; Ma) was a period of intense environmental and biotic stress1,2. During the Permian–Triassic Mass Extinction (PTME) at ~252 Ma, around 81–94% of marine invertebrate species and 89% of terrestrial tetrapod genera became extinct2. It is generally agreed that the PTME was driven by volcanogenic carbon emissions from Siberian Traps volcanism, potentially coupled with additional thermogenic releases, resulting in intense greenhouse warming3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10. A major negative excursion in carbonate δ13C ratios, over a time interval of about 50–500 thousand years (kyrs), supports the notion of a major carbon cycle perturbation4,5,6. However, it is not well understood why the extreme hothouse climate persisted throughout the 5 million years (Myrs) of the Early Triassic. The precise time interval of Siberian Traps degassing is uncertain, although the main phase of volcanism occurred around the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB), possibly with a further pulse about two million years later, during the Smithian Substage of the Early Triassic8. Nevertheless, it would normally be expected that atmospheric CO2 and global surface temperature should have declined to pre-volcanism levels within ~100 kyr of the volcanic pulses, due to amplified global silicate weathering and/or increased burial of organic carbon2.

The unusual multimillion-year persistence of super-greenhouse conditions has sparked considerable debate, and it has been suggested that it may be linked to a change in the silicate weathering feedback, such that CO2 could not be efficiently removed from the surface system11. This could potentially have been due to reduced availability of weatherable material from erosion11, which would limit global silicate weathering rates12,13. Alternatively, continental weathering may have been rapid and accompanied by high rates of reverse weathering in a silica-rich ocean, removing silicate mineral-derived cations into clays instead of forming carbonate minerals, and thus limiting overall CO2 drawdown14,15. These are intriguing hypotheses, but it remains unclear why a severe reduction in global erosion, and/or an episode of high ocean silica levels, would necessarily persist for ~5 Myrs and then recover during the Middle Triassic. Although uncertain, existing compilations of sedimentation rates16,17 and the maintenance of sporadic siliceous rock records across and after the PTME18 (see Supplementary Fig. S1) are not clearly supportive of these timings, and suggest that while these processes likely contributed to climate regulation, our understanding of the timeframe of super-greenhouse conditions remains incomplete.

Here, we explore a further mechanism for elevated Early Triassic temperatures that is closely tied to the timeframe of extreme warmth. This approach is based on the concept of an ‘upper temperature steady state', in which a change in the Earth system caused the climate-carbon cycle to stabilize at a much higher global temperature for millions of years19. Specifically, we investigate the hypothesis that the key driver of the transition to a super greenhouse Earth was the dramatic and prolonged reduction of low-latitude terrestrial biomass caused by the PTME20,21 and its delayed recovery22. Tropical peat-forming ecosystems are responsible for substantial drawdown of CO2, but these extensive biomes were lost at the end of the Permian20,23,24,25. Indeed, plant species richness and abundance dropped significantly during the Permian–Triassic transition, which is the only genuine mass extinction level event of land plants through the whole Phanzerzoic26, leaving a multimillion year “coal gap” in the Early to Middle Triassic where terrestrial plant materials did not build up as peat20,23,25. To test this hypothesis, we quantify the distribution of terrestrial plant productivity across the PTME and Early-to-Middle Triassic from the plant fossil record and use this information to guide a linked climate-biogeochemical model of the Early Triassic hothouse, testing whether these biotic changes may have resulted in a higher temperature steady state.

Our plant fossil database, including macrofossil and palynology data from the latest Permian to the Middle Triassic, is summarized in Fig. 1 and further detailed in Supplementary Tables S1–S3. Non-marine chronostratigraphy comes from recently published data (Fig. S3, “Methods” 1), with lithological, sedimentary features, and clastic strata thickness in each basin evaluated for the influence of taphonomy on plant fossil and biomass preservation (see SI text 1 for details). Considering the correlation resolution achievable for terrestrial strata, this study uses a stage-level resolution as used in previous studies on the Permian-Triassic transition20. Having correlated localities using carbon isotope stratigraphy and mercury peaks, we show, using plant biomarker data from many localities, the collapse of terrestrial floras occurred around the Permian-Triassic Boundary, with most losses in the latest Permian27,28. Statistical methods, including Squares and interpolation diversity testing, were used to evaluate the influence of fossil sampling intensity, and demonstrate that our approach is robust to variation in fossil density at the global scale (see “Materials and Methods” 4 for details) (Fig. 2).

Plotted in 15-degree latitude bins for each stage. Horizontal coordinates show taxa number and vertical coordinates show latitude. Shading shows ‘high latitudes' (-45°–−90° and 45°–90°) and ‘low-middle latitudes' (−45°–45°). Bins with less than three species have been plotted as ‘0', while missing points indicate an estimated diversity of more than three times the observed value. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

As fossil plants are typically fragmented prior to fossilization, all plant fossil records were normalized20,29 to reduce artefacts of palaeobotanical nomenclature (see “Methods” 2 for details). Normalization compensates for the palaeobotanical practice of assigning different plant organs (e.g., roots, stems, leaves, cones and seeds) of the same plant to separate fossil genera and species20. We selected a plant organ whose fossil taxonomy is most likely to reflect the whole plant taxonomy and omitted other organs that belong to the same plant group, to avoid duplication29. As an example, normalization removed ~20% of the South China Changhsingian macro plant species as duplicates20. We identified parent plants of plant microfossil (spore and pollen) data where known, to supplement plant macrofossil records. Plant macrofossils mostly recorded the lowland vegetation landscape, while plant micro fossils also record upland plant species richness information20,29,30.

Diversity estimates and inferences from plant morphological traits were used to construct climate-linked plant biomes, then this information was collectively used to extrapolate biomes across corresponding climate zones (see “Methods” 5 for details). The analysis of plant character and function across palaeogeographic regions involved three steps. First, plant morphological traits related to physiological functions were extracted from plant fossils. Among all plant functional traits, whole plant height and shape, position in the flora, leaf size, vein type, vein density and relative cuticle thickness, which are related to plant productivity, biomass and water requirements/resistance to drought, were measured or semi-quantitatively estimated in late Permian to Middle Triassic plant fossils (Table S5)31,32. Floras were assigned using the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system according to their habitat information within the plant functional traits (see “Methods” 5 for details, Table S6). For example, gigantopterids are assigned to the rainforest group with giant leaves, ‘drip tips' and intricate vein networks, indicating their high moisture requirements and high efficiency of carbon and nutrient transport, similar to recent angiosperm dominant rainforest20,31,33,34. The Cathaysian flora with a high proportion of gigantopterids is of high spatial complexity, including a canopy of tall Lepidodendron lycopod trees, diverse understory tree ferns and sphenophytes, and gigantopterids and ferns, supporting the presence of widespread late Permian rainforests in the South China Lowland (see Supplementary Table S5, S6). Secondly, the floristic information from the known floras and fossil plants was assigned to the less known floras by comparing the similarity in plant taxon composition (see “Methods” 6 for details). The floral comparison is partly based on macrofossil family level clustering, and partly on the species richness in each morphological category. Thirdly, we expanded our reconstructed plant distributions beyond the fossil evidence by assuming they would colonize any regions of tolerable climate—aiming to capture ‘hidden' communities such as the upland gymnosperms recorded in the palynological record20,25,29,35 (see “Methods” 7 for details). Plant fossil records combined with lithological indicators of local climate (e.g., coals, evaporites, tillites), were transferred onto a palaeogeographic grid map with a resolution of 40 × 48 (Fig. 3). These local (i.e., per grid box) data were then used collectively to extrapolate biomes across corresponding climate zones. Terrestrial tetrapod fossil occurrences served as an indicator for the existence of vegetation to aid in extrapolation, whereas lithological indicators of aridity are used to prevent extrapolation into desert regions (see “Methods” 8 for details) (Fig. 3).

See Methods for details. ‘Plant fossil occurrence' represents raw plant fossil data (Supplementary Table S1 and S2), ‘Land tetrapod+Plant fossil' represents terrestrial tetrapod occurrence data superimposed on land plant fossil data (Supplementary Table S3), ‘Vegetation Zone' is the interpolation of that data using lithological indicators of climate zonation (Supplementary Table S5), and NPP is reconstructed based on the present day (Supplementary Table S6 and S7). End Permian Changhsingian: M, N, O, P; Early Triassic Induan: I, J, K, L; Early Triassic Olenekian: E, F, G, H; Middle Triassic Anisian: A, B, C, D; Modern world: Q. All maps are centered around 0,0. Tetrapod data is from Allen et al.36 The palaeogeographic reconstructions are from the GEOCLIM model.

Figures 1 and 2 highlight the more substantial extinction of low–middle latitude (−45°N–45°S) tropical–subtropical vegetation, especially lowland forests, during the PTME, with 86% macrofossil species extinction in low–middle latitudes, as opposed to 66% in high latitudes (see Table S5). The published local sedimentological and lithological surveys from Siberia, Xinjiang, NW China, SW China, Utah, western Europe, South Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and Argentina, spanning a broad spectrum of latitudes from north to south, show that the ‘coal gap' after the PTME was not associated with a significant loss of river or delta sediments in these areas (Figure S3, see “Methods” 9 for details). The existence of low diversity pioneer floras in South China indicates that the preservation window was not closed even in some Early Triassic low-latitude areas with the highest post-PTME temperatures and extinction magnitude20. Therefore, it appears that the removal of vegetation (especially lowland plants), rather than taphonomy, was likely the main cause of the low plant abundance, low sedimentary organic carbon contents, and general lack of other plant-related chemicals such as biomarkers in sediments during the Early Triassic20. Before the PTME, plant macrofossil species richness was greatest in low–mid latitude areas, while after the crisis, high latitude richness was much higher (Figs. 1B, 2). Although we compiled all published fossil data known to us, and investigated the sedimentary facies and thickness of documented sections to minimize the influence of taphonomic bias, the complexity of the Earth system remains challenging to fully reconstruct. Nevertheless, we believe that this study offers valuable approaches to addressing this issue and represents a significant step toward improving our understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of flora during the PTME and its aftermath.

The reversal of the modern latitudinal diversity gradient is also seen in terrestrial tetrapods after the PTME36, suggesting that this biogeographic transition may have been ubiquitous across ecosystems on land. The tetrapod “Dead Zone” between 30°N and 40°S may reflect the extinction of terrestrial primary producers in low–middle latitude lowland areas with limited upland survivors37 (Figs. 1B, 2). The latitudinally symmetric pattern of the terrestrial biosphere suggests that the primary extinction mechanism had a similarly distributed spatial impact. Evidence suggest that the various potential factors related to volcanism, including acid rain, heavy metals, toxic gases, UVB radiation, and climate change, may have possibly contributed to the terrestrial extinction2,9,24,38,39,40,41. Among these, climate change induced by LIP activity stands out for its global and latitudinal effects22. Application of the HadCM3 climate model suggests that extreme climatic consequences—such as El Niño-driven intensified heat stress and seasonal aridity—were prevalent in low- to mid-latitude regions9. These regions notably lack plant and tetrapod fossils after the PTME, suggesting that these climate changes likely served as a primary driver of terrestrial extinctions9.

Figure 1A and S2 show that the global terrestrial palaeophytogeographical feature of the Permian–Triassic interval is the replacement of the low-latitude tropical Cathaysian flora, the low–middle latitude temperate–subtropical Euramerica flora, the high-latitude boreal Angara flora, meridional Gondwana flora, and mixed floras, by a uniform herbaceous lycopod-dominated flora in the Early Triassic, in general accord with previous studies with more limited global coverage20,21,42,43. During the PTME, high latitude areas such as Siberia, and high-altitude areas at low to middle latitudes including parts of China, the Middle East and Euramerica, provided a refuge, while the expansion of high temperatures and seasonal aridity saw the loss of most lowland and marsh plants in the lower latitudes of the Early Triassic20,25,30,35,44,45,46. According to the plant functional traits recorded in macrofossils, the pre-extinction lowlands from low to high latitude around the Tethys Ocean were covered by arborescent forests with a canopy layer possibly reaching 50 m high, which were replaced by herbaceous ground covers with heights from 0.05 to 2 m in most low to middle latitude areas (Fig, 2; Table S5). In parallel to the reduced plant height and floral spatial complexity, leaf size also decreased in both compound and simple leaf groups, inferring that high productivity forests were replaced by smaller biomass communities with lower productivity in lowlands20,30,35 (Table S5). Thus, while plant global diversity may not have suffered a catastrophe at the PTME in upland areas45, the diversity and biomass in low-middle latitude lowland areas was substantially reduced20,23,25. After the inhospitable Induan stage (251.9–249.9 Ma), plants gradually migrated out from refuge areas during the Olenekian stage (249.9–246.7 Ma). Further recovery in the Middle Triassic Anisian stage (246.7 ~ 241.5 Ma) saw tropical biomes reappear at low latitudes, as well as the resumption of coal deposition20,23 (Fig. 1).

To produce a map of palaeo-productivity from our distribution of biomes, we rely on evidence from the present47. Key Carboniferous plants likely had growth and transpiration rates similar to modern angiosperms47. Therefore, we assume that Permian to Triassic plants, either related or analogous to these Carboniferous species or resembling modern plants, functioned like today's angiosperms and gymnosperms47,48,49 (see “Methods” 8). The Net Primary Productivity on Land (NPPL) of each grid cell in our palaeogeographic reconstructions (Fig. 3) was determined using these nearest living plant functional type that shares a similar plant size and form, basic spatial structure, function, diversity, geographic location and climate zone. Within each plant functional type, there is normally more than one recent flora that fits the requirement of each palaeo flora, and these recent floras are arranged from high to low NPPL to run the sensitivity tests, with only the highest and lowest members shown in Table S7. Here, we aim to generate the general land vegetation productivity trend across the PTME in a consistent comparative system within the palaeo- and modern plant functional types rather than using vegetation modeling. This is because although dynamic vegetation models have simulated similar NPPL to our Changhsingian estimates, they do not yet incorporate experimental data on plant response to extreme hothouse conditions like those of the Early Triassic49,50.

Our NPPL estimates based on these palaeogeographic reconstructions show fluctuations from ~54.4–62.5 Pt C/yr in the latest Permian Changhsingian, to a low of ~13.0–19.7 Pt C/yr in the Early Triassic Induan (a loss of ~70%), followed by Olenekian values of ~25.0–32.2 Pt C/yr, with ~53.8–63.5 Pt C/yr in the Anisian. Before the PTME, the global terrestrial productivity gradient correlated with latitude, with the highest values in the tropics, similar to the modern world48,51. However, this trend dramatically reverses after the PTME, as regions of high productivity migrated from low-to-high latitudes, before gradually re-establishing the previous gradient during the Olenekian and Anisian stages (Fig. 3). Comparison of fossil-based reconstructions are broadly consistent with simplified plant thermal adaption modeling22,48 and show loss of low to -mid latitude forests, survival at higher latitudes, and a major productivity collapse post-extinction.

Our fossil-based reconstructions thus far represent ‘biogeographic productivity', which we define as a productivity metric that does not consider the effects of CO2 fertilization. This mechanism would be expected to increase productivity, given generally higher CO2 in Earth's past19,51,52 and especially in the Early Triassic7. To test the biogeochemical and climatic effects of these shifts in plant biogeography while also taking CO2 fertilization into account, we use our palaeobiogeographic reconstructions as inputs to the SCION Earth Evolution Model52,53. SCION is a global climate-biogeochemical model that links steady-state 3D climate54 and surface processes to a biogeochemical box model55. It calculates continental weathering rates at each grid point on the land surface based on local temperature, runoff and erosion rates, as well as an assumed biotic enhancement factor (fbiota). In order to calculate Net Primary Productivity on Land (NPPL) in SCION, we used the biogeographic productivity estimates from our maps (Fig. 3), and then added an established function for the CO2 fertilization effect56 (see “Methods” 10), based on the modeled CO2 concentration at the current model timestep. The land vegetation productivity after the CO2 fertilization effect has been applied is named NPPLf.

We then modified the biotic weathering enhancement factor (fbiota) based on the fossil-based NPPLf in each grid cell, allowing for a 4-fold enhancement between the most and least productive grid cells as a conservative estimate (see refs. 57,58,59 for a range of estimates of this factor, and Methods 10 and 11 for model runs with different factors). In order to modify the global rate of organic carbon burial, we summed the total fossil based NPPLf for each time period and used this to scale the flux of terrestrially derived organic carbon burial (see Methods 10 for details). Marine productivity and organic carbon burial is also calculated in the model based on limiting nutrient availability52. Aside from these biotic changes, the SCION model retains the Phanerozoic scale forcing information from previous standard runs52, including background tectonic CO2 degassing. The only abiotic alteration to the model was to include additional CO2 degassing from the Siberian Traps60, which accurately reproduces the shorter term (~500 kyr) carbon isotope perturbations across the PTME (Fig. 4D). The model is initialized at 300 Ma with present day CO2 concentration, but quickly achieves a long-term steady state equivalent to the Phanerozoic-scale model52.

The vegetation NPP is prescribed onto the land surface in the SCION model (A) and affects the model calculations for organic carbon burial and the biotic enhancement of continental weathering (B). The model is run with (green solid line) and without (black dashed line) the fossil-prescribed NPP, where both models include the Siberian Traps degassing. C Ocean 87Sr/86Sr compared to McArthur et al.116 (blue solid line). D Carbonate δ13C compared to the dataset of Sun et al.10 (blue solid line with points). E Atmospheric CO2. F Surface air temperature at chosen timepoints. G Equatorial surface air temperature (SAT) compared to the equatorial SSTs of Sun et al.10 (blue solid line with points). All the geological records have been correlated based on chronostratigraphic correlation with the GTS (2020). The palaeogeographic reconstructions are from the GEOCLIM model.

Figure 4 shows the SCION model results through the latest Permian, and the Early and Middle Triassic, both with and without the inclusion of our palaeo-vegetation constraints. In the control run (dashed black line), the biogeographic NPP of each continental grid cell is kept constant at 420 g C/m2/yr to produce an overall productivity similar to our late Permian fossil-constrained vegetation map, and all changes in the model environment are driven by abiotic forcings, such as background tectonic degassing rates and Siberian Traps degassing. The major features of this default run are the spikes in CO2 concentration and temperature (Figs. 4E, 4G), and the accompanying δ13C excursion (Fig. 4D), driven by Siberian Traps degassing. The magnitude of the isotope excursion is consistent with the geological record and previous modeling5,60, and CO2 concentration rises from about 1,500 to 3,000 ppm, with a corresponding increase in equatorial surface temperature of about 2°C. The high background CO2 level and relatively small temperature increase are both features of the low climate sensitivity in the FOAM climate model61, which provides the steady state 3D climate emulator for SCION. Thus, we expect that a more complex model might allow for a more dramatic temperature increase and lower overall CO2 levels, as suggested by some proxy data7,10. However, no amount of climate model complexity can account for the data-model mismatch during the Early Triassic, where model temperatures decline immediately after the cessation of Siberian Traps emissions. Because SCION has a single-box ocean, it does not balance sub-million-year alkalinity and shallow sea carbonate deposition as accurately as multi-box models, in which CO2 levels decline even more rapidly60.

When included in the model, the loss of vegetation productivity from the end Permian through the Early Triassic, and the related effects on continental weathering, result in a sustained high atmospheric CO2 content7 and high Early Triassic temperatures10 (green line in Fig. 4C). In these model runs, the reduction in terrestrial organic carbon burial and nullification of silicate weathering result in CO2 levels stabilizing at around 7000 ppm, with maximum equatorial surface temperatures of up to 33–34 °C over a ~ 5 Myr period, which is consistent with proxy inferences (Fig. 4)7,10. As before, low climate sensitivity in our model results in predictions of high CO2 concentrations, although the magnitude of predicted increase (~4 fold) is broadly equivalent to that suggested by proxies7. The modeled Early Triassic δ13C level (green line in Fig. 4D) is also around 2–3‰ lower than the control run (black dashed line in Fig. 4D), generally improving the fit to the geological record10 (blue solid line with dots in Fig. 4D). Two exceptions to the data-model fit are the Induan–Olenekian (Dienerian–Smithian) boundary and the late Olenekian (early Spathian), which are marked by transient positive carbon isotope excursions that may have been driven by increasing marine productivity, transgression, or marine anoxia8,10, none of which are considered in our stage level study. Model strontium isotope ratios, which are influenced by continental weathering fluxes and source lithologies, are not greatly affected by the inclusion of vegetation collapse, but show a slightly greater rise between the Changhsingian and Anisian as weathering migrates to higher latitudes and away from low latitude suture zones with low 87Sr/86Sr values62 (Fig. 4C, see Supplementary Fig. S4 for lithological map, and Methods 11). Our SCION model demonstrates how the prolonged hothouse environment could have been terminated by progressive terrestrial ecosystem recovery, starting in the Olenekian but accelerating in the Anisian, which is also consistent with the observed uptick in δ13C values across the Olenekian–Anisian boundary and the cooling which occurred during this time10. This dynamic fits with broader evidence for a more benign environment during the re-establishment of diverse ecosystems in Middle Triassic terrestrial settings20,35. A ‘CO2 fertilization' effect occurs in the model in the early stages of warming, before atmospheric CO2 and land surface temperatures reach saturation point for C3 plant photosynthesis. However, this increased local productivity in some areas was insufficient to offset the global decline in biomass abundance.

In our model scenario, the reduction in continental silicate weathering intensity caused by decreased plant productivity had a greater impact on increasing atmospheric CO2 than the direct effect of a decline in organic carbon burial (see Fig. S6). This is because while the large reduction in terrestrially derived organic carbon burial acts to increase CO2 levels, it also decreases atmospheric oxygen levels and redistributes nutrients to the ocean, meaning that more marine organic carbon is produced and preserved, and less fossil organic carbon is weathered. Several limitations of our approach may be responsible for under-predictions of the magnitude of temperature rise. The negative feedback on the organic carbon cycle may be too strong, which may be why SCION fails to replicate more rapid variation in Phanerozoic atmospheric O252. Additionally, the weathering of sedimentary organic carbon likely increases with temperature63, which is not accounted for in the model, and may nullify these negative feedbacks further. A further uncertainty in our modeling is the degree to which plants amplify continental weathering, as shown in Figure S6, with the ‘best guess' values from Phanerozoic-scale models of plant weathering strength (being a 4–7 fold enhancement52,57.) producing different magnitudes of warming. Previously suggested mechanisms for Early Triassic warmth, such as limited erosion rates or amplified reverse weathering, also potentially played a part in the extreme warmth11,14. They are not included in our model due to the difficulty in quantifying their magnitudes and their timeframes of operation, but they could feasibly raise CO2 and surface temperature further.

Our study provides a quantitative estimation of changes to global palaeo-plant biomass and corresponding long-term environmental impacts. Through our modeling, we show that the large and prolonged decrease in tropical plant productivity in the Early Triassic likely resulted in a world that was lethally hot by Phanerozoic standards, a consequence of substantially weakened terrestrial carbon sequestration rates. These conditions persisted for nearly five million years and cooling was only achieved as plant productivity began to increase in the Middle Triassic. We believe this case study indicates that beyond a certain global temperature, vegetation die-back will occur, and can result in further warming through removal of vegetation carbon sinks. Our study demonstrates that thresholds exist in the Earth system that can accelerate climate change and have the potential to maintain adverse climate states for millions of years, with dramatic implications for global ecosystem behavior.

The geological timings used in this paper are from the Geological Time Scale (GTS) 2020. Selected study areas (and sites) are the Kuznetsk Basin in Siberia, Junggar Basin (Dalongkou section) in Xinjiang, NW China, eastern Yunnan and western Guizhou in SW China, Utah in USA, Germanic Basin in western Europe, small Tethyan continents, now incorporated in southeastern Asia, Turkey in the Dead Sea area, Kashmir in NW India, Karoo Basin in South Africa, Sydney Basin in Australia, Prince Charles Mountains in Antarctica, and Argentina, covering the published plant fossil bearing areas from various latitudes (Fig. S2). We reviewed the published chronostratigraphic correlations between the floral records, other environmental events, and the lithological Permian-Triassic Boundary in each area to determine the global pattern of plant evolution. Chronostratigraphy of the non-marine strata is correlated by fossil assemblages including animals and plants, detrital zircon ages, and geological events recorded by geochemical proxies. The detailed records and analysis of each location are provided in the Supplementary Information text 1.

From the evidence noted in the SI part 1, it is clear that end-Permian terrestrial crisis happened in the late Changhsingian over an interval starting 750 kyrs before the PTB up to shortly after the boundary20,64,65,66,67. In high latitudes, the macrofossil records show Cordaites in Siberia and the Glossopteris flora in Gondwana disappeared in the mid to late Changhsingian68,69. An abundant flora of ferns, seed fern peltasperms, cycadophytes and conifers survived through the PTB in the high latitudes20,68,69. In our analysis, plant fossil occurrences were noted at the stage level giving the impression that all the plant changes were near the PTB.

Plant macrofossils are typically fragmented into different parts (organs) prior to fossilization, with each part often named separately using Linnean binomials29,70. We normalized the dataset to correct for duplications in which different parts of the same plant are included under different species or genus names, and ensured the same taxa with different morphological names could be linked. In normalization, organs such as species or genera of seeds, trunks, roots and leaves are removed from the dataset if another organ from that plant group is more likely to reflect the whole plant taxonomy, so that each whole plant is counted only once29,70. An example is the diverse trunk group of tree lycopods, where species of Lepidodendron are used as they are abundant and systematically informative29,70, rather than other organs produced by the same plant, including cones, sporophylls (fertile leaves) or roots (see ref. 20 for detail). For diverse leaf groups, for example, ferns and sphenophytes, leaf species or genera are used, as these fossils typically lack more distinctive organs with suitable preservation. Indeterminate species denoted as “sp.” of an existing genus are regarded as likely to be poorly preserved examples of the existing species of that genus, and are deleted. If the indeterminate species denoted as “sp.” is the only species in that genus, they are counted as a single, unnamed species. Normalized plant macrofossil species data is listed in Table S4. In addition to these, palynological occurrences are also considered. Most of the palynological data are linked with plant macrofossils at family level, with a few spore and pollen taxa preserved in-situ within their parent plant for which the genus and species names of the parent plants are used.

All the species occurrences presented are based on the normalized data (Table S1). Longitude and latitude for each fossil location are listed in Table S2 and S3. The high latitude area is defined to be >45 degrees north and south of the equator, while low-middle latitude area is <45 degrees north or south. This definition is for this study only and is not climate specific. The range of plant fossils in each stage was checked and extended for calculating the extinction magnitude over a global high-latitude and low–middle latitude area. The extinction magnitude for each stage is the extinct species number compared to a later stage, minus the total normalized species number of this stage20. See the extinction magnitude results in Table S4. The extinction magnitude of the Anisian is not estimated.

To investigate the influence of plant fossil sampling completeness on our estimates of diversity, squares and interpolation methods were applied to our normalized plant macrofossil occurrence data. As for the raw data, squares and interpolation were applied to 15° latitude bins for the Late Permian (Changhsingian) to Middle Triassic (Anisian). Coverage-based interpolation uses the abundance structure present within samples, to either subsample or extrapolate diversity estimates to particular levels of sampling completeness, known as quorum levels36,71,72. This was applied using the R package iNEXT36. Squares is an extrapolator based on the proportion of singletons in a sample and is thought to be more robust to biases associated with small sample sizes and uneven abundance distributions73,74.

Throughout the interval, the raw, squares and interpolated diversity estimates generally show similar latitudinal patterns, suggesting that sampling is not a strong influence on our inferred latitudinal diversity gradients (Fig. 2). However, many of the points in the interpolated curves were removed due to over-extrapolation, which indicates that many of the spatio-temporal bins may be under-sampled. Our results indicate that during the Induan, the highest plant diversity was found in the high latitudes, particularly in the northern hemisphere. However, during the Changhsingian, Olenekian and Anisian, we see higher diversity levels at tropical latitudes, suggesting that the latitudinal diversity gradient had reverted to a situation similar to that of the present day one to two million years after the PTME.

Plant functional traits are stable morphological, anatomical, and compositional characters that have evolved under specific climates and environments, linking plant physiological processes to the Earth's biogeochemistry and physical evolution31,32,75,76. The plant functional traits of late Permian to Middle Triassic fossil plants are not well studied. Here, we aimed to determine the habitat of the fossil plants, the climatic zone in which they lived and to semi-quantify the biomass of the flora. We selected plant traits including plant growth form, reconstructed plant height, which indicates the spatial structure of the flora, and leaf size, which indicates the potential biomass of the flora. For water, carbon and nutrient cycling in the plant, leaf shape, vein pattern and density, and cuticle thickness are considered, which determines the plant's moisture preference, drought resistance, and productivity31,32. Cuticle thickness of present Ginkgo is positively related to productivity, although this is not further explored in our dataset due to the lack of experiments on these Permian-Triassic plant's recent analogs31.

Leaf size and vein density were measured using ImageJ, and only the largest and most complete leaves of each taxon are listed in the table S5, with fossil plant data collected from references in the supplementary table references. Other traits, including plant form, whole plant height, vein type, and cuticle thickness, are semi-quantified and are based partly on the reconstructed fossil plant, including Lepidodendron, Triassic herbaceous lycopods, sphenophytes including Calamites, gigantopterids, glossopterids, and ginkgophytes. Features of plants from which reconstructions are unknown are inferred from reconstructed relatives in the same genus or family; these plants should be further investigated in the future to characterize them more accurately.

Fossils with measurable leaf size are listed in Table S5 which covers low to high latitudes. Interpretation of the floral climate zone and vegetation landscape information are based on all the micro and macro plant fossils, including those without measurable leaf size. The general concept is that plants with higher height, larger leaf size, higher vein density, and more complicated vein system are of higher biomass and relied on greater humidity for transpiration. Floras with a higher proportion of these plants normally have higher species diversity and spatial structure complexity, which suggests higher productivity. Details of the plant trait relationships are outlined by ref. 31.

To analyse the character of floras from the late Permian (Changhsingian) to the Middle Triassic (Anisian) for comparison and matching between floras with certain functional analysis and missing information, family level clustering was used to group the floras with the normalized plant fossil data. The clustering result is based on the Euclidean method. The plant systematic information comes from the listed literature, with additions from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) https://www.gbif.org/ database which were checked against the literature to ensure their accuracy. The taxonomic affinity of most spore and pollen taxa are unknown, and so only plant macrofossil data was used in clustering, and the palynology data was only used in the morphological group diversity analysis. To show the uncertainty of the clustering results, we list the plant species number after each flora in Fig. 1B. Unsurprisingly, the clustering results for flora with fewer taxa were less reliable and more crowded together. As an auxiliary method to clustering, we counted the plant species number in each morphological group (see the fourteen morphological group classifications below), then calculated the proportion of the species number in each morphological group within floras to directly show the character and to construct a representative pie chart for each flora. For floras with fewer taxa, we adjusted the location of each flora in the clustering tree manually, according to the character shown by the morphological group diversity.

Plants were divided into six habitats and fourteen groups, including four arid upland types: conifer, gymnosperm (for seed plants where systematic class/group is uncertain), peltasperm and seed fern; three humid upland types: cordaitalean, ginkgophyte, cycadophyte; one rainforest type: gigantopterid; two humid types: fern and ‘fern2' (for taxa that could be either ferns or seed fern); two marsh types: sphenophyte and lycopod; one cold type: glossopterid – normally reported in boreal Gondwana; and one arid lowland type: herbaceous lycopod. This classification is only for the plants included in this study and must be carefully applied to other time intervals by checking the habitat of the fossil plants in detail. Flora dominated by one habitat group was classified into the corresponding climate zone, and flora with more than one habitat group was defined as a mixture. In this step, we also took palynology data into account. The group information of the in-situ spore and pollen producing plant were counted77. For flora with both plant macrofossil and palynology data, we chose the dataset which contains more information. In Fig. 1B, flora with more than 150 taxa, such as the Changhsingian South China flora, have the biggest pie chart area, while flora with less than 10 taxa, like the German flora, have the smallest pie chart. After the plant function traits, habitat, and clustering analysis, the character of the flora from the End Permian to the Middle Triassic was systematically studied and classified into climate zones as shown in Table S5 and S6.

To reconstruct the spatial vegetation map, we assembled a database of fossil locations, plant macrofossil, palynology, and terrestrial tetrapod data for our time periods (Table S1–S3). To account for plant refuges or Mesozoic gymnosperm cradles that may not be represented in the fossil database, we first extended the plant megafossil range in each basin. For example, voltziales and peltasperms were found in North China and Euramerica before the PTME and reappeared in the Middle Triassic but were absent in Early Triassic strata, so we extended the ranges of those surviving gymnosperms78,79,80. Plants that were dominant after the Early Triassic but had already appeared in end Permian strata in Argentina, India and Northeast China have all had their ranges extended through the Early Triassic69,81,82,83. Secondly, the palynological data tends to better record information on upland floras, while the plant megafossil data records primarily lowland taxa20,30. We detected hidden upland floras in South China, China Xinjiang, South Africa, Antarctica, and Australia based on gymnosperm pollen evidence after the PTME21,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91. Our analysis included all the plant data from macro and micro floral records in all sedimentary facies, to avoid using the local information and to represent information from the whole basin. Thirdly, terrestrial tetrapod data was used to infer the occurrence of plants in regions without a plant fossil record24,36. Generally, terrestrial tetrapod occurrences in our study coincided with occurrences in the plant fossils, except for the Olenekian record in America and Canada. Therefore, vegetation type in those areas at this time was partly inferred from the tetrapod information alone on the presumption that plant primary producers were necessary in these regions to support vertebrate communities.

The fossil locations were then reconstructed to their time of deposition using GPlates92. Because the older palaeogeographic reconstruction used in SCION93 has no available set of rotation files, we used the reconstruction files of ref. 62, whose reconstruction at ~250 Ma is very similar to that of ref. 93 This allowed us to place fossil locations in an internally correct position at 250 Ma. However, minor manual manipulation was needed to then map some of these locations to their correct corresponding positions in the SCION land-sea maps.

Global vegetation was reconstructed by extension of fossil flora data across appropriate climate zones indicated by a sedimentary climate map94. In arid areas, plant fossil extrapolation is not applied95. Extrapolation was not carried out at the boundaries of humid and arid environments in places that lacked supporting mineralogical data. For example, the Early and Middle Triassic low-latitude inner Pangea continent is inferred to have been arid savanna or steppe, based on the available fossil record and lithological climatic indicators. Fossils from more productive biomes which are found nearer the coast are restricted to this setting and not extended far into the continental interior where climate is arid (Fig. 3).

Three principles are used for functional comparison between ancient and recent floras to estimate palaeo-productivity: firstly, recent floras must have a similar structure to the ancient flora we wish to imitate, so we compare the reconstructed size of the fossil plants including height and leaf size of the individual plant and the spatial structure of the flora with the recent analog. For example, the end-Permian tropical South China floral canopy is dominated by tree lycopods Lepidodendron and sphenophytes, fern and gigantopterid understory, showing the highest complexity in forest spatial structure among all the floras from the late Permian to Middle Triassic. The dominant gigantopterids have giant leaves with typical rainforest drip-tip structure, complicated vein systems and high vein density, and thus recent rainforest is chosen as an analog for the late Permian South China area, Southeast Asia, China Xizang, and Turkey which shared high similarity in taxa composition33. Secondly, the recent and ancient floras should be in the same climate zone. For example, the latest Permian South China tropical forest was a large, low-latitude island, and so present-day, large tropical islands like Indonesia and Thailand were chosen over (for example) continental Brazil. Each palaeo flora has suitable recent floras sharing similarity in plant function, climatic and geographic zone. Thirdly, the chosen flora should fit in the global diversity and NPP gradient at a similar place to the ancient flora. For ancient floras with clear functional trait records, we compare the NPP between floras from the late Permian to Middle Triassic by the traits mentioned above. We also use present-day data to confirm the hypothesis that plant diversity has a positive correlation with productivity, which generally fits with our normalized fossil results96,97. For instance, the late Permian (Changhsingian) tropical South China flora is matched with a present day high-diversity and highest-productivity biome in the chosen recent non-continental tropical rainforest functional group range, that of present-day Thailand. The late Permian to Middle Triassic fossil plants' inferred habitat, climate zone and landscape are shown in Table S5. The calculated NPP of each ancient flora is listed in Table S6 and details of corresponding recent flora are in Table S7. The reconstructed NPPL is marked as NPPLfossil.

Although this study makes progress in comparing the physiological and functional difference between palaeo- and recent plants, more detailed studies are still required. For example, the influence of the interaction between plants and other organisms including mycorrhiza and insects are not considered, neither are soil texture differences between the Permian-Triassic and present day. Although our results have associated uncertainties, the very large change in biomass over the PTME is very likely much larger than these potential errors. Nevertheless, without detailed study on palaeo plant physiology in other deep time periods, the methods mentioned above should not be directly applied to other timeframes.

In our initial steps to reconstruct land biomes and productivity, we did not extend the distribution of land plants to regions lacking climatic or mineral records of hospitable environments. For instance, the central areas of the Pangea supercontinent, characterized by evaporites rather than coal deposits, were identified as deserts or barren lands where plant growth was presumed unlikely. However, while the absence of fossil records in some areas may result from local biome extinctions, it could also be due to poor preservation conditions caused by insufficient water availability98. To assess the influence of taphonomic bias on our reconstructions—essentially, whether areas without fossil records truly lacked local biomes or merely lacked preservation conditions—we employed two different approaches.

First of all, we assessed the sedimentary facies and strata thickness of basins from various latitudes and locations99 (Fig. S3). For example, in low latitude South China, the fossil-plant-absence zone occurs in the Kayitou Formation, formed in a shallow lake or floodplain environment100. The central European basin recorded a warm seasonal humid climate in the Early Triassic, which is likely a response to global warming after the PTME in inner Pangea101. In high latitude South Africa and Australia, sedimentation patterns and occurrences of green algae indicate widespread ponding environments through the plant ‘dead zone'85,102,103,104. While these are strictly local examples, they indicate the presence of waterlogged, swampy environments suitable for plant preservation in the Early Triassic, suggesting that taphonomy is not the primary cause of the absence of fossils, and that this may reflect a genuine reduced abundance of plants after the PTME in these areas20. Additionally, frequent wildfires point to intensified seasonality or seasonal aridity, likely reducing lowland plant habitats and contributing to the sparse record of “hidden” upland plants2,20,21,67,85.

Second, we explored the potential existence of hidden “refuges” or “cradles” using our climate model, assuming plants could survive in grid cells with land surface temperatures below 40 °C and runoff above 0 mm/yr, similar to the conditions required by most modern plants105,106. The results suggest that suitable environments for plant survival existed in high-altitude and coastal areas, even in some low-latitude regions, such as South China, North China, Xinjiang, Europe, and Central Asia. These findings are consistent with our reconstructions based on fossil records. For example, the South China Induan plant macrofossil record is dominated by the herbaceous lycopod Tomiotrobus with a maximum height of 0.2 meters, while coeval palynological data suggests a hidden upland gymnosperm flora20,21,107. Therefore, the Induan flora in South China is compared with recent Australian shrubs or the seasonal dry subtropical forest in China Yunnan Province which is herbaceous and shrub-dominated with sparse tree cover.

To investigate the effects of vegetation change on Early Triassic climate, we ran the SCION Earth Evolution Model52. We removed the equation which calculates terrestrial vegetation biomass (as a single global number) and replaced this with values based on our reconstruction, mapped onto the model continental surface. To calculate NPPLf we multiplied the reconstructed NPPLbiogeographic by a factor representing CO2 fertilization. This follows the Michaelis-Menton formulation used in the GEOCARB biogeochemical models56,108:

where RCO2 is the atmospheric CO2 concentration relative to the preindustrial 280 ppm.

Plants play a crucial role in terrestrial weathering109. Present-day global-scale observations show that silicate weathering is linearly related to plant NPPLf (Fig. S5)48,110,111. We altered the model parameter fbiota, which represents the biotic enhancement of continental weathering (again a single global average in SCION), to make this dependent on the local vegetation in the following way:

Functionally, this returns a value tending towards 0.25 when NPPLf is very low, and a linear scaling with NPPLf when NPPLf rises. The choice of 0.25 relates to the four-fold enhancement between simple ground covers and higher plants used in first-generation long-term carbon cycle models like GEOCARB56,108, and based on field and laboratory studies53. We vary this ‘preplant' factor between 0.15 – 1 and modify the linear scaling to run sensitivity tests for various plant weathering abilities (Fig. S6). In all formulations, the scaling factor for NPP is chosen to return present day global weathering rates for the model present day integration.

The strontium isotope composition of river water has a strong local lithological control, so to simulate the Sr isotope record we imposed basic lithological classes on the model continental surface using the locations of continental arcs, LIPs and suture zones from the literature62,63,112 (Fig. S4). These zones were then prescribed representative Sr isotopic values52,57,113,114,115.

Mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data of tumour patient plasma samples present opportunities for improving cancer detection. Here we generate plasma proteomic profiles from 2,251 pan-cancer patient samples and investigate potential diagnostic biomarkers. Proteomic subtyping with different dominant tumour types links proteomic features and clinical indicators such as tumour stage. The highly immune-activated subtype, consisting of renal and bladder cancers, shows elevated glucose–insulin metabolism and reduced lipid metabolism. Comparison of the plasma proteome before and after surgery indicates that proteome patterns could be used to monitor post-surgery therapeutic effects. We also develop a binary classified model that distinguishes between tumour types and healthy controls, as well as a multicancer model for pan-cancer classification of proteins that could be useful biomarkers, and validate their performance in an independent cohort. In addition, we find that the plasma proteome, along with clinical indicators, whole blood cells and so on, can distinguish the pathological subtypes of specific tumour types. This study portrays a pan-cancer plasma proteomic landscape, providing information on plasma biomarkers that could help in discovering diagnostic opportunities.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy is effective against many cancers, although resistance remains a major issue and new strategies are needed to improve clinical outcomes1,2,3,4,5. Here we studied ICB response in a cohort of patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma—a cancer type that poses considerable clinical challenges and lacks effective therapies6,7,8. We observed significantly prolonged overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with tumours with PPP2R1A mutations. Importantly, our findings were validated in additional ICB-treated patient cohorts across multiple cancer types. Translational analyses from tumour biopsies demonstrated enhanced IFNγ signalling, and the presence of tertiary lymphoid structures at the baseline, as well as enhanced immune infiltration and expansion of CD45RO+CD8+ T cells in the tumour neighbourhood after ICB treatment in PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. Parallel preclinical investigations showed that targeting PPP2R1A (by pharmacological inhibition or genetic modifications) in in vitro and in vivo models was associated with improved survival in the setting of treatment with several forms of immunotherapy, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy and ICB. The results from these studies suggest that therapeutic targeting of PPP2R1A may represent an effective strategy to improve patient outcomes after ICB or other forms of immunotherapy, although additional mechanistic and therapeutic insights are needed.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized the management of many solid tumours but, disappointingly, have shown minimal efficacy in both advanced and recurrent ovarian cancer. Response rates to single agent programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors in recurrent ovarian cancer are low1,2,3, ranging from 5% to 15%. Unfortunately, biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression, tumour mutation burden, BRCA1/2 mutation status and homologous recombination deficiency, have not been significantly associated with response or clinical benefit in patients with ovarian cancer treated with ICB therapies3,4,5.

Some data suggest that combination ICB targeting both PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 may be more effective in recurrent ovarian cancer. A randomized trial demonstrated a response rate of 31.4% in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer who received nivolumab (anti-PD1) plus ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), compared with 12.2% in those who received nivolumab alone4. Furthermore, patients in this trial with ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC; a rare histological subtype associated with a worse prognosis compared with the more prevalent high-grade serous ovarian cancer, HGSOC6,7,8) demonstrated a fivefold greater odds of response compared with those with HGSOC4. Thus, patients with recurrent OCCC may especially benefit from ICB; however, the response rate in this group remains around 15%, suggesting that only a subset of patients with OCCC derive clinical benefit. On the basis of these observations, we prospectively enrolled patients with OCCC into a trial investigating the efficacy of dual ICB in the platinum-resistant setting (NCT03026062). During the course of this trial, we observed that patients whose tumours had inactivating somatic mutations in PPP2R1A—a gene encoding the most common scaffold component of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex—demonstrated significantly prolonged overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Critically, this finding was validated in external cohorts of patients treated with ICB. We also performed translational investigation of paired pretreatment and on-treatment tumour biopsies, revealing enhanced antitumour immune responses in those with PPP2R1A mutations. Beyond this, we conducted concurrent studies in several different preclinical models, which suggested that targeted inhibition of PPP2R1A enhanced anti-tumour immunity and treatment response in the setting of immunotherapy.

To better understand the biological correlates of the enhanced response to ICB, we investigated a cohort of 34 patients with platinum-resistant OCCC who were treated with a combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies (Fig. 1a). All except one were enrolled on an investigator-initiated clinical trial of tremelimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) treatment in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (NCT03026062). The remaining patient (patient 0) was treated on a separate clinical trial of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1; NCT01928394; Extended Data Fig. 1a). A summary of demographic and clinicopathological information for all patients is shown in Table 1. The median age at the time of study consent was 56.0 years (range, 36.0–78.0 years), and most of the patients were white (79.4%). The patients received a median of two previous lines of therapy (range, 1–9), with no previous ICB. The median follow up was 13.7 months (range, 1.0–70.3 months; Fig. 1b). In the overall cohort, the median OS was 14.3 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.8–22.9 months). The 6-month and 1-year survival probabilities were 0.68 (95% CI 0.54–0.85) and 0.56 (95% CI 0.41–0.75), respectively.

Source Data

Next-generation sequencing analysis of tumour biopsies identified ARID1A and PIK3CA somatic mutations or alterations in the majority of patients (73.5% and 55.9%, respectively) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In this cohort, 11 patients (32.4%) had somatic mutations in the PPP2R1A gene, which encodes the predominant scaffold subunit of the PP2A complex—a major cellular serine/threonine heterotrimeric phosphatase9. Most PPP2R1A mutations (n = 9; 81.8%) were located at the hotspot codon Arg183, with five patients carrying the R183W mutation and four carrying the R183Q mutation. The remaining two patients had S256F and W257G missense mutations, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 1c). All of the observed mutations are known to impair the binding of the major scaffold A subunit (encoded by PPP2R1A) to the regulatory B subunits of PP2A, therefore conferring a loss of function9. Only one case of mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability (MSI) was identified among the evaluable tumours, and it was present in a patient with wild-type PPP2R1A, consistent with published literature demonstrating a low likelihood of mismatch repair deficiency or MSIhigh status in patients with OCCC10. Four patients (11.8%) had tumours with wild-type PPP2R1A but alterations in AKT genes: three of these had pathogenic single-nucleotide variants in AKT1 (E17K in patient 152, and both C77F and E151Q in patient 163) or AKT3 (R249H in patient 69), and one patient (patient 121) had an amplification in AKT2 (19q13.2) (Extended Data Fig. 1b). Previous studies have found that E17K and C77F are activating oncogenic AKT1 mutations in solid tumours, and AKT2 amplification is a known driver of ovarian cancer pathogenesis11,12. We sought to specifically evaluate the impact of ARID1A, PPP2R1A and AKT mutations on the outcomes in this cohort based on observations in three ‘exceptional responder' patients with platinum-resistant OCCC who were treated with combination ICB and lived for over 5 years from the start of treatment. A brief clinical course of these patients is provided below.

The first patient (patient 0), who had a somatic PPP2R1A mutation (R183Q), received ipilimumab and nivolumab for 15 months and lived for 5.5 years (with disease) after her first dose of ICB. The other two exceptional responders (patients 31 and 69), who had PPP2R1A (R183W) and AKT3 (R249H) mutations, respectively, both received the combination of tremelimumab and durvalumab and remain alive 5.8 and 5.1 years since the ICB treatment start, at the time of data cut-off. To put these outcomes in perspective, the median OS in patients with platinum-resistant OCCC after progression on frontline therapy is only 10.9 months13. All three of these patients also had somatic ARID1A mutations, which are associated with improved response to immunotherapy in several cancer types, yet such associations have not been reported for loss-of-function mutations in PPP2R1A or activating alterations in AKT14,15,16,17. These observations led us to hypothesize that somatic mutations in one or both of these genes may correlate with improved survival in other patients with OCCC treated with ICB.

To test this hypothesis, we compared the outcomes of patients with OCCC based on ARID1A and PPP2R1A mutation status to see whether these alterations are correlated with OS in the setting of ICB treatment. The small number of patients with AKT alterations (n = 4) limited specific analysis of this cohort individually. We observed a significantly longer OS in patients whose tumours had a PPP2R1A mutation compared with those without a PPP2R1A mutation (median OS 66.9 versus 9.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI 0.15–1.08; one-sided log-rank P = 0.031; Fig. 1c). There was also a significant difference in PFS, with PPP2R1A-mutation carriers having a median PFS of 3.0 months compared with 1.8 months for non-mutation carriers (one-sided log-rank P = 0.034; Extended Data Fig. 2). As 9 of the 11 patients with PPP2R1A mutations had concurrent ARID1A mutations, to discriminate between the prognostic effects of ARID1A and PPP2R1A mutations, we first evaluated the prognostic effects of ARID1A mutations in patients whose tumours were wild-type for PPP2R1A (n = 23; Fig. 1d). The wild-type and mutated ARID1A groups did not show a statistically significant difference in survival, with a median OS of 9.2 versus 5.1 months (one-sided log-rank P = 0.055; Fig. 1d). Next, we examined the OS in patients with PPP2R1A mutations within the subset of patients with mutated ARID1A (n = 25; Fig. 1e). In these cases, we still observed a trend toward longer survival after ICB in patients with OCCC with concurrent PPP2R1A mutations (OS, 66.9 versus 9.2 months; one-sided log-rank P = 0.047; Fig. 1e). In summary, these data suggest that PPP2R1A mutations may have a dominant effect in association with longer survival of patients with OCCC treated with ICB, although, due to the limited sample size in each subgroup, we cannot rule out the possibility that ARID1A mutations may also have independent prognostic value.

Examination of clinical course and responses in our cohort of patients with PPP2R1A mutations provided a key insight that the observed survival benefit was associated with delayed responses that sometimes followed a period of initial progression or stable disease (Fig. 1f–h). Note that, to guard against pseudoprogression, all of the patients in this study were enrolled on clinical trials that allowed for continuation of immunotherapy beyond apparent progression of disease as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v.1.1, which may have contributed to durable disease control in patients with PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. Moreover, higher rates of grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events were noted in PPP2R1A mutation carriers (45.5% versus 13.0% for non-carriers; P = 0.079; Table 1), which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating a positive correlation between immune-related adverse events and favourable outcomes in patients treated with ICB18.

The pretreatment tumour samples from 29 patients in the clinical cohort were obtained and profiled using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq); among these, 14 paired on-treatment samples were also analysed (Supplementary Table 1). In comparing the transcriptional profiles of pretreatment samples from patients with PPP2R1A mutations to those with wild-type PPP2R1A, we observed significant enrichment of the IFNγ response pathway in PPP2R1A-mutant samples, indicating activation of adaptative immune responses (Fig. 2a). The enhanced antitumoural immune responses in PPP2R1A-mutant cases were even more accentuated after ICB treatment, as revealed by the enrichment of multiple additional immune-response-related pathways, including inflammatory response, complement pathway, allograft rejection, IFNα response and IL-2 signalling (Fig. 2b). Notably, these differences in antitumoural immune responses remained significant even after accounting for potential confounding from AKT alterations (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b).

Source Data

In longitudinal comparisons within the PPP2R1A-mutant group, significant upregulation of the IFNγ and IFNα response pathways was observed in the on-treatment samples compared with the baseline, indicating further immune activation with combined ICB therapies (Extended Data Fig. 3c). Consistently, when comparing the composition of tumour-infiltrating immune cells based on immune cell deconvolution, increases in the relative and absolute proportions of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and activated natural killer (NK) cells were observed, along with a trend of upregulation in total T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) richness. This was also accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of resting NK cells (Fig. 2c–h, Extended Data Figs. 3d–i and 4). Conversely, these changes were not significant in the wild-type PPP2R1A group in longitudinal comparisons (Fig. 2c–h, Extended Data Figs. 3d–i and 4).

Given the inherent limitations of bulk RNA-seq data in revealing detailed immune cell phenotypes and the lack of spatial information, we further performed highly multiplexed spatial phenotyping of pretreatment and on-treatment samples using CODEX with a 26-antibody panel (Fig. 3a). A total of 378,868 high-quality cells from 28 samples was obtained for downstream analysis (Supplementary Table 1 and Methods). In the baseline tumours, PPP2R1A-mutant cases exhibited higher levels of intratumoural infiltration of MHC-II+ immune cells compared with the wild-type cases (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Furthermore, B cells (CD20+), particularly proliferating B cells (CD20+Ki-67+) and germinal centre B cells (CD20+CD21+Ki-67+), showed a trend of higher densities in PPP2R1A-mutant samples, despite the small cohort size (Fig. 3b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5b,c). Consistent with this finding, peritumoural secondary follicle-like tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) were observed in three of these samples (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). As TLSs have recently been linked to favourable response to ICB19,20,21, our preliminary observations shed light on the importance of further evaluating the potential association between TLSs and PPP2R1A mutations in future studies based on larger cohorts. Finally, at the on-treatment timepoint, PPP2R1A-mutant samples also exhibited significantly higher densities of tumour-infiltrating immune cells, including CD45+CD56+ NK cells (Extended Data Fig. 5f,g).

To further examine the spatial relationships between tumour and immune cells, we conducted a multicellular neighbourhood analysis. A multicellular neighbourhood was defined as a collection of cells with centroids within 80 μm of a centre cell22,23,24 (Fig. 3e). Notably, we observed a significant upregulation of PD-1+CD8+ T cells in the neighbourhoods of tumour cells after ICB treatment in both PPP2R1A-mutant and wild-type cases (Fig. 3f–i, Extended Data Fig. 5h and Supplementary Table 2). PD-1 expression is known to be induced on T cells after activation and can persist until they reach a terminally exhausted state25. Furthermore, PD-1+CD8+ T cells have been shown to be increased in response to ICB therapies26,27. These findings suggest that ICB drugs were delivered to the tumour sites in both groups and elicited effective T cell responses. Nevertheless, CD45RO+PD-1−CD8+ memory T cells were uniquely upregulated in the tumour neighbourhoods of PPP2R1A-mutant cases after treatment, particularly around MHC-I+ tumour cells (Fig. 3f–i, Extended Data Fig. 5h and Supplementary Table 2). CD45RO+ memory T cells, which could serve as a replenishing pool for effector T cells, have been shown to mediate sustained responses to ICB therapy across multiple cohorts28,29,30. Thus, the lack of this population in wild-type PPP2R1A cases may account for the shorter duration of disease control and inferior outcomes. Finally, we observed an enrichment of NK cells in tumour neighbourhoods in PPP2R1A-mutant cases at both the pretreatment and on-treatment timepoints (Extended Data Fig. 5i,j). These results further complemented the RNA-seq analysis showing that activated NK cells were upregulated after ICB treatment in PPP2R1A-mutant cases. Together, these findings provided further evidence supporting the superior outcomes after ICB therapy in PPP2R1A-mutant OCCC.

When further examining the differences between long-term and short-term survivors within the PPP2R1A-mutant group, as dichotomized by median OS (Extended Data Fig. 6), enhanced antitumoural immunity was more evident in long-term survivors after ICB treatment. This was indicated by the enrichment of multiple immune signalling pathways, as well as upregulation of T cell and B cell lineage markers (such as CD3E, CD4 and CD79A/B), MHC class II molecules (such as HLA-DRA, HLA-DQA2 and CD74), lymphocyte activation or function markers (TNFRSF13B and GZMB), co-stimulatory molecule (CD86), immune checkpoint (PDCD1) and chemotaxis chemokines (CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4) (Extended Data Fig. 6b,c).

Finally, we sought to further understand the role of AKT alterations, as several patients with tumours containing AKT alterations (wild-type PPP2R1A) in the study cohort exhibited responses to ICB. Notably, our preclinical data indicate that phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) was downregulated in the HEC50B cell line after CRISPR correction of PPP2R1A from mutant (R183W) to wild-type and upregulated in OVCAR429 cells after CRISPR editing of PPP2R1A from wild-type to mutant (R183Q) (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d and Supplementary Fig. 1a,b). These findings suggest that AKT activation is closely associated with PPP2R1A mutational status. Consistently, as described above, the AKT-altered cases in our clinical cohort exhibited multiple known genetic alterations that would lead to AKT activation. Next, we characterized the transcriptional profiles of these cases. RNA-seq data from pretreatment samples of three AKT-altered cases revealed significant enrichment of pathways related to IFNγ response, IFNα response and allograft rejection compared with those with wild-type AKT and PPP2R1A, providing a potential explanation for the efficacy of ICB treatment in this subpopulation (Extended Data Fig. 7e).

To further validate the immune-related phenotype of PPP2R1A-mutant tumours identified in our discovery clinical cohort, we used a series of in vitro and in vivo models. First, by reviewing previously published data31,32,33, we observed that PPP2R1A consistently ranked among the top hits in genome-wide CRISPR immune screens comparing T cell-treated and control groups, indicating that PPP2R1A knockout increased tumour cell sensitivity to T cell-mediated killing (Fig. 4a). Subsequently, we constructed PPP2R1A-knockdown SKOV3 cell lines (Extended Data Fig. 8a and Supplementary Fig. 1c). When exposed to tumour-reactive B7H3 CAR-T cells, the apoptotic rate of PPP2R1A-knockdown cells was significantly higher than the negative control (Fig. 4b). Similarly, treatment of the wild-type SKOV3 cell line with the PP2A-specific inhibitor LB-100 enhanced cancer cell killing by B7H3 CAR-T cells (Fig. 4c). However, these observations primarily reflect the influence of a reduction in normal PPP2R1A protein levels. To directly assess the impact of PPP2R1A mutation and align with our clinical observations, we established SKOV3 cell lines with stable overexpression of wild-type PPP2R1A and the P179R mutant (Extended Data Fig. 8b,c). Consistent with the results above, cancer cells with the PPP2R1AP179R mutant showed increased sensitivity to CAR-T-cell-mediated killing (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, using CRISPR editing, we corrected the PPP2R1A gene from the R183W mutant in parental HEC50B cell line to the wild-type and, conversely, introduced the R183Q mutation in the OVCAR429 cell line which had wild-type PPP2R1A. We next engineered the parental and CRISPR-edited cell lines to overexpress human CD19 (hCD19) (Extended Data Fig. 8d), and exposed them to hCD19 CAR-T cells at varying effector:target ratios. Consistently, hCD19 CAR-T cells exhibited higher killing efficacy against PPP2R1A-mutant cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4e–g).

Moreover, endometrial cancers have the highest rates of PPP2R1A mutations among all cancer types. Thus, to further validate the role of PPP2R1A mutations in ICB response in vivo, we collected human endometrial cancer samples with and without PPP2R1A mutations and established patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models on humanized BLT mice. The PPP2R1A mutational status of the PDX tumours was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 8e). Mice were randomized into two groups, receiving either anti-PD-L1 therapy or human IgG isotype control (Fig. 4h). After 3 weeks of treatment, significant reductions in tumour size and weight were observed in the anti-PD-L1 treatment group compared with the control group in PPP2R1A-mutant PDX models (Fig. 4i,j). By contrast, no therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1 treatment was observed in wild-type PPP2R1A PDX models (Extended Data Fig. 8f,g), suggesting that PPP2R1A mutations specifically confer sensitivity to ICB treatment in this setting.

Notably, PPP2R1A-mutant OCCC cases often had concurrent ARID1A mutations (Extended Data Fig. 1b). To further rule out the potential confounding effect of ARID1A mutations on immunotherapy response and validate our clinical findings, we generated an isogenic Ppp2r1aR183Q mutant in an OCCC cell line derived from a conditional Arid1aflox/flox(Gt)Rosa26Pik3ca*H1047R genetic OCCC mouse model in the C57BL/6 background34 (Extended Data Fig. 8h). This set of mutations was based on the co-occurring mutations in PPP2R1A, ARID1A and PIK3CA seen in 15% of the overall cohort and 45% of PPP2R1A-mutant OCCCs in the trial (Extended Data Fig. 1b). These isogenic cells enabled us to establish syngeneic immunocompetent mouse models. After establishment of tumours to around 100 mm3, mice were randomized and treated with anti-PD-L1 or IgG control antibodies (Fig. 4k). As ARID1A inactivation also sensitizes tumours to ICB15,35, we reduced the dose of anti-PD-L1 to 2.5 mg per kg weekly based on the response in syngeneic tumours formed by Arid1a−/−Pik3ca*H1047R cells (Fig. 4l). This enabled us to show that tumour burdens, as measured by tumour size during treatment and tumour weight at the end point, were reduced by the anti-PD-L1 treatment in tumours formed by Arid1a−/−Pik3ca*H1047RPpp2r1aR183W cells compared with the IgG controls (Fig. 4m,n). Furthermore, in both models, anti-PD-L1 treatment was not associated with significant changes in mouse body weight, indicating that the treatment was well tolerated (Extended Data Fig. 8i).

On the basis of our findings in OCCC, we hypothesized that PPP2R1A loss-of-function mutations in other tumour types may also be associated with improved outcomes in patients treated with ICB. To test this hypothesis, we used cBioPortal36,37 to analyse two independent datasets: one cohort of 1,661 patients treated with ICB, and another cohort of 7,564 patients undergoing various treatments for advanced cancer. Patients with PPP2R1A mutations treated with ICB showed significantly longer OS (median OS not reached versus 18.0 months (95% CI 16.0–21.0 months), P = 0.033; Extended Data Fig. 9a). By contrast, no significant differences in OS were observed in patients with PPP2R1A mutations who received other therapies (Extended Data Fig. 9b; P = 0.638). Notably, the group with PPP2R1A mutations in the immunotherapy cohort encompassed a variety of cancer types and heterogenous concurrent mutations (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4), therefore making it unlikely that the observed survival difference was driven by cancer-type-specific factors or by other mutations. Furthermore, the survival benefit associated with PPP2R1A mutations was also revealed in two additional cohorts including a total of 286 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma who were treated with ICB (Extended Data Fig. 9c,d). However, the limited number of patients with PPP2R1A mutations in these cohorts precluded robust statistical analyses. Nonetheless, these aggregated data suggest that the correlation between PPP2R1A mutations and survival is not merely prognostic of better cancer treatment outcomes but, rather, is specific to patients treated with ICB, with potential relevance in cancers beyond OCCC.

Moreover, given the high prevalence of PPP2R1A mutations in endometrial cancer, and the fact that immunotherapy with the combination of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab (len–pem) is an approved standard second-line therapy, we investigated the relationship between PPP2R1A-inactivating mutations and outcomes in a cohort of these patients. We identified 101 patients with high-grade endometrial cancer, comprising serous (n = 49; 48.5%), clear cell (n = 8; 7.9%), carcinosarcoma (n = 25; 24.8%), mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma (n = 2; 2.0%) and mixed high-grade tumours (n = 17; 16,8%), who had undergone tumour somatic mutation analysis and were treated with len–pem. Among this cohort, 24 patients (23.8%) had endometrial cancers with PPP2R1A mutations. The patients were followed up for as long as 3.8 years. Patients with PPP2R1A-mutated tumours treated with len–pem had a longer OS compared with those with wild-type PPP2R1A tumours (median OS not reached versus 20.5 months; log-rank P = 0.051; Extended Data Fig. 10a). However, the median PFS was not significantly different between the two groups (7.5 versus 5.5 months; P = 0.246; Extended Data Fig. 10b). Analysis of only the TP53-mutated uterine tumours treated with len–pem revealed similar trends: the median OS was not reached in PPP2R1A-mutated patients versus 16.0 months in those without somatic PPP2R1A mutations (P = 0.027), and the median PFS was 7.5 versus 4.8 months, respectively (P = 0.199; Extended Data Fig. 10c,d). Finally, we also performed an analysis of wild-type ARID1A cases, and again observed a better OS, despite a similar PFS, in the PPP2R1A-mutant group (Extended Data Fig. 10e–h). Reminiscent of the results in OCCC cohort (Fig. 1e), these data further corroborated that PPP2R1A mutations could confer prognostic values independent of ARID1A status.

We identified a significant correlation between loss-of-function PPP2R1A mutations and improved OS in patients with OCCC, and possibly other cancers, who were treated with ICB. Although the exact mechanisms through which these somatic genetic changes improve the outcomes after ICB await further investigation, our data suggest that the presence of these mutations is associated with enhanced immune activation in the tumour microenvironment, and these effects are further boosted after treatment with ICB. Importantly, PPP2R1A mutations are not associated with improved survival of patients with OCCC in the setting of treatment with standard chemotherapy38; thus, this effect appears to be ICB specific, suggesting that these mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers for ICB response in this cancer type. With the use of in vitro and in vivo models, publicly available datasets and a retrospectively analysed endometrial cancer cohort, we were able to extend the positive correlation between PPP2R1A mutations and ICB sensitivity as well as the survival benefits brought by ICB to other cancer types.

In addition to serving as a potential biomarker for improved survival after ICB in OCCC and other cancers, the association between PPP2R1A mutations specifically and anti-cancer immunity probably has broader therapeutic significance for improving ICB outcomes. In this regard, there is compelling preclinical evidence that pharmacological inhibition of PP2A (the multimeric phosphatase of which the major scaffold component is encoded by PPP2R1A) improved the efficacy of ICB in syngeneic mouse models39. This study showed induction of synergistic anti-cancer immunity (including immunologic memory) by the combination of a PP2A inhibitor (LB-100) and anti-PD-1 ICB. The therapeutic role of LB-100 was mostly attributed to its direct influences on T cells, with enhanced CD8+ T cell activation, proliferation and trafficking to the tumour after treatment. Notably, these immunological effects were independent of changes in expression of TIM-3, OX40, CTLA-4 and LAG3, suggesting that there may be therapeutic opportunities for combining LB-100 with other immunomodulatory drugs beyond anti-PD-1 antibodies. Indeed, PPP2R1A genetic alterations in T cells were also proven to directly influence their functionalities. In a previous study, a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes demonstrated that downregulation of a PP2A regulatory subunit inhibited T cell apoptosis and enhanced T cell proliferation and cytokine production40. Lastly, knockout of PPP2R1A in regulatory T cells in mice leads to a severe and widespread lymphoproliferative autoimmune disorder, due to inability to suppress effector immune responses41.

Consistent with previously reported results39, our data also revealed that LB-100 could sensitize SKOV3 cells to CAR-T cell killing. Furthermore, as a complement, we also extended the cell killing assays to PPP2R1A knockdown and PPP2R1A-mutant cancer cell lines, so that the effects of altered PPP2R1A downstream pathways were fully attributable to cancer cells. Our results suggest that alterations in the cancer cell PPP2R1A pathway may also indirectly enhance T cell function. On the basis of previous studies, potential mechanisms include increased tumour DNA damage and enhanced neoantigen expression42. For example, PP2A inactivation has been shown to induce MSI in tumour cells or, through the production of cytosolic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), activate tumour-intrinsic type I IFN signalling in preclinical models of other tumour types43,44. Importantly, here we provide direct evidence of enhanced sensitivity of PPP2R1A-mutant human cancer to ICB by using humanized PDX models. The humanized immune system in the model could better mimic the potential effect of ICB in patients with somatic PPP2R1A mutations, and these data aligned well with our clinical findings.

Taken together, these preclinical studies support a functional link between PP2A loss/inhibition and enhanced anti-tumour immunity and suggest that pharmacological inhibition of PP2A may represent a robust strategy for activating antitumour immunity due to its impact on both the tumour and microenvironmental cell compartments and the potential to provide benefit in patients without PPP2R1A mutations. It is tempting to hypothesize that the boosted immunological response observed in the PPP2R1A-mutation carriers in our study may be related to the loss of PP2A function in the tumour compartment alone. In the aforementioned preclinical studies, PP2A inhibition in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and loss of function in regulatory T cells were demonstrated to have important roles in immune activation; thus, systemic administration of a pharmacological inhibitor of PP2A may be associated with more rapid tumour regression by accelerating immune responses in both the tumour and immune cell compartments. Consistent with these observations, we have recently activated a phase Ib/II clinical trial of ICB and LB-100 in patients with OCCC who do not have somatic PPP2R1A mutations (NCT06065462). Finally, in this study we also observed an enrichment of NK cells, as well as their phenotypic transition to an activated state, in PPP2R1A-mutated OCCC after ICB treatment. Indeed, the vital roles of NK cells in mediating ICB efficacy and predicting ICB responses have been reported in recent preclinical and clinical studies45,46,47. Our findings further supported these observations and highlighted the potential for NK-cell-based immunotherapies in treating PPP2R1A-mutated tumours. However, further studies are warranted to provide deeper mechanistic insights and assess therapeutic efficacy.

Although these findings are provocative, limitations exist with regard to sample size and to the potential contribution of other mutations (such as those of ARID1A) on response to ICB in this cohort. Nonetheless, this study examined a rare cancer with translational analyses performed on unique clinical samples, and these data therefore represent a valuable contribution to the literature. Furthermore, this investigation provides evidence in support of the potential use of PPP2R1A as a predictive biomarker for prognosis after ICB and as a target to improve clinical outcomes in the setting of ICB therapy. Confirmatory studies in larger cohorts and deeper mechanistic studies with additional preclinical models are warranted.

The patients included in this analysis were identified through a retrospective review of all patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant or refractory OCCC (including clear cell carcinomas arising from peritoneal and fallopian tube origins), defined as progression within 180 days of a previous line of platinum-containing therapy, treated with ICB (MD Anderson Cancer Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) 2020-1098). The patients included in this analysis were treated on two different clinical trial protocols, both IRB approved by MD Anderson, in which combination CTLA-4 and PD-1/L1-targeting ICB was administered (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03026062 (n = 33) and NCT01928394 (n = 1)). Informed consent was obtained from all of the patients enrolled in the two trials before starting treatment. NCT03026062 was an open-label, adaptively randomized phase II trial of tremelimumab and durvalumab administered in combination or sequentially. Sequential therapy included tremelimumab 3 mg per kg every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses, followed by durvalumab 1.5 g every 4 weeks for up to 9 doses after progression. Combination therapy consisted of tremelimumab 1 mg per kg plus durvalumab 1.5 g every 4 weeks for up to 4 doses followed by durvalumab monotherapy (1.5 g for up to 9 doses or until progression). The outcomes for the non-OCCC histology cohorts were reported previously48. Notably, enrolment on this trial was amended, initially limiting it to patients with OCCC, and later further restricting participation to those with OCCC with inactivating PPP2R1A or activating AKT alterations. An additional patient included in this study received treatment on NCT01928394, an open-label phase II trial in which the patients were stratified by platinum-free interval and then randomized to different dosing schedules of nivolumab and ipilimumab. The participant included in this study received ipilimumab 1 mg per kg every 6 weeks plus nivolumab 3 mg per kg every 2 weeks until progression.

Demographic and clinicopathological information, including tumour somatic mutation testing and mismatch repair/microsatellite stability status, was collected from the medical record. Tumour mutation testing using next-generation sequencing was obtained as part of the patients' standard care either at MD Anderson Cancer Center or through a commercial lab (typically Caris or FoundationOne). Clinical DNA mutation testing was not available for two participants; in these cases, T200 next-generation sequencing was performed on their pretreatment biopsies as previously described49.

RECIST v.1.1, modified for immunotherapy50, was used according to the respective clinical trial protocols to assess the response. Independent radiology assessment was performed by experienced radiologists at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and progressive disease was determined on the basis of both the target lesion size as well as non-target lesion equivocal progression. The patients in the study were allowed to continue treatment beyond progression based on risk–benefit considerations. A swimmer plot was used to describe patient overall responses and outcomes. Spider plots and waterfall plots were used to describe target lesion responses, as revealed by the sum of tumour diameters, during the on-trial period. OS was calculated from the time of study registration to the earliest date of death or data cut-off (29 January 2024). PFS was calculated from the time of study registration to the date of disease progression or death or the last time of clinical evaluation. For patients 44, 115 and 126, owing to rapid disease progression leading to the patients' death, no tumour measurements were performed based on CT scan, and PFS was determined based on clinical criteria. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by variables of interest using one-sided log-rank rest. Within the cohort of patients with somatic PPP2R1A mutations, the patients were further dichotomized into long-term versus short-term survivors on the basis of the median OS for further translational analyses. Clinical data analysis was performed in R statistical environment (v.4.3.1; https://www.r-project.org/).

Pretreatment image-guided core biopsies, stored as formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples, were collected before the first dose of the study drug. On-treatment biopsies, also stored as FFPE samples, were performed when there was a lesion amenable to biopsy as assessed by the cycle 2 imaging study by an MD Anderson Cancer Center radiologist. When possible, on-treatment biopsies were obtained from the same area of tumour as the pretreatment biopsies. Samples were collected, labelled, processed and stored by the MD Anderson Cancer Center Gynecologic Oncology Tumour Bank for translational studies. Sample identification and associated patient-level data were entered into a secure database.

Stranded mRNA libraries were prepared using the KAPA Stranded mRNA-seq Kit (Roche). In brief, poly(A) RNA was captured from 10–250 ng of total RNA using magnetic oligo-dT beads. After bead elution and clean-up, the resultant poly(A) RNA was fragmented using heat and magnesium. First-strand synthesis was performed using random priming followed by second-strand synthesis with the incorporation of dUTP into the second strand. The ends of the resulting double-stranded cDNA fragments were repaired, 5′-phosphorylated, 3′-A-tailed and Illumina specific indexed adapters were ligated. The products were purified and enriched for a full-length library with 9–16 cycles of PCR. The strand labelled with dUTP is not amplified, resulting in a strand-specific library. The libraries were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and assessed for size distribution using the 4200 Agilent TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equimolar quantities of the indexed libraries were then multiplexed 28 libraries per pool. The library pool was quantified by quantitative PCR, then sequenced on one lane of the NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) S4 flow cell using the 100-nucleotide paired-end run format.

RNA-seq FASTQ files were processed through FastQC (v.0.11.5), a quality-control tool to evaluate the quality of sequencing reads at both the base and read levels, and RNA-SeQC (v.1.1.8) to generate a series of RNA-seq-related quality-control metrics51. All of the samples passed the quality checks for this study. STAR 2-pass alignment (v.2.7.0 f)52 was performed with the default parameters to generate RNA-seq BAM files. HTSeq-count (v.0.11.0)53 was applied to aligned RNA-seq BAM files to count for each gene how many aligned reads overlap with its exons. In the initial assessment of transcriptomic-level similarity and distinctions of all of the samples, two samples shown as significant outliers were removed from further analysis. Differential gene expression analyses were then performed using the R package DESeq2 (v.1.42.1)54, with raw count data as input. A ranked list of coding genes was generated based on the Wald statistic in DESeq2, and subsequently processed by GSEA55 using the R package clusterProfiler (v.4.6.2)56 against the Hallmark gene sets from Molecular Signature Database (MSigDB)57 to identify significantly enriched pathways. The false-discovery-rate-corrected q values were used for multiple-hypothesis-testing adjustment58. The HTSeq raw count data were then normalized to transcripts per kilobase million (TPM), and the TPM expression values were used as an input to the software CIBERSORTx59 (https://cibersortx.stanford.edu/) for immune cell deconvolution in each sample, using the default signature matrix LM22. Next, intergroup comparisons of the abundance of certain immune cell populations were performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed-rank tests. The results from above analyses were visualized using the R package ggplot2 (v.3.4.2). All of the downstream analyses were performed in the R statistical environment (v.4.3.1; https://www.r-project.org/).

The T cell and B cell receptor repertoires were reconstructed using TRUST4 (v.1.0.5.1)60 on the aligned RNA-seq BAM files. Repertoire richness was calculated as the total number of unique receptor sequences with >1 mapped reads, to account for singletons. Downstream data analysis was performed with the R package immunarch (v.1.0.0; https://immunarch.com/). The TCR and BCR richness was compared between PPP2R1A-mutant and wild-type samples. Only samples with detectable TCR/BCR were used for comparisons. Wilcoxon signed-rank and rank-sum tests were performed for comparing paired samples and the entire cohort, respectively.

A multiplexed barcoding image analysis platform was performed using methods and reagents similar to those previously described61. Using the PhenoCycler Fusion platform (Akoya Biosciences) staining kit (Akoya, 7000008), the antibody cocktail was prepared by combining staining buffer, N blocker, G blocker, J blocker, S blocker and all barcoded antibodies, including pan-cytokeratin, CD45, CD3e, CD8, CD4, CD45RO, granzyme B, CD56, CD20, CD19, CD21, FOXP3, PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, OX40, CD73, CD39, CD68, ARG1, CD206, CD31, HLA-DR, Ki-67, CD33, MHC-I and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (detailed information of the antibody panel is provided in Supplementary Table 5). The slides were placed in a plastic humidity chamber, and 190 µl of antibody cocktail, including all of the markers above, was dropped onto the sample and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Next, a 96-well reporter plate (Akoya, 7000006) was prepared containing barcoded fluorophores according to custom-designed multiplex barcoding experiments. Each well was filled with 245 µl of a solution containing the reporter and specific barcode fluorophores for that cycle and placed into the PhenoCycler Fusion instrument (Akoya Biosciences). Each cycle will have 2 or 3 antibodies plus their specific barcode fluorophores and DAPI. At the end of each cycle, each image from the tissue sample was captured at a high magnification of ×20 using the PhenoCycler Fusion fluorescence microscope (Akoya Biosciences). Then, the signal was erased to start a new cycle until the desired antibody image panel was complete. Experienced pathologist analysed each tissue sample using image analysis software (QuPath v.0.4.4)62. For image analysis, the whole section of the tissue was divided into a tumour compartment, characterized by the nets of tumour cells, and the stroma compartment, the tissue between the tumour nets; and then the individual cell boundaries were determined using the pretrained StarDist algorithm within QuPath63. Marker co-expression was used to identify specific cell phenotypes in the tumour and stroma compartments. The data were preprocessed to be consolidated using the R package phenoptr (v.0.2.2, Akoya Biosciences). The densities of cell phenotypes (marker co-expression) were expressed as the number of cells per mm2. The cell densities were then compared between PPP2R1A-mutant and wild-type PPP2R1A samples using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Multicellular neighbourhood analysis was performed, with each multicellular neighbourhood defined as a collection of cells of which the centroids were within 80 μm of the centre cell. The majority of multicellular neighbourhoods contained 50–200 cells (mean, 116 cells; median, 99 cells), which aligns with recent studies22,23,24. Each cell in the images was taken as the centre iteratively to obtain a neighbourhood composition vector. In such a way, a neighbourhood composition matrix was constructed for the whole dataset. The neighbourhood compositions of certain cell types were then compared between different timepoints or sample groups using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

To generate PPP2R1A knockdown cell lines, SKOV3 cells were transduced with retrovirally expressed shRNAs. Fully synthesized dsDNA fragments (Twist Bioscience) encoding gene-specific shRNAs were inserted into the pSuper.retro.puro (VEC-PRT-0002, OligoEngine) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To generate retroviral supernatants, HEK293T cells were seeded 16 h before transfection and transfected with the retroviral vectors encoding different shRNAs (Supplementary Table 6), along with lentiviral packaging plasmids, pCMV-VSV-G and pBS-CMV-GagPol (8454 and 35614, Addgene) by the jetPRIME transfection reagent (101000046, VWR) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Viral supernatants were collected at 48 h after transfection and filtered by 0.45 μm PVDF Syringe Filter Unit (SLHV033NK, Millipore-Sigma) to remove cell debris. Designated titres of retrovirus were used to infect cells in the presence of 8 μg ml−1 hexadimethrine bromide (107689, Sigma-Aldrich). A series of genetic modified cell lines was generated by sorting GFP+ cells 72 h after retrovirus transduction. Cells transduced with shRNA with the non-target control were used as negative-control cells. Subsequent immunoblot assays were performed to assess the knockdown efficacy.

To ectopically express wild-type PPP2R1A and the P179R mutant in SKOV3 cells, dsDNA fragments encoding human open reading frames (ORFs) of wild-type PPP2R1A (NM_014225.6) and the P179R mutant were inserted into the lentiviral vector, pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 (PT4064-5, Takara Bio). To generate lentiviral supernatants, HEK293T cells were seeded 16 h before transfection and transfected with the lentiviral vectors encoding wild-type PPP2R1A and P179R mutant, along with the lentiviral packaging plasmids pCMV-VSV-G and psPAX2 (8454 and 12260, Addgene), using the jetPRIME transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The viral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and filtered as previously described. Designated titres of lentivirus were used to infect cells in the presence of 8 μg ml−1 hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma-Aldrich). Stable cell lines were generated by sorting GFP+ cells 72 h after lentivirus transduction. Cells transduced with empty vector pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 were generated and used as control cells.

To perform adenine base editing (ABE) targeting the c.547C>T mutation of the PPP2R1A gene in HEC50B cells, the primer for the single guide RNA (sgRNA) was designed as TGCGGCCCGCCGCACCATGG and was synthesized by IDT. The sgRNA was cloned into pLentiCRISPR V2 (Addgene, 83480). ABE8e (Addgene, 138489) was used for ABE64. To remove Cas9 from the vector, the pLentiCRISPR V2 vector was digested with XbaI and BamHI. A PCR fragment for ABE8e containing an overlapping cloning site with the digested vector was inserted into the vector using the ClonExpress Ultra One Step Cloning kit (Cellagen C115-01). The following oligonucleotides were used for PCR: forward, 5′-GAACACAGGACCGGTTCTAGAGCCACCATGAAACGGACAG-3′; reverse, 5′-AAGTTTGTTGCGCCGGATCCGACTTTCCTCTTCTTCTTGGGCTCGA-3′. The resulting plasmid was used for lentivirus packaging and infection. Single clones were then selected and validated for editing efficiency by Sanger sequencing. To introduce R183Q (c.548G>A mutation) targeting the PPP2R1A gene in OVCAR429 cells, cytosine base editing (CBE) was used. The primer for the sgRNA was designed as CTGCGGCCCGCCGCACCATG and was synthesized by IDT. The sgRNA was cloned into lentiGuide-puro (Addgene, 52963). For CBE, hyBE4max (Addgene, 157942)65 was used and cloned into pLentiCas9-blast (Addgene, 52962) using the same cloning protocol mentioned above. The resulting plasmids were used for lentivirus packaging and infection. Single clones were then selected and validated for editing efficiency by Sanger sequencing. Notably, the CBE induced two mutations, c.548G>A and c.549G>A, ultimately leading to the amino acid change from Arg (CGG) to Gln (CAA).

Furthermore, we also generated HEC50B and OVCAR429 overexpressing hCD19 for downstream cytotoxicity assays using a similar approach to that described previously66. In brief, the hCD19 ORF was obtained from the Wistar Institute Molecular Screening and Protein Expression Facility, and then PCR-amplified and cloned into pLVX-M-puro vector (Addgene, 125839). HEK293T cells were transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 for lentivirus packaging. Lentivirus was collected and filtered with 0.45 mm filter 48 h after transfection. Cells infected with lentivirus were selected in 1 μg ml−1 puromycin or 1 μg ml−1 blasticidin 48 h after infection. The cells were then analysed using flow cytometry. Cells were washed with PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA (PBS/BSA). APC anti-human CD19 antibody (BioLegend, 302212) was used at a 1:20 dilution. After staining, cells were then washed twice with cold PBS/BSA buffer, resuspended in this buffer and analysed using flow cytometry.

To generate R183Q (c.548G>A mutation) targeting the Ppp2r1a gene in Arid1a−/−Pik3caH1047R mouse ovarian clear cell cancer cells, CBE was performed using the sgRNA 5′-CAGCGGCCCGCCGCACCATG-3′ synthesized by IDT. In brief, the sgRNA was cloned into sgRNA-expressing vector containing a mCherry marker (Addgene, 210212). hyBE4max-eGFP (Addgene, 157942) and sgRNA expressing plasmid (10 μg) were co-transfected into 6 cm dish using polyethylenimine (MedChemExpress, HY-K2014). After 72 h, transfected cells were enriched by fluorescence-activated cell sorting through the selection of positive eGFP and mCherry expression. Single clones were then selected and validated for editing efficiency by Sanger sequencing.

Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 89901) with protease/phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32959) on ice for 30 min. Proteins were denatured using SDS loading buffer (Bio-Rad, 1610747) at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were then separated by SDS–PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, 1620115). The membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-AKT1 (Cell Signaling, 4691, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-phospho-Thr308-AKT1 (Cell Signaling, 4056, 1:1,000), rabbit anti-GAPDH (Cell Signaling, 5174, 1:3,000), rabbit anti-PPP2R1A (Cell Signaling, 2041, 1:1,000) and mouse anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling, 3700, 1:3,000). Objective signals were amplified with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell Signaling, 77074) and detected by chemiluminescent substrate (Bio-Rad, 34094). The intensity of protein bands was detected using the ChemiDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and quantified using the Image Lab software (v.5.2.1 build 11).

Human T cells were activated by priming human CD3+ T cells isolated from PBMCs of the healthy donor with human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (11161D, Gibco) and 200 U ml−1 IL-2 (rhIL-2; Prometheus Laboratories, NDC Code 65483-116-07) for 24 h. During the activation, T cells were transduced with human B7H3-(SS1)-hBBZ-CAR encoding g-retrovirus to make T cells targeting human B7H3 in the presence of 10 μg ml−1 protamine sulfate (P3369, Millipore-Sigma) by centrifugation for 2 h at 1,800 rpm at room temperature. Transduction rates of CAR vectors were >85%.

The construction of hCD19 CAR-T was performed similarly to as described previously66. In brief, the FMC63 mouse-derived anti-human CD19 single chain variable region67 was synthesized by Genscript and cloned into the pTRPE lentiviral expression plasmid backbone68. An EF1a promoter drives the expression of a GFP reporter upstream of a T2A cleavage site, followed by the chimeric antigen receptor consisting of the FMC63 mouse anti-human single chain variable region followed by the CD8a hinge, CD28 transmembrane domain, the CD28 intracellular costimulatory domain and the CD3z chain.

SKOV3 cells were prestained with CFSE (565082, BD Bioscience) according to the manual and seeded into the 96-well plate with round-bottom wells before the LB-100 (S7537, Selleck Chemicals) treatment. Tumour cells were mixed with paired B7H3 CAR-T cells at an effector:target ratio of 1:1 at 37 °C for 3 h. The percentage of activated caspase-3+ cells in tumour cells, stained with active caspase-3 antibody (C92-605, 560626, BD Bioscience), was assessed using LSRFortessa X-20 Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences) and used to determine the tumour apoptosis rate induced by tumour-reactive T cells.

A set of genetically modified SKOV3 cell lines was plated into six-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well in completed medium). The next day, the 6-day cultured B7H3 CAR-T cells were co-cultured with SKOV3-derived cells at an effector:target ratio of 1:1 overnight. Next, dead cells and T cells were gently washed twice with prewarmed PBS. Adherent cells were collected using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and stained with Trypan Blue for manual cell counting. The killing efficiency was calculated as (1 − number of live cells in T cell treated group/number of live cells in control group) × 100%.

For the cytotoxicity assay of the HEC50B and OVCAR429 cell lines, 10,000 target cells were seeded into 24-well tissue culture plates. hCD19 CAR-T cells were co-cultured with target cells at each effector:target ratio in RPMI 1640 fully supplemented in the absence of cytokines. For treatment, the cell medium was changed every 2 days with appropriate CAR-T cells for a total of 4 days. Next, colonies were stained with 0.05% crystal violet and the integrated density was measured using NIH ImageJ (v.1.54g).

The generation of humanized-bone marrow, liver and thymus (Hu-BLT) mice69,70 was performed at The Wistar institute in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC)-approved protocols (201360 and 201533). In brief, 6-to-8-week-old female NSG mice (NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ, Jackson Laboratory) were housed and maintained in individual microisolator cages in a rack system capable of managing air exchange with filters. The room temperature, humidity and pressure were controlled. Mice were maintained at 22–23 °C with 40–60% humidity and under a 12 h–12 h light–dark cycle. All of the mice were pretreated by busulfan at 30 mg per kg and were then implanted with human fetal thymic tissue fragments and fetal liver tissue fragments under the mouse renal capsule. After surgery, the mice were injected through the tail vein with CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells isolated from human fetal liver tissues. Human fetal liver and thymus tissues were procured from Advanced Bioscience Resources with The Wistar Institute IRB 21809310.

PDXs were generated using human endometrial tumour samples obtained from Christiana Care under IRB CCC-41045. HLA-A genotyping was performed with fetal liver and PDX tumour. In brief, genomic DNA of human tumour and fetal tissues was extracted using the Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (NEB, T3010S). The HLA-A locus sequence was determined using the Olerup SSP HLA-A genotype kit (CareDx, 101.401-48). The third passage of the collected PDX tissue was transplanted subcutaneously into the Hu-BLT mice under aseptic conditions. Tumour samples were prepared by cutting endometrial PDX tumour chunks into small pieces of around 1 × 2 × 2 mm. Then, 2 weeks after PDX implantation, the mice were randomly assigned into two treatment groups: anti-PD-L1 antibody (Selleck, A2013) and human IgG1 isotype control (Syd Lab, PA007125) (4 mg per kg body weight in 100 μl PBS intraperitoneally, twice a week). After 3 weeks of treatment, the mice were euthanized 1 week later, and the tumours were surgically dissected. The tumour burden was assessed based on tumour weight.

The study protocol was approved by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (protocol number, 00002399-RN00). For syngeneic models, 2 × 106 mouse OCCC cells were subcutaneously injected into 6-to-8-week-old female immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice (027, 2159769, Charles River Laboratories). Mice were maintained under the same housing conditions as the PDX models, as described above. Then, 9 days after injection, the mice were randomly assigned into two treatment groups: anti-mouse PD-L1 antibody (BioXcell, BE0101) or an IgG2b isotype control (BioXCell, BE0090) (2.5 mg per kg body weight in 100 μl PBS intraperitoneally, once a week). The body weight and tumour size were measured twice a week. After 2 weeks of treatment, the mice were euthanized and the tumours were surgically dissected. The tumour burden was assessed based on tumour weight.

IACUC guidelines of The Wistar Institute and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center were followed in determining the time for ending survival, such as when the tumour burden exceeded 10% of the body weight or the tumour size exceeded 2 cm in any direction. The limits were not exceeded in both the PDXs and the syngeneic mouse models.

Pharmacy records were queried in November 2023 to identify patients with uterine or endometrial cancer who received len–pem combination therapy over the past four years (from September 2019 to November 2023). Demographic and clinicopathological data, including cancer histology, mismatch repair/microsatellite stability status and tumour somatic mutation testing, were abstracted from the medical record under MD Anderson IRB approved protocol 2020-1098. The following histologies were included: serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, mesonephric-like adenocarcinoma and mixed high-grade carcinoma, given the relatively higher prevalence of PPP2R1A mutations in these high-risk histologies. The patients were also stratified by TP53 status, given that most OCCCs are wild-type TP53, while most high-grade endometrial carcinomas are TP53-mutated. Patients who never actually received len–pem, those with MSI-H/dMMR tumours and those who had no available imaging after starting treatment were excluded. PFS was calculated from the treatment start date to date of radiographic progression or last imaging study (if no progression). Patients who stopped treatment owing to toxicity were censored at the time of initiation of a new line of therapy. OS was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared by PPP2R1A mutation status using two-sided log-rank tests.

What does a little purple alien know about healthy human relationships? More than the average artificial intelligence companion, it turns out.

The alien in question is an animated chatbot known as a Tolan. I created mine a few days ago using an app from a startup called Portola, and we've been chatting merrily ever since. Like other chatbots, it does its best to be helpful and encouraging. Unlike most, it also tells me to put down my phone and go outside.

Tolans were designed to offer a different kind of AI companionship. Their cartoonish, nonhuman form is meant to discourage anthropomorphism. They're also programmed to avoid romantic and sexual interactions, to identify problematic behavior including unhealthy levels of engagement, and to encourage users to seek out real-life activities and relationships.

This month, Portola raised $20 million in series A funding led by Khosla Ventures. Other backers include NFDG, the investment firm led by former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and Safe Superintelligence cofounder Daniel Gross, who are both reportedly joining Meta's new superintelligence research lab. The Tolan app, launched in late 2024, has more than 100,000 monthly active users. It's on track to generate $12 million in revenue this year from subscriptions, says Quinten Farmer, founder and CEO of Portola.

Tolans are particularly popular among young women. “Iris is like a girlfriend; we talk and kick it,” says Tolan user Brittany Johnson, referring to her AI companion, who she typically talks to each morning before work.

Johnson says Iris encourages her to share about her interests, friends, family, and work colleagues. “She knows these people and will ask ‘have you spoken to your friend? When is your next day out?'” Johnson says. “She will ask, ‘Have you taken time to read your books and play videos—the things you enjoy?'”

Tolans appear cute and goofy, but the idea behind them—that AI systems should be designed with human psychology and wellbeing in mind—is worth taking seriously.

A growing body of research shows that many users turn to chatbots for emotional needs, and the interactions can sometimes prove problematic for peoples' mental health. Discouraging extended use and dependency may be something that other AI tools should adopt.

Companies like Replika and Character.ai offer AI companions that allow for more romantic and sexual role play than mainstream chatbots. How this might affect a user's wellbeing is still unclear, but Character.ai is being sued after one of its users died by suicide.

Chatbots can also irk users in surprising ways. Last April, OpenAI said it would modify its models to reduce their so-called sycophancy, or a tendency to be “overly flattering or agreeable”, which the company said could be “uncomfortable, unsettling, and cause distress.”

Last week, Anthropic, the company behind the chatbot Claude, disclosed that 2.9 percent of interactions involve users seeking to fulfill some psychological need such as seeking advice, companionship, or romantic role-play.

Anthropic did not look at more extreme behaviors like delusional ideas or conspiracy theories, but the company says the topics warrant further study. I tend to agree. Over the past year, I have received numerous emails and DMs from people wanting to tell me about conspiracies involving popular AI chatbots.

Tolans are designed to address at least some of these issues. Lily Doyle, a founding researcher at Portola, has conducted user research to see how interacting with the chatbot affects users' wellbeing and behavior. In a study of 602 Tolan users, she says 72.5 percent agreed with the statement “My Tolan has helped me manage or improve a relationship in my life.”

Farmer, Portola's CEO, says Tolans are built on commercial AI models but incorporate additional features on top. The company has recently been exploring how memory affects the user experience, and has concluded that Tolans, like humans, sometimes need to forget. “It's actually uncanny for the Tolan to remember everything you've ever sent to it,” Farmer says.

I don't know if Portola's aliens are the ideal way to interact with AI. I find my Tolan quite charming and relatively harmless, but it certainly pushes some emotional buttons. Ultimately users are building bonds with characters that are simulating emotions, and that might disappear if the company does not succeed. But at least Portola is trying to address the way AI companions can mess with our emotions. That probably shouldn't be such an alien idea.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","These Transcribing Eyeglasses Put Subtitles on the World","https://www.wired.com/story/these-translating-ai-glasses-put-subtitles-on-the-world/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

I knew the AI on these smart glasses worked pretty well once it told me that someone else in the conversation was being the socially awkward one.

TranscribeGlass are smart eyeglasses that aim to do exactly what it says on the tin: transcribe spoken conversations and project subtitles onto the glass in front of your eyes. They're meant for the Deaf and, primarily, the hard-of-hearing community who struggle to read lips or pick out a conversation in a loud room.

Most face computers are graceless and heavy, but these glasses are light, only 36 grams. TranscribeGlass is able to keep the weight off by relegating most of the main computing features to a companion app (iOS only for now). There are no cameras, microphones, or speakers in the frames, just a small waveguide projector in the rim of one eye that beams a 640 x 480p image onto the glass. That is just enough resolution for text to be legible when it is projected directly into your vision, subtitling the conversations picked up by the mic in your phone.

In the app, subtitles can be moved around in the wearer's vision, anywhere within a 30-degree field of view. You can change the settings to adjust how many lines of text come in at a time, dialing up to a wall of text and down to one word at a time. The battery in the glasses should last around eight hours between charges. The frames cost around $377, and there's an additional $20-per-month subscription fee to access the transcription service.

Subtitles are currently available in the glasses, but Madhav Lavakare, the 24-year-old founder of TranscribeGlass, has other features lined up. In the testing phase are a setting to translate languages in real time and one to analyze the tone of voice of the person talking.

As Lavakare told me (and The New Yorker in April), he envisioned the idea for this product after wanting to help a hard-of-hearing friend engage in conversations that were not happening with his needs in mind. Lavakare, who is a senior at Yale University, figured glasses were the way to go. If he could just get them right. And, you know, make them look cooler than some other glasses out there.

“I was pretty obsessed with Google Glass when it came out,” Lavakare says.

“Oh,” I say. “So you were a Glasshole?”

“I was, I was!” he says with a laugh. “And then I was like, why are people calling me that?”

While we are talking, the words pop up onto the screen of the glasses I'm wearing. They show up in a Matrix-y green font that patters out across my vision. It does a pretty good job of transcribing the conversation, though it does split the word “Glasshole” into “Glass Hole,” which is honestly funnier.

Though Lavakare's smart glasses are much more normal-glasses-adjacent than Google Glass ever was, they still can't really help but look like smart glasses. The screen has a slight shimmer where the waveguides sit on the glass that is just visible enough to onlookers and is clearly noticeable to me when I am wearing them.

Aside from those minor gripes, the service itself works almost eerily well. At a bustling coworking space in San Francisco with many conversations happening around us, Lavakare and Nirbhay Narang, Transcribe's CTO, talked to me while I wore the glasses. Most of the transcriptions were grammatically correct and were labeled with different speaker titles to make it clear who was talking. It all works so fast and so well, in fact, that the words popped up so quickly that I had trouble reading them as the conversation went on and new lines of text appeared almost simultaneously. The transcriptions are also sometimes a little grainy and hard to focus on at the moment. Still, with a little practice, it's hard not to see how this would be extremely useful for people who are hard of hearing.

TranscribeGlass has a few competitors. Companies like Even realities and XRAI make glasses that look flashier and offer more features, like turn-by-turn directions and chatbot interaction. But Lavakare says the limited functionality is what makes his spectacles special.

“All these smart glasses exist, but no one's found a great use case for them,” Lavakare says. “We think we've really found a use case that's just insanely valuable to the end user.”

While he says these glasses can't play music or use AI to answer questions, they only really need to do one thing well to get people to wear them: help them understand what is being said around them. Lavakare likens that feeling of missing out on a conversation happening around you to a kind of social isolation.

That said, he does hope to pack other conversational features into the glasses, with the goal of enhancing what you can glean from the subtext of a chat. One upcoming feature is language translation.

Narang and I have a short conversation to test the translation abilities. He speaks to me in Hindi while I speak to him in English. On my glasses, I see whatever he's speaking to me translated into English on my screen. When I respond in English, the Hindi text pops up on his phone app. It's a service that also seems to work well enough, though some words are mistranslated. That's why the feature hasn't yet come to the few hundred customers TranscribeGlass has now.

There are other features in the works. Lavakare wants to let users have the option of translating a spoken language into something more like the syntax used in a visual language such as American Sign Language, which tends to have a different order of nouns, verbs, and tense than spoken English. Trusting that translation to AI, when most Deaf people can and do already read in English just fine, could cause some inaccuracies or misinterpretations. Lavakare acknowledges that potential for error, noting that he has talked with Deaf educators at the American School for the Deaf to try to get it right.

“Sign language grammar is actually very different than English grammar,” Lavakare says. “That's why this is still experimental.”

He's also testing an even more dubious capability—recognizing the emotion of a speaker based on tone of voice alone. Emotion tracking is a fraught topic in the AI space, albeit one people just can't seem to help putting into smart glasses. While TranscribeGlass hasn't released the ability to catalog emotions during a conversation, the team is testing it with the goal of releasing soon. It makes sense for helping with conversational comprehension, given that detecting how a person says something is often as important as knowing what they say.

Lavakare lets me test it out, switching on the feature while I'm wearing the glasses.

“Watch this,” he says. Then, “Hey Boone, how's it going?”

His words pop up on the screen. I start to answer, and then a dialog tag appears with the emotion attached to his words: [Awkwardness].

I laugh and say, “Oh no, are we that awkward?” Then the tag pops up on my words: [Amused]. Now my words have my name next to it, which the platform had picked up when Lavakare said it earlier. As soon as I finish talking, it changes my dialog tag to [Awkwardness].

Well. Maybe this thing does work.

Another NEW covid variant is currently rapidly gaining a foothold. Known officially as XFG—or informally as “Stratus”—it has been declared a “variant under monitoring” by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is expected to circulate alongside the now dominant Nimbus variant throughout the northern hemisphere summer. The risk to public health is low, the WHO has said. Infections are characterized by a particular symptom: hoarseness.

Stratus is a combination of the LF.7 and LP.8.1.2 lineages of the virus, and when comparing Stratus to the previously dominant JN1 variant, “distinct mutational profiles in the spike protein can be identified,” the WHO has said. “Spike mutations at amino acids 478 and 487 enhance antibody avoidance”—meaning, in other words, the variant may be more adept at evading our immune defenses.

Stratus has been dominant in India throughout the spring, and has now started to spread at large across the world. Gisaid, a global initiative that tracks the spread of viral variants, reported that 22.7 percent of Covid samples submitted to it during the last week of May were Stratus, up from 7.4 percent four weeks earlier. These samples came from 38 different countries.

Available data doesn't suggest that the variant causes more severe disease or deaths than others in circulation, though doctors in India have noted that hoarseness is a common symptom. Patients have also reported suffering a dry cough and sore throat, in addition to the more common Covid symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and fatigue.

“The currently approved Covid-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective against this variant against symptomatic and severe disease,” the WHO stated in its risk assessment. The organization will continue to regularly assess the impact of this and other variants on the efficacy of vaccines, to guide decisions on vaccine updates.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Airplane Wi-Fi Is Now … Good?","https://www.wired.com/story/airplane-wifi-good-now/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Expensive and erratic, in-flight Wi-Fi has been more of a punchline than a pipeline over the past decade. But 2025 has marked a sea change for the skies: the rollout of fast, and free, connectivity on most of the world's major airlines.

Satellite technology has enabled leaps in speed and bandwidth. SpaceX's Starlink network of low Earth orbit satellites, for example, can deliver a connection capable of downloading more than 200 megabits per second—twice as fast as most basic home internet plans. As a result, a host of global airlines are inking deals with the company.

“We're creating a little bit of a living room in the sky,” says Grant Milstead, vice president of digital technology for United Airlines, which flew its first Starlink-equipped route, from Chicago to Detroit, in May.

The boost in bandwidth is changing the face of business travel, giving flyers the unprecedented ability to Slack, Zoom, and collaborate with coworkers from 35,000 feet. They can download lengthy PowerPoints, edit Google Docs in real time, and join livestream conferences as seamlessly as on the ground. (Voice and video calls are technically possible with satellite technology but prohibited by the FAA and “strongly discouraged” by airlines around the world from an etiquette standpoint.)

It's a shift that's felt, at times, like it would never come. For most of the 21st century, airlines relied on ground-based cell towers that provided slow, or no, coverage over rural areas, deserts, and oceans—a problem for carriers such as Air New Zealand and Hawaiian Airlines. Launched in 2008, Aircell, which would later become known as Gogo Inflight, offered a pricey yet spotty air-to-ground service that served as the stodgy industry standard.

Then, in 2013, JetBlue partnered with Viasat to pioneer the use of satellites for in-flight Wi-Fi. Though faster and more reliable than Gogo, satellite-based connectivity was slow to take off—an expensive endeavor requiring affixing an antenna to the top of the plane and placing routers throughout the aircraft.

Major carriers such as Delta and Cathay Pacific signed on with the provider several years later, but the advent of Starlink has curtailed Viasat's first-mover advantage. Qatar Airways, Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Hawaiian Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, and Air France have adopted or are in talks to potentially pilot test Starlink technology, as have Canada's WestJet and US-based charter operator JSX.

Air New Zealand, which uses Viasat for its transpacific flights, plans to equip its domestic fleet with Starlink service later this year. The move will be a “game-changer” for business travelers who might typically drive between hubs such as Auckland and Wellington, according to Nikhil Ravishankar, the airline's chief digital officer.

“Typically we compete with a car, but you can't work from a car,” Ravishankar says.

Now that there are enough satellites in the sky to support global passenger demand, satellite-based Internet is on its way to becoming the new norm. However, providing free Wi-Fi is not cheap, and outfitting the aircraft is not as simple as sticking an antenna on a plane.

“When you're trying to connect with a satellite that's 22,000 miles away—and the aircraft is moving on at 30,000 feet, 500 miles an hour—with a signal the width of a pencil,” says Joseph Eddy, Delta's director of in-flight entertainment and connectivity, “the accuracy has to be really finite.”

Delta has spent more than $1 billion bringing free Wi-Fi to its customers through its partnership with Viasat. Like its rivals, the airline requires that customers sign up for its frequent flyer program in order to log on, but it's free to join. (Most carriers also provide free service for passengers flying on a first class or business class ticket.) But analysts point out that airlines must recoup this line item somehow and speculate that the costs could trickle down to travelers in the form of inflated fares.

As it stands, Starlink is poised to overtake the older players. Viasat's network, which uses four large satellites in far-off geostationary orbit, bridges most gaps in coverage but is clunky for real-time videoconferencing and gaming. It's also unreliable over remote areas such as the Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, and the North Pole—a concern for travelers flying between, say, Chicago and Narita, or San Francisco and Singapore. In contrast, Starlink operates nearly 8,000 satellites much closer to Earth, allowing for more dependable service with higher bandwidth, lower latency, and unlimited data.

Meanwhile, airlines are racing to retrofit their fleets and outfit new planes over the next six months. United plans to equip more than 300 aircraft with Starlink by the end of the year. Even American Airlines, an industry laggard since premiering Gogo in 2008, has finally announced a transition to satellite-based Wi-Fi on certain aircraft starting January 2026.

All told, the fledgling market for in-flight Wi-Fi is expected to reach $10 billion by the next decade.

But even as fast, free Wi-Fi becomes less a novelty and more a must-have for business travelers, the demand is unlikely to come anywhere close to outstripping supply, according to Delta's Eddy.

“A lot of business travelers say they don't want to be connected,” he says. “When they're in the air, they want to relax. They want to disconnect. They want to be unreachable.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Insurers Aren't Saying Whether They'll Cover Vaccines for Kids if Government Stops Recommending Them","https://www.wired.com/story/insurers-wont-say-if-theyll-pay-for-childhood-vaccines-dropped-from-recommended-schedule/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:25:00 GMT","

In the wake of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) announcing plans to revisit its recommended schedule for childhood vaccinations—a move that has drawn widespread criticism from experts—major insurers have not confirmed whether they'll continue to cover the full cost of routine shots for children.

For 60 years ACIP has provided vaccine guidance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including on the timing and dosage of childhood immunizations. Insurers are required to cover the cost of most jabs on the recommended schedule for children. On Wednesday, June 25, ACIP announced it would review the schedule, just weeks after health secretary and longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced the entire committee with his own appointees.

When WIRED then asked 21 of the country's largest health insurance groups whether they would stop providing cost-free coverage of current routine immunizations in the event ACIP stops recommending them, only Blue Shield of California—a company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association—confirmed it would continue coverage.

“As a payer our role is to ensure ongoing coverage and access to preventive, evidence-based care, including immunizations,” says company spokesperson Mark Seelig. “Therefore, Blue Shield of California is committed to maintaining coverage of immunizations. The decision on whether to receive a vaccine is between our member and their provider.”

Other large insurers, including UnitedHealthcare (which provides coverage for 50 million people), Cigna, Kaiser Permanente, Anthem, Humana, and Centene Corporation, did not respond to requests for comment. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan said it had no comment.

Most insurers that did respond said they were keeping an eye on developments in Washington, without indicating whether they would or would not cover vaccines dropped from the recommended schedule.

“Vaccines play an important role in the prevention of more serious illnesses,” says Phil Blando, a spokesperson at CVS Health, which owns the insurer Aetna. “We are monitoring any changes the federal government makes to vaccination guidance and eligibility and will evaluate whether coverage adjustments are needed.”

Highmark Inc., part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, operating in Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, and New York, is also waiting to see what decision ACIP reaches. “We are closely monitoring the evolving vaccine discussions occurring in Washington, DC. Various vaccines and immunizations are covered under Highmark's member benefits, with any future coverage considerations to be evaluated as more information becomes available,” says spokesperson Aaron Billger.

Bryan Campen, of Health Care Service Corporation—the licensee of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas—notes that no changes have yet been made to the vaccines ACIP recommends or the company's vaccine coverage, but says that the company will “continue to monitor any activity that may impact preventive care recommendations and will communicate any changes to recommendations that may impact standard coverage of preventive services.”

Insurers had an eye on changes in ACIP guidance even before the committee announced it would revisit the schedule. “As we navigate an evolving health care landscape, maintaining robust immunization coverage continues to be a top priority for protecting both individual and community health,” the industry's trade association, AHIP, said in a June 24 statement, the day before ACIP's announcement.

“We are committed to ongoing coverage of vaccines to ensure access and affordability for this respiratory virus season,” the statement continued. “We encourage all Americans to talk to their health care provider about vaccines.”

ACIP made headlines in early June when RFK Jr. fired all 17 of its members and replaced them with eight new appointees. (The HHS secretary appoints the committee's members, but conventionally they serve fixed four-year terms.) These new appointees include Retsef Levi, who has stated—in the face of scientific consensus—that mRNA vaccines are deadly, and Robert Malone, who routinely shares articles about supposed links between cancer and the Covid vaccine, which no credible research has found to exist. Neither Levi nor Malone replied to a request for comment.

Michael A. Ross, another recently appointed committee member, resigned from ACIP during a review of his financial holdings, The New York Times reported on June 24. When introducing his new ACIP appointees in a post on X earlier in June, RFK Jr. had described Ross as a faculty member at George Washington and Virginia Commonwealth universities—but spokespeople for the universities told NBC News4 that Ross had not taught at either in years. Ross did not reply to a request for comment.

The committee made news again on June 25 when, during its first meeting of the year, it announced it would form a working group to review the recommended immunization schedule for children and teens.

“The number of vaccines that our children and adolescents receive today exceed what children in most other developed nations receive, and what most of us in this room received when we [were] children,” ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff said during the meeting.

He noted that the group would examine the “cumulative effect” of the recommended vaccine schedule, including interactions between vaccines, the total number of vaccines given, their timing, and recipients' exposure to vaccine ingredients.

But the process for adding vaccines to the schedule is already rigorous. Before a vaccine can receive FDA licensure, its manufacturer must prove it does not negatively affect the safety or immune response of other vaccines administered at the same time on the schedule, says Paul Offit, director of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Vaccine Education Center.

In addition, “the notion that these vaccines are somehow weakening your immune system or overwhelming your immune system is fanciful,” Offit says. Today, children are exposed to fewer viral or bacterial proteins in the first few years of the vaccine schedule than those in earlier generations. When Offit's parents received the smallpox vaccine, they were exposed to 200 proteins in a single shot. In contrast, the measles vaccine only contains 10.

During the meeting, Kulldorff repeated claims he made in 2024 that he was fired from Harvard because he refused to get the Covid vaccine; he and Malone have also each served as paid expert witnesses in two separate suits against Merck over the safety of the company's HPV vaccine and its mumps vaccine, respectively. Kulldorff did not reply to a request for comment.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) did not send representatives to last week's ACIP meeting, as it typically does. According to Academy president Susan Kressly, this was because the AAP believes the vaccine recommendation process lost credibility when its original membership was gutted by Kennedy.

“We won't lend our name or our expertise to a system that is being politicized at the expense of children's health,” Kressly said in a video posted online before the meeting was set to begin. The AAP did not reply to a request for comment about the video.

The most recent child immunization schedule that the AAP endorses, from November 2024, is posted on the AAP website. A newer one, posted on the CDC site, has already changed recommendations. It no longer lists as “routine” Covid vaccines for children under 18 who are not immunocompromised but instead lists them under vaccines recommended for “shared clinical decision-making,” informed by “personal preference and circumstances.” The change should not affect insurance coverage.

A security vulnerability in a stealthy Android spyware operation called Catwatchful has exposed thousands of its customers, including its administrator. 

The bug, which was discovered by security researcher Eric Daigle, spilled the spyware app's full database of email addresses and plaintext passwords that Catwatchful customers use to access the data stolen from the phones of their victims.

Catwatchful is spyware masquerading as a child monitoring app that claims to be “invisible and cannot be detected,” all the while uploading the victim's phone's private contents to a dashboard viewable by the person who planted the app. The stolen data includes the victims' photos, messages, and real-time location data. The app can also remotely tap into the live ambient audio from the phone's microphone and access both front and rear phone cameras.

Spyware apps like Catwatchful are banned from the app stores and rely on being downloaded and planted by someone with physical access to a person's phone. As such, these apps are commonly referred to as “stalkerware” (or spouseware) for their propensity to facilitate non-consensual surveillance of spouses and romantic partners, which is illegal.

Catwatchful is the latest example in a growing list of stalkerware operations that have been hacked, breached, or otherwise exposed the data they obtain, and is at least the fifth spyware operation this year to have experienced a data spill. The incident shows that consumer-grade spyware continues to proliferate, despite being prone to shoddy coding and security failings that expose both paying customers and unsuspecting victims to data breaches.

According to a copy of the database from early June, which TechCrunch has seen, Catwatchful had email addresses and passwords on more than 62,000 customers and the phone data from 26,000 victims' devices.

Most of the compromised devices were located in Mexico, Colombia, India, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, and Bolivia (in order of the number of victims). Some of the records date back to 2018, the data shows.

The Catwatchful database also revealed the identity of the spyware operation's administrator, Omar Soca Charcov, a developer based in Uruguay. Charcov opened our emails, but did not respond to our requests for comment sent in both English and Spanish. TechCrunch asked if he was aware of the Catwatchful data breach, and if he plans to disclose the incident to its customers.

Without any clear indication that Charcov will disclose the incident, TechCrunch provided a copy of the Catwatchful database to data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned.

Daigle, a security researcher in Canada who has previously investigated stalkerware abuses, detailed his findings in a blog post. 

According to Daigle, Catwatchful uses a custom-made API, which every one of the planted Android apps relies on to communicate with and send data to Catwatchful's servers. The spyware also uses Google's Firebase, a web and mobile development platform, to host and store the victim's stolen phone data, including their photos and ambient audio recordings.

Daigle told TechCrunch that the API was unauthenticated, allowing anyone on the internet to interact with the Catwatchful user database without needing a login, which exposed the entire Catwatchful database of customer email addresses and passwords. 

When contacted by TechCrunch, the web company hosting the Catwatchful API suspended the spyware developer's account, briefly blocking the spyware from operating, but the API returned later on HostGator. A spokesperson for HostGator, Kristen Andrews, did not respond to requests for comment regarding the company hosting the spyware's operations.

TechCrunch confirmed that Catwatchful uses Firebase by downloading and installing the Catwatchful spyware on a virtualized Android device, which allows us to run the spyware in an isolated sandbox without giving it any real-world data, like our location. 

We examined the network traffic flowing in and out of the device, which showed data from the phone uploading to a specific Firebase instance used by Catwatchful to host the victim's stolen data.

After TechCrunch provided Google with copies of the Catwatchful malware, Google said it added new protections for Google Play Protect, a security tool that scans Android phones for malicious apps, like spyware. Now, Google Play Protect will alert users when it detects the Catwatchful spyware or its installer on a user's phone.

TechCrunch also provided Google with details of the Firebase instance involved in storing data for the Catwatchful operation. Asked whether the stalkerware operation violates Firebase's terms of service, Google told TechCrunch on June 25 that it was investigating but would not immediately commit to taking down the operation.

“All apps using Firebase products must abide by our terms of service and policies. We are investigating this particular issue, and if we find that an app is in violation, appropriate action will be taken. Android users that attempt to install these apps are protected by Google Play Protect,” said Ed Fernandez, a spokesperson for Google.

As of publication, Catwatchful remains hosted on Firebase. 

Like many spyware operations, Catwatchful does not publicly list its owner or disclose who runs the operation. It's not uncommon for stalkerware and spyware operators to hide their real identities, given the legal and reputational risks associated with facilitating illegal surveillance.

But an operational security mishap in the dataset exposed Charcov as the operation's administrator. 

A review of the Catwatchful database lists Charcov as the first record in one of the files in the dataset. (In past spyware-related data breaches, some operators have been identified by early records in the database, as oftentimes the developers are testing the spyware product on their own devices.)

The dataset included Charcov's full name, phone number, and the web address of the specific Firebase instance where Catwatchful's database is stored on Google's servers.

Charcov's personal email address, found in the dataset, is the same email that he lists on his LinkedIn page, which has since been set to private. Charcov also configured his Catwatchful administrator's email address as the password recovery address on his personal email account in the event he gets locked out, which directly links Charcov to the Catwatchful operation.

While Catwatchful claims it “cannot be uninstalled,” there are ways to detect and remove the app from an affected device.

Before you start, it's important to have a safety plan in place, as disabling spyware can alert the person who planted it. The Coalition Against Stalkerware does important work in this space and has resources to help victims and survivors.

Android users can detect Catwatchful, even if it is hidden from view, by dialing 543210 into your Android phone app's keypad and then hitting the call button. If Catwatchful is installed, the app should appear on your screen. This code is a built-in backdoor feature that allows whoever planted the app to regain access to the settings once the app is hidden. This code can also be used by anyone to see if the app is installed.

As for removing the app, TechCrunch has a general how-to guide for removing Android spyware that can help you identify and remove common types of phone stalkerware, and then enable the various settings you need to secure your Android device.

Microsoft is planning to lay off 9,000 employees, impacting less than 4% of its global workforce, according to a report by CNBC.

Microsoft continues to beat expectations in its quarterly earnings; in its most recent report, the company grew its net income by 18% year over year, amounting to a total of $25.8 billion.

However, the company has continued to reduce its headcount — this is one of many rounds of layoffs to have already occurred this year.

Microsoft has said that these cuts are an attempt to cut down on its layers of management, following the lead of competitors like Amazon and Meta.

Australian airline giant Qantas said on Wednesday it experienced a data breach that compromised the personal information of at least six million passengers.

The airline said a cybercriminal targeted one of its call centers on June 30, and stole customer data from its systems, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and frequent flyer numbers.

Qantas is the latest airline hacked in recent weeks following a spate of breaches attributed to Scattered Spider, a collective of hackers and tactics that are highly adept at breaking into the networks of big companies. Canadian airline WestJet suffered a data breach in June, which media reports have linked to Scattered Spider. Hawaiian Airlines also said last week it had suffered a data breach.

Google's security unit Mandiant told TechCrunch on Wednesday that it is “too early to tell” if the Qantas hack was linked to Scattered Spider, but warned that airlines should be on “high alert” for social engineering attacks.

Rivian has hit a milestone in its agreement with German automotive giant Volkswagen that will bring $1 billion into the EV startup's coffers in the form of a share sale. Rivian also announced Wednesday that it delivered 10,661 vehicles in the second quarter. 

That represents a 23% drop in sales from the second quarter of 2024, and only a slight improvement over Rivian's rough first quarter, when it delivered 8,640 EVs. The company has already lowered its sales target for 2025 as a result of President Trump's tariffs and trade wars, all of which make it more expensive to build cars.

Rivian said Wednesday that it still believes it will deliver between 40,000 and 46,000 EVs this year. But even hitting the high end of that range means it will ultimately sell fewer cars in 2025 than it did in either of the prior two years. All this makes things especially tenuous for Rivian, which has historically burned through billions of dollars and is banking a lot on the 2026 release of its more affordable SUV, the R2.

The payout from Volkswagen is the result of Rivian tallying its second-ever gross profit in the first quarter of this year. In 2024, the two automakers announced a technology joint venture worth up to $5.8 billion. Rivian has provided employees, along with its software and electrical architecture designs, to that joint venture. Volkswagen plans to use those underlying technologies to power its future EVs. It provided the first $1 billion to Rivian late last year in the form of a convertible note.

Rivian was only able to hit that gross profit milestone because it spent a lot of money and effort over the last two years simplifying the design of its existing consumer vehicles, the R1S SUV and R1T pickup truck. Those redesigned versions hit the road last year and were dramatically cheaper for Rivian to build, although the company is still losing money overall. 

Things could get even more challenging for companies like Rivian if Trump gets what he wants with his so-called proposed “One Big Beautiful Bill.” This week, that piece of legislation was passed from the U.S. Senate back to the House of Representatives. In its current form, it will end the federal EV tax credit, which instantly cuts $7,500 off the price of a new electric vehicle, in September of this year.

Apple's biggest assembly partner, Foxconn, has ordered more than 300 of its Chinese employees to return home from its iPhone factories in India, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources.

The employees told to return account for the bulk of Foxconn's staff in its iPhone facilities in India, and only Taiwanese support staff remain in the country, the report said.

The motivation behind the order was not immediately clear, Bloomberg reported, though the outlet noted that Chinese officials have been asking regulators to curb knowledge and tech resources from being exported to India in a bid to preserve the country's manufacturing heft.

The move comes as Foxconn and other Apple suppliers have been ramping up manufacturing in India as the iPhone maker seeks to reduce its reliance on Chinese manufacturing for its hardware. In May, Foxconn received Indian government approval to build a $435 million semiconductor plant in the country.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook has said the company is importing more iPhones from India as one way to handle the uncertainties around U.S. tariffs and trade risks.

It's crazy to me how many people have miserable health, complain about their body and mental state endlessly, but still put up any roadblock they can think of to avoid exercising of any form.

reply

I don't think it's that weird. Exercising, particularly cardio, for its own sake, without something you're trying to accomplish with your effort, feels very bad.

reply

The exercise is important for my general health but it isn't positively correlated with my cognitive functioning. Quite the opposite.

reply

It's a ton of work at first but it's completely worth it -- post-exertional malaise sucks.Other things that helped me personally: daily cold plunges up to the chin (so you feel it in your vagus nerve), HRV reset breathing exercises, and daily meditation. Wish you the best of luck.

ADHD patients seem to be able to exercise just fine (and -importantly- don't seem to be suffering widespread muscle death) when on Adderall and similar.

I know that is a hurdle I have with my kids.  They complain that jogging/running hurts.  It is hard to convince people that that never really changes, and that it also hurts for the people that are doing it every day.  Obviously acute pains are a different thing, but there is a reason recovery is a vital part of exercise.  We all have to recover from pushing limits.  You can't expand your limits without pushing, though.

reply

Otherwise, you'll never stick with it.I hate jogging, I have forced myself to do daily jogging for several month periods, but I never stick with it.For me, incline treadmill at maximum incline and a moderate pace gets my heart-rate up and doesn't feel nearly as awful.

reply

For my kids, I'm trying to convince them that a lot of the things they find uncomfortable are things they just aren't used to.  Ergonomics have fooled a lot people into thinking ""feels right"" is the initial state of something, I think?  You still have to train yourself to get used to a lot of things.

reply

My suggestion is to stop your workout a little before you want to, almost as if you're disappointed it's over now, which will make you want to go to the gym the next day more consistently.

reply

Similarly, for many nootropic reports, ""just doing something"" is far more effective than people give credit.  Especially if it is a choice to do something.  Successfully executing one choice seems to confer some success at executing on the next one.  (Note, successful execution does not imply successful outcome...)I'm convinced this is why people that start their routine with ""just make your bed every day"" get a surprising amount of success.All of which is to say that I agree you shouldn't blow yourself out.  My push back is that you are probably far less blown out than you think after a workout.

As I've gotten older, I've found other activities to fill the void such as rock climbing and mountain biking. Both can be strenuous when you want them to be, but you can also take it easy. Combined with low level weight training, I've found it a lot more enjoyable since both require your brain to be 100% engaged when doing it so there's also a mental boost as well.

reply

You reference that they can be strenuous.  My bet is that you often choose to push to a strenuous feeling often during the training period of each of these.  My further bet is what you call ""strenuous"", I'm asserting that those unfamiliar would call ""painful.""To be clear, I'm not claiming that you are constantly hurting yourself.  I am claiming that if you weren't familiar with the feeling, you'd call it a pain.  I'm thinking back to the original Matrix, ""why do my eyes hurt?""

And agreed that acute pain should take special care when folks are doing something.  But the research is getting somewhat clear that cushioned shoes and such can be awkwardly counter to avoiding problems.

It's much easier on your joints, and you can adjust the difficulty gradually.

reply

That is, I'm not hurting in my joints from running.  My pains there will be much more attuned to how hard it is for me to ""push"" at speeds.  That said, pushing at any speed is how I have managed to increases the speeds that I can push.

Maybe if you are underdoing it its possible but if you follow the muscle building theory, you are certainly going to get fucked eventually. Even the slightest position issue can make your tendons hurt for months... No wonder all athletes are on BPC 157, TB 500 and friends...I talked to exercise professors and random people alike, and they all tell the same story. Professor said that I should get used to pain.Too bad exercise seems to be a must after you are 50+ and no amount of good nutrition and vitamin megadosing will suffice for optimal health and particularly insuline resistance. Prior to that age though, you can get away without it.

What is the muscle building theory? Not everyone who does weightlifting is aiming for hypertrophy. Some are aiming for strength.Honestly, it sounds like you're trying to convince yourself not to do it. That's okay. It's difficult to know where to begin and avoid potential injury. It does take some time to learn. I like to recommend starting with a functional training class. This kind of class provides a guided session in building strength in everyday movements and provides a steady pace to really tune in to your body. It's very difficult to injure yourself.

I am still doing it, and I do feel good in general. However, I have constant pain in one part of the body or other which is something I can manage (if its too strong, ibuprofen or friends). The entire gym is full of NSAIDs.It's just that nobody underlines this aspect of exercise. I know its good for metabolism, brain health, cardiovascular health, looking good etc so you trade serious disease for more or less pain.

Soreness is not a bad thing. And it's true that people who regularly exercise will often be in a state where they feel some level of soreness somewhere. That's the kind of pain people say you should embrace.It's also true that lots of folks injure themselves exercising. Sometimes this leads to having to take time off to recover.But people who don't exercise are more at risk of injury in general. This is because their tendons, bones, and muscles are less able to deal with sudden stress.> And yet, nobody mentions how supplements can't generally damage youAnd last of all - this is plainly not true...

The fact is resistance training is vital for able bodied folks to avoid feeling pain later. And of course it has many other benefits than that. Even just pulling on some resistance bands can save your back and shoulders and the chance of injury there is minuscule.

I got muscle problems from _not_ doing resistance training, my bad posture caught up with me finally. And I was doing quite a bit of cardio (treadmill walking), so my general health was OK.It took months to build up muscles enough to avoid stressing the same overworked muscles, but eventually I had no pain whatsoever.

That kind of pain quickly subsides after relaxing your routine though. It's not chronic.The inflammation pathways aren't the same as disease state pathways.

It's impossible for anyone to say this convincingly about their own experience. If it were easy to tell whether an effect was due to placebo, we wouldn't need blinded trials!

1. Apart from ADHD medications, which are very powerful, most drugs and weird obscure supplements have little effect (there are some intriguing but noisy results about peptides).2. Exercise— especially weightlifting and HIIT— is also very powerful. There's evidence of a dose-response curve where light exercise is good but intense is better.Arguably this is pretty unsurprising, from an evolutionary perspective. It would be strange if our brains had ""one weird trick"" to perform a lot better with no downsides, since if it existed evolution should've found it. But being in good shape confers large benefits.

It would not be strange at all. We are constantly evolving and so is our environment.  This argument is very similar to the ""efficient market fallacy"", if the market was perfectly efficient there would be no opportunity to create value, but in reality it is highly imperfect.

The technology could save lives—so long as it doesn't fully replace humans that monitor safety.

Last winter, during the construction of an affordable housing project on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, a 32-year-old worker named Jose Luis Collaguazo Crespo slipped off a ladder on the second floor and plunged to his death in the basement. He was one of more than 1,000 construction workers who die on the job each year in the US, making it the most dangerous industry for fatal slips, trips, and falls.

“Everyone talks about [how] ‘safety is the number-one priority,'” entrepreneur and executive Philip Lorenzo said during a presentation at Construction Innovation Day 2025, a conference at the University of California, Berkeley, in April. “But then maybe internally, it's not that high priority. People take shortcuts on job sites. And so there's this whole tug-of-war between … safety and productivity.”

To combat the shortcuts and risk-taking, Lorenzo is working on a tool for the San Francisco–based company DroneDeploy, which sells software that creates daily digital models of work progress from videos and images, known in the trade as “reality capture.”  The tool, called Safety AI, analyzes each day's reality capture imagery and flags conditions that violate Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules, with what he claims is 95% accuracy. 

That means that for any safety risk the software flags, there is 95% certainty that the flag is accurate and relates to a specific OSHA regulation. Launched in October 2024, it's now being deployed on hundreds of construction sites in the US, Lorenzo says, and versions specific to the building regulations in countries including Canada, the UK, South Korea, and Australia have also been deployed.

Safety AI is one of multiple AI construction safety tools that have emerged in recent years, from Silicon Valley to Hong Kong to Jerusalem. Many of these rely on teams of human “clickers,” often in low-wage countries, to manually draw bounding boxes around images of key objects like ladders, in order to label large volumes of data to train an algorithm. 

Lorenzo says Safety AI is the first one to use generative AI to flag safety violations, which means an algorithm that can do more than recognize objects such as ladders or hard hats. The software can “reason” about what is going on in an image of a site and draw a conclusion about whether there is an OSHA violation. This is a more advanced form of analysis than the object detection that is the current industry standard, Lorenzo claims. But as the 95% success rate suggests, Safety AI is not a flawless and all-knowing intelligence. It requires an experienced safety inspector as an overseer.  

Robots and AI tend to thrive in controlled, largely static environments, like factory floors or shipping terminals. But construction sites are, by definition, changing a little bit every day. 

Lorenzo thinks he's built a better way to monitor sites, using a type of generative AI called a visual language model, or VLM. A VLM is an LLM with a vision encoder, allowing it to “see” images of the world and analyze what is going on in the scene. 

Using years of reality capture imagery gathered from customers, with their explicit permission, Lorenzo's team has assembled what he calls a “golden data set” encompassing tens of thousands of images of OSHA violations. Having carefully stockpiled this specific data for years, he is not worried that even a billion-dollar tech giant will be able to “copy and crush” him.

To help train the model, Lorenzo has a smaller team of construction safety pros ask strategic questions of the AI. The trainers input test scenes from the golden data set to the VLM and ask questions that guide the model through the process of breaking down the scene and analyzing it step by step the way an experienced human would. If the VLM doesn't generate the correct response—for example, it misses a violation or registers a false positive—the human trainers go back and tweak the prompts or inputs. Lorenzo says that rather than simply learning to recognize objects, the VLM is taught “how to think in a certain way,” which means it can draw subtle conclusions about what is happening in an image. 

As an example, Lorenzo says VLMs are much better than older methods at analyzing ladder usage, which is responsible for 24% of the fall deaths in the construction industry. 

“With traditional machine learning, it's very difficult to answer the question of ‘Is a person using a ladder unsafely?'” says Lorenzo. “You can find the ladders. You can find the people. But to logically reason and say ‘Well, that person is fine' or ‘Oh no, that person's standing on the top step'—only the VLM can logically reason and then be like, ‘All right, it's unsafe. And here's the OSHA reference that says you can't be on the top rung.'”

Answers to multiple questions (Does the person on the ladder have three points of contact? Are they using the ladder as stilts to move around?) are combined to determine whether the ladder in the picture is being used safely. “Our system has over a dozen layers of questioning just to get to that answer,” Lorenzo says. DroneDeploy has not publicly released its data for review, but he says he hopes to have his methodology independently audited by safety experts.  

Using vision language models for construction AI shows promise, but there are “some pretty fundamental issues” to resolve, including hallucinations and the problem of edge cases, those anomalous hazards for which the VLM hasn't trained, says Chen Feng. He leads New York University's AI4CE lab, which develops technologies for 3D mapping and scene understanding in construction robotics and other areas. “Ninety-five percent is encouraging—but how do we fix that remaining 5%?” he asks of Safety AI's success rate. 

Feng points to a 2024 paper called “Eyes Wide Shut?”—written by Shengbang Tong, a PhD student at NYU, and coauthored by AI luminary Yann LeCun—that noted “systematic shortcomings” in VLMs.  “For object detection, they can reach human-level performance pretty well,” Feng says. “However, for more complicated things—these capabilities are still to be improved.” He notes that VLMs have struggled to interpret 3D scene structure from 2D images, don't have good situational awareness in reasoning about spatial relationships, and often lack “common sense” about visual scenes.

Lorenzo concedes that there are “some major flaws” with LLMs and that they struggle with spatial reasoning. So Safety AI also employs some older machine-learning methods to help create spatial models of construction sites. These methods include the segmentation of images into crucial components and photogrammetry, an established technique for creating a 3D digital model from a 2D image. Safety AI has also trained heavily in 10 different problem areas, including ladder usage, to anticipate the most common violations.

Even so, Lorenzo admits there are edge cases that the LLM will fail to recognize. But he notes that for overworked safety managers, who are often responsible for as many as 15 sites at once, having an extra set of digital “eyes” is still an improvement.

Aaron Tan, a concrete project manager based in the San Francisco Bay Area, says that a tool like Safety AI could be helpful for these overextended safety managers, who will save a lot of time if they can get an emailed alert rather than having to make a two-hour drive to visit a site in person. And if the software can demonstrate that it is helping keep people safe, he thinks workers will eventually embrace it.  

However, Tan notes that workers also fear that these types of tools will be “bossware” used to get them in trouble. “At my last company, we implemented cameras [as] a security system. And the guys didn't like that,” he says. “They were like, ‘Oh, Big Brother. You guys are always watching me—I have no privacy.'”

Izhak Paz, CEO of a Jerusalem-based company called Safeguard AI, has considered incorporating VLMs, but he has stuck with the older machine-learning paradigm because he considers it more reliable. The “old computer vision” based on machine learning “is still better, because it's hybrid between the machine itself and human intervention on dealing with deviation,” he says. To train the algorithm on a new category of danger, his team aggregates a large volume of labeled footage related to the specific hazard and then optimizes the algorithm by trimming false positives and false negatives. The process can take anywhere from weeks to over six months, Paz says. 

With training completed, Safeguard AI performs a risk assessment to identify potential hazards on the site. It can “see” the site in real time by accessing footage from any nearby internet-connected camera. Then it uses an AI agent to push instructions on what to do next to the site managers' mobile devices. Paz declines to give a precise price tag, but he says his product is affordable only for builders at the “mid-market” level and above, specifically those managing multiple sites. The tool is in use at roughly 3,500 sites in Israel, the United States, and Brazil.

New technologies could detect fires faster, giving first responders a head start.

Buildots, a company based in Tel Aviv that MIT Technology Review profiled back in 2020, doesn't do safety analysis but instead creates once- or twice-weekly visual progress reports of sites. Buildots also uses the older method of machine learning with labeled training data. “Our system needs to be 99%—we cannot have any hallucinations,” says CEO Roy Danon. 

He says that gaining labeled training data is actually much easier than it was when he and his cofounders began the project in 2018, since gathering video footage of sites means that each object, such as a socket, might be captured and then labeled in many different frames. But the tool is high-end—about 50 builders, most with revenue over $250 million, are using Buildots in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Canada, and the US. It's been used on over 300 projects so far.

Ryan Calo, a specialist in robotics and AI law at the University of Washington, likes the idea of AI for construction safety. Since experienced safety managers are already spread thin in construction, however, Calo worries that builders will be tempted to automate humans out of the safety process entirely. “I think AI and drones for spotting safety problems that would otherwise kill workers is super smart,” he says. “So long as it's verified by a person.”

A young, energetic star has had just about enough of its clingy planet. The pair are mired in a toxic relationship, with the planet sending waves of energy toward the star—and the host star is responding with violent explosions that are destroying its planet over time.

Using the European Space Agency's (ESA) Cheops mission, a team of astronomers from the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy gathered evidence for the first known exoplanet with an apparent death wish. In a paper published Wednesday in the journal Nature, the team describes the planet, similar in size to Jupiter, which may be triggering flares of radiation from the star it orbits. Although astronomers have theorized about this type of interaction before, the flares recorded in this star system are around 100 times more energetic than expected, according to the study.

The planet, named HIP 67522 b, is one of the wispiest exoplanets ever found, with density similar to candy floss. It takes just seven days to orbit its star, which is slightly larger and cooler than the Sun. And while our host star is a middle-aged 4.5-billion-year-old, this young star has only been around for 17 million years. Compared to the Sun, this star is more energetic and has a more powerful magnetic field.

The team behind the study first spotted the young star system using TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite). “We hadn't seen any systems like HIP 67522 before,” Ekaterina Ilin, lead author of the study, said in a statement. “When the planet was found it was the youngest planet known to be orbiting its host star in less than 10 days.”

The astronomers were on the hunt for stars releasing flares due to interactions with their orbiting planets, and they believed they found the perfect pair. To be sure of their findings, the team of astronomers wanted a closer look using ESA's sensitive CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). “With Cheops we saw more flares, taking the total count to 15, almost all coming in our direction as the planet transited in front of the star as seen from Earth,” Ilin said.

Our own Sun releases solar flares, intense bursts of energy that explode from its atmosphere when a build-up of magnetic energy is suddenly released. Solar flares are sometimes directed toward Earth through no fault of our own. For the unlucky exoplanet, however, the strong flares from its host star are likely its own doing.

Since HIP 67522 b orbits so close to its star, it may be exerting its own magnetic influence on the host star. The planet may be gathering energy as it orbits, then redirecting that energy as waves along the star's magnetic field line. When those waves meet the end of the magnetic field line at the star's surface, it triggers a massive flare.

“The planet seems to be triggering particularly energetic flares,” Ilin said. “The waves it sends along the star's magnetic field lines kick off flares at specific moments. But the energy of the flares is much higher than the energy of the waves. We think that the waves are setting off explosions that are waiting to happen.”

The radiation carried by the flares is eroding the planet's wispy atmosphere and causing it to lose mass at a much faster rate. In the next 100 million years, HIP 67522 b could go from a Jupiter-sized planet to a much smaller Neptune-sized planet, according to the study.

The team behind the study wants to carry out follow-up observations of the unique star system using different wavelengths to find out what kind of energy is being released by the star. “I have a million questions because this is a completely new phenomenon, so the details are still not clear,” Ilin said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Elon Musk Adds ‘Sell Cars in Europe' to His To-Do List","https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-adds-sell-cars-in-europe-to-his-to-do-list-2000623060","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:50:10 GMT","

Elon Musk has always worn a lot of hats. Earlier this year, while he was working at the White House, he literally wore several hats on his head at the same time, in a clownish attempt to make this very point to other Trump officials. Even though the billionaire has since parted ways with the administration and is in the midst of an acrimonious spat with the President, he is still keeping busy. This week, he both gave himself a new job and promised to launch his own political party, thus keeping the whole hats-on-hats thing going.

Last week, multiple outlets reported that Musk had fired Omead Afshar, the head of Tesla's sales and manufacturing operations in North America and Europe. The alleged expulsion (Tesla never confirmed what had happened, and didn't respond to Gizmodo's request for comment) came amidst a dramatic downturn in the EV company's business. Tesla sales in Europe and the U.S. have been dropping like a stone over the past few months, as backlash against Musk's political activities and increased competition from other EV brands do serious damage to Tesla's brand and bottom line.

Now, Musk appears to have given himself Afshar's job. Bloomberg reports that Musk has “assumed oversight of sales in Europe and the US.” The outlet notes that Musk and Tom Zhu, Tesla's deputy and senior vice president for Asia, are now “divvying up” Afshar's former responsibilities amongst themselves. At the same time, Zhu has reportedly been promoted to oversee Tesla's manufacturing operations globally, the outlet reports. Just how many of Afshar's responsibilities Zhu will take and how many Musk will bear is anybody's guess.

Again, Musk giving himself this new position seems like a particularly bizarre choice, given the widely held perception that it is Musk, himself, that has inspired a downturn in Tesla sales—particularly in Europe. Musk spent the first part of this year mucking around in European politics—using his platform, X, to take shots at European leaders (like Britain's prime minister, Keir Starmer) and to spread alarm and misinformation. At the same time, Musk's role in the Trump administration (with DOGE) has also inspired backlash. Recent statistics show that Tesla sales have been dropping by double digits across the EU.

At the same time that Musk has given himself a new job, he is also toying with continuing his foray into politics—another hilarious decision, given how poorly his recent efforts have fared. In recent days, Musk has claimed that he would like to launch a new political party in the U.S., should Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill be signed into law. Musk and Trump—who were considered best “buddies” and political colleagues only a few months ago—have been feuding over the contents of the bill, which includes a nixing of the EV tax credit that formerly helped fuel Tesla's rise. In retaliation for Elon's criticism of the bill, Trump has threatened to cut off federal support for Musk's companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.

If Musk doesn't get his way, his new plan is to launch an “America Party,” as well as to use his financial largesse to primary “nearly every single Republican in Congress,” the New York Times has reported. “If this insane spending bill passes, the America Party will be formed the next day,” Musk posted to X on Monday. “Our country needs an alternative to the Democrat-Republican uniparty so that the people actually have a VOICE.” It's so far unclear what Musk's “America Party” might look like, although Newsweek has gone as far as to heavily speculate about it. They predict that the billionaire might attempt to craft a new political consensus that coheres around his own interests.

Of course, all of this may be bullshit, since another thing that Musk is very good at (aside from giving himself a lot of really impressive job titles) is vowing to do stuff that he never actually does. His corporate career is littered with dumb promises that have never come to pass. It doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that his political career will be any different.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Scientists Finally Sequenced the First Ancient Egyptian Genome","https://gizmodo.com/scientists-finally-sequenced-the-first-ancient-egyptian-genome-2000622926","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 15:00:32 GMT","

Scientists have, for the first time, sequenced the entire genome of an ancient Egyptian who lived approximately 4,500 to 4,800 years ago.

The feat was achieved by a team of researchers at the Francis Crick Institute and Liverpool John Moores University, who published their findings in Nature. According to the study, the ancient individual's genetic ancestry traces back to populations in both North Africa and West Asia, shedding light on the genetic diversity of early Egyptians.

Researchers first started trying to extract DNA from ancient Egyptian individuals four decades ago. But poor DNA preservation has presented a major obstacle, and until now, researchers had only partially reconstructed the genomes of just three ancient Egyptians. Now, thanks to technological advances, researchers have successfully pieced together a complete ancient Egyptian genome, using DNA extracted from a tooth.

“Piecing together all the clues from this individual's DNA, bones and teeth have allowed us to build a comprehensive picture. We hope that future DNA samples from ancient Egypt can expand on when precisely this movement from West Asia started,” study co-author Adeline Morez Jacobs, visiting research fellow and former PhD student at Liverpool John Moores University, said in a statement.

The individual in question died sometime during the 3rd or 4th Dynasties, overlapping the Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom periods of Egyptian history. He was buried in a clay casket in a tomb carved into a hillside in Nuwayrat, a village located 163 miles (263 kilometers) south of Cairo. This era coincided with the construction of the first step pyramid and was marked by technological innovation and political stability.

Because his burial occurred before artificial mummification became common practice, his DNA was better preserved than that of individuals from later in the Old Kingdom, as mummification processes can destroy DNA molecules.

His skeleton was excavated in 1902 and remained at the World Museum Liverpool. The researchers analyzed the individual's skeleton to estimate his sex, age, height, and lifestyle. The evidence suggests that he worked as a potter or in a similar trade, because his bones showed muscle markings from sitting with outstretched limbs for long periods of time.

Archaeological evidence has long indicated that ancient Egyptians traded and maintained cultural connections with communities in the Fertile Crescent—an area of West Asia that now encompasses several modern Middle Eastern countries. Similar objects, writing, and visual motifs have been discovered in both regions, but genetic evidence to support these connections has been lacking until now.

The researchers found that 80% of the individual's genetic ancestry traced back to communities who lived in North Africa. The remaining 20% of his ancestry mapped to ancient individuals who lived in Mesopotamia, in what is now the Middle East. The researchers caution, however, that this is just one individual who may not be representative of the ancient Egyptian population as a whole.

“This individual has been on an extraordinary journey. He lived and died during a critical period of change in ancient Egypt, and his skeleton was excavated in 1902 and donated to World Museum Liverpool, where it then survived bombings during the Blitz that destroyed most of the human remains in their collection. We've now been able to tell part of the individual's story,” said co-author Linus Girdland Flink, an archaeologist at the University of Aberdeen, in a statement.

The good folks at Amazon must be getting warmed up for the annual Prime Day blowout, or maybe somebody lit their 4th of July fireworks a little early, because for the second day in a row there is a truly insane Dell laptop deal that's just dropped out of nowhere. The last one, on the Dell 15 Vostro 3520, took a $2,000 price tag down to just $549. Now it's the Dell 15 Vostro 3530's turn in an even bigger deal taking a $2,400 price down to just $650. 

The Dell Vostro 3530 is the slightly bigger brother to the Vostro 3520, normally retailing for $400 more than the lower model. Two huge 73% Amazon deals later, you need only an extra $100 to bump up from the 6-core processor of the Vostro 3520 to the 10-core version that powers the Vostro 3530, which means you keep a staggering $1,750 in your pocket when you score this monster laptop.

See at Amazon

The Dell description of the Vostro 3530 laptop says it's aimed at small businesses and entrepreneurs, but when you look at the specifics and the features of this machine, it's hard to think of anyone who wouldn't want it as their everyday laptop for work, play, or general use.

Start with the very most basic laptop needs — a fast processor and big-capacity storage. The Dell Vostro 3530 is powered by a 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i5 processor that can hit speeds up to 4.66GHz, much more than enough for any streaming, surfing, or heavy-duty multitasking you ask of it. It has 32GB of RAM, which you can expand to 64GBm and the built-in storage is a huge 1TB SSD.

The display on the Dell Vostro 3530 is a 15.6-inch full-HD beauty with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and driven by an Intel iRIS Xe graphics card.

The array of ports and slots you'd need to connect the Dell Vostro 3530 to parallel devices is fully loaded. It comes with a USB-C 3.2 Gen 1 port for data transfers, USB-A 3.2 and USB-A 2.0 ports, an HDMI 1.4 port for external monitor hookups, an SD 3.0 card slot, and a RJ-45 Ethernet port. Add the WiFi and Bluetooth connections to that super-fast Ethernet hookup, and your path to surfing and streaming is clear and smooth.

The big 4th of July sales are already under way and Prime Day will be following fast on their heels, but we can't envision any huge event that will match the deals Amazon's been dropping on these powerhouse Dell laptops like the Vostro 3530. It's 73% off, which translates into a $1,750 price cut down to just $650.

Both Switch 2 and its dock have cooling fans

Multiple Nintendo Switch 2 owners, most notably in Japan, are reporting problems with the console overheating during gameplay, leading to crashes and freezes. The problem, as noted by Nintendo Soup, includes playing hefty new titles like Cyberpunk 2077, but also less hardware-intensive titles like Pokémon and Splatoon.

According to the report, users are reporting game freezes and crashes, as well as fans going into overdrive in order to try and dissipate heat. The multitude of reports from Japanese users all come from X and are machine-translated. Some users have reported crashing and periodic freezes, but only postulate that thermal performance might be to blame. ""The fan's going nuts, so maybe it's overheating,"" one user reported while playing Rune Factory.

Some users are definitely reporting the issue while using the Switch 2 in dock mode. A Cyberpunk 2077 player said the game had crashed at least five times, while the fans seemed to be running at full speed. Others seem to be experiencing the thermal issues in handheld mode, with one user suggesting the Switch 2 became too hot to even hold while gaming.

Beyond Japan, users on Facebook have reported the Switch 2 getting warm or even hot to the touch while gaming, while other users over on Reddit are reporting similar issues.

""I've had my Switch 2 display a message saying that the system was overheating and entering sleep mode twice now, both times while playing Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Edition docked,"" said one user. Another replied, confirming their Switch 2 was hot when they grabbed it from their dock after a day at work.

If you are experiencing these issues, Nintendo does have some suggestions. Sadly, they're pretty rudimentary. Action recommended includes simply unplugging your dock to let it cool down, moving your dock to a more ventilated area, ensuring your air vents are clear, and finally, monitoring the situation.

Nintendo says that if these remedies don't fix the issue, you'll need to send your Switch 2 in for repair.

The issue seems noteworthy, but not enormously prevalent thus far. During our own thermal testing of the Switch 2, our unit reached 117 degrees Fahrenheit, or 47 degrees Celsius, while docked. In handheld, this dropped to 102 F (39 C), which we found generally warm to the touch.

Nintendo Switch 2 has generally been met with acclaim, smashing the company's console sales record in its opening weekend. In fact, it's so popular that Nintendo's president recently had to apologize for the shortage. The launch hasn't been without bumps, however, and some users have even reported Nintendo disabling their online accounts and services over the use of Mig Flash drives, even for ROMs they already own.

Blackwell graphics cards plummet towards MSRP as deal season heats up


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Update 7/2/2025 5am PT: The Newegg gift card deals below have expired, but the cards remain in stock for purchase. The PNY GeForce RTX 5070 OC 12GB $549 @Best Buy also still remains at an excellent price point. A selection of graphics cards across Nvidia's RTX 50-series have fallen to their MSRPs on Newegg, thanks to instant rebates in the form of gift cards. These Blackwell graphics cards, including higher-end versions of the RTX 5070, 5060, and 5060 Ti, are likely falling in price as online retailers gear up for Amazon's upcoming Prime Day 2025.

PNY GeForce RTX 5070 OC 12GB: now $549 at Best Buy This is currently the best value RTX 5070 graphics card available for sale without any deal gimmicks. It's the OC version with a 2.2 GHz base clock and 2.5GHz boost. Make use of the Blackwell architecture and Nvidia's latest DLSS 4 features for improved gaming fidelity and performance.

Nvidia's RTX 5070 can be had for as low as $549 after rebates from a number of different board partners, including Gigabyte, Asus, and MSI. The tastiest deal is on this Gigabyte Windforce RTX 5070, a three-fan cooler selling for $609 bundled with a $60 promotional gift card. The inclusion of the gift card effectively takes the Gigabyte card down to $549 if you're upgrading other parts of your PC, bagging you a three-fan RTX 5070 right at MSRP. For context, the same card has sold for between $700 and $800 on Amazon since its release.

Some cards sitting at similar price levels today also ship with Newegg's ""FantasTech Price Protection"". This Fourth of July-linked promotion ensures that if customers purchase items with the price protection until July 6th, and the same model is discounted for cheaper as part of Independence Day sales, customers will be retroactively refunded the discount amount.

GIGABYTE WindForce GeForce RTX 5070: $549.99 ($609.99 with $60 promotional gift card) at NeweggThe cheapest RTX 5070 today, if you take into account the Newegg $60 gift card. MSRP for a high-end GPU is nothing to take for granted anymore. 

ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070: $609.99 on NeweggThe cheapest RTX 5070 with ""FantasTech Price Protection"" means you're safe from buyer's remorse in case of further 4th of July deals.

MSI SHADOW GeForce RTX 5070: $599 at NeweggThe absolute cheapest RTX 5070 if you're not looking for rebates or money-back after your purchase. 

RTX 5060s and RTX 5060 Tis have also fallen to similar lows. The 16GB 5060 Ti, the most attractive card of this group, has fallen to $449 from Gigabyte and other board partners, taking it within $20 of its $429 MSRP. The 8GB models of the 5060 and 5060 Ti are staying steady at their MSRPs of $299 and $379, though these 8GB models have proven much less attractive to buyers in 2025.

Very few of the sales on new graphics cards seem to have anything to do with Prime Day or Newegg's official ""FantasTech"" response to Amazon's four days of deals. Newegg may be attempting to squeeze in early to snag some of Amazon's business during Prime Day, but the why of these deals matters much less than the fact that they are here, possibly getting GPUs into the hands of those who have been waiting for a price drop this severe.

The RTX 5070 deals on Newegg have already started selling out, so those interested may need to act fast to not miss out on these hot buys. Be sure to keep your eyes on Tom's Hardware's deals coverage as Prime Day 2025 approaches, running this year from July 8-11.

Even though Newegg is leading the charge currently in GPU discounts, there are still deals to be had at competing retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy. See our small list of some current deals and graphics card listings.

Amazon's Prime Day is just around the corner, taking place over four days from July 8 to July 11, 2025. But that doesn't mean that there aren't any deals floating around ahead of the main event. So if you've had your eye on any new components for your PC, a new monitor, a shiny new gaming laptop, or even a new 3D printer, then now is still a great time to see what deals are on offer.

You will need to be an existing Amazon Prime member or take up an Amazon Prime membership to be able to grab any possible deals. You can sign up for Prime for $14.99 a month, or if you want to save a few dollars, you can sign up for a year for $139, saving you $40.99 over the course of a year.

Several other tech retailers, including Newegg, Best Buy, and Walmart, are also jumping on the sales train and hosting their own individual events. Newegg has its Fantastech sales event focusing on computer hardware, so there are plenty of opportunities to hopefully pick up a bargain.

Check back often, as we keep an eye on some of our favorite deals and update them regularly before, during, and after the sales.

Amazon Prime Day is the name of Amazon's July sales event. Often referred to as Prime Day. Amazon Prime Day is the biggest sales event of the summer, and this year, for the first time, has expanded to four days in length. During the event (July 8-11, 2025), Amazon Prime members can view and purchase discounted products featured in the Prime Day sales.

Yes, you need an active Amazon Prime membership to take advantage of Prime Day discounts. You can sign up for Amazon Prime for $14.99 a month. If you're a new customer, you can even try Prime free for 30 days.

Apart from Amazon's own products, such as the Kindle and Echo, we can't be 100% sure, but in the past, we've seen many computer hardware components, peripherals, and monitors discounted. Therefore, we should hopefully see more tech deals during this event.

I've covered many sales events over the years and will be using my experience and expertise to keep a keen eye on all the retailers' sales events, looking for the best deals for readers of Tom's Hardware.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:tomshardware.com","HP unveils 'CarFax for PCs' that could make buying older laptops more viable — telemetry, support requests, and AI will generate a laptop's history to reduce e-waste","https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/manufacturing/hp-unveils-carfax-for-pcs-that-could-make-buying-older-laptops-more-viable-telemetry-support-requests-and-ai-will-generate-a-laptops-history-to-reduce-e-waste","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 10:50:00 GMT","



The company plans to introduce its Endpoint Security Controller-enabled service in 2026.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


One company's trash can be another company's treasure—or at least that's what HP is hoping to convince its customers with a new ""PCFax"" service that uses telemetry, support requests, and ""AI"" to generate reports about a laptop's history. And if your first thought was ""gee, that sounds a lot like CarFax,"" you're on the same wavelength as the folks at HP who designed this service. Congratulations, or I'm sorry. Whichever.

""When buying a used car, dealerships and individual buyers can access each car's particular CarFax report, detailing the vehicle's usage and maintenance history,"" a quartet of HP employees said in a piece for IEEE Spectrum. ""Armed with this information, dealerships can perform the necessary fixes or upgrades before reselling the car. And individuals can decide whether to trust that vehicle's performance. We at HP realized that, to prevent unnecessary e-waste, we need to collect and make available usage and maintenance data for each laptop, like a CarFax for used PCs.""

Some of the data used to generate these reports will be sourced from the Endpoint Security Controller built into some of HP's enterprise products to collect information from ""thermal sensors that monitor CPU temperature, power-consumption monitors that track energy efficiency, storage health indicators that assess solid state drive (SSD) wear levels, performance counters that measure system utilization, fan-rotation-speed sensors that detect cooling efficiency, and more."" This data is then stored on a dedicated portion of the system's storage and is supposedly tamper-proof.

A brief aside: HP introduced the Endpoint Security Controller in 2019. It didn't attract much coverage then, which isn't necessarily surprising for something as decidedly uncool as a firmware- and hardware-level snitch that gathers as much information as possible for HP's enterprise customers. But I do find it somewhat telling that several pages of search results for ""Endpoint Security Controller"" are filled almost entirely with complaints on HP and Microsoft's support forums related to unexpected boot failures caused by an obscure issue with the controller itself, the host BIOS, or something else.

Anyway. HP said the PCFax reports would also include ""information from HP's factory and supply-chain records, digital-services platforms, customer-support service records, [and] diagnostic logs"" as well as ""data from external sources including partner sales and service records, refurbishment partner databases, third-party component manufacturers like Intel, and other original equipment manufacturers."" All of that data will then be combined to help prospective buyers tell if a given system is junk or not. (Presumably so those customers would then return to HP for more systems later.)

That would require some amount of critical thinking, however, so HP also plans to pipe all this data into some kind of AI model that will ""analyze historical telemetry data and predict failures before they happen, such as detecting increasing SSD write cycles to forecast impending failure and alert IT teams for proactive replacement, or predicting battery degradation and automatically generating a service ticket to ensure a replacement battery is ready before failure, minimizing downtime."" Sounds interesting enough—provided the model is a reliable source rather than just a robotic salesperson.

Maybe that's just the cynical take. Either way, there's no denying that companies are finally responding to the absurd amounts of e-waste their product cycles generate, whether that's by reclaiming minerals from used products, finding ways to safely recycle them, or designing them to be upgraded without requiring someone to throw out the proverbial baby with the contaminated bathwater. There's a chance PCFax (or something like it) will complement those efforts by convincing HP's customers that a three-year-old laptop doesn't need to be thrown away for no reason.

The Justice Department announced on June 30 its latest hit in the game of geopolitical whac-a-mole against North Korea's nuclear weapons programs.

The department said on Monday that it had conducted a series of coordinated actions, including ""two indictments, an arrest, searches of 29 known or suspected 'laptop farms' across 16 states, and the seizure of 29 financial accounts used to launder illicit funds and 21 fraudulent websites,"" after North Korean IT workers ""successfully obtained employment with more than 100 U.S. companies"" with the help of ""individuals in the United States, China, United Arab Emirates, and Taiwan.""

International sanctions make it practically impossible for North Korea to fund its nuclear programs through legitimate means. But rather than scuttling its efforts to become a nuclear power, the so-called Hermit Kingdom has turned to alternative sources of income, such as stealing billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency and conducting ransomware operations against organizations in a variety of sectors. The latest scheme involves placing operatives in high-paying jobs at U.S. tech companies.

The State Department, Treasury Department, and FBI said (PDF) in 2022 that North Korea ""has dispatched thousands of highly skilled IT workers around the world"" who ""in many cases misrepresent themselves as foreign (non-North Korean) or U.S.-based teleworkers, including by using virtual private networks (VPNs), virtual private servers (VPSs), purchased third-country IP addresses, proxy accounts, and falsified or stolen identification documents"" in a bid to evade detection for as long as possible.

Yet the revelation of its not-so-secret funding operations hasn't discouraged North Korea. Quite the opposite: ""We have observed the North Korean IT worker threat evolve,"" Google Cloud said in March. ""We've detected North Korean IT workers conducting a global expansion beyond the U.S., with a notable focus on Europe. They have also intensified extortion campaigns against employers, and they've moved to conduct operations in corporate virtual desktops, networks, and servers.""

Politico reported in May that ""the scam is more widespread than previously understood and has recently hit many Fortune 500 companies."" The problem is probably going to get worse before it gets better, too, with Wired reporting that generative AI has made it even more difficult for companies to determine if they're extending a job offer to a legitimate prospect or a North Korean operative. And help from people in the U.S. can mask other signs that a remote worker isn't above board.

The Justice Department said that ""certain U.S.-based individuals [allegedly] enabled one of the schemes by creating front companies and fraudulent websites to promote the bona fides of the remote IT workers, and hosted laptop farms where the remote North Korean IT workers could remote access into U.S. victim company-provided laptop computers."" It would be suspicious for a supposedly U.S.-based worker to have their laptop shipped outside the country; these ""laptop farms"" circumvent that issue.

Shutting down these operations can help protect companies from North Korean operatives who plan to use their access to private resources to steal intellectual property, provide information that could be useful for more overt cybercrime, and, yes, steal cryptocurrency. (The Justice Department said one undercover worker ""stole virtual currency worth approximately over $900,000"" from an Atlanta-based company.) The question is how long it'll take for other North Korean IT workers to take their place.

Spices have been valued for centuries in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine because of their healing properties. In small amounts used for cooking, cinnamon, turmeric, and ginger are generally safe and may provide health benefits, depending on their quality and preparation methods. However, at higher therapeutic doses, they can interact with medications or cause side effects; therefore, long-term use should be monitored by a healthcare professional.

Cinnamon spice is extracted from the bark of various species of the cinnamon tree, and essential cinnamon oil is obtained from the bark or leaves. Active constituents include cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, and coumarin. Cinnamon provides antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiviral, antihypertensive, blood sugar-regulating, and antitumor properties, which may reduce the risk for heart disease and improve brain function. Traditionally, it has also aided digestion and fought infections.

Combined with lysozyme, essential oils from Cinnamomum verum and clove (Syzygium aromaticum) have been shown to reduce the minimum inhibitory concentrations of gentamicin and imipenem against multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, thereby enhancing antibiotic efficacy and modifying resistance. Its use in patients with breast cancer could be promising, but further studies are needed.

However, an in vitro study showed that cinnamaldehyde activates receptors that increase the excretion of certain drugs, potentially reducing their effectiveness. The cheaper Asian cassia cinnamon contains larger amounts of coumarin than the more expensive Ceylon cinnamon; in high doses, coumarin can damage the liver and, in combination with anticoagulants, can increase the risk for bleeding.

Interactions may occur with painkillers, antidepressants, chemotherapeutic agents, and antidiabetic drugs. Reported side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches, and skin reactions, such as dermatitis or worsening rosacea.

Turmeric contains the curcuminoid curcumin, the yellow component of curry powder, masala, and golden milk, prized for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and, at therapeutic doses, its anticarcinogenic and analgesic effects. Other compounds may also contribute to the observed cognitive benefits. Caution is advised when extrapolating scientific results from laboratory and animal experiments to humans, particularly because the amounts used in these studies are impractical compared with concentrated curcuminoid curcumin extracts.

Curcumin interacts with liver enzymes and may affect antidepressants, antihypertensives, chemotherapeutic agents, and certain antibiotics. Its blood-thinning, blood sugar-lowering, and blood pressure-reducing properties can potentiate the effects of anticoagulants, antidiabetics, insulin, and antihypertensives. Concurrent intake of iron-rich foods can reduce curcumin's bioavailability.

To ensure adequate absorption, curcumin should be consumed with fats and piperine-rich black or long pepper, as well as with chili, lemon, ginger, honey, or even cinnamon and nutmeg. The preparation methods are crucial: Cooked roots may offer stronger DNA-protective effects, roasting in ghee may benefit the gut microbiome and compound uptake, and oxidation should be avoided.

At therapeutic concentrations, curcumin is contraindicated in gallstones, cholestasis, bleeding disorders or anticoagulation, and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Ginger is known for its anti-inflammatory, immune-boosting, and antiemetic effects. Some studies suggest blood sugar- and blood lipid-lowering properties, but the extent of interactions with antidiabetic drugs and possible side effects — similar to those of sulfonylureas — requires further research. Ginger is already included in combination products for the treatment of diabetes.

Its active constituents, such as gingerol, have blood-thinning effects when consumed regularly, chronically, or in concentrated form, and can increase bleeding risk when taken with anticoagulants. Higher doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as mucosal irritation, bloating, and heartburn.

Laboratory studies have indicated potential drug interactions for these spices, but the findings mainly involve high doses rather than typical culinary use. Caution is advised before starting such supplements, particularly in patients taking anticoagulants, antidiabetics, or chemotherapeutic agents. For most people, these spices are considered safe and combine taste with potential health benefits.

In a decade-long study, a ratio of serum acute tryptase to serum baseline tryptase above 1.74 showed superior diagnostic performance compared with the current consensus formula, which requires serum acute tryptase to be greater than a personalized cutoff value. The ratio correctly identified more than two thirds of true cases while ruling out the majority of false cases in children with suspected anaphylaxis.

“Our study underlines the need for better implementation of both sAT [serum acute tryptase] and sBT [serum baseline tryptase] measurements at adequate sampling times in pediatric EDs [emergency departments] and contributes to the ongoing debate on the optimal interpretation of pediatric dynamic tryptase,” the authors wrote.

Moïse Michel, PhD, with the Nîmes University Hospital, Nîmes, France, was the corresponding author of the study, which was published online on June 24 in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global.

This study was limited by its retrospective design and the absence of grade 4 anaphylaxis cases in the cohort, limiting the evaluation of tryptase measurement performance.

This study did not receive any specific funding. One author reported receiving speaker and consultancy fees from various pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Preventive treatment with the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor monoclonal antibody erenumab for 6 weeks was not associated with significant reductions in weekly headache attacks, pain severity, or attack duration in adults with chronic cluster headache (CCH), a new phase 2 placebo-controlled trial showed.

“Erenumab failed to show a benefit over placebo in patients with CCH, indicating that blockade of peripheral CGRP receptors has no beneficial role in the prophylaxis of CCH,” the investigators wrote.

“To date, all double-blind controlled trials in CCH using an mAb affecting the CGRP pathway were negative, leading to the conclusion that future research should revisit the role of CGRP in CCH,” they added.

This study was led by Jasper Mecklenburg, MD, Charité – UniversitätsmedizinBerlin, Berlin, Germany. It was published online on June 17 in JAMA Network Open.

Data on patients who progressed from episodic headache to CCH were missing. Additionally, the onset timing of current CCH episodes was unclear, with no detailed records of past steroid responses or reasons for prior treatment failures with verapamil or lithium, which relied on patient recall.

This trial was funded by a grant from Novartis Pharma GmbH to Charité – UniversitätsmedizininBerlin. Several investigators reported having financial ties with various sources including the funding company. Full details are listed in the original article.

Music that evokes an emotional response may influence the specificity of memory recall, new research suggests.

Investigators found that participants who were shown a series of images of everyday items before listening to music were more likely to remember only general details of the photos if they experienced a more emotional response to the music, while those who had a moderate emotional response were more likely to recall specific details.

“Most people think that emotional things are better remembered, but they actually aren't. It's just parts of the memory that are affected, not the whole memory,” co-investigator Stephanie L. Leal, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Integrative Biology & Physiology at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), told Medscape Medical News. “One size doesn't fit all when it comes to music and memory.”

Interestingly, familiarity with a song was not associated with either general or detailed memory.

“We played the same songs for everybody, but importantly, everyone responded differently. So I think personalization and taking individual preferences into account is going to be important for interventions,” said Leal, who is also director of the Neuroscience of Memory, Mood, and Aging Laboratory at UCLA.

The findings were published online on July 23 in The Journal of Neuroscience.

As previously reported by Medscape Medical News, previous research has shown that both music appreciation and participations are tied to improvement in executive function and memory.

For this study, researchers wanted to dive into the complexities of memory, including the possible connection between music and differing aspects of memory.

“We tend to remember more of the gist of something emotional that happened and not as much of the details. So we wanted to see if music could boost certain parts of memory but not all of the parts,” she said.

Many previous music studies have included older individuals, especially those with dementia. For this project, investigators chose instead to assess a younger population because they wanted to use their data as a “baseline” before moving on to further research in groups that are older and/or have impaired conditions such as depression or Alzheimer's disease, Leal said.

“We wanted to see what happens in healthy people first and then apply it to other populations,” she said.

The study included 130 healthy undergraduate students between the ages of 18 and 35 years from Rice University, Houston.

During the initial phase of memory formation — called the “encoding” phase — each participant was shown 128 images of common household objects and asked to choose whether the object should be considered as an indoor or outdoor item.

Participants then donned headphones and listened to 10 minutes of classical music pieces, ambient soundscapes, or silence while they filled out questionnaires about their medical history.

After the music ended, participants spent about 20 minutes filling out additional questionnaires, including a rating of the music or sounds they heard on the basis of emotional arousal, positive or negative reaction, or familiarity.

They then viewed a set of 192 images that included some they hadn't seen before (foils) and others that were identical (targets) or similar (lures) to the photos viewed earlier. Participants were asked to classify an image as old or new, allowing the researchers to measure target recognition — a measure of general memory — or lure discrimination — a measure of detailed memory.

General recall of the images was greater among those who experienced either low or high emotional response to music than among those who experienced moderate changes in emotional arousal (P for both < .001).

More detailed memories were reported by those who reported only a moderate emotional response to music than those who reported a low or high emotional response (P for both < .001).

There were no significant associations between memory of the images and song familiarity or whether a song was happy or sad.

“Overall, music modulated both general and detailed memory, but individual differences in emotional response were crucial — participants listened to the same music yet responded differently,” the investigators wrote.

“These findings suggest that music interventions may not uniformly enhance memory, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches in treating memory and mood impairments,” they added.

The research suggests that a high emotional response may cloud details more than a moderate response.

“Yes, the idea is that if something is very emotionally arousing, maybe we don't want to remember the details associated with it. Maybe we just want to remember that general feeling or the bigger impact of that event, whether it's positive or negative,” Leal said. “Maybe we just want to take the ‘big picture' from that.”

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Daniel L. Bowling, PhD, assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California, noted that the study “follows the general trend” of research that breaks down large concepts, such as memory, into specific features.

Bowling, who is also director of the Music and Brain Health Lab at Stanford, was not involved with the current study.

“This showed different levels of responses to music that were differentially related to varying types of memory that you might want to target,” Bowling said.

For example, if a clinician's purpose is cognitive training, with more of an emphasis on details, “you might want more moderate levels of [emotional] arousal. But if you want more big-picture stuff, which could be critical when asking people about their life, then higher levels of arousal may be better,” he added.

He noted that because the researchers used almost a “pretreatment,” with music used before the recall task, it would be interesting to know if using such a pretreatment before taking a test could possibly improve performance.

There are interventions, some of which Bowling is involved with, that are looking at supporting arousal and attention during studying. 

A controlled study comparing these things and looking systematically into effects on different types of memory would be helpful, “but we're really at the beginning of figuring all of this stuff out,” he said.

Although the current study has some limitations and needs to be replicated, “any kind of talk toward systematic effects of different musical parameters or emotional modeling starts to help us bring this into the scientific-medical realm. And that's a real strength here,” Bowling concluded.

The investigators reported having no relevant financial relationships. Bowling reported consulting for and owning stock in Spiritune, an app that develops playlists for different purposes, including improved workflow.

Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy showed safe navigation in significant number of most patients with peripheral pulmonary lesions needing a bronchoscopic diagnosis, with a diagnostic yield of 61.6% and minimal adverse events. 

“This study is the largest RAB [robotic-assisted bronchoscopy] study to date and includes academic and community centers, providing generalizable estimates of safety and effectiveness in real-world clinical practice,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Septimiu Murgu, MD, University of Chicago, Department of Medicine, Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Chicago. It was published online on April 27, 2025, in CHEST.

This was a single-arm observational study. The investigators had varying levels of experience with robotic-assisted bronchoscopy, and decision-making processes were not uniform across sites. The small number of cone-beam computed tomography users limited meaningful interpretation of the diagnostic yield linked to this technology.

This study was supported by Auris Health, Inc, part of Johnson & Johnson MedTech. Few authors reported receiving research support from Auris Health and/or Johnson & Johnson MedTech while some reported being currently employed by subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson.

Infectious mononucleosis (IM), also known as the kissing disease or “mono,” is typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is a clinical condition characterised by fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis.

Bell palsy is a condition that causes sudden, temporary facial paralysis or weakness on one side of the face. It can have various aetiologies, such as congenital, neurologic, infectious, neoplastic, or traumatic.

This report describes the case of a woman who was diagnosed with Bell palsy, a rare neurologic complication of EBV-associated IM.

An 18-year-old woman with a medical history of low back pain and sinusitis presented to the clinic with complaints of fever, sore throat, and left-sided facial drooping. She reported noticing these symptoms 1 week prior. The neck pain had progressively worsened and radiated to the left ear. The patient also experienced difficulty forming words and was unable to raise her left eyebrow or smile due to facial drooping. She noted no improvement with over-the-counter medications and denied recent travel.

On physical examination, several 1-cm mobile tender anterior cervical lymph nodes were noted. Tonsillitis with white exudates and left ear tympanosclerosis with associated pain were observed. The left corner of the mouth was drooping, and the patient had difficulty making facial expressions and closing her left eye. The spleen was palpable and tender to touch. Neurologic examination showed that all other cranial nerves were grossly intact. The muscle strength was 5/5 in both the upper and lower extremities, and deep tendon reflexes were present throughout. The lungs were clear to auscultation, and pulses were palpable in all extremities. No oedema, cyanosis, or clubbing was observed. The skin was dry, and no rashes were observed.

Laboratory tests showed mild leucocytosis. Rapid antigen tests for streptococci, influenza, and COVID were negative. A rapid heterophile antibody test for EBV was positive.

The mononucleosis spot test was positive for reactive heterophile antibodies, a hallmark finding of IM. Immunofluorescence assays showed positive immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies against EBV, with the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies indicating either a recent primary infection or a reactivated infection.

On the basis of these findings, a diagnosis of left-sided Bell palsy due to EBV infection was confirmed. The patient was prescribed prednisone 60 mg for 1 week, with a plan to taper the dose. Tylenol was recommended for pain management as needed.

Artificial tears were prescribed to prevent corneal damage and dryness due to the inability to close the left eye. An ear, nose, and throat (ENT) referral was made for the evaluation of left ear tympanosclerosis and associated pain. The patient was counselled to avoid contact sports because of the risk for splenic rupture, a common complication of IM.

At the 2-week follow-up, the patient reported symptoms such as runny nose, fatigue, and ongoing ear pain, pending evaluation by an ENT specialist. At that time, there was no evidence of lymphadenopathy, fever, or splenomegaly. The patient's facial paralysis had improved by approximately 70%, and her speech was also markedly improved. The patient was counselled to rest, stay hydrated, and closely monitor for new symptoms.

IM, most often caused by the EBV, is a viral illness that primarily affects teenagers and young adults. It is transmitted through saliva — which is why it is often referred to as the “kissing disease” — but can also be spread via respiratory droplets, blood, or organ transplants. Symptoms may include sore throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes, and extreme fatigue, as well as swelling of the liver and spleen. A heterophile antibody test is typically sufficient to diagnose IM. Most people recover on their own with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers. However, in rare cases, complications such as a ruptured spleen, neurologic issues, or liver inflammation can occur.

Neurologic complications, such as cranial nerve palsies, Guillain-Barré syndrome, meningoencephalitis, and mononeuritis multiplex, occur in approximately 1%-5% of all patients with acute EBV infection. In children, neurologic manifestations may be the only clinical sign that can occasionally delay diagnosis.

Acute peripheral facial paralysis is the most common acute mononeuropathy and often presents a diagnostic challenge for physicians. Its incidence has been reported as 21.1 per 100,000 per year in children younger than 15 years. Paediatric facial nerve paralysis can be congenital or acquired, but the idiopathic form, known as Bell palsy, is the most frequent, accounting for 40%-75% of cases.

Bell palsy is diagnosed by the abrupt onset of unilateral facial weakness or complete paralysis of all muscles on one side of the face. It may be accompanied by dry eyes, pain around the ear, an altered sense of taste, hypersensitivity to sounds, or decreased tearing.

Recovery time varies, but complete resolution of symptoms usually occurs within 2-3 weeks.

There is always a small possibility of permanent functional loss, which can result from structural damage to axons and myelin. Treatment is usually supportive, often involving a combination of steroids and, in some cases, physical therapy. Facial nerve palsy is most often idiopathic and related to microcirculatory changes but may also result from congenital defects, infections, trauma, neoplasms, or systemic illness. Infectious causes account for 5%-30% of cases and are the most common cause in young children. Common pathogens include herpes simplex virus 1, varicella-zoster virus, EBV, Borrelia burgdorferi, HIV, and influenza virus. The causes of facial palsy are classified as follows:

Genetic: Hereditary myopathies, gene mutations

Syndromic: Craniofacial malformations and brainstem disorders

Delivery-related: Prematurity, instrumental delivery, caesarean section

Infectious: Viral, bacterial, and fungal agents including chronic or acute otitis media

Inflammatory: Autoimmune and vasculitis conditions

Neoplastic: Tumours involving the facial nerve or surrounding structures

Traumatic: Skull fractures affecting the facial nerve

Iatrogenic: Injury during head and neck surgeries

Idiopathic: Bell palsy

Timely diagnosis and stroke exclusion are critical to avoid permanent damage. Lyme disease should be ruled out, especially in patients with recent travel to endemic areas and a bull's eye rash.

Adding anagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, to ongoing insulin and metformin therapy was well-tolerated and improved glycemic control at 24 weeks in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes (T2D).

“[A]fter 24 weeks of treatment, the addition of anagliptin to ongoing insulin and metformin therapy improved glycemic control in patients with T2DM without affecting body weight. These findings suggest that addition of anagliptin could be an effective treatment option for patients with inadequately controlled T2D,” the study authors concluded.

Analysis of gut microbiota in early pregnancy (11-13 weeks) reveals distinct microbial signatures that predict gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) with 98% accuracy, offering potential for early diagnosis. Researchers identified significant differences in microbial composition between GDM and healthy pregnancies at both phylum and genus levels.

“This study not only uncovers early-pregnancy gut microbiota features associated with GDM but also provides a scientific basis for the development of microbiota-based diagnostic tools, offering new insights for GDM prevention and management,” the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Weirong Yao, The Second Hospital of Zhangzhou in Zhangzhou, China. It was published online on July 1 in Microbiology Spectrum.

According to the authors, while the cohort of 61 participants achieved sufficient power to detect microbial signatures with moderate effect sizes, future studies with larger samples are needed to validate generalizability, particularly for low-abundance taxa. Additionally, functional predictions based on 16S rRNA sequencing lack direct metabolite validation and cannot fully reflect microbial functional activity, necessitating future studies incorporating metabolomic and proteomic analyses for validation.

This study was supported by the Zhangzhou Natural Science Foundation Project (ZZ2024J47). The authors reported no conflicts of interest.

Long-term outcomes in primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) were influenced by patient/disease factors; compared with no treatment, treatment with cyclophosphamide (alone or with steroids) was associated with a reduction in relapse rates.

""Our findings further support the treatment of patients with PACNS with cyclophosphamide alone or in combination with steroids to reduce the frequency of relapse,"" the authors wrote.

This study, led by Anna Lena Fisse, Department of Neurology, Ruhr University Bochum, St. Josef Hospital, Bochum, Germany, was published online on June 23, 2025, in Annals of Neurology.

The non-randomised observational design introduced potential confounding as treatment intensity correlated with disease severity. Variable follow-up durations and non-treatment in some cases could bias outcome interpretation.

This study reported open access funding enabled and organised by Projekt DEAL. Some authors reported receiving speaking fees, honoraria, travel support, and research funding; serving as paid consultants; and having other financial ties with several pharmaceutical companies.

DISCLOSURES |  July 02, 2025  

Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM) is a type of systemic amyloidosis that causes restrictive cardiomyopathy and can affect the peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. After diagnosis, patients should be referred to consultation with cardiologists as well as other specialists to develop a treatment plan based on their symptoms. Because this condition can affect several different organ systems, disease management requires a multidisciplinary approach. 

Are you up to date on your understanding of ATTR-CM management ? Test your knowledge with this quick quiz.

ATTRwt, the more common type of ATTR-CM, usually occurs as a function of age, whereas hATTR usually occurs as a result of TTR mutations. Several siRNA agents and ASOs are available to treat polyneuropathy associated with either type.

Liver transplantation, which removes mutant TTR from the blood, has been used to treat hATTR, but the development of newer medications has reduced the need for transplant. Patients with ATTR-CM should be treated with interventions that address all their symptoms, including heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction system disorders, and extracardiac manifestations.

Learn more about treatment considerations for hATTR and ATTR-CM. 

Volume management is an essential element of cardiac amyloidosis treatment, especially if heart failure symptoms are present. In patients with ATTR-CM and heart failure symptoms, loop diuretics are used to maintain euvolemia. Because diuretics can reduce preload, blood pressure should be carefully monitored to prevent adverse effects on renal perfusion and cardiac output. 

Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors can exert vasodilative effects and have been shown to cause hypertension in this setting. Beta-adrenoceptor blockers have been shown to exert negative chronotropic effects and can worsen symptoms of heart failure 

Cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin, are usually not recommended in patients with ATTR-CM. 

Learn more about treating cardiac involvement in ATTR-CM. 

Transthyretin stabilizers, including tafamidis, vutrisiran, and acoramidis, are approved to treat cardiomyopathy in both hATTR and ATTR-CM in adults. They work to reduce cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization. However, they have not been shown to reverse existing damage. 

Clinical trials have demonstrated that this medication class significantly reduced all-cause mortality and lowered hospitalization rates in addition to slowing disease progression. This medication class was also generally well tolerated in most patients with minor side effects, including urinary tract infection. Clinical data also showed that starting this medication class earlier in the disease course might provide improved long-term outcomes.

OH is defined as a reduction of ≥ 20 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure or 10 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure within 3 minutes of standing or upright tilt; further, it is a common complication of ATTR-CM. Nonpharmacologic management of OH can include compression stockings (which can produce ≥ 15-20 mm Hg of pressure) and elastic abdominal binders. Reduced fluid intake has been shown to worsen OH but specifics regarding intake amount in the setting of ATTR-CM can be individualized according to the patient. Though magnesium supplementation has been shown to help manage blood pressure in certain cases, there is limited evidence regarding its role in the treatment of OH associated with ATTR-CM. Evidence regarding vitamin D supplementation in this setting is also limited. 

Learn more about managing different conditions associated with ATTR-CM. 

siRNAs and ASOs, considered to be TTR “ silencers,”work in similar ways to “knock down” the production of TTR in the liver. Their mechanism of action involves targeting TTR mRNA for degradation. This prevents it from being translated, reducing the amount of TTR protein in circulation and disables retinol (vitamin A) transport.

TTR stabilizers bind thyroxine 4 into one of two transthoracic echocardiography interdimeric binding pockets. This prevents dissociation into amyloidogenic TTR monomers and oligomers, thereby increasing the stability of the tetramer.

Among Medicare beneficiaries with HIV, the proportion receiving at least one nonrecommended antiviral prescription decreased substantially from 5.1% in 2013 to 0.1% in 2021.

“Further research should assess how many beneficiaries switched to less toxic antivirals over time (rather than being censored), characteristics associated with switching to safer alternatives, alternative antivirals prescribed instead, and how more recent ART [antiretroviral therapy] guideline recommendations may influence future prescription patterns,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Jose F. Figueroa, MD, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Boston. It was published online on May 1, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The study focused exclusively on traditional Medicare beneficiaries living with HIV, possibly limiting the generalizability of the findings to individuals with HIV covered by commercial insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare Advantage plans. HIV diagnoses relied on claims data.

This study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Aging, the Harvard Center for AIDS Research, and the Advancing Clinical Therapeutics Globally program. Some authors reported having financial ties with multiple foundations and pharmaceutical organizations.

In a large cohort, long-acting lipoglycopeptides (laLGPs) demonstrated comparable effectiveness to standard-of-care antibiotics for step-down treatment of serious Gram-positive bacterial infections in both individuals who used drugs and those who did not.

“Our study highlighted utilization patterns and supported the clinical effectiveness of laLGPs in serious bacterial infections among a diverse patient population. While awaiting a randomized clinical trial, large national databases could help clinicians understand laLGPs' efficacy, especially for off-label use among PWUD [people who use drugs] individuals,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by David Goodman-Meza, MD, PhD, Kirby Institute, Sydney, Australia. It was published online on May 21, 2025, in JAMA Network Open.

The classification of people who use drugs relied solely on diagnostic codes, which may not have accurately represented the true population. The absence of culture data and the use of proxies for Gram-positive infections, potentially affected the accuracy of microbiological profiling. Additionally, adherence to antibiotic therapy and completion of standard-of-care therapy could not be directly measured in this analysis.

This study received internal funding from the UCLA Department of Medicine and grants from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, the US National Institute on Mental Health, and others. Two authors reported having financial ties with several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Inc., Gilead Sciences Inc., Janssen, and Global Services LLC.

DISCLOSURES |  July 02, 2025  

Earlier reports blamed several medications including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), statins, and antihypertensive agents for triggering microscopic colitis. However, a Swedish study of adults aged 65 years or older found that most of these drugs didn't increase the risk.

“Our study demonstrated that, contrary to the previous belief, it's unlikely that medications are the primary triggers for microscopic colitis,” the lead author commented in a press release. “Clinicians should carefully balance the intended benefits of these medication classes against the very low likelihood of a causal relationship with MC [microscopic colitis],” the authors concluded.

This study was led by Hamed Khalili, MD, MPH, Gastroenterology Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. It was published online in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The Swedish registries do not capture primary care visits, so any symptoms or diagnoses recorded there that might have prompted a colonoscopy went unmeasured. Incomplete colonoscopy records may have obscured why participants actually underwent the procedure. Furthermore, the absence of data on smoking status, body weight, laboratory results, and contraindications could have biased the findings.

This study was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health, the Swedish Research Council, and the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Some authors declared receiving consulting fees, serving on advisory boards, receiving financial support, and other ties with certain pharmaceutical companies.

The whole-body MRI revealed similar inflammation levels in both patients with new arthralgia and those with new inflammatory arthritis after exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), showing three distinct patterns of inflammation.

“The finding of inflammation and erosions in patients with arthralgia without visible joint swelling suggests that clinical examination is insensitive and that the incidence of joint inflammation induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors is likely to be underestimated,” the experts wrote in a related comment.

This study was led by Kate Harnden, MB ChB, Leeds Institute of Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Medicine, Chapel Allerton Hospital, University of Leeds, Leeds, England. It was published online on June 10, 2025, in The Lancet Rheumatology.

The imaging of feet and ankles was excluded from MRI scans owing to time constraints, which may have overlooked inflammation in those areas. The short follow-up period of 6 months limited the ability to capture long-term outcomes. Including patients with prior autoimmune diseases may have affected the results, and the predefined MRI patterns based on classical arthritis forms may have led to nonspecific pattern labeling.

This study was supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Leeds Biomedical Research Centre. One author reported receiving a bursary travel award, and another was supported by a fellowship program by AbbVie. One author disclosed receiving honoraria, and another received research grants and consulting fees from various sources including Gilead, Lilly, AbbVie, and Deepcare.

Nearly 60% of patients with adrenal insufficiency and their caregivers needed to administer emergency glucocorticoid injections, yet more than one third failed, resulting in negative outcomes. Confusion, illness, and the need for assistance were primary barriers to self-administered injections.

“Education about the condition and its treatment is central to this process for all stakeholders,” the authors wrote. “Our data emphasize the urgency and importance of gathering the stakeholders to initiate the comprehensive redesign of emergency care for patients with AI [adrenal insufficiency],” they added.

“Timely, effective intervention can mean the difference between recovery and a life-threatening situation,” Elizabeth Regan, MD, PhD, a physician researcher at National Jewish Health and senior author of the study, said in a press release.

This study was led by Whitaker J. Hover and Aiden D. Krein, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, National Jewish Health in Denver. It was published online in Endocrine Practice.

The anonymous and internet-based nature of this study limited the verification of disease status and the diagnostic records. Additionally, participants were from a patient advocacy group with extensive educational programs, which might not have represented the general population of patients with adrenal insufficiency.

This study did not report any funding source. One author reported being the Founder and Chief Strategy Officer for Solution Medical, which is developing injector products for adrenal crisis treatment.

The three most common reasons schools called emergency medical services (EMS) were for neurological crises such as seizures, psychiatric conditions or substance abuse, and trauma related injuries, according to data from the national EMS registry analyzed by researchers from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago.

During the study period (2018-2022), school-based medical emergencies constituted 11 percent of EMS encounters for children and two-thirds resulted in transport to the hospital. Findings, published in Pediatrics, can help schools prioritize training so staff can respond even before EMS arrival.

While many schools have taken steps to ensure they are prepared for medical emergencies, many can still enhance their preparedness. Our study results highlight specific target areas for training of school staff, given that timeliness of treatment in an emergency is essential. We also stress that certain emergency medications should be available in the school setting, including benzodiazepine for seizures, epinephrine for food allergies and albuterol for asthma.""

Michael Harries, MD, MAT, MA, lead author, Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellow at Lurie Children's

The authors point out that national advocacy efforts around passing Seizure Safe Schools legislation are ongoing and effective. Nineteen states passed relevant legislation as of 2022. The model bill recommended by the Epilepsy Foundation seeks to ensure not only that staff are trained, but that seizure medication is available and first-aid responders are legally protected.

The American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on medical emergencies in schools, issued in 2022, specifies the available training programs for school staff, and the medications and equipment that schools should have on hand to respond quickly to potentially life-threatening emergencies.

The study found that physical trauma occurred more frequently in elementary school age students (17 percent), while psychiatric conditions and substance abuse were more common among adolescents (18 percent).

""Given the ongoing mental health crisis in youth, we were not surprised to find that psychiatric conditions and substance abuse were among the most common emergencies in schools,"" said senior author Sriram Ramgopal, MD, Emergency Medicine physician at Lurie Children's and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""Our findings underscore the need for schools to proactively address mental health needs of students, especially teenagers. This may include establishing relationships with local mental health care facilities and improved training for staff on how best to respond to a psychiatric crisis. Overall, we need consistent policies across the country to ensure that all schools are prepared for common medical emergencies.""

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), a type of arthritis commonly occurring in children, is a chronic, inflammatory condition that affects the joints, causing pain, swelling, stiffness, and limiting the range of motion. An imbalance between the regulatory and effector immune cells, primarily driven by the adaptive immune system and induced by both genetic and environmental factors, contributes to the pathogenesis of JIA.

A recent study published by researchers from the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University in the Genes & Diseases journal analyzed the single-cell transcriptomes of immune cells in JIA patients, particularly the sJIA and non-sJIA subtypes, to understand the immune response, both pathogenic and protective, in JIA progression.

Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 14 JIA patients and four healthy controls (HCs) showed an increase in the levels of monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and platelets in JIA, along with a more pronounced pro-inflammatory response in JIA patients, particularly in sJIA versus non-sJIA subtypes.

A comparison of CD4+ cell transcriptomic profiles of sJIA, non-sJIA, and HC cells showed enrichment of DEGs associated with regulating intrinsic apoptotic signaling and VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling pathways in the sJIA and non-sJIA groups. Similarly, the CD8+ transcriptomic profiles of the three groups showed a stronger inflammatory response, lymphocyte migration, and cytotoxicity in the sJIA subtype compared to non-sJIA, while T-cell apoptosis was higher in non-sJIA.

Additionally, the B-cell response to IFN was stronger in sJIA than in non-sJIA, which suggests that while VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling is associated with JIA pathogenesis, IFN may be one of the factors contributing to the different clinical manifestations of sJIA and non-sJIA. Furthermore, non-classical monocytes were found only in the sJIA subtype, implicating its pathogenic role in sJIA.

CellChat analysis revealed that interactions between the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and NK cells with other cell populations were abundant in both sJIA and non-sJIA cases, and macrophage MIF was expressed abundantly in all cell types. This study identified a new ligand-receptor pair, MIF (CD74-CXCR2), in the sJIA subtype, whose ligand CXCR2 is expressed only in monocytes. The authors suggest that MIF (CD74-CXCR2) may serve as an indicator to distinguish the sJIA from non-sJIA subtypes.

In conclusion, this study, the first to characterize the single-cell transcriptomic profile of immune cells in different subtypes of primary JIA, holds significant implications for the precise diagnosis and classification of JIA and may guide the development of personalized treatment strategies for JIA patients.

This pilot study evaluates a newly developed point-of-care (PoC) device designed to measure bilirubin levels in human blood serum using a microfluidic cartridge and optoelectronic sensing module. Accurate bilirubin measurement is critical for assessing liver function and diagnosing conditions such as jaundice and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Traditional laboratory methods are accurate but not suitable for rapid or resource-limited settings due to their complexity. The goal of this study was to determine if the new portable PoC device could deliver comparable accuracy and clinical utility.

Serum samples from 20 patients with bilirubin concentrations ranging from 2 μmol/L to 480 μmol/L were analyzed using both the PoC device and a standard laboratory method (the diazo method via the Abbott Alinity system). The PoC device employed dual-wavelength light detection (455 nm and 530 nm) and microfluidic flow to analyze small-volume samples. The results showed a strong correlation (R² = 0.986) between the PoC and lab measurements. Bland-Altman analysis showed a small mean difference (−5.6 μmol/L) with no systematic bias. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated high diagnostic performance, with 90% sensitivity and 97% specificity in classifying bilirubin levels across clinical thresholds.

The study concludes that the microfluidic-based PoC device offers a promising alternative for bilirubin testing, especially in settings where traditional lab infrastructure is unavailable. Although the sample size was small, the device met clinical accuracy standards and performed well compared to existing PoC solutions like Bilistick and BiliDx. The authors recommend larger-scale studies for further validation, including testing in patient populations with varying clinical profiles such as neonates and individuals with liver disease.

Optibrium, a leading developer of software and AI solutions for molecular design, today announced its partnership with TalTech (Tallinn University of Technology) to co-supervise an EU-funded PhD position as part of the INNOCHEMBIO programme. This research project will focus on developing more accurate metabolism models that will reduce the reliance on costly laboratory experiments while improving speed, efficiency and sustainability in drug discovery.

The PhD research will address a critical need in modern drug development. To overcome the limited amount of available experimental data, existing predictive models use hybrid approaches that combine machine learning with physics-based methods. The most accurate physics-based methods are too computationally expensive to apply routinely, so it's necessary to use faster but less-accurate approximations. This project aims to replace those methods with more efficient and accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). These improved models will enable pharmaceutical teams to better identify risks associated with drug metabolism and guide the design of optimal compounds for synthesis, saving time and reducing costs while aligning their efforts with green chemistry principles. This research will specifically target MLIPs for drug-like molecules and metabolism mediated by Cytochrome P450 enzymes, a family responsible for the metabolism of 70-80% of all small molecule drugs.

The developed models will be integrated directly into Optibrium's StarDrop™ platform, enhancing the company's predictive capabilities for real-world drug discovery applications. This integration ensures immediate practical relevance and positions Optibrium to deliver even greater value to pharmaceutical companies seeking efficient and sustainable drug development solutions.

The collaboration forms part of the Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) COFUND programme INNOCHEMBIO, funded by the European Commission in 2025 (Grant agreement 101217295). This initiative supports the EU's Green Deal objectives by training future experts in sustainable chemistry and biotechnology. INNOCHEMBIO will co-finance 15 PhD positions in total, with the first call for applications now open.

Industry-academia collaborations like this provide PhD candidates with unique insights into real-world challenges whilst ensuring their research has immediate practical impact. The models we develop will directly improve our ability to support pharmaceutical researchers in making more informed decisions earlier in the drug discovery process.""

Mario öeren, Principal Scientist, Optibrium, and Senior Researcher, TalTech

Matthew Segall, Chief Executive Officer, Optibrium, added: ""By supporting the next generation of scientists, we're not only advancing individual careers but also building the expertise needed to overcome the next greatest challenges in drug discovery. Faster and more accurate predictive models allow teams to operate more cost-effectively while minimizing waste and conserving resources.""

In a new study, Microsoft's AI-powered diagnostic system outperformed experienced doctors in solving the most challenging medical cases faster, cheaper, and more accurately. 

Study: Sequential Diagnosis with Language Models. Image credit: metamorworks/Shutterstock.com

*Important notice:  arXiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

A recent study on the ArXiv preprint server compared the diagnostic accuracy and resource expenditure of AI systems with those of clinicians regarding complex cases. The Microsoft AI team demonstrated the efficient use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine to tackle diagnostic challenges that physicians struggle to decipher.

Often, physicians diagnose patients for an ailment through a clinical reasoning process that involves step-by-step, iterative questioning and testing. Even with limited initial information, clinicians narrow down the possible diagnosis by questioning the patient and confirming through biochemical tests, imaging, biopsy, and other diagnostic procedures.

Solving a complex case requires a wide-ranging set of skills, including determining the most critical following questions or tests, staying aware of test costs to prevent increasing patient burden, and recognizing evidence to make a confident diagnosis.

Multiple studies have demonstrated the enhanced efficiency of language models (LMs) in performing in medical licensing exams and highly structured diagnostic vignettes. However, the performance of most LMs was evaluated under artificial conditions, which drastically differ from real-world clinical settings.

Most LMs models for diagnostic assessments are based on a multiple-choice quiz, and the diagnosis is made from a predefined answer set. A reduced sequential diagnosis cycle increases the risk of overstating static benchmarks' model competence. Furthermore, these diagnostic models present the risk of indiscriminate test ordering and premature diagnostic closure. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an AI system based on a sequential diagnosis cycle to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce test costs.

To overcome the above-stated drawbacks of LMs models for clinical diagnosis, scientists have developed the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark (SDBench) as an interactive framework to evaluate diagnostic agents (human or AI) through realistic sequential clinical encounters.

To assess diagnostic accuracy, the current study utilized weekly cases published in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), the world's leading medical journal. This journal typically publishes case records of patients from Massachusetts General Hospital in a detailed, narrative format. These cases are among the most diagnostically challenging and intellectually demanding in clinical medicine, often requiring multiple specialists and diagnostic tests to confirm a diagnosis.

SDBench recast 304 cases from the 2017- 2025 NEJM clinicopathological conference (CPC) into stepwise diagnostic encounters. The medical data spanned clinical presentations to final diagnoses, ranging from common conditions (e.g., pneumonia) to rare disorders (e.g., neonatal hypoglycemia). Using the interactive platform, diagnostic agents decide which questions to ask, which tests to order, and when to confirm a diagnosis.

Information Gatekeeper is a language model that selectively discloses clinical details from a comprehensive case file only when explicitly queried. It can also provide additional case-consistent information for tests not described in the original CPC narrative. After making the final diagnosis based on information obtained from the Gatekeeper, the accuracy of the clinical evaluation was tested against the real diagnosis. In addition, the cumulative cost of all requested diagnostic tests conducted in real-world diagnosis was estimated. By evaluating diagnostic accuracy and cost, SDBench indicates how close we are to high-quality care at a sustainable cost.

The current study analyzed the performance of all diagnostic agents on the SDBench. AI agents were evaluated on all 304 NEJM cases, while physicians were assessed on a held-out subset of 56 test-set cases. This study observed that AI agents performed better on this subset than physicians.

Physicians practicing in the USA and UK with a median of 12 years of clinical experience achieved 20% diagnostic accuracy at an average cost of $2,963 per case on SDBench, highlighting the benchmark's inherent difficulty. Physicians spent an average of 11.8 minutes per case, requesting 6.6 questions and 7.2 tests. GPT -4o outperformed physicians in terms of both diagnostic accuracy and cost. Commercially available off-the-shelf models offered varied diagnostic accuracy and cost.

The current study also introduced the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), a platform co-designed with physicians, which exhibited higher diagnostic efficiency than human physicians and commercial language models. Compared to commercial LMs, MAI-DxO demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy and a significant reduction in medical costs of more than half. For instance, the off-the-shelf O3 model achieved diagnostic accuracy of 78.6% for $7,850, while MAI-DxO achieved 79.9% accuracy at just $2,397, or 85.5% at $7,184.

MAI-DxO accomplished this by simulating a virtual panel of “doctor agents” with different roles in hypothesis generation, test selections, cost-consciousness, and error checking. Unlike baseline AI prompting, this structured orchestration allowed the system to reason iteratively and efficiently.

MAI-DxO is a model-agnostic approach that has demonstrated accuracy gains across various language models, not just the O3 foundation model.

The current study's findings demonstrate AI systems' higher diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness when guided to think iteratively and act judiciously. SDBench and MAI-DxO provided an empirically grounded foundation for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis under realistic constraints.

In the future, MAI-DxO must be validated in clinical environments, where disease prevalence and presentation occur as frequently as daily, rather than as a rare occasion. Furthermore, large-scale interactive medical benchmarks involving more than 304 cases are required. Incorporation of visual and other sensory modalities, such as imaging, could also enhance diagnostic accuracy without compromising cost efficiency.

However, the authors note important limitations. NEJM CPC cases are selected for their difficulty and do not reflect everyday clinical presentations. The study did not include healthy patients or measure false positive rates. Moreover, diagnostic cost estimates are based on U.S. pricing and may vary globally.

The models were also tested on a held-out test set of recent cases (2024-2025) to assess generalization and avoid overfitting, as many of these cases were published after the training cutoff for most models.

The paper also raises a broader question: Should we compare AI systems to individual physicians or full medical teams? Since MAI-DxO mimics multi-specialist collaboration, the comparison may reflect something closer to team-based care than individual practice.

Nonetheless, the research suggests that structured AI systems like MAI-DxO may one day support or augment clinicians, particularly in settings where specialist access is limited or expensive.

A new AI model is much better than doctors at identifying patients likely to experience cardiac arrest.

The linchpin is the system's ability to analyze long-underused heart imaging, alongside a full spectrum of medical records, to reveal previously hidden information about a patient's heart health.

The federally-funded work, led by Johns Hopkins University researchers, could save many lives and also spare many people unnecessary medical interventions, including the implantation of unneeded defibrillators.

""Currently we have patients dying in the prime of their life because they aren't protected and others who are putting up with defibrillators for the rest of their lives with no benefit,"" said senior author Natalia Trayanova, a researcher focused on using artificial intelligence in cardiology. ""We have the ability to predict with very high accuracy whether a patient is at very high risk for sudden cardiac death or not.""

The findings are published today in Nature Cardiovascular Research.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most common inherited heart diseases, affecting one in every 200 to 500 individuals worldwide, and is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and athletes.

Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will live normal lives, but a percentage are at significant increased risk for sudden cardiac death. It's been nearly impossible for doctors to determine who those patients are.

Current clinical guidelines used by doctors across the United States and Europe to identify the patients most at risk for fatal heart attacks have about a 50% chance of identifying the right patients, ""not much better than throwing dice,"" Trayanova says.

The team's model significantly outperformed clinical guidelines across all demographics.

Multimodal AI for ventricular Arrhythmia Risk Stratification (MAARS), predicts individual patients' risk for sudden cardiac death by analyzing a variety of medical data and records, and, for the first time, exploring all the information contained in the contrast-enhanced MRI images of the patient's heart.

People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develop fibrosis, or scarring, across their heart and it's the scarring that elevates their risk of sudden cardiac death. While doctors haven't been able to make sense of the raw MRI images, the AI model zeroed right in on the critical scarring patterns.

People have not used deep learning on those images. We are able to extract this hidden information in the images that is not usually accounted for.""

Natalia Trayanova, senior author

The team tested the model against real patients treated with the traditional clinical guidelines at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Sanger Heart & Vascular Institute in North Carolina.

Compared to the clinical guidelines that were accurate about half the time, the AI model was 89% accurate across all patients and, critically, 93% accurate for people 40 to 60 years old, the population among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients most at-risk for sudden cardiac death.

The AI model also can describe why patients are high risk so that doctors can tailor a medical plan to fit their specific needs.

""Our study demonstrates that the AI model significantly enhances our ability to predict those at highest risk compared to our current algorithms and thus has the power to transform clinical care,"" says co-author Jonathan Crispin, a Johns Hopkins cardiologist.

In 2022, Trayanova's team created a different multi-modal AI model that offered personalized survival assessment for patients with infarcts, predicting if and when someone would die of cardiac arrest.

The team plans to further test the new model on more patients and expand the new algorithm to use with other types of heart diseases, including cardiac sarcoidosis and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful"" budget reconciliation bill would make some of the most sweeping changes in health policy in years, largely affecting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act plans — with reverberations felt throughout the health care system.

With only a few exceptions, the budget reconciliation process — which allows the political party in control to pass a bill with only 51 votes in the Senate, rather than the usual 60 — is how nearly every major piece of health legislation has passed Congress since the 1980s.

But using reconciliation to constrict rather than expand health coverage, as the GOP is attempting now? That is unusual.

One of the best-known programs born via reconciliation is the ""COBRA"" health insurance continuation, which allows people who leave jobs with employer-provided insurance to keep it for a time, as long as they pay the full premium.

That is one of dozens of health provisions tucked into COBRA, or the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985. Also included was the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals that take Medicare to treat or transfer patients with medical emergencies, regardless of their insurance status — a law that's become a focus of abortion opponents as they seek to limit access to the procedure.

A key reason so much health policy has passed this way has to do with how Congress manages the federal budget. Federal government spending falls into two categories: mandatory, or spending required by existing law, and discretionary, which traditionally is allocated and renewed each year as part of the appropriations process.

Lawmakers use the reconciliation process to make changes to mandatory spending programs — Medicare and Medicaid are among the largest — as well as tax policy. (For complicated political reasons, reconciliation bills cannot touch Social Security, the last prong in the entitlement program trifecta.)

Reconciliation comes into play only if it is needed to reconcile taxes or mandatory spending to comply with the terms Congress sets for itself each year, through the annual budget resolution. This year the GOP's focus is finding the cash to renew Trump's expiring tax cuts, which largely benefit wealthier Americans, and boost military and border security spending.

In years when Congress orders a reconciliation bill, health policy almost always plays a major part. Usually, reconciliation instructions call for reductions in payments to health providers under Medicare — which costs the most of the federal health programs.

For much of the 1980s and 1990s, Democrats in Congress quietly used reconciliation to expand eligibility for the Medicaid program, often by cutting more than the budget called for from Medicare. For every $5 cut from Medicare, about $1 would be redirected to provide Medicaid to more low-income people.

But budget reconciliation has also become a convenient way to make policy changes to the nation's major health programs, as it is usually considered a ""must-pass"" bill likely to be signed by the president and not subject to filibuster in the Senate.

As a result, all manner of now-familiar health programs were created by budget reconciliation bills, many of which provided health coverage to more Americans.

The 1989 reconciliation bill created a new system for paying doctors who treat Medicare patients, as well as a new federal agency to study the cost, quality, and effectiveness of health care, today known as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

Children's health has been a popular add-on over the years, including the gradual expansion of Medicaid coverage to more children based on family income. The 1993 reconciliation bill created the Vaccines for Children program, which ensures the availability and affordability of vaccines nationwide for uninsured and underinsured kids. The 1997 reconciliation bill created the Children's Health Insurance Program, which today provides insurance to more than 7 million children.

In fact, the list of major health bills of the past 50 years not passed using budget reconciliation is short. For instance, the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, which added a prescription drug benefit to the program for the first time, attracted just enough bipartisan support to pass on its own.

The biggest health care law of recent decades — the Affordable Care Act — didn't start out as a reconciliation bill, but it ended up using the process to clear its final hurdles.

After initial passage of the bill in December 2009, a special election cost Democrats their 60th seat in the Senate — and with it, the supermajority they needed to pass the bill without Republican votes. In the end, the two chambers used a separate reconciliation measure, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, to negotiate a compromise that included the ACA.

Can our gut bacteria help clear dangerous ‘forever chemicals' from our bodies? New research reveals certain microbes rapidly sequester PFAS, offering hope for microbiome-based solutions against toxic environmental exposures.

Study: Human gut bacteria bioaccumulate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

Bacteria formed microscopic PFAS ""storage units"" inside their cells, cryo-imaging revealed dense PFAS clusters, explaining how they tolerate concentrations 50x higher than their environment.

Scientists have discovered that certain species of microbe found in the human gut can bioaccumulate (store internally rather than merely absorb) PFAS – the toxic and long-lasting 'forever chemicals.' They say boosting these species in our gut microbiome could potentially help increase faecal excretion of some PFAS, but direct evidence of health protection in humans is not yet available. The research is published in the journal Nature Microbiology.

PFAS have been linked with a range of health issues, including decreased fertility, developmental delays in children, and a higher risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases.

Scientists at the University of Cambridge have identified a family of bacterial species, naturally found in the human gut, that can bioaccumulate various PFAS molecules within their cells. The study showed that when a community of 20 human gut bacterial strains (“Com20”) was introduced into the guts of mice to 'humanise' the mouse microbiome, these bacteria collectively rapidly accumulated PFAS eaten by the mice, which were then excreted in faeces. The researchers also performed a separate comparison using communities containing either five high-accumulating or five low-accumulating strains.

The researchers also found that as the mice were exposed to a single oral dose of PFAS, the microbes in the colonized mice contributed to increased faecal excretion of PFAS compared to germ-free controls. The finding that gut bacteria sequester a consistent fraction of PFAS across a range of concentrations comes from in vitro experiments with B. uniformis, not from the mouse model. Within minutes of exposure, the bacterial species tested in laboratory (in vitro) kinetic studies bioaccumulated between 25% and 74% of the PFAS. This rapid uptake was demonstrated in cell cultures, whereas the 25–74% range was observed in a 24-hour screen across different strains.

Some bacteria evolved supercharged PFAS resistance in just 20 days. B. uniformis grew 46x better under PFDA exposure after lab evolution, showing rapid adaptation potential.

The results are the first evidence that our gut microbiome may play a beneficial role in removing toxic PFAS chemicals from the body, although this has not yet been directly tested in humans. The study only demonstrated increased faecal excretion in mice colonised with human gut bacteria, and did not assess PFAS levels in blood or measure health effects.

The researchers plan to utilize their discovery to develop probiotic dietary supplements that enhance the levels of these beneficial microbes in the gut, potentially protecting against the toxic effects of PFAS. However, further research, including human cohort studies, will be necessary to determine whether this strategy can effectively reduce PFAS levels and associated health risks in people.

PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances) can't be avoided in our modern world. These man-made chemicals are found in many everyday items, including waterproof clothing, non-stick pans, lipsticks, and food packaging, which are used for their resistance to heat, water, oil, and grease. However, because they take thousands of years to break down, they accumulate in large quantities in the environment and in our bodies.

Dr Kiran Patil, in the University of Cambridge's MRC Toxicology Unit and senior author of the report, said: ""Given the scale of the problem of PFAS 'forever chemicals', particularly their effects on human health, it's concerning that so little is being done about removing these from our bodies. We found that certain species of human gut bacteria have a remarkably high capacity to soak up PFAS from their environment at a range of concentrations, and store these in clumps inside their cells. Due to aggregation of PFAS in these clumps, the bacteria themselves seem protected from the toxic effects.""

Dr Indra Roux, a researcher at the University of Cambridge's MRC Toxicology Unit and a co-author of the study, said: ""The reality is that PFAS are already in the environment and our bodies, and we need to try and mitigate their impact on our health now. We haven't found a way to destroy PFAS, but our findings open the possibility of developing ways to get them out of our bodies where they do the most harm.""

There is increasing concern about the environmental and health impacts of PFAS, and in April 2025, the UK launched a parliamentary inquiry into their risks and regulation.

There are over 4,700 PFAS chemicals in widespread use. Some substances are cleared out of the body through our urine in a matter of days, but others with a longer molecular structure can remain in the body for years.

Dr Anna Lindell, a researcher at the University of Cambridge's MRC Toxicology Unit and first author of the study, said: ""We're all being exposed to PFAS through our water and food – these chemicals are so widespread that they're in all of us.

""PFAS were once considered safe, but it's now clear that they're not. It's taken a long time for PFAS to become noticed because at low levels they're not acutely toxic. But they're like a slow poison.""

Lindell and Patil have co-founded Cambiotics, a startup, along with serial entrepreneur Peter Holme Jensen, to develop probiotics that remove PFAS from the body. They are investigating various ways to turbocharge the microbes' performance. Cambiotics is supported by Cambridge Enterprise, the innovation arm of the University of Cambridge, which helps researchers translate their work into a globally leading economic and social impact.

Not all PFAS were handled equally, long-chain types like PFDA accumulated 2x better than shorter chains, and sulfonated versions behaved differently than carboxylates in mixtures.

While the new findings show that certain gut bacteria can accumulate PFAS in the lab and animal models, not all gut bacteria are capable of doing so. The study found that some species, particularly Gram-negative strains, are high accumulators, while others are not. The experiments primarily focused on one PFAS (PFNA), so the effects may differ for other PFAS compounds.

While we wait for new probiotics to become available, the researchers suggest that the best things we can do to protect ourselves against PFAS are to avoid PFAS-coated cooking pans and use a reliable water filter.

The authors also caution that further research is needed to determine whether increasing PFAS-bioaccumulating gut bacteria will significantly reduce PFAS levels or health risks in humans. Further human studies are planned to clarify this potential.

The study also identified mechanistic details, including the role of bacterial efflux pumps (such as TolC in E. coli) and the intracellular aggregation of PFAS, visualized via cryogenic FIB-SIMS imaging. Longer-chain PFAS (such as PFDA) were found to be more efficiently bioaccumulated than shorter-chain variants.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New brain scan tool predicts aging speed and dementia risk","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250701/New-brain-scan-tool-predicts-aging-speed-and-dementia-risk.aspx","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 03:29:00 GMT","

Any high school reunion is a sharp reminder that some people age more gracefully than others. Some enter their older years still physically spry and mentally sharp. Others start feeling frail or forgetful much earlier in life than expected.

The way we age as we get older is quite distinct from how many times we've traveled around the sun.""

Ahmad Hariri, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University

Now, scientists at Duke, Harvard and the University of Otago in New Zealand have developed a freely available tool that can tell how fast someone is aging, and while they're still reasonably healthy -- by looking at a snapshot of their brain.

From a single MRI brain scan, the tool can estimate your risk in midlife for chronic diseases that typically emerge decades later. That information could help motivate lifestyle and dietary changes that improve health.

In older people, the tool can predict whether someone will develop dementia or other age-related diseases years before symptoms appear, when they might have a better shot at slowing the course of disease.

""What's really cool about this is that we've captured how fast people are aging using data collected in midlife,"" Hariri said. ""And it's helping us predict diagnosis of dementia among people who are much older.""

The results were published July 1 in the journal Nature Aging.

Finding ways to slow age-related decline is key to helping people live healthier, longer lives. But first ""we need to figure out how we can monitor aging in an accurate way,"" Hariri said.

Several algorithms have been developed to measure how well a person is aging. But most of these ""aging clocks"" rely on data collected from people of different ages at a single point in time, rather than following the same individuals as they grow older, Hariri said.

""Things that look like faster aging may simply be because of differences in exposure"" to things such as leaded gasoline or cigarette smoke that are specific to their generation, Hariri said.

The challenge, he added, is to come up with a measure of how fast the process is unfolding that isn't confounded by environmental or historical factors unrelated to aging.

To do that, the researchers drew on data gathered from some 1,037 people who have been studied since birth as part of the Dunedin Study, named after the New Zealand city where they were born between 1972 and 1973.

Every few years, Dunedin Study researchers looked for changes in the participants' blood pressure, body mass index, glucose and cholesterol levels, lung and kidney function and other measures -- even gum recession and tooth decay.

They used the overall pattern of change across these health markers over nearly 20 years to generate a score for how fast each person was aging.

The new tool, named DunedinPACNI, was trained to estimate this rate of aging score using only information from a single brain MRI scan that was collected from 860 Dunedin Study participants when they were 45 years old.

Next the researchers used it to analyze brain scans in other datasets from people in the U.K., the U.S., Canada and Latin America.

Across data sets, they found that people who were aging faster by this measure performed worse on cognitive tests and showed faster shrinkage in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory.

More soberingly, they were also more likely to experience cognitive decline in later years.

In one analysis, the researchers examined brain scans from 624 individuals ranging in age from 52 to 89 from a North American study of risk for Alzheimer's disease.

Those who the tool deemed to be aging the fastest when they joined the study were 60% more likely to develop dementia in the years that followed. They also started to have memory and thinking problems sooner than those who were aging slower.

When the team first saw the results, ""our jaws just dropped to the floor,"" Hariri said.

The researchers also found that people whose DunedinPACNI scores indicated they were aging faster were more likely to suffer declining health overall, not just in their brain function.

People with faster aging scores were more frail and more likely to experience age-related health problems such as heart attacks, lung disease or strokes.

The fastest agers were 18% more likely to be diagnosed with a chronic disease within the next several years compared with people with average aging rates.

Even more alarming, they were also 40% more likely to die within that timeframe than those who were aging more slowly, the researchers found.

""The link between aging of the brain and body are pretty compelling,"" Hariri said.

The correlations between aging speed and dementia were just as strong in other demographic and socioeconomic groups than the ones the model was trained on, including a sample of people from Latin America, as well as United Kingdom participants who were low-income or non-White.

""It seems to be capturing something that is reflected in all brains,"" Hariri said.

The work is important because people worldwide are living longer. In the coming decades, the number of people over age 65 is expected to double, reaching nearly one fourth of the world's population by 2050.

""But because we live longer lives, more people are unfortunately going to experience chronic age-related diseases, including dementia,"" Hariri said.

Dementia's economic burden is already huge. Research suggests that the global cost of Alzheimer's care, for example, will grow from $1.33 trillion in 2020 to $9.12 trillion in 2050 -- comparable or greater than the costs of diseases like lung disease or diabetes that affect more people.

Effective treatments for Alzheimer's have proven elusive. Most approved drugs can help manage symptoms but fail to stop or reverse the disease.

One possible explanation for why drugs haven't worked so far is they were started too late, when the Alzheimer's proteins that build up in and around nerve cells have already done too much damage.

""Drugs can't resurrect a dying brain,"" Hariri said.

But in the future, the new tool could make it possible to identify people who may be on the way to Alzheimer's sooner, and evaluate interventions to stop it -- before brain damage becomes extensive, and without waiting decades for follow-up.

In addition to predicting our risk of dementia over time, the new clock will also help scientists better understand why people with certain risk factors, such as poor sleep or mental health conditions, age differently, said first author Ethan Whitman, who is working toward a Ph.D. in clinical psychology with Hariri and study co-authors Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi, also professors of psychology and neuroscience at Duke.

More research is needed to advance DunedinPACNI from a research tool to something that has practical applications in healthcare, Whitman added.

But in the meantime, the team hopes the tool will help researchers with access to brain MRI data measure aging rates in ways that aging clocks based on other biomarkers, such as blood tests, can't.

""We really think of it as hopefully being a key new tool in forecasting and predicting risk for diseases, especially Alzheimer's and related dementias, and also perhaps gaining a better foothold on progression of disease,"" Hariri said.

The authors have ﬁled a patent application for the work. This research was supported by the U.S. National Institute on Aging (R01AG049789, R01AG032282, R01AG073207), the UK Medical Research Council (MR/X021149/1), and the New Zealand Health Research Council (Programme Grant 16-604).

A recent study published in Genes & Diseases reveals new insights into the relationship between immune cell characteristics, blood metabolites, and the risk of urolithiasis. Using Mendelian randomization (MR) and mediation analysis, the research highlights how genetically predicted blood metabolites mediate the association between specific immune cell profiles and the development of urinary stones. The findings shed light on potential pathogenic mechanisms and suggest novel therapeutic targets for this widespread and recurrent condition.

Urolithiasis, characterized by the formation of urinary stones, affects approximately 10% to 15% of the global population, with prevalence on the rise. It is influenced by multiple factors, including immune dysregulation and metabolic disturbances. In this study, researchers employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach to assess the causal relationship between immune cell features, blood metabolites, and urolithiasis risk. The study involved data from 488,346 individuals, including 6,223 cases of urolithiasis and 482,123 controls, and utilized genetic instruments derived from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS).

The analysis identified 10 immune cell characteristics significantly associated with urolithiasis, including markers from the B cell panel, Treg cell panel, and CDC panel. Among these, IgD-CD24-% lymphocyte, CD24 on transitional B cells, CD25 on IgD+ CD38- naïve, CD4 Treg % T cell, and activated and resting Treg AC were found to increase the risk of urolithiasis. On the other hand, HLA DR on plasmacytoid DC, HLA DR on DC, and HLA DR on B cells were identified as protective factors. Notably, the reverse MR analysis did not support a causal effect of urolithiasis on immune cell characteristics, indicating a unidirectional relationship.

Further analysis revealed 13 metabolites linked with urolithiasis, including lipids, amino acids, carbohydrates, and metabolite ratios. Among these, glycolithocholate and 4-hydroxychlorothalonil (4-OH-CHT) were associated with increased risk, while stearidonate and sphingomyelin were associated with a reduced risk. Importantly, glycolithocholate and 1-oleoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPE positively mediated the link between B cell traits and urolithiasis, while 4-OH-CHT negatively mediated the association between CD4 Treg % T cells and urolithiasis.

These findings emphasize that blood metabolites play a significant role in the immune-mediated formation of urinary stones. By uncovering the metabolic pathways involved, the study not only enhances the understanding of urolithiasis pathogenesis but also proposes new biomarkers for risk assessment. Furthermore, it suggests that targeting immune-metabolic interactions could be a promising strategy for preventing and managing urolithiasis.

Relapsed/refractory peripheral and cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (R/R PTCL and CTCL) are aggressive blood cancers that often resist standard therapy. Patients with these lymphomas may require stem cell transplants, but the disease needs to be brought under control before patients can undergo this treatment. A new study by investigators from PETAL Consortium at Mass General Brigham found the combination of duvelisib and romidepsin to be effective, tolerable and safe for patients with R/R PTCL and CTCL. Their findings suggest that this drug combination offers a novel strategy to help these patients control the disease in order to be eligible for stem cell transplants. The results are published in Blood Advances.

This real-world study builds upon prior clinical trials by providing a more comprehensive view of using the drug combination in clinical practice, including variations in clinical setting, prescribing patterns, and adverse event management within a diverse, higher-risk population. Despite dose modifications and interruptions, high response rates were observed in patients.""

Josie Ford, BS, first author, clinical research coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital

Clinicians administered the treatment to 38 patients, tracking treatment effectiveness, how long the patient lived and side effects. Study outcomes showed that the drug combination helped shrink or eliminate cancer in 61% of patients, with 47% having no detectable cancer. Eleven patients went on to receive stem cell transplants. Additionally, in patients with the nodal T-follicular helper cell subtype of lymphoma, 82% of patients responded well. The drug combination had manageable side effects, but one patient died from treatment-related complications.

""These findings support duvelisib and romidepsin's efficacy, safety and tolerability, and we hope the study facilitates improved access to the treatment through insurance coverage and regulatory agency approvals,"" said senior author Salvia Jain, MD, a founding member of the PETAL consortium and a hematologist and medical oncologist at MGH. ""Future direction would lie in determining markers of response or resistance, ideally through non-invasive monitoring so the treatment can be personalized.""

Alphalyse, a fast-growing Danish specialist contract research organization (CRO) that has developed GMP‑validated liquid‑chromatography mass‑spectrometry (LC‑MS) assays for host‑cell‑protein (HCP) impurity testing in biologic drugs, today announces that Fidelio Capital has acquired a majority stake in the company. Alphalyse's founders will retain a significant shareholding, establishing an ambitious partnership aimed at expanding capacity, accelerating international growth, and establishing Alphalyse as the global reference in biologic HCP impurity analysis.

The partnership comes at an exciting moment for the biologics market as the drug pipeline - particularly complex modalities - continues to expand and the limitations of legacy ELISA technology become increasingly clear. LC-MS is emerging as the method of choice for drug developers and manufacturers seeking deeper process insight and stronger regulatory compliance, a trend underlined by the new U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) General Chapter 1132.1 and recent discussions at the BEBPA Host Cell Protein Conference, where this shift was front and center.

Alphalyse already supports customers at every development stage, from discovery to commercial release, with quantitative, reproducible HCP data that de‑risks regulatory submissions and shortens development timelines. Its GMP‑validated assays are fully in line with the new USP chapter, positioning the company to scale rapidly and set a new industry standard for HCP impurity analysis worldwide.

Demand for precise insights into HCP impurities is growing quickly as biologics pipelines continue to expand. Fidelio's operational expertise and global network will allow us to increase our capacity and international footprint, ensuring developers and manufacturers have the data that regulators now expect from day one.""

In a summer full of soccer, there's one match that stands out among the rest. The rivalry between the U.S. Women's National Team and Canada is one of the fiercest and most storied in women's soccer. And with the 67th edition on July 2 in the Allstate Continental Clásico, two players are on this week's episode to share their very different perspectives: Lynn Biyendolo, the veteran forward who recently captained the USWNT for the first time, and defender Jordyn Bugg, who at 18 years old just made her first career start.

Together, they join David Gass and Megan Klingenberg to discuss the 600th win in USWNT history (6:30), the superpowers of a soft-spoken leader (15:30), Lynn's thoughtful choice to change the name on her jersey (17:00) and Jordyn's decision to go pro at 17 years old (19:15) before diving into the rivalry with Canada (23:05). Then, the group concludes with some fun rapid-fire questions (34:00) including their takes on ‘Love Island USA' Season 7.

The United States Women's National Team returns to action July 2 for a meeting with Canada in the Allstate Continental Clásico in Washington, D.C. Kickoff is 7:30 p.m. ET at Audi Field.

Fresh off winning the program's 600th win on Sunday, the USWNT will look to close out this three-match window on a strong note against a Concacaf rival. Here are five things to know before the United States faces Canada on Wednesday.

The matchup between top-ranked United States and No. 8 Canada will mark the 67th time the neighboring countries have met on the pitch. The United States owns the all-time series, recording 53 of the program's 600 wins against Canada, the most against any opponent in history.

This matchup has been full of memorable moments in the past and is sure to bring more in the future, including Wednesday night. This was the theme of this week's episode of the U.S. Soccer Podcast released Wednesday morning with featured guests veteran Lynn Biyendolo and 18-year-old Jordyn Bugg. The pair joined hosts David Gass and Megan Klingenberg, who also faced Canada during her international career, to share their different perspectives on the rivalry.

Two of the United States' eight goals scored so far this window belong to Alyssa Thompson. The Angel City FC forward scored in each of the USA's most recent matches against the Republic of Ireland, once as a starter and once off the bench. If Thompson continues the trend against Canada, at 20 years, 237 days old, she'll be the second-youngest player to score in three straight USWNT appearances. Only legend Mia Hamm has done so at a younger age in separate three-game streaks as an 18-year-old in 1990 and a 19-year-old in 1991.

Biyendolo is also coming off a strong performance. On Sunday against Ireland, the veteran forward captained the USWNT for the first time in her career as she led a young starting XI that without her had only 41 caps combined. Like Thompson, Biyendolo has scored in two of the United States' three most recent matches – the opening goal against Ireland in the 11th minute and a second-half brace off the bench in the 4-0 win over Jamaica in early June.

Consecutive wins brought a lot of scoring for the United States; the team has also kept their opponents off the board. The squad under head coach Emma Hayes enters Wednesday night's contest coming off back-to-back clean sheets against Ireland. Dating back to the early June friendlies, the USWNT has strung together four straight shutouts against three different opponents – Jamaica, China PR and Ireland.

In those matches, the USWNT has outscored their opponents by a total of 15-0, the largest margin in a four-match span in the last three years. The last time the USWNT displayed that kind of control in a four-match span was in 2022 when the team won four games with a combined score of 17-0.

Canada, the opponent Wednesday, will be a strong challenge as head coach Casey Stoney's team has also been in good form as of late. FIFA's eighth-ranked team is the midst of a successful stretch of their own, winning three straight games dating back to May 31. Most recently, Canada scored four goals in 16 minutes to beat Costa Rica 4-1, then went on to earn back-to-back victories over Haiti.

The United States and Canada faced off twice in 2024 – in the Concacaf Women's Gold Cup Semifinal and the SheBelieves Cup Final. The USWNT won both meetings on penalty shootouts to extend their four-year unbeaten streak against their northern rivals.

The two head coaches have approached this window similarly, seeing it as a chance to develop their programs and build toward larger goals. That said, the Canada team that the U.S. will see in this edition features some regular starters such as Jessie Fleming, Ashley Lawrence, Adriana Leonand and Kailen Sheridan. Another player to look out for is Holly Ward. The 21-year-old has scored in back-to-back matches for Canada. 

Heading into the three-match window, Hayes required European-based based players in the national team pool to sit out this window to rest, with the exception of Naomi Girma who missed part of the season at Chelsea FC due to injury. The result was a young and less experienced camp roster, but one brimming with NWSL talent ready to make the most out of their opportunities at the national team level.

The site of Wednesday night's match is the club soccer home for two players on the U.S. roster. Midfielder Croix Bethune and defender Tara McKeown play for the Washington Spirit in the NWSL and know Audi Field, the Spirit's home pitch since 2023. Both players started the USWNT match on June 29 against Ireland.

The Washington Spirit is also owned by Michele Kang, one of the most steadfast champions and committed investors in women's soccer. Last fall, Kang made a historic $30 million, five-year pledge to U.S. Soccer to advance the sport and was recently named this year's Sports Philanthropist of the Year Honoree at the Sports Humanitarian Awards as part of ESPN's ESPYs Week.

The U.S. Men's National Team advanced past Costa Rica 4-3 on penalty kicks in the Concacaf Gold Cup Quarterfinal in a comeback victory Sunday.

Next, the USMNT will face Guatemala in the semifinal at Energizer Park in St. Louis (7 p.m. ET on FS1).

Guatemala entered the tournament as the third-lowest ranked FIFA team. With one upset at a time, the squad now finds itself in the semifinal for the first time since 1996. Guatemala stunned Canada in penalty kicks on Sunday after sneaking its way out of Group C with wins over Jamaica and Guadeloupe.

The Americans beat Costa Rica in a dramatic penalty shootout, much like Guatemala did in its knockout match at U.S. Bank Stadium. U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese made three saves in the shootout to send the USA through to the next round, and forward Damion Downs netted the final kick to secure the victory.

Before the quarterfinal, the United States came out of Group D unscathed, beating Trinadad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti. The Stars and Stripes finished the group stage with nine points while only conceding one goal.

The USA and Guatemala have met 27 times in history; the USMNT holds a winning record of 16-5-6. The two countries last met in the Gold Cup more than two decades ago in the 2007 group stage. The United States won that match 1-0.

It's been almost 10 years since the USMNT competed against Guatemala in a set of World Cup Qualifiers in 2016. None of the players on the current roster played in those matchups.

The USMNT has advanced to the semifinals in 17 of 18 total Gold Cups and will have a chance to reach its 11th title match.

The United States Women's National Team played a series of friendly matches against the Republic of Ireland, earning two back-to-back 4-0 wins. After stringing together a series of impressive performances in the first half of the 2025 NWSL season, all four Reign FC players saw the pitch, marking many milestone moments.

 

Lynn Biyendolo

Forward Lynn Biyendolo, a United States Women's National Team veteran, has been called upon to lead the squad this international window. She is the oldest player on the June/July camp roster and has 82 career caps. 

She reached two milestones in the USWNT's most recent match against the Republic of Ireland – she was captain of the team for the first time and reached her 25th international goal.

The USWNT patiently passed the ball around the field to create the scoring opportunity, with Sam Meza, Emma Sears and Biyendolo leading the charge. The quick series of passes opened up space out wide for Sears to run and chip a cross into the box. Biyendolo was poised in front of the goal, making no mistake as she volleyed the ball into the left side of the net.

Jordyn Bugg

Jordyn Bugg, the youngest player on the USWNT roster, made her first appearance for the United States on June 26. The 4-0 win saw Bugg come onto the field in the 73rd minute, replacing Naomi Girma and becoming the 280th player in USWNT history to earn a cap. She is the youngest USWNT debutante since Olivia Moultrie debuted at 18 years and 76 days in 2023.

The 18-year-old earned her first start in the very next match and played a full 90 minutes alongside fellow defenders Emily Sams, Tara McKeown and Izzy Rodriguez.

Claudia Dickey

Goalkeeper Claudia Dickey made her first appearance for the United States on June 26. She became the 29th goalkeeper in USWNT history to earn a cap. A long time in the making, Dickey had previously joined the senior national team this year but had not yet made an appearance prior to this international window.

She didn't have a lot of work to do as the United States captured the shutout, as Ireland managed just two shots, both of which were off target. She was tested in the 61st minute the match, as Ireland's Kyra Carusa fired a close-range shot that required a quality stop from Dickey, but in the end, the play ended up being called offside and the save would not appear on the stats sheet.

A first cap and first clean sheet for Claudia Dickey 👏#USWNT x Allstate pic.twitter.com/pkgAcR87up

 

Sam Meza

Midfielder Sam Meza also made her United States debut, starting the match on June 29. She became the first player to play in the USL Super League and earn a USWNT cap. She showed her quality in the midfield, using her strength and tenacity to control possession of the ball for the United States, in addition to connecting quick passes. She played for 87 minutes before giving way to Rose Lavelle. 

She debuted alongside Izzy Rodriguez as the two became the 281st and 282nd players to earn a cap for the USWNT and the 23rd and 24th players to debut under head coach Emma Hayes. They are also the 12th and 13th players of Hispanic descent to play for the USWNT.

Next up, Biyendolo, Bugg, Dickey, Meza and the United States take on Jordyn Huitema and Canada today, Wednesday, July 2 at 4:30 p.m. PT. Tune in to the match on TNT, truTV & Max and Universo & Peacock in Spanish and on the radio via Westwood One Sports.

The U.S. women's national team is back in action and will crank up the heat as they close out the summer window against Canada on Wednesday. The Stars and Stripes will host their regional rival at Audi Field in Washington, D.C., and the aim for a three-game sweep of their opponents this window. 

The USWNT are coming off a pair of blowout wins against Ireland, where they outscored the Girls in Green 8-0. Head coach Emma Hayes rolled with two entirely different starting lineups for the matches, but the biggest test of the window are Canada, a long-time Concacaf rival, in the final match of the three-game summer series for the national team till October. 

The coaching staff will likely pluck from more rested players to go against Canada, including defender Naomi Girma and midfielder Rose Lavelle. Missing from the roster are defenders Gisele Thompson and Kerry Abello, who have left training camps following injuries. 

With the next international window not till October, Hayes and her staff are utilizing this as an opportunity for final player evaluations before narrowing down the player pool moving forward. The intention is to step into the next phase of planning for the upcoming 2027-28 cycle. 

The two sides have a long history against each other, but the USWNT have 53 wins against their continental rivals in 66 previous meetings, and they last squared off during the 2024 SheBelieves Cup. The game ended 2-2 in regulation with goals by USWNT's Sophia Wilson and Canada's Adrianna Leon, but needed penalties to determine a winner. The shootout was high drama, with former goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher making a stop and then converting a penalty kick, and the USWNT won 5-4 on penalties 

Hayes has been clear about a timeline in squad processes in the build-up to the 2027-28 cycle. The expanded player pool over the last six months will likely be narrowed following the match against Canada, a team that Hayes considers a top squad, prime to challenge many of the USWNT's more untested players.

""I look at the Brazil games. I look at the Japan games, for example, tier one, opponents, tier A opponents, I think Canada are in that category. I am curious how much we have learned from playing a tier one opponent ... I think we have an opportunity to show how much we've closed the gap on the details, and not just six or seven senior players. I mean, more numbers being able to do that,"" Hayes said.

The manager and her staff are also focusing on more tactile and technical areas for the group moving forward. She noted how dangerous the team looked against Ireland, and that four goals is an admirable accomplishment, but that the data presented showed that there could've been even more. She and the coaching staff will evaluate how successful players are in decision-making, executing game plans, and more against Canada.

""Are we getting into the right areas? Yes. Are we taking the right decision when we're in the right areas sometimes, are we executing at the top level in the right situations? Still indifferent for me. I still feel there is another level to close the gap for the volume of opportunities we get and converting them,"" she said.

""Movement is important in the game to disrupt an opponent, but you have to maintain structures to minimize the impact the opponent can have in the opposite direction. And Canada are very good in their transitions, and if you give them too much transition space, they have pace to hurt you. So I think we need to get those details right, but this is really about improving all the things I've just previously mentioned, but those are one or two that I think can be next steps.""

Head coach Casey Stoney named a 23-player roster for a pair of summer friendlies against Costa Rica and the USWNT. The manager views the games in a similar lens to Hayes, as a measuring stick for how the squad can fair against top competition. 

""This window is an important step forward for our group as we continue building toward our goals,"" she said in a statement. ""We step up to a world-class challenge against the world's top-ranked team, the USA, which is exactly where we want to be.""

It'll be the first time Stoney is on the sidelines with Canada against a top regional rival, but several players on the roster have extensive experience facing the Stars and Stripes. Stoney is still in the early stages with the squad, and the match comes at the midway point of the calendar year after she was appointed head coach in January.

""I think, first probably five months, really have been about exploring, about getting to know the players, getting to know the staff, understanding the skill sets of what we've got available, making sure the team plays the strengths of the players, rather than getting the players to adapt to something that we want to do,"" she said last month.

""I've got to be honest, the first two camps, at least, has been about building trust in coaching and the technical team. I think the players lost trust over the last year, which is absolutely understandable. I'm coming in as a foreign person into a national team that, you know, I genuinely have a desire to do well for. It's a privilege and an honor to represent this team. And what I've gotten to know is there's some incredible people, some incredible talent, and if we can, just fine-tune things we can give the players the right tools to be able to be successful, then we can go up a gear.""

USWNT: Mandy McGlynn, Avery Patterson, Emily Sonnett, Naomi Girma, Lily Reale, Sam Coffey, Rose Lavelle, Ally Sentnor, Michelle Cooper, Alyssa Thompson

Canada: Kalien Sheridan, Ashley Lawrence, Jade Rose, Vanessa Giles, Gabrielle Carle, Julia Grosso, Jesse Flemming, Simi Awujo, Marie-Yasmine Alidou, Janine Sonis, Evelyne Viens

To be frank, this one has the feeling of a stalemate with both coaching staffs eager to use the match as an inflection point for both programs. But draws are no fun in a rivalry, so here's hoping the newer faces to the rivalry get out there and make a game of it. Pick: USWNT 2, Canada 1

Summertime, and the living is easy; players are jumpin' and the goal count is high. The top-ranked women's soccer team in the world continues its round of exhibitions with a Canadian friendly in the U.S. capital. The U.S. women's national team has not allowed a goal across its last four outings.

The Americans have won by a 4-0 final score in three straight friendlies. Last week, they put a combined 8-0 hurting on the Republic of Ireland. Dynamic forward Alyssa Thompson found the back of the net in both matches, while Rose Lavelle took a bow in her first USWNT showing since ankle surgery:

Rose's 25th career international goal! 🌹#USWNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/uqsGcyE9Tk

— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) June 27, 2025



Head coach Emma Hayes said that she'd use the summer to test new call-ups and grant breathers to her players in European leagues. Hayes completely scrambled the starting lineup between the Ireland friendlies, and will all but certainly try more configurations in D.C.

The former Chelsea manager has prioritized the U.S. youth pipeline in her nascent tenure — after Sunday's action in Cincinnati, her first 24 matches at the helm have yielded 24 debut caps. Izzy Rodriguez, a fullback for the NWSL's Kansas City Current, scored in her very first USWNT look on Sunday.

In 66 total matches, the Americans have an absurd plus-147 goal differential versus Canada. This year's Canadian crew is led by goalkeeper Kailen Sheridan, a standout stopper with the San Diego Wave. Her domestic teammate Adriana Leon plays forward and leads the active roster with 44 international goals. Jessie Fleming is Canada's captain; she was forever enshrined in the country's sports history after her gold medal goal in 2020. Fleming also played under Hayes with Chelsea from 2020-24.

2002: “Mia Hamm chipped a shot over goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc 3 minutes 34 seconds into overtime to lift the United States to a 2-1 victory over Canada in the Concacaf Women's Gold Cup championship game last night in Pasadena, Calif. Hamm, who has 136 national team goals and ranks as the top scorer in women's international soccer, leaped in joy when her kick floated over the charging LeBlanc and into the net. A beaming Hamm then sprinted to the right corner and slid into the flag, with her teammates rushing over to pile on.”

2008: “Angela Hucles scored the game's only goal in second-half injury time as the United States women's national team defeated Canada, 1-0, to win the Peace Queen Cup on Saturday in Suwon, South Korea. Hucles, a midfielder, won the golden ball as the tournament's most valuable player.”

2012: “The game was more than two hours old. Over the first 122 minutes of the United States women's soccer team's Olympic semifinal with Canada, the Americans had been shocked by three goals from their opponent's best player, boosted by three separate rallies to tie the score, and helped by a referee's call so unusual even their own players admitted they had never seen it before. But now it was the 123rd minute — and most likely the last minute of extra time in overtime — and one final hopeful cross was floating into the area in front of the Canadian goal. Suddenly, a pink headband rose high in the air and Alex Morgan, the speedy American star forward, used her head to send the ball on a perfect arc, just over the goalkeeper's hand and just under the crossbar, for a 4-3 victory. Old Trafford, the venerable stadium here, exploded for one final time on a chilly English night as the United States prevailed.”

It is the U.S. men's national team's turn to take center stage during the country's busy summer of soccer on Wednesday, when they face Guatemala in the Concacaf Gold Cup semifinals. History – and the odds – favor Mauricio Pochettino's side but as surprises and upsets continue to define this edition of the Gold Cup, Wednesday's match in St. Louis also provides the USMNT to make a real statement.

The USMNT reached the semifinals the hard way with a penalty shootout win over Costa Rica on Sunday in the quarterfinals, a game of trials and tribulations that also arguably serves as the first gutsy, meaningful win of Pochettino's tenure with the national team. He has handed the task of winning the USMNT's first Gold Cup in four years to a group of inexperienced players, several of whom are starting to make a case for themselves – the Bayer Leverkusen-bound Malik Tillman is the standout so far, but on Sunday, goalkeeper Matt Freese, defender Max Arfsten and midfielder Diego Luna also had their moments.

Going into the semifinals, the question facing the USMNT is whether they can translate Sunday's positives into genuine upward momentum and provide reasons for optimism after a year of disappointing performances and results. That includes a focus on the individual players, all of whom are competing to earn a spot amongst the regulars once that version of the team reconvenes later this year, all with an eye on next year's World Cup roster.

Meanwhile in Washington, D.C., the U.S. women's national team are undergoing a similar period of experimentation as they take on Canada, though the stakes are different. Head coach Emma Hayes has earmarked this friendly as the end of her vast project to explore the USWNT's wider player pool, giving a group of young players one last chance to impress as Hayes spends the next two years building chemistry in time for the Women's World Cup. The head coach will not be short on impressive options in a variety of positions, though the chance to succeed Alyssa Naeher as the USWNT's first choice in goal is something to keep an eye on – Mandy McGlynn and Claudia Dickey each started games in the last week against Ireland, while Angelina Anderson rounds out the rostered goalkeepers for this camp.

The summer of major international tournaments kicks into high gear on Wednesday with the start of the Women's Euros, which is expected to be the latest showcase for the growth of women's soccer in the region. Look no further than the competitive group of teams that have a realistic shot at the title – reigning world champions Spain are in the mix to win the competition for the first time and build a dynastic legacy two years after lifting the Women's World Cup, while a resurgent Germany look to build upon their bronze medal run at last year's Olympics. Sandra Herrera, though, argues this is England's title to lose, placing them atop her pre-tournament power rankings.

The tournament will be just as much of a spotlight for Europe's top teams as it will be for the continent's best players, including many of the usual suspects as well as those ready for a breakout performance. That's especially true for Spain, who still boast Ballon d'Or winner Aitana Bonmati, though her availability to start the tournament is still a question after a battle with meningitis. Spain still pack plenty of punch when it comes to goalscorers, who should be able to operate just fine at the start even without Bonmati pulling the strings behind them – the in-form, NWSL-based Esther Gonzalez is in the mix, while rising talent Claudia Pina is the pick to become the game's next big star with a statement-making showing in Switzerland.

Club World Cup's last eight confirmed

While there's plenty of action in Switzerland and the U.S., the Club World Cup will take the next few days off after locking in its quarterfinalists. Real Madrid joined the last eight on Tuesday with a 1-0 win over Juventus and will play Borussia Dortmund in a rematch of the 2024 UEFA Champions League final, with the German side beating Monterrey 2-1 later that day. The much-awaited battle of the Bellingham brothers will have to wait for another day, though – Dortmund's Jobe will be suspended for Saturday's quarterfinal, meaning Real Madrid's Jude will be the only Bellingham available for selection.

The biggest surprises of the competition so far, though, came on Monday. First was Fluminense's 2-0 win over Inter in an upset that was just waiting to happen – the victors are one of two Brazilian sides remaining at the Club World Cup, which has been a showcase for teams from the country, while Inter have been in middling form for months now. Nothing was quite as surprising as Al-Hilal's 4-3 win over Manchester City, defeating the English side in extra time after a thrilling match. City were the dominant side with 30 shots but their sloppiness in the back cost them, with Al-Hilal now the only team from outside Europe and South America left in the competition.

Tennessee soccer forward Reese Mattern was called up to the U.S. U-19 Women's National Team domestic training camp, U.S. Soccer communications announced Tuesday.

In March, the U.S. Under-19 Women's National Team announced the call-up of Tennessee's star forward for a training camp. Mattern will join 20 other collegiate standouts and three professionals from across the country in Fayetteville, Georgia, at the future home of the Arthur M. Blank U.S. Soccer National Training Center for a domestic training camp slated to begin June 24 and run through July 1.

U-19 WNT head coach Carrie Kveton and U-16 GNT head coach Ciara Crinion will be co-head coaches for the camp.

As a freshman the Charlottesville, Virginia native, started all 20 games, finishing second on the team with 32 shots and tying for the team lead with 16 shots on goal.

Mattern's impressive rookie season was rewarded with a 2024 SEC All-Freshman Team selection and a Freshman of the Week honor during the second week of the 2024 season.

The U.S. Men's National Team advanced past Costa Rica 4-3 on penalty kicks in the Concacaf Gold Cup Quarterfinal in a comeback victory Sunday.

Next, the USMNT will face Guatemala in the semifinal at Energizer Park in St. Louis (7 p.m. ET on FS1).

Guatemala entered the tournament as the third-lowest ranked FIFA team. With one upset at a time, the squad now finds itself in the semifinal for the first time since 1996. Guatemala stunned Canada in penalty kicks on Sunday after sneaking its way out of Group C with wins over Jamaica and Guadeloupe.

The Americans beat Costa Rica in a dramatic penalty shootout, much like Guatemala did in its knockout match at U.S. Bank Stadium. U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese made three saves in the shootout to send the USA through to the next round, and forward Damion Downs netted the final kick to secure the victory.

Before the quarterfinal, the United States came out of Group D unscathed, beating Trinadad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti. The Stars and Stripes finished the group stage with nine points while only conceding one goal.

The USA and Guatemala have met 27 times in history; the USMNT holds a winning record of 16-5-6. The two countries last met in the Gold Cup more than two decades ago in the 2007 group stage. The United States won that match 1-0.

It's been almost 10 years since the USMNT competed against Guatemala in a set of World Cup Qualifiers in 2016. None of the players on the current roster played in those matchups.

The USMNT has advanced to the semifinals in 17 of 18 total Gold Cups and will have a chance to reach its 11th title match.

After a quarterfinals scare against Costa Rica, the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) is back in the Concacaf Gold Cup semifinals.

USMNT advanced 4-3 on penalties to avoid falling victim to a massive upset against Costa Rica this past Sunday night at U.S. Bank Stadium.

Up next for USMNT is Guatemala, who's made it to the semifinals later for the first time in 29 years after a stunning upset over Canada 6-5 on penalties.

This marks the first meeting between these two countries in almost a decade, with the last head-to-head matchup coming all the way back in 2016, when USMNT defeated Guatemala 4-0 in FIFA World Cup Qualifying nine years ago.

The winner of this match will advance to the championship game and awaits the winner of Mexico vs. Honduras, which kicks off at 10 p.m. following the conclusion of USMNT-Guatemala.

The United States has owned this matchup in recent history, winning four of five matches and outscored Guatemala 17-3 in the process.

United States goalkeeper Matthew Freese (25) stops a shot during the second half of a CONCACAF Gold Cup quarterfinals match against Costa Rica on Sunday, June 29, 2025, in Minneapolis.

The two games the U.S. men's national team played leading up to the CONCACAF Gold Cup were ominous, first a 2-1 loss to Turkey and then a 4-0 thumping by Switzerland that did not inspire much confidence. For the national team, it was a seldom-seen four-game losing streak, with all four losses at home.

But the Gold Cup, the regional championship, has gone much better, and even if some of the team's better players aren't on hand, new faces have emerged, new candidates for spots on the team have made their cases.

The next test for the national team comes Wednesday night at sold-out Energizer Park, when the Americans face Guatemala in the semifinals of the Gold Cup, the highest-stakes U.S. game to be played in St. Louis in more than 30 years. The U.S. advanced past Costa Rica in a dramatic penalty-kick shootout on Sunday.

With a win over the decidedly underdog Guatemala team, the Americans would face the winner of another David vs. Goliath match, Mexico vs. Honduras, which will also meet Wednesday in Santa Clara, California.

“It's the togetherness that we've created and fostered,” said Tim Ream, the veteran center back and captain of the U.S. team who played at St. Dominic High and St. Louis University. “I think with the two friendlies that we had, it could have been a not-great situation going into the Gold Cup, and to be honest, I think everybody used it as a learning experience and a moment to understand what it would take to come together and what it would take to play in the tournament, survive and continue to move on. And I sit back and look at these guys and in the game, in the changing room, at meals and just the bonds that are being created in such a short amount of time. I don't think you can speak about it enough, and it's something that maybe not necessarily we've had enough of in the past, and to see guys just getting along and having fun is so good to see.

“And I said it after the game the other day to a few of the guys, watching them work for each other in moments, in heated moments, in moments like Malik (Tillman) having their guy come into his face and watching everybody rush in. It's such a, it may sound weird, but that's an enjoyable thing to see, because I think it shows that OK, finally, we're a group of guys that we're going to push back. You're not going to push us around. And we have the personalities in here, and to see them all jelling together, that's been nice to see.”

Even if the quarterfinal with Costa Rica that got the U.S. to St. Louis goes into the books as a tie, it was a significant performance for the Americans. The U.S. conceded an early penalty kick and trailed 1-0. Tillman missed a PK that would have tied the game, then the U.S. got goals from Diego Luna and Max Arfsten to take the lead, only for Costa Rica to tie the game in 71st minute. The game then went to penalty kicks, where U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese, making a solid push for the top goalkeeper spot that has belonged for some time to Matt Turner, made three saves as the U.S. advanced.

“I think when you look back on our performance, you'll see a really resilient mentality,” midfielder Tyler Adams said. “Max Arfsten, to come out and give up a penalty and then come back and have an assist and a goal is a great mentality and shows the team spirit. Malik Tillman, after getting fouled pretty hard, steps and takes the penalty and misses but still makes amazing plays in the game, and obviously Matt Freese, unbelievable in the penalty shootout. So many guys with valuable experience throughout that game and it sets us up for success in the future.”

The United States has reached the final of the tournament in 12 of its 17 editions to date, so this is familiar territory for them but not so much for Guatemala. This is only the second time Guatemala has gotten this far, the other being in 1996. Guatemala has never reached the final. Guatemala finished second in its group to Panama and then tied Canada and advanced on penalty kicks in its quarterfinal. Guatemala, ranked No. 106 in the world by FIFA (the U.S. is 16th), has only one win over the United States in its past 23 meetings, a 2-0 win in a World Cup qualifier in 2016 in Guatemala City.

But this year's Gold Cup has seen some upsets. In addition to Guatemala eliminating Canada, on the other side of the bracket, Honduras beat Panama on PKs. (If the game is tied after regulation Wednesday, it will go straight to penalty kicks with no overtime.) Canada and Panama had both won their groups and were considered to be the teams looking the best in group play.

“It's going to be very difficult,” said U.S. coach Maurico Pochettino. “They're very good, very well-organized, very great coach, very good players. I see this as a big challenge for us.”

There are two interesting names on the Guatemala roster. Rubio Rubin played seven games with the U.S. national team but also was eligible to play for Mexico and Guatemala and, after dropping off the U.S. radar, used a one-time international switch to play for Guatemala. Aaron Herrera played with the U.S. under-20 and under-23 teams and one game with the full national team before switching to Guatemala.

City SC beat writer Tom Timmermann and co-host Beth O'Malley reflect on City SC's steadily climbing goals-allowed totals, which are lessening the benefits of the team's improved offense.

The USMNT beat Costa Rica in one penalty shootout, just hours after Guatemala did the same to eliminate Canada, setting up an unlikely semifinal showdown in the semifinals of the 2025 CONCACAF Gold Cup on Wednesday (7 pm ET).

Mauricio Pochettino's side erased an early deficit with goals two minutes before and after halftime, but the Ticos hit back in the 71st minute and took the Yanks to spot kicks. Goalkeeper Matt Freese wound up the hero of the day after saving three of six attempts from 12 yards. Even without the likes of Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Folarin Balogun and Yunus Musah, the Americans are in the semifinals of the Gold Cup for the 13th straight tournament.

Two USMNT players, Malik Tillman and Patrick Agyemang, felt slightly worse for wear when they awoke on Monday after throwing themselves into 34 duels (18 won) and suffering eight fouls between them. Tillman took six of those fouls and at looked like he might have to come off at multiple points during the second half, only to go the full 90 and redeem himself in the penalty shootout after he hit the post from the spot in the 37th minute. Tillman has been a revelation at this tournament (3 goals, 1 assist) after finishing the Eredivisie season with a bang (5 goals, 1 assist in eight games upon returning from an ankle injury. Next stop: Bayer Leverkusen? And then, World Cup starting XI for the USMNT? We shall see, sooner rather than later.

Guatemala found themselves a goal down midway through the first half as well, and their fortunes also changed right before halftime when Jacob Shaffelburg was shown his second yellow card and sent off. Los Chapines equalized through former United States international Rubio Rubin, who switched his international allegiance in 2022 to represent his mother's homeland. Rubio has scored 13 goals in 34 appearances. 

At this point of the tournament, Pochettino's team just about picks itself with promising performers (Tillman, Agyemang and Diego Luna) becoming breakout stars across the front line. As their chemistry grows, so will their output. USMNT 3-1 Guatemala.

Herculez Gomez takes a look at what the USMNT still has to improve on after narrowly beating Costa Rica on penalties in the Gold Cup. (1:59)

Alejandro Zendejas is arguably the most important player for the biggest team in North American soccer.

Since arriving to Mexico City giants Club América in 2022, the FC Dallas academy product has been a revelation. His efforts have helped cement three Liga MX titles with Las Águilas, and when including all competitions, that trophy haul then extends to five.

Selected as a member of the Best XI for the Concacaf Champions Cup in 2024 and Player of the Month earlier this year in Liga MX -- a league whose top teams are the powerhouses of the continent -- the 27-year-old native of El Paso, Texas, has been nothing short of exceptional.

Zendejas' reward? Watching the U.S. men's national team from afar as they take part in this summer's Gold Cup.

When head coach Mauricio Pochettino revealed his MLS-heavy roster shorn of marquee attacking names such as Christian Pulisic, Timothy Weah and Giovanni Reyna, Zendejas seemed perfectly suited to guide the backup squad that didn't have many key players. Leaving the winger out ensured zero representation for Liga MX, a league that was once a vital source of talent for the USMNT.

Twelve years ago, at the 2013 Gold Cup, the U.S. had six players from Mexico's first division. A handful of players were also added in the two following Gold Cup tournaments, as well as at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.

But that fútbol influence is now diminishing.

Why is a game-changing América starter like Zendejas still left out? And with no Liga MX player currently in the picture, when so many prominent figures are missing at the Gold Cup, what has happened to the Liga MX-USMNT connection?

""He's going to play on June 1 [with América] against [LAFC] to see if he qualifies for the Club World Cup, so he's a player where there was a risk to consider him,"" Pochettino told members of the media when asked why Zendejas wasn't included in a USMNT training camp ahead of the Gold Cup.

""We considered him, but the risk was that if they won that match, they would be the ones who would be available to play [at the Club World Cup].""

América went on to lose that Club World Cup play-in match, thereby leaving a window of time for Zendejas to be chosen by Pochettino, who then didn't select him. Despite Pochettino stating that the Texan was ""considered,"" it's worth noting that the América player wasn't called up to the 23-man Concacaf Nations League roster in March.

It becomes even more of a head-scratching decision when considering the lack of wingers at Pochettino's disposal for the 4-2-3-1 lineup he's preferred in this tournament. Malik Tillman, Brenden Aaronson, Quinn Sullivan and Jack McGlynn all have played in wide attacking roles this summer -- Tillman, Aaronson and Sullivan historically have operated more centrally, while McGlynn is a traditional central midfielder.

""It sucks, man. I've watched Zendejas,"" Sebastian Saucedo, who has had runs in both Liga MX and MLS while representing the U.S. youth national team, said to ESPN. ""You know how big América is in Mexico, you know what I mean? For him to perform like that ... I don't know, I think that Zendejas deserves more.""

Alejandro Guido, a former player in both Liga MX and MLS who was called up to the USMNT in 2018 while with Tijuana, was also perplexed by Zendejas' omission.

""He's playing for if not the biggest club in North America and doing a great job,"" said the now FC Cincinnati 2 assistant coach. ""Being a foreign player, winning titles. I mean, I just don't know another player that's been doing that as consistently in MLS.""

One possible reason for Zendejas' absence? His USMNT performances haven't mirrored his brilliant form in Mexico.

Last season, Zendejas provided an impressive tally of 22 goal contributions (goals plus assists) across 3,063 minutes of play, one every 139.2 minutes. In a much smaller sample size for the USMNT, that production drops to two goal contributions across a total of 511 minutes since his 2023 debut, one every 255.5 minutes.

""I'm a big believer in Zendejas and his level in Liga MX, but certainly when we're talking about the U.S. men's national team, he's not exactly showered himself in glory,"" said Herculez Gomez, an ESPN analyst and former USMNT striker that played in both MLS and Liga MX. ""Do I think he's done enough to merit call-ups? Absolutely. Do I think it's a mistake if they leave him off? I don't know ... He's one of those players that when he's played for the national team, you've seen glimpses, but he's never really had that type of performance where you could say, 'This is why he needs to be here.'""

Aside from Zendejas, why haven't other U.S.-eligible players stepped up from Liga MX? That may simply be due to the current numbers.

Of the 16 American players in Liga MX in 2024-25, only 22-year-old FC Juarez full back Ralph Orquin (now back at América after his loan spell with Juarez) was as frequent of a starter for his club side as Zendejas. After those two names, the U.S. list then ranges from rotational options to scarce minutes. Coupled with a growing MLS and more players landing in Europe, it's perhaps not a shock that Liga MX's USMNT influence is at a low point.

Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)

""[Orquin] should be given an opportunity, you see a lot of new MLS guys getting an opportunity,"" Saucedo said. ""These guys should get one too, but there is a lack of Mexican-Americans in Mexico that used to play at a top level like Joe [Corona], like Ventura [Alvarado].""

Guido has seen firsthand how the gap between Liga MX and MLS isn't as great as it once was. Before going pro across the border with Tijuana in 2012, the San Diegan at first considered signing with the Colorado Rapids before ultimately deciding that Liga MX would be better for his career.

""I could just tell the level wasn't the same as in Mexico,"" said the FC Cincy 2 assistant. But now? ""It's a lot different, man. It's a lot better, and yes, I would be considering if I was starting [my career today] to play in the U.S.""

As seen in the aforementioned lack of minutes for many U.S. players in Mexico, it's difficult to make your mark in a Liga MX whose split seasons emphasizes short-term goals at the expense of long-term development. While that condensed format leads to unpredictable and entertaining soccer, it also means that many managers aren't willing to take chances on the younger generation when needing to find success in such limited timeframes.

""You know the landscape in Liga MX, young players don't get much opportunity,"" Gomez said. ""Liga MX doesn't really prioritize their youth.""

Alianza, the largest amateur grassroots soccer program in the United States for Latinos, has also seen a developing trend with MLS being able to provide more pathways in players' own backyards.

For years, the program was dominated by Liga MX scouts who would offer pathways for budding U.S. stars through the Mexican league. That's changing.

""We love all the scouts from Liga MX and they're always big supporters and they continue to show up to our events, but there has definitely been a shift with more and more MLS teams coming to our events,"" Daina Lecuona, a director at Alianza, said to ESPN. ""There's a lot of these players that were slipping through the cracks previously that were landing up in Liga MX teams, but now that [MLS] academies are getting more and more well funded ... now you have more and more pumping funding into the academy system, so they're sending scouts or being able to canvas a lot wider of an area.

On ""The Football Reporters"" podcast, Jeff Carlisle gauges how USMNT fans are feeling about Mauricio Pochettino's time in charge of the team.

""The pathway in the U.S. is such a great thing right now, and it wasn't the case 10 to 15 years ago.""

For now, at the Gold Cup, that pathway seems to be working for the USMNT.

With plenty of MLS options stepping up, Pochettino and his men earned three consecutive victories in the group stage and recently defeated Costa Rica on penalties in a dramatic quarterfinal clash. Although they've battled through some close calls, few could complain about a goal differential of +7 through 360 minutes of play.

All that said, the stakes and competition will be much higher in the latter stages of the knockouts for a group of players that still has plenty to prove. For many of these MLS-based options, the intensity and expectations might be something they've never experienced before in a league that's growing, but still developing.

In Liga MX, meanwhile, there are certain intangibles that can be gleaned by a decisive attacker like Zendejas, who has shined in a league that not only has a significant amount of history but also an ongoing domination of the region with 19 of the last 20 Concacaf club titles. And when things inevitably become difficult for Pochettino's men in the Gold Cup's latter stages, Zendejas' experience may have proven invaluable.

""Playing in the [Estadio] Azteca against Cruz Azul is very different from playing in MLS, there's still that component that you can't find in MLS,"" Guido said. ""The way you mature, the way you adapt to a different culture, it's just going there and thinking exclusively about soccer and leaving your family to pursue your dream ... it's definitely more challenging and I do agree that it brings a different sense of maturity to a player.""

Saucedo agreed, and despite no current spot for a Liga MX player in the USMNT, the winger still hopes to see others following in his and Zendejas' footsteps.

""The way I saw it was, I'm gonna go and sacrifice, going away from home, going and seeing what it's like to play at one of the biggest clubs in Mexico ... everything that I experienced, I soaked it in,"" he said. ""I wish I could see more kids sacrifice ... giving it a try.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

For the second time this FIFA Club World Cup, Xabi Alonso benched Rodrygo in a must-win game for Real Madrid.

Rodrygo's future at Real Madrid has been uncertain ever since Carlo Ancelotti overlooked the winger in a title-deciding El Clásico. The Brazilian logged zero minutes against Barcelona and then missed out on Los Blancos' final league matches of the season due to fitness concerns.

The arrival of Alonso was supposed to be a fresh start for Rodrygo after his poor 2024–25 campaign in which he found the back of the net just once in his final 22 appearances. It looked like the 24-year-old was a part of his new manager's plans when he got the nod against Al Hilal in Real Madrid's Club World Cup opener.

Except Los Blancos went on to only collect a point from the disappointing 1–1 draw. Rodrygo, despite assisting Real Madrid's lone goal, was pulled in the 65th minute and then benched against Pachuca. He then only featured for 23 minutes in Real Madrid's 3–0 victory over RB Salzburg to close out the group stage.

Things got even more bleak for Rodrygo when he was once again left out Alonso's XI for Real Madrid's round of 16 match against Juventus. Even when Los Blancos were desperate for an insurance goal in the latter stages of the game, the Brazil international was kept on the bench.

Rodrygo has now played just 23 minutes in Real Madrid's last three matches, and 88 overall in the Club World Cup. The likes of Brahim Díaz and Dani Ceballos have more appearances than the winger in the United States this summer, a loud statement from Alonso.

Although the new Real Madrid boss insisted Rodrygo has “a big role to play” in the tournament, he is putting his trust in just Vinícius Júnior and now a healthy Kylian Mbappé up top, while Trent Alexander-Arnold occupies much of the right wing. 

The lack of minutes does nothing but fuel the transfer rumors surrounding Rodrygo. The Brazilian has been linked with several Premier League clubs this summer, including Arsenal and Chelsea, and could soon find himself playing in the English top-flight should Alonso continue relegating him to the bench.

The Gunners, in particular, have their sights set on Rodrygo. The two-time Champions League winner would finally be able to play on his preferred left wing with a move to north London, providing a solution to Arsenal's attacking woes from this last season. Still, Mikel Arteta's side will likely have difficulty financing such a deal.

All eyes will be on Rodrygo when Real Madrid take on Borussia Dortmund in the Club World Cup quarterfinals.

Inter Milan's Denzel Dumfries feeling the heat at the Club World Cup in America

The Club World Cup is devaluing football because players cannot perform properly, according to Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Maheta Molango. 

High temperatures have impacted players, while low crowds have also been a factor in Fifa's extended competition in America.

Ten Juventus players asked to be substituted during their 1-0 defeat by Real Madrid, with the last-16 game in Miami on Tuesday played in temperatures reaching 30C and humidity of 70%.

Borussia Dortmund's substitutes also spent the first half of their game against  Mamelodi Sundowns last month watching from the dressing room because of the heat. 

Six matches have had to be suspended because of thunderstorms, including a two-hour delay in Chelsea's last-16 win over Benfica.

It means, less than a year before the start of the World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico, Molango is worried by how the competition is impacting the players and the sport.

""We're devaluing the product and it's a shame because if I'm a US fan and that's my first exposure to soccer, that's not good,"" he said.

""We need to be mindful we're competing with other sports and they're very good at entertainment. Then it becomes a very poor comparison.

""We've reached a stage where the quality is dropping, because there's no way you can have a good game if you play at 4pm in Mexico. 

""It's impossible, because the players themselves say to you 'I cannot. I need to manage my efforts"" - which would mean what you see on the pitch is not good, the audiences drop, it's as simple as that. This is all about money.

""My hope is that people now, even from a pure business perspective, will see that it does not make sense.""

Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp called the competition ""the worst idea ever implemented in football"", and days before the tournament, global players' union Fifpro released a report saying players should be allowed at least a four-week off-season break.

""It's this feeling of accumulation of competitions that just do not talk to each other and create a calendar that is just nonsensical,"" added Molango. 

""Let's see what happens in October, November [to players] - that's when you're going to start seeing because you pay the price. This Club World Cup gives us a chance to start looking at the bigger picture."" 

Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola understood Klopp's position, but felt competing in the Club World Cup was the price of success. 

""Would I love to have two months to prepare for next season? Yes. Would I love to be refreshed for next season? Yes. But it is what it is,"" he said, before City were knocked out by Al Hilal on Tuesday.

Fifa has also defended itself with senior sources from the governing body telling BBC Sport last month the protection of player welfare has been at the core of decision-making, pointing to initiatives such as additional substitutes and permanent concussion subs.

Suggestions the competition has contributed to further congestion in the fixture calendar were firmly dismissed, with a source saying it was ""not caused by the Club World Cup"".

It was pointed out a maximum of seven Club World Cup games will be played by two teams every four years, with the slot for the competition replacing the one previously used for the Fifa Confederations Cup.

The extended competition was a main trigger for a joint legal action last year by the PFA, along with the French and Italian players' unions, against Fifa over the ""overloaded and unworkable"" football calendar. A hearing on that is likely to be held early next year. 

It came before the top European leagues and players' union Fifpro filed a legal complaint against Fifa with the European Commission over what it claims is an ""abuse of dominance"" by world football's governing body.

""This is much more of a political one. It's fair to say we are pretty confident the Commission will show an interest in probably taking the case, which is unusual,"" Molango added.

""Quite a few kind of sports cases are brought in front of the Commission and normally they don't get involved in those type of cases. In this instance, based on what we've seen so far, we're pretty confident.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Joao Pedro transfer: Chelsea complete signing of Brazil forward from Brighton","https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/cg75j2118e3o","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:00:34 GMT","

Joao Pedro has been playing in England since joining Watford from Fluminense in 2020

Joao Pedro has become the 18th forward to sign for Chelsea in just over three years under their current owners.

He joins from Brighton in a deal worth £60m, taking their total spending on attackers in that period to £560m. 

And the 23-year-old could go straight in to the squad for Chelsea's Club World Cup quarter-final with Palmeiras on Saturday in Philadelphia.

Typically for a Blues signing, Joao Pedro has signed a long contract - eight years - although the club can no longer spread the cost of his transfer over the length of the deal after that loophole was closed by the Premier League.

The Fluminense youth product scored 30 goals in 70 games for Brighton after joining from Watford in 2023 for just under £30m, which at the time was a club record fee.

""Everyone knows this is a big club with a great history,"" he said. ""They had brilliant players in the past and have brilliant players now, so I am excited to join and you know when you are a Chelsea player you must think one thing - win.""

Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler said it was a ""good move for all parties"".

""It's an excellent deal for the club, and a good return on a significant investment in an area of the pitch where we have a lot of competition and are already well served in terms of our attacking talent,"" he added.

""It's also an exciting move for Joao - it gives him the opportunity to play Champions League football this coming season, and he will of course be keen to cement his position in the Brazil team before the World Cup next summer.""

Chelsea's spending looks set to rise further. They have had a £55m bid for English winger Jamie Gittens, 20, accepted by Borussia Dortmund.

What might Pedro offer for Chelsea?

Once Chelsea's move for Gittens goes through, they will have added Gittens, Joao Pedro and Liam Delap to an already strong attack featuring Cole Palmer, Nicolas Jackson, Pedro Neto, Noni Madueke, Christopher Nkunku, Marc Guiu and Tyrique George.

Estevao Willian is also joining the club after the Club World Cup as he prepares to face Chelsea with Palmeiras on Sunday.

It might feel as though Chelsea are almost doing deals just for the sake of it, but there is a specific plan.

The signing of Joao Pedro is expected to add competition for the number nine and 10 positions, with Nkunku expected to leave.

Gittens will come in as a left winger and replace Jadon Sancho after his loan spell from Manchester United was not made permanent. It's also worth noting Mykhailo Mudryk remains provisionally suspended for a failed drugs test.

Delap comes in to add competition for Jackson in the number nine position, with Chelsea having looked short up front last season.

Chelsea are not forcing any of the players in their Club World Cup squad out but could accept substantial offers for Madueke or Jackson, who are not deemed untouchable like Palmer is at Stamford Bridge.

It's worth noting Chelsea have eight attackers for four forward positions, but we haven't mentioned the likes of midfielders Enzo Fernandez and Andrey Santos, who often play as number 10s as well.

The prospect of loaning out Guiu and George, both 19, remains open. They played a substantial part in last season's Conference League campaign, but Chelsea need to strengthen the squad now they are back in the Champions League.

The likes of exiled attackers Raheem Sterling, Joao Felix and Armando Broja remain at the club and are available for sale.

Chelsea's deal for Joao Pedro takes their spending on initial transfer fees to £1.32bn in seven transfer windows, including this one, under their current ownership.

The expected arrival of Gittens would mean the club's outlay surpasses £1.5bn in three years once you include potential add-ons and Joao Felix's loan fee. Even taking into account sales, their net spend is £1.07bn.

Chelsea's gross and net spends were the most in the Premier League in their first three transfer windows under the current owners. 

The club have been quiet in the past two winters but spent the most again last summer – though their net spend was only the seventh highest – and are on course to be the Premier League's biggest spenders once more ahead of the new season.

More than £560m, or 43%, of Chelsea's spending on guaranteed fees has been on 18 attacking players. Thirteen of those have made their debut for the Blues, with mixed returns so far.

By buying younger players on lower wages and spreading the payments over long-term contracts, Chelsea's strategy is to unearth new stars and sell on unwanted talent for a profit.

But their ability to further bolster their ranks may be determined by the Premier League's response to the sale of their women's team to parent company BlueCo for £198.7m - a process that put the wider business into profit.

This move gave them ""headroom"" under the Premier League spending rules, while Chelsea's finances are also being boosted by playing in next season's Champions League and the Club World Cup run.



Chelsea's sale of their women's team to themselves - what does it mean?

Edu Rubio, former West Ham, Crystal Palace and Wolves coach:

Some may wonder 'why this signing?' but for me, Joao Pedro is exactly what Chelsea need. He also falls into the category of young player with potential, to bring more revenue in a future sale, of course; but he is Premier League tested and proven, he is not a gamble.

He can come short, hold the ball and link up play to help the team with their attacks. He can offer Liam Delap space for forward runs, which will stretch the opposition and offer Chelsea more pockets and options in the final third.

Joao offers more of a much-needed presence in that final build-up than Nicolas Jackson. His ideal position is striker but he can also play as a false nine and offers Enzo Maresca more options.

His work off the ball and physicality will also support the style and DNA that Maresca is looking to build on in his second year at the helm. Joao's stats in penalty kicks, assists and open-play goals are also impressive. He definitely brings a new game dimension to Chelsea.

He has not gone past 11 league goals in a season so there might be a question mark there. Can he become a top player now that he is in a Champions League team?

Chelsea have reached the quarter-finals of the Club World Cup, and will be backing themselves to win the whole thing due to how the tournament has progressed.

After finishing second in their group behind Flamengo, the Blues have been handed the easier side of the draw on paper. Chelsea aimed a dig at the Brazilian side upon their exit from the competition.

Manchester City will no longer be a threat to Chelsea, whilst Thiago Silva helped knock out Champions League finalists Inter Milan with a dominant defensive performance.

The Blues face Palmeiras in the quarter-final, with Enzo Maresca getting his first up-close look at Estevao Willian ahead of his transfer to the club.

With Estevao frustrated at his manager, there will be optimism amongst the Blues that they can progress, which would set up a semi-final tie against Fluminense or Al-Hilal.

Despite a potential final against one of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich or PSG, the Opta Supercomputer is giving out positive results when it comes to Chelsea's chances.

As per The Analyst, the Blues have a 26.8% chance of winning the competition, making them the favourites to win the whole thing.

Maresca has already delivered silverware in his first season at Stamford Bridge in the form of the Conference League, however the Club World Cup being added to it would make for a remarkable 12 months in charge.

Maresca has been forced to utilise most of his outfield players during the competition due to the extreme weather conditions facing Chelsea in the United States.

Therefore he will be delighted that Joao Pedro is set to join the club after his £60m move from Brighton is set to be announced imminently.

Pedro is available for the Club World Cup, whereas Jamie Gittens will have to wait for his debut after featuring in the competition for Borussia Dortmund.

With Maresca a big fan of Pedro, it can be expected that he will give serious consideration to playing the Brazilian despite his limited time with the first team squad.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

German side dispatch Monterrey 2-1 with Guirassy goals

Bellingham booking rules him out of Real Madrid tie

Serhou Guirassy scored two early goals as Borussia Dortmund held on to defeat Monterrey 2-1 on Tuesday night in Atlanta to reach the Fifa Club World Cup quarter-finals. Karim Adeyemi assisted both goals to bring Guirassy's tournament total to three.

Germán Berterame scored his third of the competition early in a much-improved second half for Monterrey that gave their German opponents some nervy moments, including Sergio Ramos's header early in stoppage time that went narrowly wide of the top corner.

Dortmund become the fifth and final European side to reach the last eight, and the second from Germany along with Bayern Munich. They will face Real Madrid on Saturday in East Rutherford.

But there will be no meeting of the Bellingham brothers there after Jobe was booked for a foul on Nelson Deossa, the midfielder's second of the tournament. The 19-year-old's first yellow card came in Dortmund's 1-0 group win over Ulsan HD.

“I think we all saw that he was very disappointed,” Dortmund's manager, Niko Kovac, said. “I think he did not exactly know that the second yellow card is a suspension at half-time. He was a little bit surprised.”

Kovac said there would be more opportunities for the siblings to face each other. “He's young. His brother is also young, so I'm convinced they will face each other, maybe next season in the Champions League, and then the future. The future is for them.”

Jobe, who sealed a €33m (£28m) move to Dortmund from Sunderland last month, was substituted in the 55th minute to avoid any chance of a red card, Kovac said.

Monterrey were the last of five Concacaf entrants eliminated after Inter Miami's 4-0 loss to Paris Saint-Germain.

Berterame cut Monterrey's deficit to 2-1 with a powerful downward header after an initial cross from the left took a fortunate deflection off teammate Erick Aguirre.

Eleven minutes later, Monterrey's Jesus Corona was played in for a one-on-one with the keeper, but he fired what would have been a leveller straight at Gregor Kobel.

Guirassy and Adeyemi combined twice in the opening 24 minutes. In the 14th, Guirassy received a pass on the edge of the 18-yard box with his back to goal and found Adeyemi next to him. Adeyemi's instant return pass played Guirassy into a position for a low finish beyond the outstretched leg of goalkeeper Esteban Andrada.

Ten minutes later, Adeyemi chased a long ball down the right-hand side, held up play and delivered a square pass into the run of Guirassy, who drove home, giving Andrada little chance.

Guirassy could have had a hat-trick before half-time when he fired narrowly wide of the right post after Bellingham's feed. Three minutes later, Andrada's remarkable recovery and save denied him after a cross from Pascal Gross.

The late game drew a crowd of 31,442 at the cavernous Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where the upper deck wasn't needed. But the sweltering US heat wasn't an issue with the roof closed in Atlanta.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Connections: Sports Edition

A frustrated Jobe Bellingham will miss out on a first competitive meeting with brother Jude after being booked in Borussia Dortmund's 2-1 win over Monterrey in their Club World Cup last-16 game.

Earlier in the day, Jude Bellingham helped Real Madrid defeat Juventus 1-0 to set up a potential quarter-final against his brother at MetLife Stadium, New Jersey, on Saturday.

Advertisement

And that fixture looked odds-on when Serhou Guirassy scored twice in the first 24 minutes to put the German side in control, only for Jobe to pick up a needless booking three minutes later. Jobe was booked against Ulsan in the group stage, with two yellow cards in the tournament leading to a one-game ban.

Monterrey pulled one back three minutes into the second half through German Berterame, who had a second ruled out for offside as the Mexican side pinned Dortmund back.

Ultimately, Dortmund held out, meaning there will be no reunion for Sergio Ramos, the Monterrey captain, with Real Madrid, the club he represented 671 times over 16 seasons, with the 39-year-old heading a late chance wide.

The game was also marred by a homophobic chant, with FIFA saying it was aware that some Monterrey supporters had shouted a slur at the opposition goalkeeper during his run-up to take goal kicks. A message was displayed towards the end of the game saying the match may have to be suspended.

Here, The Athletic's Mark Carey, Felipe Cardenas and Oliver Kay break down the key talking points.

Rip up the paper, scrunch it up in a ball, and throw it in the bin. The story of the Bellingham brothers playing a first competitive game against each other at the Club World Cup will not be happening.

Jobe came into the game knowing that brother Jude and Real Madrid were waiting for the winner of this game, but that a yellow card would suspend him for Dortmund's quarter-final clash should they qualify.

After 27 minutes, with Dortmund already 2-0 up, Jobe tracked Monterrey's Nelson Deossa down the line with the Colombian going nowhere, before a needless late foul brought a caution that he could have avoided. The change in his body language was visceral, knowing the consequences of such a split-second decision.

 

Jobe looked crestfallen as he saw referee Facundo Tello following him with a yellow card and it deprives the competition of what would have been a fascinating contest. The frustration remained when he was substituted on 55 minutes.

 

Just over two years younger, Jobe's path to Dortmund has followed in the footsteps of Jude, but they share much of each other's games.

Not only do they operate in similar positions, but it's the gait, the running style, the stature. Jobe's tendency to ghost into the box unmarked has been a hallmark of his older brother's, with the 19-year-old arguably more of a box-to-box profile if you were forced to offer differences between their traits.

A shame for the Bellingham family, of course, but given that the pair will be playing Champions League football next season, you would not bet against a family clash occurring in the near future.

Mark Carey

Late in the first half, with Monterrey down 2-0, Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel prepared to take a goal kick. After he sent the ball downfield, one section of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium crowd yelled a discriminatory chant that has, unfortunately, become synonymous with Mexican football. The homophobic chant grew louder in the second half each time Kobel sent a dead ball downfield.

According to a FIFA representative on site in Atlanta, there is a protocol in place to first address that type of crowd behaviour and then respond to it. The objective is to give the referee the ability “to take escalating action when such incidents occur among fans or participants”. Per FIFA, such measures are part of a new disciplinary code that has been implemented for the Club World Cup.

FIFA has been criticised by anti-discrimination campaigners after football's world governing body appeared to roll back messages challenging racism or discrimination at the Club World Cup in the U.S.



After Monterrey cut Dortmund's lead to 2-1, the crowd became even more energised and the chant was heard again. It continued throughout the second half, but referee Tello allowed play to continue. In second half stoppage time, an anti-discrimination message was played over the stadium's loudspeakers.

Felipe Cardenas

Death, taxes, and Serhou Guirassy scoring a goal when he takes to the field.

We really are in that territory of inevitability with the Guinea international in the past couple of years, with his two goals against Monterrey making it 37 for the season in all competitions as he set Borussia Dortmund on their way to secure their place in the quarter-finals.

The two finishes were clinical on Tuesday evening, both tucked into the corner of the goal with conviction and purpose as he opened his body up to fire past Monterrey goalkeeper Esteban Andrada. In fairness, Guirassy's team-mates are under no illusion in serving him the ball, with no player having had more shots than the 29-year-old's 17 in this summer's tournament.

For those who might not be Bundesliga fans, Guirassy has been one of the most clinical finishers in Germany in the past two seasons. If not for the other-worldly numbers from Bayern Munich's Harry Kane, he would have two Torjagerkanone's (Bundesliga top goalscorer trophy) on his mantelpiece.

A tally of 28 league goals for Stuttgart in 2023-24 earned Guirassy his move to Dortmund last summer, with 21 league goals in his first campaign made all the more impressive when considering Dortmund's disappointing season overall. Collectively in that time, Guirassy's attacking rate has equated to exactly one goal per game in Germany.

For Dortmund, all roads lead to Guirassy — and with good reason.

Mark Carey

And so the quarter-final line-up is complete. On one side of the draw, there is Fluminense vs Al Hilal on Friday afternoon, followed by Palmeiras vs Chelsea. On the other, there is Paris Saint-Germain vs Bayern Munich on Saturday afternoon, followed by Real Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund.

It makes for a reasonable geographic spread: while there is the expected majority from Europe (two from Germany and one apiece from England, France and Spain), there are also two teams from Brazil and one from Saudi Arabia. One European finalist is guaranteed, but on the other side of the draw, it is Chelsea vs the rest of the world.

On tonight's evidence, Dortmund have to be considered outsiders. They rushed into a 2-0 lead with two delightful link-ups between Karim Adeyemi and Guirassy, but they ended up grateful for some wasteful finishing from a spirited Monterrey side. Real Madrid might not be so forgiving.

Oliver Kay

Monterrey looked to be completely out of the match at half-time. Ramos put his hands on his hips and looked demoralised as he led his team into the tunnel. But it seemed like an inspired speech had taken place inside the Monterrey dressing room. Berterame's close-range header after a brief scramble inside the Dortmund penalty area cut the score to 2-1.

The partisan Monterrey crowd, which included neutrals in Inter Miami jerseys, turned Mercedes-Benz Stadium into a home ground for the Liga MX side. The crowd roared with each progressive pass. Monterrey's bench stood and watched a portion of the second half like cheerleaders as manager Domenec Torrent urged his side forward. The comeback was on. “Sí se puede!” (It's possible!) was sung throughout the stadium.

With the pride of North American football on the line, Monterrey showed great grit to put the Bundesliga side on their heels for the better part of the second half. Despite the result, it was a positive display on the field for Mexican football.

The FIFA Club World Cup is down to eight teams after the conclusion of the last 16 on July 1. As such, dream matchups are coming to fruition on both sides of the bracket. 

We're due two Champions League final rematches in the quarterfinals. Reigning champions Paris Saint-Germain take on 2020 winners Bayern Munich, who got the better of them when they met five years ago. Fluminense spoiled any chance of an Inter Milan vs. Manchester City rematch, and Al Hilal followed that upset with an underdog win of their own by defeating Pep Guardiola's team later that night. 

Chelsea are the only Premier League side remaining in the competition looking to play spoiler to these Cinderella stories for the rest of the tournament.

Real Madrid had their own Champions League final rematch to contend with first against Juventus, but they have another in the quarterfinals after Borussia Dortmund dispatched Liga MX's Monterrey.

Here's a look at the FIFA Club World Cup bracket as the round of 16 concludes detailing all quarterfinal games, a preview of semifinal matches and final information.

FIFA have been offering more free tickets to Club World Cup matches, Mail Sport understands.

Earlier this week, we revealed that the governing body had told those who paid to see Chelsea's weather-delayed victory over Benfica in Charlotte that they could have four complimentary seats for the fixture between Inter Milan and Fluminense at the same stadium.

At the time, FIFA seemed to suggest that the offer was a form of compensation after the Chelsea game had been hit by a two-hour pause thanks to the threat of thunderstorms in the area.

In an email to those involved, they said the move was ‘a token of our appreciation' for the 25,929 who attended the fixture at what was an empty-looking 74,867-capacity venue.

However, Mail Sport has since learned that FIFA has delivered a similar offer elsewhere. Those who bought tickets for Paris Saint-Germain's match with Inter Miami on Sunday – at the indoor Mercedes Benz Arena in Atlanta – were subsequently offered two free tickets for Borussia Dortmund's last-16 victory over Mexicans Monterrey on Tuesday.

Despite the offer, the cavernous venue with a 71,000-capacity was less than half full, with a reported 31,442 present and the upper deck not needed.

Earlier in the tournament, Mail Sport revealed that FIFA had been moving those who had bought tickets for matches to seats facing television cameras, in an apparent attempt to make stadia appear more populated and improve optics.

Despite some healthy attendances, many of the games in the revamped, expanded tournament have failed to capture the imagination of the US public.

FIFA will be hoping that it is a different story for the quarter-finals, which feature the likes of PSG, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. 

They may well, however, be nervous over Brazilians Fluminense's clash with the Saudi Arabian conquerors of Manchester City, Al-Hilal. That match will take place on Friday afternoon, local time, at Orlando's 65,000-capacity Camping World Stadium.

There is a fresh Fortnite mystery that's swept the gaming world, but this time, football is the mystery itself—it just happens to center on why three of England's biggest clubs aren't attending the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup. Manchester City will be attending, but Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal won't. Why aren't they participating, and what does that indicate about the selection process for the teams?

32 of the world's largest clubs will be invited to the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, but none of England's giants. Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal were not invited alongside their counterparts, reports Gistreel, on the basis of a strict points-based system used by FIFA. The system awards clubs points in line with performances over the past four years in the UEFA Champions League, and only the most frequent and consistent clubs are invited.

Manchester United, despite all their past glory, have been performing terribly in the recent past in European competitions. Liverpool, who won the Champions League in 2019, failed to gain enough points in the next seasons. Arsenal, however, returned to the Champions League a few months ago after many years and failed to gain enough points to qualify.

TalkSport informs us that the qualification relied on how the club did between 2021 and 2024 in the Champions League. Manchester City, Chelsea, and Real Madrid qualified since they won the tournament or maintained a consistent streak in the latter stages of the tournament. United, Liverpool, and Arsenal did not qualify, forfeiting precious points and ultimately a spot in the longer tournament.

There has to be caution against confusing Manchester United with Manchester City, who will represent England at the 2025 Club World Cup. Manchester City's recent dominance of football on the pitch in European as well as domestic football, capped by a Champions League title, ensured their participation. The same could not be assured of United, Liverpool, or Arsenal, whose recent European display was short of the required standard as provided by FIFA.

As TalkSport summarizes, “Manchester City, Chelsea, and Real Madrid are already among the clubs to have secured spots in the 2025 Club World Cup.”

United, Liverpool, and Arsenal's absence is a reminder that past triumphs won won't secure future appearances—performances today alone matter. Rebuild now begins for the three clubs.

The redesigned Club World Cup is more clubs, sure, but more competition. Performing at the European standard should be a priority for the club in the event that they wish to be the largest in the sporting arena globally. United, Liverpool, and Arsenal view it wake-up call and a time for a comeback next year.

Missing out on competing in the 2025 Club World Cup will be a letdown to Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal supporters, but it is an indication of just how much these words mean to them. They will need to go back to the drawing board and make it a core business in case they become the winner of the next one.

The “secret room” of this tale is concealed, however, not in Fortnite but in the FIFA qualification system. Manchester United, Liverpool, and Arsenal were denied entry into next year's 2025 Club World Cup on recent performances and not on merit. Rebuild now begins for the three clubs.

Two all-European clashes, Brazilian flair and a Saudi surprise form the last-eight clashes of the Club World Cup.

Eight teams from across three continents have their sights set on the FIFA Club World Cup 2025 trophy as the tournament enters the second stage of knockout phase.

After an extra-time thriller, two major upsets, three close encounters and two thumping wins, the quarterfinal lineup has been completed as Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund became the last two teams to seal their spots.

The last-eight stage pits four European giants against each other, provides a Middle Eastern club the chance to build on their deserved success and two Brazilian teams the opportunity to take the continent further.

Here's how the Club World Cup quarterfinals line up:

When: Friday, July 4 at 3pm (19:00 GMT)
Where: Camping World Stadium, Orlando, Florida

Emotions will run high and the stands will be replete with colour and noise when one of Brazil's oldest football clubs, Fluminense, take on Saudi Arabia's football giants Al Hilal at the 65,000-capacity venue in Florida.

Al Hilal will ride on the high of beating the tournament's defending champions Manchester City 4-3 in an extra-time thriller in one of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history on Tuesday.

Their Brazilian opponents, too, achieved similar success as they ousted Italian giants and UEFA Champions League finalists Inter Milan in a 2-0 win.

When: Friday, July 4 at 9pm (01:00 GMT, July 5)
Where: Lincoln Financial Field, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania

Palmeiras, the second Brazilian club to make the quarterfinals, will face the former English champions Chelsea in Friday's second knockout to be held in Philadelphia.

Runners-up in the Brazilian top-flight last season, Palmeiras beat compatriots Botafogo in a heated clash in the round of 16 and have been one of the strongest defensive lineups in the tournament.

Their opponents, who won the Club World Cup in 2021, will look to move past a disappointing English Premier League season and enter the business end of the competition for a chance to finish the season with a trophy.

The last-eight clash will be the final match held at the 69,000-capacity Lincoln Field stadium.

The winner will face the team that emerges victorious from the Al Hilal vs Fluminense match in the first semifinal.

When: Saturday, July 5 at 12pm (16:00 GMT)
Where: Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia

Arguably, the biggest clash of the quarterfinals pits two of the three title favourites remaining in the competition.

A win over German giants Bayern will consolidate European champions PSG‘s pedigree as one of the biggest clubs in the world and offer the Paris-based side a chance to complete a sensational season quadruple.

Bayern are the joint top goal-scoring team in the competition, with 16 goals in their four games so far, but their attack will be tested against the French champions at the 75,000-capacity stadium in Georgia.

When: Saturday, July 5 at 4pm (20:00 GMT)
Where: MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, New Jersey

The undisputed kings of the Club World Cup will come face-to-face with the German team that consistently finds itself amongst the best European clubs.

Real have welcomed back their star forward Kylian Mbappe and will hope he returns to his goalscoring form in a tough last-eight clash against a talented Dortmund team.

The blockbuster fixture – a rematch of the 2024 UEFA Champions League final – will be staged at the tournament's biggest stadium, which is doubling up as the the venue for the 2026 FIFA World Cup final.

A full house at MetLife Stadium's 88,000 seat arena on Saturday would go a long way to quelling doubts about American fan interest in the Club World Cup ahead of the semifinals and finals.

The winner of this clash will meet the winner of the PSG-Bayern match in the second semifinal.

The Nigeria international was expected to join 'Real Madrid, PSG or some Premier League team', but he's once again stuck in limbo

Victor Osimhen's time in Turkey couldn't have gone much better from a sporting perspective. The Nigerian scored 37 times in 41 appearances across all competitions as Galatasaray won a domestic double.

Usually, Europe's top clubs would be queuing up sign such a prolific No.9, particularly as there are so few proven goal-scorers on the market right now - and yet, at the time of writing, only Al-Hilal have expressed concrete interest in acquiring the Napoli-owned attacker, with the Saudi Arabian outfit willing to make him one of the highest-paid players on the planet.

So, what on earth is going on with Osimhen? Why is a world-class forward who dreamed of playing in the Premier League seemingly left with no other option but to move to the Middle East? And why is he still so reluctant to do so? GOAL attempts to get to the bottom of the curious case of Victor Osimhen...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

There are a lot of noticeable differences between the England team set to defend its European Championship title this summer and the one that claimed the trophy only three years ago. Super-subs in 2022, Alessia Russo and Ella Toone have been absorbed into the starting XI now, with Ellen White and Fran Kirby having both stepped away, while Millie Bright will be a notable absentee in the heart of defence after withdrawing from selection this summer. Perhaps the biggest change, though, is in between the posts, where Hannah Hampton will be taking over from Mary Earps at a major tournament for the first time.

Earps was one of the Lionesses' star performers during Euro 2022, keeping four clean sheets in six games while only conceding twice on her way to being named to the tournament's best XI. She took that form into the 2023 Women's World Cup, too, where she won the Golden Glove after helping England reach the final for the first time. Such top quality exploits on such big stages, supported by two strong seasons for Manchester United, allowed the 32-year-old to win The Best FIFA Women's Goalkeeper award in back-to-back years, underlining Earps' status as one of the world's best.

Circumstances have changed dramatically in the last two years to result in Earps not even being present for this summer's Euros, then. Hampton has by no means come out of the blue to take the shirt, having been in the squad for both tournaments in 2022 and 2023, but she has enjoyed an almighty rise to become the Lionesses' No.1 for their first-ever title defence.

The UEFA Women's Euro 2025 starts on July 2 and runs until the grand final on July 27. The Women's Euro 2025 will take place across Switzerland, featuring stadiums in Basel, Geneva, and Bern.

If you're looking for your chance to secure Women's Euro 2025 tickets, fret not. We've got all of the intel for you to get a seat at this international tournament in Switzerland.

UEFA Women's EURO 2025, which is the 14th edition of the Women's European Championship, is being held from Wednesday, July 2 to Sunday, July 27. Switzerland is staging the tournament for the first time, and the host nation will be hoping that playing in front of their fervent home fans will prove to be a good omen. The Netherlands were the host nation when they won the Women's Euro 2017, and England reigned supreme on home turf at Women's Euro 2022.

Other major timelines for the events you might want to note include:

Here's a closer look at where you can watch the Women's Euro 2025 from where you are:

Women's Euro 2022 was won by the tournament hosts, England. Chloe Kelly was the goalscoring heroine as she netted the winning goal in extra time against Germany. It was the first time an England senior team had won major footballing honours since the men's side had won the FIFA World Cup in 1966. The Lionesses were led by Sarina Wiegman, who had coached the Netherlands to glory five years earlier at Women's Euro 2017.

The 16 teams playing at Women's Euro 2025 are split into four groups of four teams. The top two sides in each group will progress to the quarter-finals. The groups were confirmed during December's draw in Lausanne and are as follows:Group A: Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Finland

Group B: Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy

Group C: Germany, Poland, Denmark, Sweden

Group D: France, England, Wales, Netherlands","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Joao Fonseca continued his stylish start to his Wimbledon debut on Wednesday by notching a slice of Brazilian history.

The #NextGenATP star delivered a rock-solid display to hold off Jenson Brooksby 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 and become the first Brazilian man to reach the third round at SW19 since Thomaz Bellucci in 2010. Brooksby attempted to use the windy conditions to drag Fonseca into a cat-and-mouse battle, but the 18-year-old's firepower ultimately proved too much in a three-hour, 14-minute victory.



By triumphing in his first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Brooksby, Fonseca also became the youngest man to reach that stage since Bernard Tomic in 2011. Next up in his maiden foray at the All England Club is qualifier Nicolas Jarry, who dispatched 19-year-old American Learner Tien 6-2, 6-2, 6-3.

Even though Fonseca, who is competing in just his fourth tour-level event on grass, struggled to maintain his footing at times, he was able to draw on a raucous Court 12 atmosphere to help him through. Playing in front of a crowd that included Brazilian and American fans alike, Fonseca swung freely and fired 50 winners, including a stunning stretched backhand winner from the back fence early in the fourth.

Brooksby arrived at Wimbledon fresh from reaching the final at the grass-court ATP 250 in Eastbourne, and the 24-year-old constantly pulled Fonseca forward with the use of drop shots and variation. While it worked for a brief moment, when he recovered a crucial break for 4-4 in the fourth set, the Brazilian responded instantly to prevail.

Fonseca's meteoric rise across the 2025 season began at the Australian Open, where he stunned then-World No. 9 Andrey Rublev in his first main draw appearance at a Grand Slam tournament. He then backed it up with a stellar run to his first ATP Tour title in Buenos Aires a month later before reaching the third round at Roland Garros last month.

Joao Fonseca, It All Adds Up

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz headline the entry list for the 2025 National Bank Open presented by Rogers (NBO) in Toronto. The field was announced by Tennis Canada on Wednesday.


This year's list marks the largest player field in tournament history, as the ATP Masters 1000 event enters a new 12-day format with a 96-player main draw.

“With a 96-player draw, six additional sessions, and the strongest player field in our history, we are thrilled to be entering a bold new era of the National Bank Open presented by Rogers, kicking off our redefined identity as the Tennis Playground,” said Karl Hale, Tournament Director, NBO Toronto. 


“With more players and an added round of action [the Round of 128], fans will get to witness more world-class tennis than ever before. Already, 2025 has delivered some of the most exciting moments in Masters 1000 and Grand Slam history — and now, Toronto is ready to take centre stage.”




Headlining this year's player list are the top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings, Sinner and Alcaraz. Since Sinner took home the NBO title in 2023, his first ATP Masters 1000 title, he's emerged as a dominant force on Tour, claiming three Grand Slam crowns, three more Masters 1000 titles, and the year-end ATP Finals in 2024. 


Alcaraz, who is still looking to lift his first NBO trophy, currently boasts five Grand Slam championships and seven Masters 1000 titles. In June, the Sinner-Alcaraz rivalry delivered an epic final match at Roland-Garros, which the Spaniard took in the fifth-set tiebreak to move ahead 8-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The two superstars have combined to win the last six Grand Slam tournaments.


“I'm very much looking forward to being back in Toronto for the National Bank Open presented by Rogers,” said Sinner. “This tournament will always hold a special place in my heart, as Toronto is where I won my first big title. The fans in Canada made the victory all the more special, and I can't wait to play in front of them once again.”


For the first time since 2021, three Canadians are ranked inside the Top 40, gaining direct entry into the NBO main draw. Montreal's Felix Auger-Aliassime, World No. 28, will be making his eighth appearance at the NBO. Denis Shapovalov, World No. 30, is also set to compete at the NBO for the eighth time, with his best performance coming in 2017 as an 18-year-old when he defeated Rafael Nadal en route to the semi-finals. Rounding out the group is Montrealer Gabriel Diallo, World No. 40, who will be playing in his fourth NBO, having won his first ATP main-draw match at the event in 2023.




“Canada, I can't wait to be back at home and playing in front of all of you at this year's National Bank Open presented by Rogers,” said Auger-Aliassime. ""The atmosphere and fans in Toronto are always amazing, and it's not something I take for granted. I'm going to give it everything I've got, and I hope that we can go on a deep run together!”


In addition to Sinner and Alcaraz, the remainder of the Top 5 – Alexander Zverev (No. 3), Jack Draper (No. 4), and Taylor Fritz (No. 5) – are all part of the entry list. Zverev, who won the NBO in 2017, will be joined by fellow champions Novak Djokovic (No. 6), Daniil Medvedev (No. 9), and Alexei Popyrin (No. 22). 


Other notable names include NBO finalists Alex de Minaur (No. 11), Andrey Rublev (No. 14), Stefanos Tsitsipas (No. 26), and Hubert Hurkacz (No, 39); Americans Ben Shelton (No. 10), Frances Tiafoe (No. 12), and Tommy Paul (No. 13); as well as #NextGenATP stars Jakub Mensik (No. 17) and Joao Fonseca (No. 54).


The first NBO of a redefined era, held at Sobeys Stadium, will kick off with a one-day qualifying round on Saturday, July 26, followed by main-draw action from Sunday, July 27 to Thursday, August 7. The popular 407 ETR Family weekend will be held again this year from July 26-27, while TennisFest, a new event at the NBO featuring must-see entertainment, hands-on activities, and distinctive food and beverage offerings, will take place during the second weekend, August 2 and 3. The Top 32 players will be receiving first-round byes, meaning they will make their tournament debuts on Tuesday, July 29 or Wednesday, July 30.


In the coming weeks, five main-draw wild cards will be announced, including the champion of Tennis Canada's new competition for Canadian players, the Road to the NBO. The official draw ceremony will be hosted at 12:00 p.m. Eastern on Friday, July 25.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Inside World No. 733 Tarvet's incredible journey to a showdown with Alcaraz at Wimbledon","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tarvet-wimbledon-2025-feature","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 01:57:05 GMT","

Less than three weeks ago, Oliver Tarvet did not have a wild card into Wimbledon qualifying. Now the 21-year-old is preparing to take on two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court in the second round of the main draw.

It is similar to the storybook run of Marcus Willis, who was No. 772 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2016 when he faced Roger Federer in the second round of the Wimbledon main draw after advancing through pre-qualifying. A big difference is that World No. 733 Tarvet flew across the world without knowing he would have a qualifying spot.

The Briton, who plays college tennis for the University of San Diego, competed in back-to-back ITF World Tennis Tour events in San Diego the first two weeks of June. After playing nine singles matches in the California heat — including a title campaign in the first event — Tarvet retired during the semi-finals of the second tournament, totally wiped out physically and mentally from a huge effort.

During the second event Ryan Keckley, the head coach at the University of San Diego, received word from Mark Hilton, a national coach for the Lawn Tennis Association, that Tarvet was under consideration for a qualifying wild card. There was no guarantee, but after the semi-finals, Keckley informed his player that he had a chance to receive a qualifying wild card and that they would need to get plans into motion in the hopes of that possibility becoming a reality.

“We pretty much pulled him into the locker room and said, ‘Hey, you've got an opportunity here. We've got to go try to make the most of it',” Keckley told ATPTour.com. “So he jumped on a plane the next day.”



That gave Tarvet less than a week to travel eight time zones and adjust not only to the big time difference, but from hard court to grass, for one of the most prestigious sporting events on the planet.

“He only really had six days of preparation on the grass before one of the biggest moments of his life,” Keckley said. “And then the next day was the biggest moment, and then the next day was the biggest moment. He's just risen to the occasion every opportunity and chance he's gotten.”

In the 11 sets Tarvet has played since beginning his qualifying run, the home favourite has lost just one. Before last week Tarvet had never faced an opponent ranked higher than World No. 367 in a professional match, and now he has the opportunity to take on a five-time major champion.

“He's done it with a lot of hard work. He's not afraid of work, and he's always prioritised his tennis over any kind of academic priorities that he might have,” Keckley said. “He's not a guy that ever skips a day. So when you put that many consecutive days of healthy practices, thoughtful, mindful practices, and you have some of the skill sets that Ollie does, good things are bound to happen.”








Tarvet, who is entering his senior season at USD, made an immediate impact on his head coach three years ago. The Briton's work ethic has shone through consistently during his time as a Torero.

“[Juniors] go to college tennis and everyone says they want to be a pro and quite frankly, very few are willing to do what it takes to become a pro. And Ollie was different in that regard,” Keckley said. “He texted me at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday and maybe some other college students would be at the library, some would be at the bars or socialising. He was underneath the lights hitting forehands with another player and it wasn't just a one-time thing. It was continuous.”

That dedication has helped Tarvet become a multiple-time qualifier for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, which was created to increase the development pathway for top players in the American collegiate system by providing direct entry into ATP Challenger Tour events. The 21-year-old's plan is to take the fall off from school to make use of those entries before returning to school in the spring.

Tarvet has not lost an official completed singles match in college or the pros since November, a stretch during which he has won 31 consecutive completed matches.

“His confidence is at an all-time high,” Keckley said. “So you're taking a very confident kid who believes in himself, believes in the work that he's put in, has an extremely high tennis IQ and you're putting him in an opportunity to win in an uncomfortable environment… He gets comfortable in the uncomfortable. He buys into the mentality.”

Keckley is not someone who cries, but when Tarvet defeated fellow qualifier Leandro Riedi on Monday in the first round of the main draw, the coach was emotional, full of pride for someone he watched make a dream come true.

“That moment, I'll never forget it because he just comes over and he gives you the biggest, sloppiest, wettest hug possible and you are just embracing every second of it because he's just made a name for himself,” Keckley said. “Not only in the United States, because he had a name for himself in the U.S college system, but in the LTA and worldwide.” 

There is no doubt that there is a huge gap between the experience Alcaraz and Tarvet will walk on Centre Court with Wednesday. But according to Keckley, his charge is someone who “eats and breathes and loves tennis”, and handles big moments “exceptionally”.

“We've got to first focus on our side of the net, focusing on what makes Ollie special, and he's very special. [it is about] getting his mind right and staying within what he is capable of doing, and then the rest is adjustments along the way,” Keckley said. “But he is a very capable tennis player and every challenge that has been put in front of him, he's matched and risen to the occasion. 

“So tomorrow we're going to go out there and the lines are the same, the balls are the same. The surface is a little different from San Diego, but we're going to focus on our side of the net.”

Gauff, Pegula, Zverev, Musetti among top-ranked casualties

A shocking 23 of the 64 seeds have been eliminated in the opening round at Wimbledon these past two days – 13 on the men's side and 10 on the women's – tying the most at any Grand Slam since the majors began seeding 32 players in 2001.

‘Carnage' is how former world No.1 Andy Roddick described it on his latest podcast episode.

That number could go up to 24 if the 29th-seeded Brandon Nakashima doesn't win his first round against Bu Yunchaokete, which was suspended with Nakashima leading by two sets to one.

Four top-10-seeded men were sent packing, with No.3 Alexander Zverev leading the exodus by falling to France's Arthur Rinderknech 7-6(3), 6-7(8), 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-4 in a clash that was completed across two days on Centre Court.

“I think generally he played a fantastic match. I'm not sure he's ever played a match like that in his life,” said Zverev after his loss, before detailing the mental struggles and feelings of loneliness he's been experiencing recently on tour.

Last year's semi-finalist Lorenzo Musetti, the No.7 seed, lost 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 to Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili, who is ranked 126 in the world and hadn't won a Grand Slam main draw match in three years before his big upset on Tuesday.

Musetti was unable to play any warmup events on grass this season due to a left leg injury he picked up at Roland-Garros that sidelined him between both majors.

Denmark's Holger Rune blamed a knee injury for his 4-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 loss to Chile's Nicolas Jarry.

“If I play normal, I'm beating him nine out of 10 times, with all respect for Nicolas Jarry. Obviously today didn't make it a lot easier with my knee, but yeah, it was not great,” said the No.8 seed.

Meanwhile, ninth-seeded Daniil Medvedev, who was a semi-finalist at Wimbledon the last two years was stunned by France's Benjamin Bonzi 7-6(2), 3-6, 7-6(3), 6-2.

Medvedev admitted he may have underestimated his opponent heading into the match.

“I'm surprised by his level. I know that he can play well. But I would be surprised if you find a match of him playing like this any other match this year. I'm surprised he did today. But it can happen. That's when sensations happen,” said the former US Open champion.

Seeded men who lost in the Wimbledon first round:

No.3 Zverev, No.7 Musetti, No.8 Rune, No.9 Medvedev, No.16 Cerundolo, No.18 Humbert, No.20 Popyrin, No.24 Tsitsipas, No.27 Shapovalov, No.28 Bublik, No.30 Michelsen, No.31 Griekspoor, No.32 Berrettini

On the women's side, reigning Roland-Garros champion and Wimbledon No.2 seed Coco Gauff was sent packing by Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska, while last week's Bad Homburg winner Jessica Pegula, the No.3 seed, fell to Italian Elisabetta Cocciaretto.

Fifth-seeded Zheng Qinwen and ninth-seeded Paula Badosa were also eliminated.

“I feel like historically Wimbledon always has so many upsets in first rounds here, to be honest. I think it's always a topic,” said Gauff on Tuesday when asked to explain the reasons behind such a high number of seeded casualties.

“I think I would say really the quick turnaround, most of the seeds are going deeper in Roland-Garros, and then you spend like a long clay season, and then you have to come and try to adjust to grass.

“Some people play the week before, but it's like you come here – I think Jess won on Saturday. She's lucky that she was on this side of the draw to play on Tuesday. It's not the easy, quick turnaround.  

“Then if you go deep in Roland-Garros, you're debating on do I rush and play that week, or do I take time and play the week before? It's a tricky thing.

“It seems like Carlos and Novak are the ones to figure it out. Even Carlos had a tough first-round match.

“I think this Slam out of all of them is the most prone to have upsets because of how quick the turnaround is from clay.”

Like Zverev and Medvedev, Pegula felt like her opponent played lights-out tennis against her to advance in straight sets.

“She played absolutely incredible tennis. Do I think I played the best match ever? No, but I definitely don't think I was playing bad,” said Pegula, who just on Saturday had defeated Iga Swiatek in the Bad Homburg final.

Many of the fallen seeds did indeed face peaking opponents, who were playing with the freedom typically associated with being an underdog and capitalised on the first-round nerves everyone experiences at the majors.

Roddick said on his podcast the slew of upsets was mostly about the grass, more than anything else.

“I think it's more surface than it is these players freaking out or not knowing what to do because they're a little nervy,” said the American.

Former world No.3 Maria Sakkari noted that the depth in both the men's and women's game is why we're witnessing such results.

“The level, I think, men and women is just so high right now,” said the Greek, who punched her ticket to the second round with a straight-sets victory over Anna Blinkova.

Sakkari acknowledged that it may seem weird that so many seeded men have exited the tournament but she sees it as a natural evolution of the game.

“The guys that beat those guys are good. They're not nobodies. They're very, very good players,” she added.

Legendary tennis coach Darren Cahill has revealed what Jannik Sinner did moments after his French Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz that surprised onlookers.

Sinner lost a five-hour epic 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 6-7, 6-7 to Alcaraz at Roland-Garros last month.

It was his first defeat in four Grand Slam finals, with the Italian dropping just two sets in his previous three finals.

Alcaraz saved three championship points on the way to arguably the greatest victory of his career.

The length of the match appeared to take its toll on Sinner, judging by the light-hearted thing he did minutes later.

According to Cahill, who has coached Sinner to all three of his Grand Slam final victories and previously mentored Simona Halep and Andre Agassi, the Italian walked past a candy jar as he was leaving the arena.

While tradition indicates that each player takes a small number of candies with them, Sinner instead decided to take the whole jar.

Speaking on ESPN, Cahill explained: ""About a half an hour afterwards, he went and did the press, he was walking to the transport, we had this big bus where we all sit in.

""And for the players, they have this candy jar, that you can take a couple of candies as you're walking out. He took the whole jar. He grabbed the glass jar, took the candies.

""He'd been on a strict diet for two weeks, and that was it - the diet was out of the window. In the car, he was handing candies out to everyone, he was laughing, he was giggling.



""He moved on pretty quickly [from the defeat]. It'll be interesting to see how he moves on here [at Wimbledon], because this will be the big test.""

Advert

Sinner got off to a positive start in SW19 on Tuesday, defeating compatriot Luca Nardi in straight sets 6-4, 6-3, 6-0.

He takes on Aleksandar Vukic of Australia in round two on Thursday evening.

Sinner and Alcaraz are on opposite sides of the draw so, should they face each other at this year's Wimbledon, the pair will have reached yet another Grand Slam final.

Coco Gauff wasn't herself during Tuesday's shocking opening-round loss at Wimbledon to Dayana Yastremska, failing to flex her usual strengths as a defensive player and top-rated American.

Coming off her second Grand Slam with a French Open title over Aryna Sabalenka last month, Gauff admitted her focus wasn't there against the unseeded Ukrainian after her straight sets loss. Gauff managed just six winners in the match, suffered nine double faults and whiffed her way to 29 unforced errors.

Gauff is the third player since the Open era began in 1968 to win the French Open before losing in the first round at Wimbledon.

""I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,"" Gauff said, ""so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.""

Gauff's career-long grass court struggles continued on Court No. 1 after failing to find a rhythm once she lost the tiebreak in the first set.

Gauff lost shortly after World No. 3 and fellow American Jessica Pegula was upset in the first round as well, leaving the women's draw at Wimbledon without America's two top threats early in Week 1.

Gauff's serve was an issue early and lingered throughout the match. Gauff endured a critical double fault in the tiebreaker to end the first set, a major miscue that left Yastremska with a prime opportunity.

Gauff played from behind early in the second set after losing her serve in the first game with Yastremska not being fooled by consistency issues. Whether serves went wide or into the net, it was obvious Gauff was not going to be on the offensive on grass.

""When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat,"" Gauff said. ""I didn't serve that well.""

Gauff mentioned Yastremska's strong play after the loss and said she ""couldn't find my footing"" on a hot day in London. 

""I definitely was struggling in the locker room. I don't like losing,"" Gauff said. ""The main thing I'm sure my team and everyone is going to tell me (is): 'You did well at Roland-Garros. Don't be so upset.' Things like that.""

Gauff said she won't dwell on her first-round upset and her focus has already turned to the U.S. Open later this year.

""Maybe losing here (in the) first round isn't the worst thing in the world,"" Gauff said, ""because I have time to reset.""

Gauff said she felt ""a little bit overwhelmed"" after winning the French Open last month

Robert Prange/Getty 

 The biggest win of Coco Gauff's year might have led to her biggest loss, the American tennis star surmised after getting knocked out of Wimbledon in the first round on Tuesday.


 The 21-year-old American tennis star was upset in the first round of the English tennis tournament after losing to unseeded Ukrainian tennis player Dayana Yastremska in straight sets. Gauff was the No. 2 seed in the tournament.


 Gauff said after her shocking loss on Tuesday that she was “a little bit overwhelmed” with “everything” that came with winning her second major tournament last month. Gauff defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the French Open, and went on a mini media tour in the weeks following the victory.


 ""I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards,"" Gauff said, according to ESPN. ""So, I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.""


Robert Prange/Getty 

 The outlet reported that Gauff made “mistake after mistake” in the match against Yastremska, 25, who won the first set 7-6 before cruising to a 6-1 win in the second set. Gauff made 29 unforced errors in the match, including nine double-faults.


 ""Dayana started off playing strong,"" Gauff said afterwards. ""I couldn't find my footing out there today.""

 It's the second time in the last three years that Gauff has lost in the first round at Wimbledon after getting upset in 2023 as the No. 7 seed to unseeded Sofia Kenin.


 After the match Tuesday, Yastremska said she felt “really on fire” during the first-round performance and complimented Gauff as a tough opponent.


 ""Playing against Coco, it is something special,” the world No. 42 said. 


 Gauff wasn't the only top-seeded player to go down in the first round Tuesday. A record-breaking four women ranked in the top 10, as well as four men, were all upset – the most ever at a major tournament in the Open Era (since 1968), according to ESPN.

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have won the last six Grand Slam titles and in the ongoing Wimbledon too, they are the heavy favorites to win. Last month, they locked horns in the final of the French Open-the first time they faced off in a Grand Slam summit clash and it did not disappoint at all.

It was what perhaps everyone expected it to be: nothing short of a thrilling clash that kept everyone on the edge of their seats for five hours and 29 minutes. Tommy Paul, after his first-round match at Wimbledon against Johannus Monday, was asked in the press conference what went through his mind while watching the final between the two young rivals.

We all know what it was. It was amazing. I love both of those guys. I love watching both.

Paul, who will square off against Sebastian Ofner, is projected to lock horns with Sinner in the fourth round and could only face Alcaraz if he reaches the final. The Spaniard holds a 5-2 head-to-head record over the 28-year-old and had knocked him out in this year's Roland Garros quarterfinal. Against the three-time Grand Slam champion, Paul trails 1-4 in the head-to-head record and had also lost their clash in this year's Rome Open semifinal.

You're not gonna put together two weeks against these guys [to win a Slam]. We've got some catching up to do.

Paul has never played the final of a Grand Slam tournament and at Wimbledon, he produced his best when he reached the quarterfinals last year. Alcaraz had knocked him out of the tournament then.

The five-time Grand Slam champion is playing the tournament as the two-time defending champion. It was 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, whom he defeated in the last two finals. Djokovic is the last player other than Alcaraz and Sinner to win a Major since the 2023 US Open.

The 22-year-old Spaniard survived a scare in the first round as it took him more than four hours to knock out Italy's Fabio Fognini in five sets. He will next face Britain's Oliver Tarvet on July 2. If he wins this year's Wimbledon, he will complete the Channel Slam for two consecutive seasons.

Jannik Sinner secured a spot in the second round of the Championships without breaking any sweat. He was up against Luca Nardi, whom he defeated 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 to schedule his second-round clash with Aleksandar Vukic.

At the press conference later, Sinner was asked whether he was worried about the reception of the public as he is playing his first Wimbledon since the doping scandal. The Italian thinks people have forgotten a bit about the case which is a “good and bad thing about today's society.”

At first, everything was a bit different; people saw me in different ways, but I think everyone has seen that I'm a clean player, that I never intended to do anything wrong. I always try to be my best version and have a good team around me, and that's what I'll try to achieve in the future. The things I can control, I will, both on and off the court. It was an incident, yes.

 Sinner is bidding to win his second title of the season following the Australian Open. At Wimbledon, the 23-year-old has never progressed beyond the semifinals, reaching the stage in 2023 (lost to Novak Djokovic) and last year,  Daniil Medvedev knocked him out in the quarterfinals.

Sinner has faced his second-round opponent Vukic twice, winning both matches. But they will be facing each other for the first time on grass. Before scheduling the clash with Sinner, the Australian knocked out Tsen Chun-hsin in four sets.

Follow live updates and scores from day three of the Wimbledon Championships at the All England Club

It's day three at Wimbledon 2025 and a packed day is almost done, with a raft of British players in action including Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter, as well as Carlos Alcaraz, Naomi Osaka and a host of other big names.

The first Brit on court today was Sonay Kartal, sweeping aside Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova in straight sets, though Billy Harris was beaten by Portuguese No 1 Nuno Borges. British qualifier Oliver Tarvet also exited, showing heart in a loss to defending champion Alcaraz in the match of his life, but Cameron Norrie advanced with an epic win over Frances Tiafoe on Court One. Raducanu, meanwhile, faces a huge test against former champion Marketa Vondrousova. 

Yesterday Jack Draper cruised through to the second round, but Heather Watson and Jodie Burrage were early casualties among the home prospects. There were more dramatic exits in the women's draw, however, when third seed Jessica Pegula and fifth seed Zheng Qinwen were eliminated, before French Open champion Coco Gauff lost to Dayana Yastremska in the final match on Court One.

The men's No 3 seed Alexander Zverev suffered a shock defeat to France's Arthur Rinderknech but top seed Jannik Sinner swept past Italian Luca Nardi. Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic saw off the stout challenge of Alexandre Muller to make his way into the next round, crediting “miracle pills” for his turnaround.

Follow all of the latest from Wimbledon with The Independent's live blog below:

Raducanu 2-1 Vondrousova*

Vondrousova hits the wrong side of the tramline with an ambitious groundstroke, but Raducanu nets shortly after a second serve on the next point. 15-15.

Raducanu can't quite shuffle her feet into position as she tries a forehand now, and she nets again. 15-30.

Better from the Brit! She rips a backhand and rushes the net, where she slices a winner past Vondrousova – with help from the net cord, though the Czech looked beaten anyway. 30-30.

More fine net play from Raducanu, to the delight of the Centre Court crowd. She puts away a smash after chipping a forehand approach shot into the corner. 40-30.

But she propels a forehand long to find herself at deuce.

Really good baseline hitting from both players, who push the ball close to the baseline and tramline again and again. Eventually, Raducanu finds the chalk on a cross-court backhand, and Vondrousova can't get it back.

Vondrousova then aims to move in on a forehand, but she whips it wide! Raducanu holds.

*Raducanu 1-1 Vondrousova

Vondrousova can't beat the net on her first service point, misfiring with a groundstroke, before she falls to 0-30 thanks to a crouching backhand winner by Raducanu.

The Briton misses on her next effort, however. 15-30.

And a couple more misses by Raducanu from the baseline see her fail to convert from a promising position in this game.

Raducanu 1-0 Vondrousova*

*denotes next to serve

Raducanu flies into a 40-0 lead, forcing two errors out of Vondrousova either side of a spitfire, inside-out forehand winner.

She punctuates that winner with a “come on!”, but two points later, Vondrousova scores with a forehand winner of her own – a well-placed one down the line. 40-15.

Now a longer rally ends with Raducanu, on the stretch, slapping a backhand low and wide. 40-30.

Fine serving from Raducanu, though, as she holds!

Noami Oasaka is a set up against Katerina Siniakova, but another seed has fallen on the women's side! Beatriz Haddad Maia loses to Dalma Galfi in straight sets!

Alongside that debut effort in 2021, last year was a joint-best run for Raducanu at Wimbledon.

She reached the fourth round in both cases.

Here, she aims for round three.

Both players are on court and warming up.

Okay, the final Centre Court match today pits Emma Raducanu against 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova in round two.

Raducanu actually beat Vondrousova here in 2021, also in the second round, in that stellar debut Wimbledon campaign where the Briton reached round four.

Four years on, Raducanu, 22, looks to repeat that result against the Czech, 26.

Boulter 7-6(7), 2-6, 0-1 Sierra*

It's a fourth consecutive break of the Boulter serve for Sierra and Court 1's enthusiasm has been dampened. 

*Boulter 7-6(7), 2-6 Sierra

A shout of delight from Sierra as she takes the second set with a big serve. The Argentine looks right at home on the grass and the big stage, not having lost any confidence despite losing that first set, and playing much more aggressively than the Brit. 

“I have to give a big credit to Oliver. It's his second match on the tour, I just loved his game to be honest, the level he played in his first match on Centre Court. I knew I had to play my best tennis, I played great tennis, really happy about my performance, and just big credit to him as well. 

“Today I played against someone from here, at home, it was not easy, but the crowd was really respectful.”

On his run of 20 wins in a row: “I found the right way, I'm trying to enjoy every match, it doesn't matter if I'm winning or losing. That's the key in the last two or three months to my consecutive winning streak. I'm just trying to keep it going.”

Boulter 7-6(7), 2-5 Sierra*

A backhand error hands over a very tame break, and Sierra once again leads by two breaks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","BBC commentators fume at Wimbledon star for 'absolutely ridiculous' antics vs Cam Norrie","https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/bbc-commentators-wimbledon-norrie-tiafoe-35489734","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 15:32:00 GMT","

BBC co-commentator John Lloyd took aim at Frances Tiafoe's antics during his second round Wimbledon with Cameron Norrie as he labelled the American ""absolutely ridiculous"".

Tiafoe claimed the opening set on Court 1 on Wednesday afternoon before Norris, who is a former semi-finalist at SW19, fired back to win the next three sets. But it was the American's antics after the third set that caused controversy as he decided to take a moment to compose himself, but took his time in doing so.

Before the fourth set could begin, Tiafoe took a prolonged period of time to collect his belongings from his side of the court before heading for a toilet break. He appeared to grab a towel, t-shirt, shorts and fresh trainers from his bag before requesting a toilet break from the umpire.

It took seven minutes for him to return with Lloyd claiming he was deliberately trying to halt Norrie's momentum. Not that it worked as the Brith would claim the fourth set to progress with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 victory.

He said ahead of the fourth set: ""This is ridiculous, I'm sorry but it's absolutely ridiculous. The momentum of the game. And you had the French Open final and they didn't go for one bathroom break in five hours. Not one. If I was Norrie I would go out and hit a couple of serves.""

Andrew Castle, who was also on commentary duty, joked about the amount of stuff that Tiafoe was taking as he joked: ""It looks like he is moving in.""

The French umpire Damian Dumusois allowed Tiafoe to then slowly walk off the court with Castle letting rip as he claimed it was unfair on the home player. He said: ""Damian Dumusois in the chair here. I'm not sure what he can do. You've got the court official waiting to lead him off and the loo is just back there. I think this is actually unfair to the person who is in front and is on the charge.""

Lloyd then added: ""I think if you have to have a bathroom break, you get your stuff immediately. You can't just wait three minutes deciding which shirt and shorts you want to wear. This for me, I don't agree with it at all. I think this is wrong.""

Norrie said after his win: ""I just stayed calm and played point by point. It was so nice to play Frances at such a big match. I served really well in that last game and you guys we were amazing in that last game so thank you.

""It's so special. You forget so quickly. You just feel goose bumps. It's such a special court and such a special tournament. I just walked out and smiled as much as I could. And then you have to go out to battle. I'm really happy with my level today.""

...

The upsets keep coming at Wimbledon. Following an upset-heavy first round, American Frances Tiafoe added his name to the list of disappointing performers after a loss to Cameron Norrie on Tuesday.

Tiafoe lost the match in four sets, 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5.

Tiafoe got off to a decent start, taking the first set 6-4. But he couldn't hold that momentum. Tiafoe dropped the next two sets against Norrie 6-4, 6-3, to fall behind in the match.

With Tiafoe on the ropes, the American decided to take a lengthy bathroom break ahead of the fourth set. His absence lingered longer than expected, causing some to accuse Tiafoe of trying to halt Norrie's momentum. Tiafoe was gone long enough that some sites erroneously listed the match as over after just three sets, leading some to wonder whether Tiafoe retired due to an injury.

That was not the case. Tiafoe returned to the court for the fourth set, and initially seemed reinvigorated as he resumed play. But Norrie once again fought back, taking a 4-3 lead in the set. Tiafoe again showed signs of life, taking the next two games to make it 5-4, but Norrie battled back to win the set.

Norrie didn't miss his opportunity to send Tiafoe packing. The Brit won the next two games, taking the fourth set 7-5 and ending the match.

Tiafoe is far from the biggest name to be eliminated early at Wimbledon this year. The first round of the event saw multiple top seeds fall, including Coco Gauff, Alexander Zverev and Jessica Pegula. Americans, in particular, have struggled in 2025. Following the premature exits of Gauff, Pegula and Tiafoe, sixth-seeded Madison Keys remains the highest-ranked American still standing on the women's side. Fifth-seeded Taylor Fritz represents the highest-ranked American on the men's side.

It's a disappointing loss for Tiafoe, who made it to at least the third round at Wimbledon in each of the past four years. While the loss likely hurts, Norrie is far from a pushover. He was No. 61 coming into Wimbledon, but ranked as high as No. 18 in 2024 before plummeting down the rankings. Norrie battled injuries and illness since then, which could explain his recent struggles.

If Norrie is back to form, he could prove to be a tough opponent the rest of the way. Norrie ranked as high as No. 8 back in 2022, and has shown the ability to play tennis at an elite level in the past. Tuesday's win over Tiafoe offered some hope Norrie can turn things around after his recent struggles.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"

Novak Djokovic has credited a doctor's 'miracle pills' for helping him to battle through an illness during his first round match at Wimbledon on Tuesday night.

The Serbian star asked for a doctor to be called to the court shortly after losing the second set of the match to France's Alexandre Muller.

Djokovic had appeared visibly unwell and after discussions during a medical time out, was given a tablet by the doctor to ease his symptoms.

The seven-time Wimbledon champion was then able to seize control of the match, breaking Muller's impressive resistance.

Djokovic won 10 of the final 12 games following his medical time out, ultimately wrapped up a 6-1, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-2 victory.

When asked in his on court interview about the illness, Djokovic suggested he may have been suffering from a stomach bug.

Djokovic had credited the doctor's 'miracle pills' for helping him to fight through to the second round. 

'I went from feeling my absolutely best for a set and a half to my absolute worst for about 45 minutes,' Djokovic said. 

'Whether it was a stomach bug - I don't know what it is, but just struggled with that. 

'The energy kind of kicked back after some doctor's miracle pills and I managed to finish the match on a good note.'

Despite Djokovic appearing visibly hampered by illness, some fans queried the extent of the issue with the medical time out coming just minutes after losing the second set.

'Textbook Djokovic ""I'm not playing great so I'll take a medical timeout even though there's no signs of me being remotely injured"" move to make sure he gets the crowd back on side and acting like he's playing on against all the odds,' one fan wrote.

'Every time I watch a Djokovic match that he's losing, or is tight, he calls on the on court doctor,' another added. 'Saw him do it multiple times. Can't have him at all. Medical time outs to halt opponents momentum.'

A third added: 'Djokovic in “shock” loses a set and immediately calls a medical timeout followed by securing a double break. How many times does he do that?' 

Djokovic's use of 'miracle pills' also generated discussion from fans on social media.

'""I think a lot of people would like to know what these doctors miracle pills are"" is quite a line to Novak,' one fan wrote, referencing a question by the on court interviewer.

'Djokovic references “miracle pills from the doctor”, which generally happens when things aren't going his way. Everyone laughs. Interviewer jokes about it. Staggering this has been accepted without question for so long,' another fan added.

It is not the first time in his long career Djokovic has created debate, after previously claiming he had been drinking a 'magical potion' when asked by journalists in 2022.

The questioning followed Djokovic appearing to breathe in the contents of a drink during Wimbledon that year.

While some also queried Djokovic's description of 'miracle pills', others defended the Serbian by claiming it was merely a phrase to highlight how it had helped to ease his symptoms.

'He always calls that miracle pills in this case Novak was sick and those pills calmed his stomach pain fast that's why he called it miracle pills,' one fan wrote.

Djokovic had also been seen in discussion with the doctor during the next changeover during the match in the third set.

The discussion took place while Muller had his own medical timeout due to an apparent calf issue.

Djokovic's eventual four set victory saw the 38-year-old, who is targeting a record 25th Grand Slam title, set up a second round encounter with Britain's Dan Evans.

Djokovic admitted post-match that Wimbledon represents his best chance of adding to his haul, with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner having established themselves as the leading duo in recent Grand Slams.

'I wouldn't be here if I didn't think I have a chance. I think I always have a chance,' Djokovic added.

'I think I earned my right to really feel like I can go all the way to the title'

'I always felt like grass, particularly in the second part of my career, was really the surface where I played my best tennis. So why not do it again?'","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

It's day three at Wimbledon 2025 and a packed day is almost done, with a raft of British players in action including Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter, as well as Carlos Alcaraz, Naomi Osaka and a host of other big names.

The first Brit on court today was Sonay Kartal, sweeping aside Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova in straight sets, though Billy Harris was beaten by Portuguese No 1 Nuno Borges. British qualifier Oliver Tarvet also exited, showing heart in a loss to defending champion Alcaraz in the match of his life, but Cameron Norrie advanced with an epic win over Frances Tiafoe on Court One. Raducanu, meanwhile, faces a huge test against former champion Marketa Vondrousova. 

Yesterday Jack Draper cruised through to the second round, but Heather Watson and Jodie Burrage were early casualties among the home prospects. There were more dramatic exits in the women's draw, however, when third seed Jessica Pegula and fifth seed Zheng Qinwen were eliminated, before French Open champion Coco Gauff lost to Dayana Yastremska in the final match on Court One.

The men's No 3 seed Alexander Zverev suffered a shock defeat to France's Arthur Rinderknech but top seed Jannik Sinner swept past Italian Luca Nardi. Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic saw off the stout challenge of Alexandre Muller to make his way into the next round, crediting “miracle pills” for his turnaround.

Follow all of the latest from Wimbledon with The Independent's live blog below:

Raducanu 2-1 Vondrousova*

Vondrousova hits the wrong side of the tramline with an ambitious groundstroke, but Raducanu nets shortly after a second serve on the next point. 15-15.

Raducanu can't quite shuffle her feet into position as she tries a forehand now, and she nets again. 15-30.

Better from the Brit! She rips a backhand and rushes the net, where she slices a winner past Vondrousova – with help from the net cord, though the Czech looked beaten anyway. 30-30.

More fine net play from Raducanu, to the delight of the Centre Court crowd. She puts away a smash after chipping a forehand approach shot into the corner. 40-30.

But she propels a forehand long to find herself at deuce.

Really good baseline hitting from both players, who push the ball close to the baseline and tramline again and again. Eventually, Raducanu finds the chalk on a cross-court backhand, and Vondrousova can't get it back.

Vondrousova then aims to move in on a forehand, but she whips it wide! Raducanu holds.

*Raducanu 1-1 Vondrousova

Vondrousova can't beat the net on her first service point, misfiring with a groundstroke, before she falls to 0-30 thanks to a crouching backhand winner by Raducanu.

The Briton misses on her next effort, however. 15-30.

And a couple more misses by Raducanu from the baseline see her fail to convert from a promising position in this game.

Raducanu 1-0 Vondrousova*

*denotes next to serve

Raducanu flies into a 40-0 lead, forcing two errors out of Vondrousova either side of a spitfire, inside-out forehand winner.

She punctuates that winner with a “come on!”, but two points later, Vondrousova scores with a forehand winner of her own – a well-placed one down the line. 40-15.

Now a longer rally ends with Raducanu, on the stretch, slapping a backhand low and wide. 40-30.

Fine serving from Raducanu, though, as she holds!

Noami Oasaka is a set up against Katerina Siniakova, but another seed has fallen on the women's side! Beatriz Haddad Maia loses to Dalma Galfi in straight sets!

Alongside that debut effort in 2021, last year was a joint-best run for Raducanu at Wimbledon.

She reached the fourth round in both cases.

Here, she aims for round three.

Both players are on court and warming up.

Okay, the final Centre Court match today pits Emma Raducanu against 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova in round two.

Raducanu actually beat Vondrousova here in 2021, also in the second round, in that stellar debut Wimbledon campaign where the Briton reached round four.

Four years on, Raducanu, 22, looks to repeat that result against the Czech, 26.

Boulter 7-6(7), 2-6, 0-1 Sierra*

It's a fourth consecutive break of the Boulter serve for Sierra and Court 1's enthusiasm has been dampened. 

*Boulter 7-6(7), 2-6 Sierra

A shout of delight from Sierra as she takes the second set with a big serve. The Argentine looks right at home on the grass and the big stage, not having lost any confidence despite losing that first set, and playing much more aggressively than the Brit. 

“I have to give a big credit to Oliver. It's his second match on the tour, I just loved his game to be honest, the level he played in his first match on Centre Court. I knew I had to play my best tennis, I played great tennis, really happy about my performance, and just big credit to him as well. 

“Today I played against someone from here, at home, it was not easy, but the crowd was really respectful.”

On his run of 20 wins in a row: “I found the right way, I'm trying to enjoy every match, it doesn't matter if I'm winning or losing. That's the key in the last two or three months to my consecutive winning streak. I'm just trying to keep it going.”

Boulter 7-6(7), 2-5 Sierra*

A backhand error hands over a very tame break, and Sierra once again leads by two breaks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Emma Navarro gave in to begging Jannik Sinner but gave him brutal response","https://www.themirror.com/sport/tennis/jannik-sinner-emma-navarro-partners-1240517","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:33:00 GMT","

Emma Navarro has joked that Jannik Sinner had been desperate to play alongside her at the US Open, quipping that the world No.1 'begged her' to play as his partner.

The two have agreed to team up in the new format of the mixed doubles later this summer, with the matches to be held over two days prior to the two-week period of the major championship, which get underway on Sunday, August 24. A number of big names have already agreed to play in the mixed doubles, with Carlos Alcaraz set to team up with British star Emma Raducanu, as well as Novak Djokovic playing with fellow Serbian Olga Danilovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas pairing with his girlfriend Paula Badosa.

Sinner and Navarro are the latest mixed doubles to enter the talent-stacked tournament, with Navarro explaining how the world number one approached her to be his partner for the matchups.

Navarro said: ""He was begging me to play. I said 'yeah sure. I guess I'll play with you. You're not the best player but I'll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year!'""

After the news broke that the two would be entering as partners, Sinner was asked about how this came about prior to his first round matchup at Wimbledon.

He told reporters: ""It was very unexpected, to be honest. Look, I just met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked. We never texted to each other. It's actually a funny story.

""The tournament, they wanted us to kind of play together because certain teams were already set up. The choice was not big, but I'm very happy to play with Emma.""

The new-look competition will see games be played in a different format, being much quicker and less strenuous in order for more than one game to be played per day.

The format up to the final will be best-of-three-set matches with sets played to four games and a sudden-death deciding point at deuce.

Sinner explained why he was ""very excited"" to be apart of the new look competition in Queens, New York City. He said: ""It's something new. I think it's very exciting for the fans to see something different.

""The best singles player playing doubles is always something fun to watch. We have something similar - obviously not mixed - in Indian Wells and Miami.

""This time, I think the teams are very, very high level, the best players to play. It's going to be exciting to see. I'm looking forward to it.""

Coco Gauff became the biggest seed to fall across the opening two days of Wimbledon as the American second seed was beaten in straight sets by Dayana
Yastremska.

Fresh from her second Grand Slam win at the French Open, Gauff looked a shadow of her best self only a month on from that triumph - her serve, in particular, deserting her as she sent down nine double faults while being broken four times in the 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 defeat.

""I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came after [the French Open],"" a tearful Gauff said in her post-match press conference. ""I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it.""

She added: ""I definitely was struggling in the locker room. I don't like losing. I just feel a little bit disappointed in how I showed up today.""

Even though Gauff's big breakthrough came at the All England Club when, just 15 years old in 2019, she beat Venus Williams in her opening match and made it all the way to the fourth round, the grass court tournament has proven to be her least successful major, the only one where she has failed to reach the semi-finals.

It was admittedly a tough draw for Gauff against the world No 42 from Ukraine, but one she will have still expected to navigate. Instead, the 21-year-old exits a major in the first round for just the third time in her career, and first since 2023, which was also at Wimbledon.

""I think it's just changing my playing style a little bit, which is difficult,"" she said.

""I have faith that if I can make these adjustments, I can do well here. I really do want to do well here.""

In all across the opening two days of Wimbledon, a grand total of 23 seeds - 13 men and 10 women - are already out, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001.

Novak Djokovic somewhat limped to a late-evening victory over Alexandre Muller on Centre Court to set up a second-round meeting with Great Britain's Dan Evans on Thursday.

The 38-year-old, searching for a 25th Grand Slam singles title to take him clear of Margaret Court, received a medical timeout after losing a second-set tie-breaker to the 41st-ranked Frenchman but ultimately rallied to a 6-1 6-7 (7-9) 6-2 6-2 win clinched at 10.30pm, shortly before the 11pm curfew.

Monday saw seven British players record victories at the All England Club, the best tally on any day of the Championships in the Open era. And the wait for an eighth home player to reach the second round was ended at 4.48pm when Evans beat fellow Briton Jay Clarke 6-1 7-5 6-2 to set up the meeting with Djokovic. It was the 35-year-old's first Wimbledon win in four years.

""I'd love it to be on Centre, to get a chance to play him [Djokovic],"" Evans said after his win. ""He's at the latter end of his career and I'd go out there and give it a really good go. It would be special in England to play the greatest of all time.""

Elsewhere in the men's draw, world No 1 Jannik Sinner eased into the second round, needing just an hour and 48 minutes to dispose of his Italian compatriot Luca Nardi 6-4 6-3 6-0.

American fifth seed Taylor Fritz defeated France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (8-10) 6-4 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 in a match suspended on Monday evening with the pair level at two sets each.

Along with Gauff, two of the biggest seed casualties on Tuesday at Wimbledon were men's and women's world No 3s, Alexander Zverev and Jessica Pegula.

Zverev and Arthur Rinderknech were locked at one set apiece on Monday when play was stopped but, after resuming on Centre Court the following afternoon, it was the Frenchman who ground out a 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (8-10) 6-3 6-7 (7-5) 6-4 victory.

It was Zverev's first opening-round defeat at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon in 2019 and leaves the 28-year-old still searching for a first major after 38 attempts.

Pegula struggled to explain away her shock Wimbledon exit as she praised the ""insane"" performance of opponent Elisabetta Cocciaretto. Last year's US Open runner-up crashed out following a 6-2 6-3 defeat to the Italian world No 116 in just 58 minutes.

Asked what went wrong, the 31-year-old American replied: ""I don't know. She played absolutely incredible tennis.

""Do I think I played the best match ever? No. But I definitely don't think I was playing bad. It's really a bummer to lose. I haven't lost first round of a Slam in a very long time, so that sucks.""

Cocciaretto, who had only once before defeated a top-10 player, spectacularly turned the tables on Pegula, having suffered a 6-4 6-0 round-three loss to her at the All England Club in 2023.

Defending women's singles champion Barbora Krejcikova was tested by promising 20-year-old Alexandra Eala, losing the first set before finding her form late in a 3-6 6-2 6-1 win.

Eala is the first player from the Philippines to appear in the main draw at Wimbledon in the Open era and Krejcikova was full of praise for her afterwards.

""I mean, what the hell [kind of tennis] she played in the first set?,"" the reigning champion said of her young opponent.

""She was smashing the ball and cleaning the lines, so wow, wow. She's going to be really good in a couple of years.""

Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek, seeded eighth, is yet to conquer Wimbledon but showed positive signs as she beat Polina Kudermetova 7-5 6-1, while Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva advanced after a 6-3 6-3 victory over Mayar Sherif.

The women's draw is now without three of its top five seeds after No 5 Qinwen Zheng of China, the Olympic champion, suffered a third successive Wimbledon first-round defeat, beaten 7-5 4-6 6-1 by Czech doubles specialist Katerina Siniakova.

Elsewhere, US 10th seed Emma Navarro knocked out two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova with a 6-3 6-1 victory in a match that lasted exactly an hour. It marked Kvitova's final appearance at Wimbledon before heading into retirement.

Queen's champion Tatjana Maria, who reached the semi-finals in 2022, also made an early exit as she lost in three sets to American Katie Volynets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","US Open finalist explains why there's ""no point"" breaking Wimbledon record","https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/tennis/wimbledon-serve-record-taylor-fritz-35488926","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:28:00 GMT","

Taylor Fritz claimed there would be ""no point"" in breaking the Wimbledon serve speed record after Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard claimed he could throw one down at over 160pm.

It is the Frenchman who holds the record after a 153mph first serve against the American on Monday night. Mpetshi Perricard twice broke the record at the start of the week in the same match.

He laid down the gauntlet in the first round clash and sent his first serve down at 149mph - which eclipsed the mark set at SW19 in 2010 by American ace Taylor Dent of 148mph.

Shortly later he was at it again to hammer down a serve at 153mph - which incredibly was returned by Fritz who would go on to win that point.

The American would eventually win a five-set thriller on Tuesday afternoon after their Monday night clash had carried over. It was then put to him that Mpetshi Perricard could further break his record, but Fritz explained why that would be a pointless exercise.

He said: ""If he did 153, he could potentially do close to 160 in the right conditions. The question I have is: Why? There's no point. It's much better to hit 140 to a spot than just hit the ball, serve as hard as you can.""

Firtz, who made his first Grand Slam final less than a year ago when he played at the US Open, confessed that he didn't mind the crazy fast serves as they meant he had to react instantly, rather than have to think too much, which is when he admits errors come.

He said: ""I don't really mind it because it actually gives me absolutely zero time to think. Normally when I start thinking, that's when I mess things up (smiling). The fact that it's just all reflexes. I think that's one of the things I do better in my return game, when I like to stand close, chip, holding a backhand grip. It's just handsy and it's reflexes. I'd much rather deal with the speed than the spot.""

The 27-year-old reached the quarter-finals at Wimbledon last year, which is his best result to date. Fritz hasn't shied away from making a Grand Slam his ultimate goal and said recently: ""Winning a Grand Slam is the only reason I want to keep playing. It will probably feel like emptiness if I don't achieve it. I'd think about it for the rest of my life if that were the case.

""Wimbledon might be my best opportunity to win a Grand Slam. I don't know if I have a better chance at the US Open, but either way, I never thought I had unlimited time.""

Men's world No. 1 Jannik Sinner will team up with American WTA standout Emma Navarro for the mixed doubles event at this year's US Open. The tournament, part of US Open Fan Week, is set for August 19 and 20 at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York, with the winning pair taking home a $1 million prize purse.

Sixteen teams have been announced for the two-day event, and Sinner and Navarro are among the most anticipated pairings. Both shared their thoughts on the upcoming partnership, offering fans a glimpse into how their collaboration came together.

Navarro recently described the process behind the pairing, and Sinner also weighed in during his pre-Wimbledon press conference. Interestingly, Sinner revealed that he had never met or texted Navarro before, and that tournament organizers had approached them both to play together for the event.

Sinner gave insight into the development during his pre-Wimbledon press conference. He explained that he and Navarro had never met or communicated before, and that the idea to partner came from the tournament organizers themselves.

Later, in an interview with Tennis Channel after her first-round win at Wimbledon, Navarro playfully described how Sinner had “begged” her to play with him for the US Open, while also complimenting her game.

Navarro said, “Yeah, he was beginning me to play. He was saying, you know, I heard about your volleys and your doubles skills. Please please, will you play with me? I said yeah, sure. I guess, I will play with you. You're not the best player, but I'll make an exception and try to get a better partner next. Yeah, no, I am excited.”

﻿

After sharing the story, Navarro, 24, expressed excitement about the new experience and her determination to perform well for the team.

She added, “I think it's going to be fun. I got to hold up my end of the bargain on my half, and I think it would be really fun. So I am excited.”

Like Navarro, Sinner got his Wimbledon campaign off to a strong start, defeating compatriot Luca Nardi 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 in the first round on Tuesday. When asked about playing alongside the world No. 1, Navarro joked that it was “not too shabby,” but admitted there would be pressure and high expectations.

She said, “Not too shaby. In all seriousness. I'm going to have a lot of pressure and a lot of expectations to live up to there. I know he's going to be hitting clean forehands, backhands, left and right, and aces all over the court. So it will be great.”

In addition to Sinner and Navarro, another high-profile pair for the mixed doubles event is Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu. The Spaniard revealed during the Queen's Club Championships that he had asked Raducanu to team up for the US Open in August.

The two have also been seen practicing together on the Wimbledon courts, showing strong camaraderie ahead of the event.

Sport | Tennis

Coco Gauff vowed to make changes in a bid to find the formula to Wimbledon success.

The second seed was the latest big name to fall in a dramatic first round at SW19, with fellow American Jessica Pegula and Qinwen Zheng sent packing earlier on Tuesday.

Across the men's and women's singles draws, eight top-ten seeds fell at the first hurdle, the most of any Grand Slam in the Open Era.

Gauff reached the Wimbledon fourth round as a 15-year-old but has not bettered that since and her struggles continued here.

Dayana Yastremska took full advantage to secure a 7-6 6-1 win on No1 Court, with Gauff admitting she had struggled to adapt to the surface.

Gauff won the French Open last month but her grass-court preparations consisted of an opening defeat in Berlin.

“I think it's just changing my playing style a little bit, which is difficult, because for me it's like I approach clay and I play this one way for however long clay season is, six to eight weeks, or I don't know,” she said.

“Then I feel like when I go on hard, I don't have to change as much, but I still have to adjust it a little bit. I know on grass I do. I feel like by the time I find it, it's already time to play. It's difficult, but I don't know.

“I have faith that if I can make these adjustments, I can do well here. I really do want to do well here. I'm not someone who wants to write myself off grass this early in my career, but I definitely need to make changes if I want to be successful here.”

There were cheers on No1 Court following Jack Draper's win, as it was announced that Gauff and Yastremska would be moved from their scheduled slot on Centre Court.

But those same fans could not rally Gauff into a comeback as the second set slipped away in double quick time.

The 21-year-old managed only six winners compared to 29 unforced errors, and struggled with her serve throughout as the double fault tally reached nine.

Gauff will now turn her attention to the hard-court swing on home soil, culminating in a bid for a second US Open title at Flushing Meadows later this summer.

“I don't really like losing,” she said. “I don't know, I just feel a little bit disappointed in how I showed up today. I feel like I could have been a little bit better in those tough tie-breaker moments, especially after Roland Garros, where I felt like I learned a lot in those tie-breakers.

“Yeah, I mean, obviously I'm not going to dwell on this too long because I want to do well at US Open. Maybe losing here first round isn't the worst thing in the world because I have time to reset.”

Gauff began to tear up, as she added: “Yeah, definitely sucks.”

Australian Open champion Madison Keys got the better of Olga Danilovic in straight sets to reach the Wimbledon third round.

WIMBLEDON -- Four Top 10 seeds had exited Wimbledon at the first hurdle, and Madison Keys had only just avoided joining the exodus. Two days after pulling through a 2-hour, 41-minute rollercoaster against Elena-Gabriela Ruse, the No. 6 seed was far more efficient in dismissing Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2 in 75 minutes.

In contrast to the baking conditions of the first two days, second-round action began in a more familiar scenario: clouds, cooler temperatures and a two-hour rain delay owing to persistent drizzle. This suited Keys down to the ground.

""I definitely felt a little more comfortable today,"" the Australian Open champion said in her on-court interview. ""It's the cloudy, rainy England we know and love, so that helps a lot. It felt a little bit more normal out here today.""

Keys will next face No. 104-ranked Laura Siegemund, who upset No. 29 seed Leylah Fernandez 6-2, 6-3 to reach the third round of Wimbledon for the first time in her career. The result was the 37-year-old's third Top 30 victory of 2025, and her second at a major following her second-round upset of Zheng Qinwen at the Australian Open. Keys and Siegemund have split two previous meetings, both in 2016, with Keys winning the grass-court encounter 6-3, 6-1 at Wimbledon that year.

Danilovic has been one of the most improved players of the past 12 months, raising her ranking from No. 150 last July to No. 37 this week. But the Serb's surge has mostly been down to her results on clay and hard courts -- her first-round defeat of qualifier Zhang Shuai was her first tour-level win on the surface.

By contrast, Keys is a three-time grass-court titlist and a two-time Wimbledon quarterfinalist (2015 and 2023), and used her wealth of expertise on the surface to pull away after a tight first set. She fired 19 winners to Danilovic's 15, but also used chipped shots adeptly on defense, drawing her opponent into net to set up for winning passes. Meanwhile, Danilovic's tally of 27 unforced errors reflected the 24-year-old being repeatedly caught out by the low bounce of the court.

Keys' seven double faults were the only blot on her formbook -- two particularly wild ones came as she failed to serve the first set out. But she was able to shrug them off each time, and did not drop serve otherwise.

""I definitely knew that I wanted to get the momentum as early as I could, and try to keep it,"" said Keys. ""She's obviously had a phenomenal couple of years and she's had some really big upsets. I knew she could play some really great tennis, so really just wanted to try to get a lead and then just run with it.""

After quelling the power of Ruse and Danilovic, Keys' next match against Siegemund's array of spins and finesse will be a very different test.

""She's always a tricky player,"" Keys said. ""I think she's super crafty, so I think grass highlights that for her, and I thinkall of her tangibles become even more of a weapon. You just know that you're never really going to get the same ball twice. So if you go out looking for any sort of rhythm, you're not going to find it. I think just knowing that going into the match is half the battle, then just having a really solid game plan on how to approach each individual ball that comes at you.""

Keys has taken two losses to players who rely on craft rather than power in this year's grass swing already -- Tatjana Maria at Queen's and Marketa Vondrousova in Berlin. Received wisdom is that grass is a surface for big hitters, but Keys points out that it can reward more than just power.

""Grass highlights certain talents very differently,"" she said. ""Obviously the big hitters, the ball kind of moves through the court really easily. Then you have the craftier players who are able to take the pace and hit these shots that are basically rolling at your feet. I think both have very different challenges.""

There wasn't any doubt over who she'd prefer to see in her draw, though.

""I would probably rather play someone who hits big,"" Keys said. ""Just because that's how I play, so it feels like a little bit more of a rhythmic player that you are playing against -- versus a crafty player you don't really know what you are going to get.""

Aryna Sabalenka is trying to fight her way to her first Wimbledon title. She has mastered the courts at the Australian Open, but grass has never been her best surface. She has the game for success at Wimbledon, but the history of it.

In the second round of Wimbledon 2025, Sabalenka faced Marie Bouzkova, a player who can hit with power that almost matches Sabalenka. To make matters tougher for the WTA No. 1, Bouzkova is Czech, and any and all women's players from that nation should have confidence in London.

Sabalenka wasn't trying to defeat Bouzkova, but the entire culture of Czech women's tennis, which appears to be set on dominating at Wimbledon. The last two champions have come from the country, and in the first round, five Czech women pushed through into the second round.

Several have real chances to make a run at the title, including 2023 Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova and rising player Linda Noskova. But Sabalenka isn't going to be afraid of any player. She has earned that right. 

The Belarusian was tested by good shot-making from Bouzkova, but the Czech could not match Sabalenka's immense power. Few players can, and if Sabalenka learns to volley a bit more, she could be unbeatable in London as long as her serve holds up.

The Belarusian also did what all great players do. In a tight first set, she took control in the tie-break and moved to the lead by winning it 7-4. This happened after Sabalenka was broken late in the set, but she came back to break Bouzkova in the next game.

In the second set, Sabalenka got an early break and simply needed to hold serve the rest of the way, which she did, mostly with ease.

The WTA No. 1 showed no nerves in her final service game, winning at love with smart shots deep in the corners that Bouzkova had no answer for. The Belarusian took the final set 6-4. 

Overall, Sabalenka played an exceedingly efficient match. She finished with 41 winners against just 18 unforced errors, and 28 of her 35 net chances. She faced only one break point. She feels like more of a threat to win Wimbledon in 2025 than in any previous year.

World No. 3 Alexander Zverev admits he feels “alone” and “empty” after his shock first round exit at Wimbledon to Arthur Rinderknech.

The German was one of the biggest casualties added to the seeds scrapheap, falling to the Frenchman after a two-day, five-set marathon.

The three-time grand slam finalist, beaten 7-6 (3) 6-7 (8) 6-3 6-7 (5) 6-4, opened up about his mental health and revealed he will now consider therapy after struggles on and off the court since reaching the final of the Australian Open this year, losing to Jannik Sinner.

The 28-year-old – who has faced allegations of domestic abuse in the past which were unproven and which he has always denied – intends to seek help in the coming weeks.

“It's more mental, probably, I feel very alone out there at times, I struggle mentally, after the Australian Open, I don't know,” said Zverev. “Trying to find ways to get out of this hole, but I keep finding myself back in it. I don't know, I feel generally speaking quite alone in life, it's not a nice feeling.

“Maybe for the first time in my life I'll probably need it.

“I've been through a lot of difficulties. I've been through a lot of difficulties in the media. I've been through a lot of difficulties in life generally.

“I've never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do. It's not necessarily about tennis. Just lacking joy outside of tennis, as well.”

Zverev is the fourth top-10 player to crash out in the first round at this year's Championships – and the highest-ranked – joining Lorenzo Musetti, Holger Rune, and Daniil Medvedev through the exit door.

Rinderknech, the world number 72, was previously best known for having to retire from a match he was winning at last year's French Open because he injured his foot kicking an advertising hoarding.

The 29-year-old said: “I don't even know where to start. My legs are still shaking. I can't do this anymore.

“We started yesterday at 8pm, finish now at 7. What a moment, such emotions.”

...

LONDON (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka was just two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times on Wednesday before asserting herself for a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory over Marie Bouzkova to avoid the sort of surprise that has sent a group of seeded players home.

Four of the top 10 women's seeds failed to make it out of the first round: No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula, No. 5 Zheng Qinwen and No. 9 Paula Badosa. In all, a record-tying 23 seeded players — 10 women, 13 men — were gone by the end of Day 2, equaling the most at any Grand Slam event in the past 25 years.

“Of course you're going to know the overall picture. ... I hope it's no upsets anymore in this tournament,” the No. 1-ranked Sabalenka said afterward with a chuckle. ""If you know what I mean.”

She is a three-time Grand Slam champion, with all of those titles coming on hard courts at the Australian Open or U.S. Open. She also was the runner-up to Gauff at the clay-court French Open last month — drawing criticism from some over her post-match comments, a flap she and Gauff set aside via social media videos last week — but hasn't been past the semifinals on the grass of the All England Club.

A year ago, Sabalenka was forced to miss Wimbledon because of an injured shoulder.

On Wednesday, the record-breaking heat of the first two days gave way to rain that delayed the start of play on smaller courts for about two hours, along with temperatures that dropped from above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) to below 68 F (20 C).

At Centre Court, the 48th-ranked Bouzkova went ahead 6-5 in the first set with the match's initial service break thanks to a double-fault by Sabalenka. Bouzkova served for that set, and was two points away from it at 30-15 in that game, again at 30-all, then once more at deuce.

But on the last such occasion, Sabalenka came through with a forehand volley winner she punctuated with a yell, followed by a down-the-line backhand winner that was accompanied by another shout.

“That was a tough moment,"" said Sabalenka, who will face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova next. “Until that point, (my) return wasn't great enough to break her serve. I'm really glad ... everything clicked together and I was able to break her back. I kind of like felt a little bit better.”

That sent them to a tiebreaker, and from 4-all there, Sabalenka took the next three points, ending the set with a powerful forehand return winner off a 67 mph second serve. In the second set, the only break arrived for a 3-2 lead for Sabalenka, and that was basically that.

Sabalenka compiled a 41-17 edge in winners while making only 18 unforced errors in a match that lasted a little more than 1 1/2 hours.

What else happened Wednesday at Wimbledon?

Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who is seeded sixth, joined Sabalenka in the third round, beating Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Other players in action later included 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini among the women and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe among the men.

Who plays Thursday at the All England Club?


          Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 major championships at Wimbledon will lead off the Centre Court schedule on Day 4 against Britain's Dan Evans at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET), followed by Iga Swiatek vs. Caty McNally, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. Aleksandar Vukic.

Less than three weeks ago, Oliver Tarvet did not have a wild card into Wimbledon qualifying. Now the 21-year-old is preparing to take on two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Centre Court in the second round of the main draw.

It is similar to the storybook run of Marcus Willis, who was No. 772 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2016 when he faced Roger Federer in the second round of the Wimbledon main draw after advancing through pre-qualifying. A big difference is that World No. 733 Tarvet flew across the world without knowing he would have a qualifying spot.

The Briton, who plays college tennis for the University of San Diego, competed in back-to-back ITF World Tennis Tour events in San Diego the first two weeks of June. After playing nine singles matches in the California heat — including a title campaign in the first event — Tarvet retired during the semi-finals of the second tournament, totally wiped out physically and mentally from a huge effort.

During the second event Ryan Keckley, the head coach at the University of San Diego, received word from Mark Hilton, a national coach for the Lawn Tennis Association, that Tarvet was under consideration for a qualifying wild card. There was no guarantee, but after the semi-finals, Keckley informed his player that he had a chance to receive a qualifying wild card and that they would need to get plans into motion in the hopes of that possibility becoming a reality.

“We pretty much pulled him into the locker room and said, ‘Hey, you've got an opportunity here. We've got to go try to make the most of it',” Keckley told ATPTour.com. “So he jumped on a plane the next day.”



That gave Tarvet less than a week to travel eight time zones and adjust not only to the big time difference, but from hard court to grass, for one of the most prestigious sporting events on the planet.

“He only really had six days of preparation on the grass before one of the biggest moments of his life,” Keckley said. “And then the next day was the biggest moment, and then the next day was the biggest moment. He's just risen to the occasion every opportunity and chance he's gotten.”

In the 11 sets Tarvet has played since beginning his qualifying run, the home favourite has lost just one. Before last week Tarvet had never faced an opponent ranked higher than World No. 367 in a professional match, and now he has the opportunity to take on a five-time major champion.

“He's done it with a lot of hard work. He's not afraid of work, and he's always prioritised his tennis over any kind of academic priorities that he might have,” Keckley said. “He's not a guy that ever skips a day. So when you put that many consecutive days of healthy practices, thoughtful, mindful practices, and you have some of the skill sets that Ollie does, good things are bound to happen.”








Tarvet, who is entering his senior season at USD, made an immediate impact on his head coach three years ago. The Briton's work ethic has shone through consistently during his time as a Torero.

“[Juniors] go to college tennis and everyone says they want to be a pro and quite frankly, very few are willing to do what it takes to become a pro. And Ollie was different in that regard,” Keckley said. “He texted me at 8 p.m. on a Tuesday and maybe some other college students would be at the library, some would be at the bars or socialising. He was underneath the lights hitting forehands with another player and it wasn't just a one-time thing. It was continuous.”

That dedication has helped Tarvet become a multiple-time qualifier for the ATP Next Gen Accelerator, which was created to increase the development pathway for top players in the American collegiate system by providing direct entry into ATP Challenger Tour events. The 21-year-old's plan is to take the fall off from school to make use of those entries before returning to school in the spring.

Tarvet has not lost an official completed singles match in college or the pros since November, a stretch during which he has won 31 consecutive completed matches.

“His confidence is at an all-time high,” Keckley said. “So you're taking a very confident kid who believes in himself, believes in the work that he's put in, has an extremely high tennis IQ and you're putting him in an opportunity to win in an uncomfortable environment… He gets comfortable in the uncomfortable. He buys into the mentality.”

Keckley is not someone who cries, but when Tarvet defeated fellow qualifier Leandro Riedi on Monday in the first round of the main draw, the coach was emotional, full of pride for someone he watched make a dream come true.

“That moment, I'll never forget it because he just comes over and he gives you the biggest, sloppiest, wettest hug possible and you are just embracing every second of it because he's just made a name for himself,” Keckley said. “Not only in the United States, because he had a name for himself in the U.S college system, but in the LTA and worldwide.” 

There is no doubt that there is a huge gap between the experience Alcaraz and Tarvet will walk on Centre Court with Wednesday. But according to Keckley, his charge is someone who “eats and breathes and loves tennis”, and handles big moments “exceptionally”.

“We've got to first focus on our side of the net, focusing on what makes Ollie special, and he's very special. [it is about] getting his mind right and staying within what he is capable of doing, and then the rest is adjustments along the way,” Keckley said. “But he is a very capable tennis player and every challenge that has been put in front of him, he's matched and risen to the occasion. 

“So tomorrow we're going to go out there and the lines are the same, the balls are the same. The surface is a little different from San Diego, but we're going to focus on our side of the net.”

Thirteen men's seeds and 10 women's seeds are out before round two, including four of each tour's Top 10. How much can be chalked up to burnout?ByPeter BodoPublished Jul 02, 2025 copy_link

It wasn't so long ago that the buzz in tennis was that, age-wise, “30 is the new 20.” Led by the Big Three, but including players like Fernando Verdasco, Feliciano Lopez and even “Dr. Ivo” Karlovic, these veterans were still belting out winners in their late 30s.Given the fitness level of those players, was 40 destined to be the “new 30?”It seemed a preposterous idea—and it was. Last year at Wimbledon, the average age of the final four men, despite the presence of 37-year old Novak Djokovic, was 27. That's right in the developmental sweet spot. The champion Carlos Alcaraz was 21, and semifinalist Lorenzo Mussetti was 22.But the recent success of this youth uprising (the cohort also includes Jannik Sinner, Jack Draper, Jakub Mensik and new sensation Joao Fonseca) has a darker side. Some of the more consistent players, stalwarts who had challenged and occasionally toppled the Big Three+ opponents, may be struggling with burnout—or something akin to it.

Granted, the first day at Wimbledon was a lousy day for many top players. But losses by three of the game's bigger, bankable stars—Daniil Medvedev, Matteo Berrettini and Stefanos Tsitsipas—were thought-provoking. All three seeded players have reached Grand Slam finals and still are in their primes.Other seeds struggled in the heat wave gripping London during the first two days of what can only be called carnage. On Monday, the ATP also lost No. 8 Holger Rune and No. 16 Francisco Cerundolo, along with two other seeds. The WTA suffered three casualties, the highest being No. 9 seed Paula Badosa.Then came Tuesday. ATP stalwarts Alexander Zverev, the No. 3 seed, and No. 7 Mussetti, led a parade of six seeds to fall, while No. 2 Coco Gauff, No. 3 Jessica Pegula and No. 5 Qinwen Zheng also were eliminated.

Well, [I'm] not panicking. Daniil Medvedev

Medvedev, a former No. 1, five-time major runner-up and former US Open champion, is still just 29, but he's hit upon hard times. He's won 20 ATP titles, but not one since May 2023. He has lost his last six finals, his ranking is down to No. 9 (for now), and he lost at Wimbledon to No. 64 Benjamin Bonzi.“I would be surprised if you find a match of him playing like this any other match this year,” Medvedev told reporters afterward.The lanky Russian's response to his and other recent setbacks has been philosophical analysis mixed with a tendency to whistle past the graveyard.“Well, [I'm] not panicking,” Medvedev said after the loss, while allowing that he was “really worried” after losing in the first round at Roland Garros—and then failing in his second match at the ATP 250 event at 's-Hertogenbosch. Medvedev righted his ship at Halle (he lost the final to Alexander Bublik), but stumbled on Monday.It's a lot of losses in a row [lately], different ones,” he said of recent defeats doled out by the likes of clay-court experts including Casper Ruud and Mussetti. “[I'm] not too worried,” he concluded, adding that he looked forward to the upcoming segment on his preferred hard courts. But the pressure will be on.

I'm just trying to find that balance again, of how can I go match after match feeling the freshest that I can. Stefanos Tsitsipas

Tsitsipas, with an age and rank of 26, is a former ATP No. 3 and two-time finalist at majors. He's been struggling for over a year now, partly due to a back injury that flared up at Wimbledon, where he abandoned his match after losing the first two sets to ATP No. 113 Valenti Royer. Tsitsipas had arrived at Wimbledon with high hopes—and some baggage besides injury issues.“I was playing good tennis (going into Wimbledon),” he said after the loss. “I felt like I had a good chance at Wimbledon. I really don't know what else I can say. It's tough to wrap my head around what happened.”A few weeks ago, on his best surface at Roland Garros, Tsitsipas lost to Italian qualifier Matteo Giganti. In a somber press conference afterward he admitted to feeling flat: “I have been fresher for sure in the past, and I'm just trying to find that balance again, of how can I go match after match feeling the freshest that I can.”Tsitsipas also alluded to the disruptive impact being made by younger players: “The lineup right now is much more difficult than it was back then (circa 2021). Players are so much more mature. Shots have changed. Players [are] playing with two forehands almost. I have to adapt my game. I have to consider certain things moving forwards because it's growing a lot in intensity, and physically it has never been in a position like now.”

Tennis has been in the last months really tough for me. Matteo Berrettini

The keyword is “intensity.” The word helps explain the comparable struggles faced by a number of other under-30 players once tabbed for big success even if, like Medvedev, they avoid speaking it. The game has become ever more grueling. In 2024, Wimbledon featured 37 five-set matches—the most at a major in the Open Era. It's no coincidence that loss of intensity and burnout have become issues for players of a certain age.Matteo Berrettini may be the most alarming case among all of them. The charismatic, 6'5"", 29-year-old was seeded No. 32. A former Wimbledon finalist, he was knocked out after a five-set battle with Poland's No. 109 Kamil Majchrzak. Berrettini later told the media of his struggle to find intensity and confidence:“I'm going to say something that's maybe not correct [proper]. Tennis has been in the last months really tough for me. I think you could see it on court today. I am really sorry for the people that helped me to get here and everybody that made it possible. I'm talking about physically, and obviously tennis-wise—and everything. But, honestly, this is not the way that I wanted to be on court [I wanted to] enjoy being out there.”

This was an extraordinarily frank admission from a player who has had more than his share of injury blues and who won three ATP titles last year—but also watched some of his Italian compatriots rocket past him in the rankings.“I surprised myself at the [good] level I can have, but that's not the issue for me,” said Berrettini, who missed two months and only picked up a racquet again the Tuesday before the start of Wimbledon. Instead he was disappointed by his lack of joy.“My team thought that coming back here, such a special place for me, would help me to feel better, but it didn't. I just have to take some time and think about my future, because this is not the way I like to spend my time on court.”Perhaps Berrettini will find his joy again. Medvedev may recapture his consistency and appetite.

The American has a slight edge in the head-to-head, but the southpaw will like his chances in front of a home crowd.ByZachary CohenPublished Jul 02, 2025 copy_link

I'm envious of the fans that will be in attendance for a second-round meeting between Cameron Norrie and Frances Tiafoe at Wimbledon. These are two very talented players with big personalities, and they should put on a show at the All England Club. Tiafoe is understandably the betting favorite coming into this one. He's one of the most popular players in the world, and he's ranked nearly 50 spots ahead of Norrie in the ATP rankings. However, Norrie is the home favorite, has always enjoyed playing this event and has played Tiafoe close in the past. There's no way he should be out there at +142 odds.Tiafoe has won two straight against Norrie, but one win was a 6-4, 6-4 victory at Indian Wells in 2023, and the other was a 6-4, 7-6 (4) win in Vienna last year. Both of those matches were competitive, and Norrie does have one win over Tiafoe under his belt. It's not like this is some extremely lopsided head-to-head series. That said, there won't be some sort of mental edge for Tiafoe when he heads to the court. If anything, Tiafoe is a player that is used to having the crowd in his corner, but he's going to have to deal with a pro-Norrie atmosphere.

Stylistically, it's also hard not to like what Norrie brings to the table on grass. While Tiafoe is a slightly better server, Norrie is plenty capable of cruising through his service games. Tiafoe only has a 16.4% break percentage on this surface in his career. Meanwhile, Norrie's break percentage is a little closer to 20% on the grass. That might not seem like much of a difference, but it definitely could play a role in deciding who wins this one. I also like Norrie's flat backand, which barely clears the net and can be tough for opponents to dig out, especially on grass.Norrie is going to need to have a solid day from the forehand wing. That was the swing shot the last time these two met. In Vienna, Tiafoe had a forehand Shot Quality of 8.1 and Norrie had a forehand Shot Quality of 5.0, according to TennisViz and Tennis Data Innovations. Tiafoe was also well aware of how poorly Norrie was hitting from that side of the court, so he targeted it relentlessly. I'm not sure he'll be able to do that this time around. After a slow start to the season, Norrie has started to find his confidence again. He's 9-4 in his last 13 matches, and he's hitting that forehand a lot better. In 2024, Norrie only made 84.0% of his forehands. In 2025, he's making 87.0%. That's a significant increase when it comes to finding the court.This just feels like a coin flip, but I personally think the coin is a little weighted towards the Brit's side with this one being played in London. Norrie is worth a shot at these enticing odds.Pick: Norrie ML (+142)

Naomi Osaka's 2025 Wimbledon draw ostensibly opened up when No. 5 seed Zheng Qinwen fell in the first round, but is the former world No. 1 in for an even bigger challenge against Zheng's conqueror Katerina Siniakova?“Siniakova is a very good grass-court player,” Lindsay Davenport said of the WTA doubles No. 1, who peaked at No. 27 in singles. “She hits the ball very flat and through the court. But this is a good section of the draw for Osaka if she can make her way through, but I'm split. I'm torn.”Siniakova shocked Zheng for the second time in three years at the All England Club, improving to 3-1 overall against the reigning Olympic champion.

“When we were talking about unseeded players, I was looking at Katerina like, ‘She might actually pull this upset off [vs. Zheng Qinwen],” added Davenport, a former No. 1 and 1999 Wimbledon champion.Osaka eased through her opening round against Australia's Talia Gibson, but the four-time Grand Slam champion has never been past the third round at Wimbledon despite her big game.“I don't like Osaka's chances in this match,” said Jim Courier, a fellow former No. 1. “She's probably the favorite from the oddmaker's standpoint, but boy, Siniakova and her style of play, I would like her in this match.”“She robs you of time, goes hard up the middle quite a bit,” added Prakash Amritraj. “She forced a bunch of errors off that Zheng forehand. I think Osaka likes to dictate and grass sometimes rushes her a little bit too much. It's probably a 50-50, but I might lean towards Siniakova.”

Siniakova and Osaka are 1-1 in their head-to-head, the Czech winning their lone Grand Slam match at 2019 Roland Garros.

Osaka, who returned from maternity leave at the start of the 2024 season, won just one match in the lead-up to Wimbledon, taking out Olga Danilovic in a pair of tiebreakers at the Bad Homburg Open. She was last in the third round of Wimbledon in 2018, falling in the second round to Emma Navarro in 2024, and hasn't been in the second week of a major tournament since winning the 2021 Australian Open.Still Davenport was optimistic that Osaka could top that result—perhaps later this season if not at SW19.“You'd think that something is coming for Osaka with how hard she's been practicing. She looks fitter out there,” she said of Osaka, who has been working with coach Patrick Mouratoglou since last year.Osaka and Siniakova will play on No. 2 Court on Wednesday.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's fierce battle in Austria

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Bortoleto challenges Alonso in Spielberg

Lawrence Barretto explains the state of play after Alpine enquired about the availability of 10-time race winner and current Mercedes reserve Valtteri Bottas.

Alpine have enquired about the availability of 10-time race winner and current Mercedes reserve Valtteri Bottas, should they decide they want to change their line-up this season or beyond. F1 Correspondent Lawrence Barretto explains the state of play...

Well, they're not so much chasing as they are exploring their options.

Alpine are in something of a transitional year – and with the Enstone-based team swapping to Mercedes power next year as part of an overhaul of the squad under the stewardship of Flavio Briatore, they are keen to get their driver line-up right for 2026.

Pierre Gasly is, without question, part of their plans. Their second seat is trickier.

They've already made a change this season, bringing in Franco Colapinto to replace Jack Doohan (with the latter back to reserve and the bench) from Imola onwards.

Colapinto hasn't hit the ground running like he did in his super sub performance for Williams and has yet to score a point in five races with the squad.

However, it must be said that the car has lacked performance relative to its rivals and, since Colapinto joined the team, his team mate Gasly has scored just once with eighth in Spain.

Alpine continue to back Colapinto – and believe he is capable of delivering.

But as 2026 edges ever closer, Briatore is doing what you'd expect him to do – keeping his finger on the pulse and ensuring he knows what his options are going forward, hence why sources say he contacted Mercedes to check on Bottas' availability.

My understanding is that Mercedes will not stand in Bottas' way should he be offered a race seat elsewhere.

I believe Bottas is contracted to the Silver Arrows, where he won all of his 10 races, until the end of the year – and then he is free to make his own decisions with regards trying to find a race seat (or worst-case alternative role) next season.

His boss Toto Wolff is a big supporter of Bottas and believes he is still operating at a high-level and is deserving of a place on the grid. So, it's no surprise they would accommodate a request should one be made for his services, especially as Alpine will be running the Silver Arrows' engines next year.

It's two-fold. Briatore finds the team's currently level of performance concerning. With Alpine locked to the bottom of the Constructors' Championship, he wants short-term progress soon.

Having two strong drivers delivering consistently can have a significant impact – as Williams are seeing with their experienced line-up of Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz.

Secondly, he wants the team to take advantage of sweeping changes to the aerodynamic and power unit regulations next season – and the arrival of Mercedes power, which is widely expected to be among the best, if not the best, engines next year.

Bringing on someone with Bottas' experience could help on both counts.

Teams' standings after Austria

The Finn has 247 Grands Prix to his name, has won 10 races, scored 67 podiums and taken 20 pole positions. He excelled during his time at Mercedes, particularly with regards to his one-lap pace, and made a positive impact during his three years at Sauber.

His time at Mercedes has given him recent insight into how a race-winning team is operating while he is believed to have been fully plugged into the development of the 2026 car. He even had some seat time with McLaren earlier this year in a 2023-spec car.

Alpine could benefit from Bottas' presence in the race team – and there will be those internally who are fans of his given he was in contention for a seat there this year before the management changed and opted for Doohan.

One thing is for sure, Bottas is hungry to return to a race seat and more motivated than ever.

He took the Mercedes reserve role (to stay relevant, fit and connected to the sport) and is keen on discussions with newcomers Cadillac about a race seat next year.

The Finn would back himself to deliver if he gets a shot at Alpine – and you'd expect he'd be interested in a deal that allows him to drive next year, too, for security. His experience with Mercedes power could be invaluable.

Such a move would help him get race sharp again so that even if Alpine don't retain him, he would be even more appealing to the likes of Cadillac, as they look to hit the ground running on debut next year.

For now, it's business as usual and Colapinto will be in the car at Silverstone and beyond.

If Alpine decide they want to pursue an alternative, preliminary talks with Mercedes would likely continue, with Bottas and his management also being drafted in if things accelerate.

Absolutely, but every driver is under pressure to perform – and Colapinto is no different.

Briatore's move to explore options will raise that pressure, but it might trigger a step up in performance for the Argentine driver.

Silverstone is a circuit which the 22-year-old has performed well at in junior formulae – and he'll have fond memories of the place having made his Grand Prix weekend debut there last year when driving for Williams.

If Colapinto improves his results, Briatore won't need to change anything for now. And just knowing Bottas is available gives Briatore and Alpine flexibility.

The weather forecast is in ahead of the British Grand Prix from Silverstone.

Great Britain will host Round 12 of the 2025 F1 season this weekend, but what does the weather have in store for the drivers at Silverstone?

As things stand, it looks like mixed conditions could be on the cards across the three days of action, with sunshine early on making way for potential showers as the weekend progresses.

McLaren were the team to beat last time out in Austria, where temperatures became increasingly hot throughout the event. The squad will be hoping for more of the same this time around, though the forecast suggests that Silverstone will not be quite as warm.

Mercedes, meanwhile, are known to prefer cooler weather, with the W16 seeming to go well on occasions where the temperatures have dropped. How will the Silver Arrows fare this weekend?

Christian Horner has offered his response after being quizzed on reports Mercedes are having 'conversations' with Max Verstappen, amid George Russell's contract discussions with the team.

Christian Horner has had his say on the reports that Mercedes are having ""conversations"" with Red Bull's Max Verstappen about a possible switch, calling it “a lot of noise” as the chatter intensified in Austria.

The reports rose to the surface in Spielberg amid the situation surrounding George Russell's contract discussions at the Silver Arrows, with the Briton's current deal expiring at the end of 2025.

When quizzed in Austria about the process of agreeing a new deal, Russell stated that he was more focused on performance than “pressing massively” to get something signed, despite conceding that “it does help if there was pen on paper”.

He also went on to tell Sky Sports F1 that it was ""only normal that conversations with the likes of Verstappen are ongoing"".

Verstappen himself also dismissed the talk over the weekend in Austria, instead wanting to focus on racing – while his boss Horner was also questioned about the reports.

“It is a lot of noise, and I think Max [Verstappen] gets quite annoyed by it,” Horner told Sky Sports F1.

“We are very clear with the contract we have with Max until 2028. Anything is entirely speculative that has been said. We tend to not pay too much attention to it.

“I can imagine George is frustrated that he hasn't been given a contract yet, but that's between him and his team.

“The situation with Max – we know clearly where we are at, as does Max. Everything is subject to noise and obviously within the contract remains confidential to the two parties.”

Amid the continued speculation, Mercedes Team Principal Toto Wolff asserted that it was still the case he and Russell wanted to continue the partnership, but recognised the team still needed to have certain conversations.

“[We're] absolutely keen to continue the relationship,” said Wolff in Austria.

“Everything goes its normal course – we have agreed on timings and we're absolutely within that framework, and it's clear silly season starts now.”

""Some conversations you just simply need to have, but it doesn't change my fundamental opinion about how the team is going to go forwards.”

Hollywood icon Harrison Ford blesses partnership with new short film ahead of exclusive Glenmorangie experience at British Grand Prix.

Glenmorangie has been named as the Official Whisky of Formula 1, with Hollywood icon Harrison Ford helping reveal the partnership ahead of the British Grand Prix this weekend.

The partnership marks the union of two icons, steeped in heritage, dedicated to taking their crafts to new heights and is part of part of the landmark 10-year deal between Formula 1 and LVMH – Glenmorangie's parent company.

Ford, who plays himself in Glenmorangie's humorous brand campaign Once Upon a Time in Scotland, marked the partnership in a new short film, and with the same amusing understatement he uses for Glenmorangie's whisky, blessed the collaboration in a word: “Nice.”

Silverstone, site of the first official Formula 1 Grand Prix in 1950, will host a special Glenmorangie experience showcasing cocktails and the exclusive Eagle Speedster Jaguar E-Type, as used by Ford in the whisky's brand film.

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer at Formula 1, said: “As part of our 10-year deal with LVMH, we are delighted to welcome Glenmorangie from the Moët Hennessy Maisons collection as the Official Whisky of Formula 1. We have both been mastering our craft for many years, and we share a commitment to refinement and perfection delivered over time.

“With our mutual respect for tradition, it is absolutely fitting that we are launching our collaboration at the Formula 1 British Grand Prix at Silverstone – the circuit that hosted our first race 75 years ago – and from there around the world for many years to come.”

Caspar MacRae, President and CEO of Glenmorangie, added: “I am thrilled to set in motion Glenmorangie's landmark partnership with Formula 1 – the pinnacle of motor racing. We share with F1 a great pride in our heritage and an unstoppable desire to reach new heights of excellence.

""We look forward to spectacular performances and imaginative serves and hope our collaboration will inspire and excite racegoers throughout Formula 1's 75th anniversary year – and beyond.”

After welcoming tens of thousands of visitors in the Dutch capital already, the Formula 1 Exhibition is staying in Amsterdam for six more weeks.

The Formula 1 Exhibition is extending its stay in Amsterdam by a final six weeks because of incredible demand.

After welcoming tens of thousands of visitors since opening, and receiving overwhelmingly positive feedback, the internationally acclaimed exhibition will now remain at De Kromhouthal in Amsterdam-Noord in the Dutch capital through Sunday, September 7 2025.

The extension means F1 Exhibition remains in Amsterdam one week beyond the Dutch Grand Prix, giving fans the perfect opportunity to enjoy both unmissable events together in the Netherlands.

F1 Exhibition offers an engaging look into 75 years of Formula 1 history, highlighting how the sport has evolved from technical innovation to the personal journeys of its greatest icons.

Visitors explore this rich legacy across seven thematic rooms, featuring standout pieces such as Max Verstappen's 2021 title-winning RB16B, Jim Clark's Dutch Grand Prix-winning Lotus 33, and the dramatic wreckage of Romain Grosjean's Haas from his 2020 crash in Bahrain.

The European tour has already enjoyed successful runs in major cities including Madrid, Vienna, and London, while in the Americas the show opened to critical acclaim in Toronto and Buenos Aires – each showcasing legendary cars, cutting-edge innovations, personal stories, and interactive experiences for fans of all ages, including racing simulators.

“It's fantastic news that the exhibition is being extended – a clear sign of how much it resonates with fans,” said former F1 driver, and ambassador of the F1 Exhibition Amsterdam, Robert Doornbos. “As an ambassador, I'm incredibly proud to be part of an experience that brings the sport to life in such a powerful and inspiring way.”

Jonathan Linden, Co-CEO Round Room Live and Producer of The Formula 1 Exhibition, commented: “We are delighted with the popularity of the Formula 1 Exhibition in Amsterdam and are thrilled to extend our run there.

""With the Dutch Grand Prix coming up as well as the summer holidays in Amsterdam, we expect a high-demand for the newly released tickets and look forward to sharing the experience with even more fans.”

Visitors start by entering Once Upon a Time in Formula 1, where legendary cars including the Sauber C17, Williams FW13B and Fernando Alonso's Ferrari F10 are displayed, while in Drivers & Duels legendary rivalries come alive.

Design Lab explores the ground-breaking technologies driving the sport forward, with Revolution by Design showing the technological advances the sport has gone through in the past 75 years, before The Pit Wall delivers an immersive 360° multimedia experience capturing the thrill and strategy of a race weekend.

Each element of the Formula 1 Exhibition is carefully curated to captivate and entertain fans of all generations – a unique and unforgettable experience for every motorsport enthusiast.

The Amsterdam edition also features an exclusive local highlight: Dutch Drive – a tribute to Circuit Zandvoort and the Dutch Grand Prix. This room celebrates the Netherlands' deep motorsport heritage and the passionate ‘Orange Army' that has embraced the sport.

Ahead of becoming Audi's works team in 2026, Sauber have opened their new Technology Centre at Bicester Motion in the United Kingdom.

Sauber have announced the opening of their new Technology Centre based at Bicester Motion in the United Kingdom, marking the next step in the squad's transition into Audi's Formula 1 works outfit in 2026.

With the 444-acre Bicester Motion located in an area known as Motorsport Valley in the Midlands and South East of the country – due to this being where seven of F1's 10 teams are based – Sauber say that the facility will “provide a base for the team to benefit from the expertise within the region and support the Audi F1 Project's HQ in Hinwil, Switzerland, to create a cohesive and integrated approach to all aspects of the project”.

The primary purpose of the Bicester centre in Building 123 is to “enhance and expand the team's technical capabilities, to ensure the team is well-positioned to attract top engineering talent and foster partnerships with leading industry supply chain specialists”.

Sauber previously announced their intention to open the centre earlier in the year as preparations ramp up for their transformation into becoming the Audi F1 factory team from 2026 onwards.

Mattia Binotto, Head of Audi F1 Project, said: ""The opening of the Sauber Motorsport Technology Centre at Bicester Motion is a significant milestone as we prepare for Audi's arrival in Formula 1.

“This facility will allow us to tap into the talent pool in Motorsport Valley and further strengthen our technical capabilities while being part of a thriving cluster at Bicester Motion where you live and breathe motorsport.

“The support it will play to Hinwil will be important to our long-term success.”

Daniel Geoghegan, Chief Executive Officer, Bicester Motion, added: “We warmly welcome Sauber Motorsport in what is an exciting step in its Audi F1 transformation ahead of next year's F1 season.

“It is thrilling that Bicester Motion has been chosen as their UK base connecting into their Swiss and German operations to support their vision to deliver sustainability, innovation, and maximum performance in motorsport.

“They join many other pioneering automotive and aviation companies, along with Motorsport UK, the governing body of this great industry, already based here. We look forward to seeing their team develop and their transformation on and off the track continue.”

The president sued over an interview with Harris on the CBS News segment that he said was deceptively edited to her advantage.



		By Alex Weprin, Winston Cho 

	July 1, 2025 10:26pm	




	In a widely expected but still stunning decision, Paramount Global has agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Trump, who sued over an October interview that 60 Minutes conducted with Kamala Harris.


	Under the deal, announced Tuesday evening, the money will go to Trump's presidential library. It involves an agreement from Paramount, which will not apologize as part of the settlement, to release 60 Minutes transcripts of interviews with presidential candidates after they've aired, according to a statement from the company.

					Bill Moyers, Longtime PBS and CBS Journalist and Documentarian, Dies at 91		
			









	By most legal observers' thinking, the lawsuit was destined for dismissal because of industry-wide norms related to editing interviews. But the deal provides a pathway to regulatory approval of Paramount's sink-or-swim merger with Skydance. 


	At the Paramount shareholder meeting Wednesday morning, co-CEO George Cheeks addressed the settlement, telling attendees that “yes, the company has agreed in principle to settle the lawsuit, and as reported, it does not include an apology.


	“As to the why? Look, companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,” Cheeks continued. “A settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives, rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction.”

	











	In a statement, the legal team for President Trump said that “with this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit. 


	“CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle,” the statement continued. “President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again.”


	Trump's suit, filed in October, alleged that there was “deceptive doctoring” in the interview, with clips of Harris being asked a question but delivering different answers in a preview clip and the final version, as well as the inclusion of a longer section of her response to a question about the conflict in the Middle East. CBS, consistent with practices in other newsrooms, maintained that it merely edited down Harris' reply for the final broadcast, and that she was answering the same question in both cases.


	According to sources, Paramount believes that the suit posed a threat to Skydance's deal to acquire the company, which requires regulatory approval, including the transfer of FCC licenses. FCC chairman Brendan Carr has said that the 60 Minutes interview would come up in the Commission's review of the deal. The FCC has since requested the full transcript and unedited footage of the interview.


	And clearly executives believe that the settlement boosts the chances of the government greenlighting the merger, though it's always possible that the FCC still takes a close look.

	











	Inside CBS News, rumors of the settlement sparked anger and resignation, given how common it is in the news business to edit down long interviews for time constraints. On April 22, longtime 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens abruptly announced his resignation, citing an inability to “make independent decisions based on what was right” for the show. 


	“Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger,” said correspondent Scott Pelley in the first episode of the newsmagazine after Owens' exit. “The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.”


	And on May 19, CBS News and Stations chief Wendy McMahon also resigned, telling staff that “the company and I do not agree on a path forward.”


	The decisions from Owens and McMahon sent shock waves throughout CBS News amid industry-wide concerns of the government's campaign against media over accusations of liberal bias. In December, ABC News settled for $16 million a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump in what was viewed as a major concession for the network.


60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl told David Remnick on The New Yorker Radio Hour that the team of correspondents is already thinking about what comes next.


	“I'm already beginning to think about mourning, grieving. But I'm holding out hope,” Stahl said. “I know there's going to be a settlement. I know there's going to be some money exchanged. I know that. And then we will hopefully still be around, turning a new page, and finding out what that new page is gonna look like.”

	











	Stahl and her colleagues have already asked CBS leadership to make Tanya Simon Owens' successor, though no formal decision has been made as of now.


	The Writers Guild of America East, which reps 60 Minutes and CBS News staffers, criticized the deal and backed the journalists at the news outlets. “This settlement is a transparent attempt to curry favors with an administration in the hopes it will allow Paramount Global and Skydance Media merger to be cleared for approval,” the WGAE stated. “Paramount's decision to capitulate to Trump threatens journalists' ability to do their job reporting on powerful public figures.”


	The arguments outlined in Trump's lawsuit, which didn't allege defamation and also named Rep. Ronny Jackson as a plaintiff, marked a new road map for the president and his legal team to chill free speech by weaponizing the courts. The complaint advanced a claim over an alleged violation of Texas' consumer protection law covering deceptive advertising grounded in the premise that the network's segment with Harris misled the public. It's a way to bypass the legal barriers to asserting defamation. He brought a similar claim in December in a lawsuit against pollster J. Ann Selzer, The Des Moines Register and Gannett, the newspaper's parent company, for “brazen election interference” over releasing a poll showing Harris leading in Iowa, which Trump won.


	CBS argued that its editorial judgments are “non-commercial speech that lies wholly outside the scope” of Texas consumer protection laws. It also said that Trump should have brought the lawsuit in a federal court in New York and not Texas, where judges are more receptive to conservative legal causes.

	











	Trump's picks at various regulatory agencies have emerged as another tool in his arsenal to steer networks away from coverage critical of him and his administration. Carr has threatened to revoke broadcast licenses for stations owned by networks that have drawn Trump's ire under the agency's authority to ensure that public airwaves operate in the public interest. It's a long shot considering there aren't any TV station licenses up for renewal until 2028 — and pulling one in the middle of a term is essentially unheard of — but long-term incentives to stay out of Trump's crosshairs by toning down adversarial coverage persist.

The ancient tradition, a symbolic honor, is believed to have been in action since 1237.


							By 

	Lily Ford



Cate Blanchett will receive the Freedom of the City of London, an ancient tradition used to honor an individual's contribution to the community.


	The Aussie actress, as well as Northern Ireland's Adrian Dunbar, will receive the Freedom of the City for their work in the arts.




	Blanchett is famed for her Oscar-winning roles in The Aviator and Blue Jasmine, as well as high-profile performances in The Lord of the Rings franchise and more recently, Black Bag. She is an activist on issues such as climate change and serves as an UNHCR Goodwill Ambassador, advocating for refugees and displaced people.

	











	Dunbar will be best known to audiences for his role in the hit U.K. police procedural Line of Duty. Among his recent credits is ITV's Ridley and Inside No. 9.

	Both actors have also performed on the stage — at the iconic London venue the Barbican, Blanchett appeared in The Seagull from February to April this year, and Kiss Me, Kate with Dunbar is running from June to September this summer.


	The Freedom of the City of London is one of the city's oldest traditions and is believed to have been going since 1237.


	Chair of the CLC's Freedom applications committee, Alderman Russell, said Freedom is “offered as a way of paying tribute to their outstanding contribution to London or public life, or to celebrate a very significant achievement.”

Uma Thurman and Henry Golding join the returning cast in this follow-up to 2020's adaptation of the graphic novel series about immortal soldiers battling to protect humanity.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	A welcome surprise after months of COVID lockdown and upended release schedules, The Old Guard came along in 2020 to demonstrate that hard-charging action and emotionally textured drama need not be mutually exclusive. Its well-developed lead characters could handle themselves with MMA fight moves, knives, swords and Bronze Age axes. But they also had soulful interiority, their immortality sentencing them to existences of aching solitude and loss. Arriving five years later, Netflix's sequel has most of those elements, but it's missing the secret sauce — Gina Prince-Bythewood's commanding direction.

Charlize Theron and KiKi Layne return as, respectively, the ancient — though still gorgeous, toned and nimble — warrior and the powerful fledgling immortal, along with a solid supporting cast that includes Marwan Kenzari and Luca Marinelli as Joe and Nicky, the gay couple whose relationship spans centuries. Joe's unabashed declaration of love and the passionate kiss they shared in the back of a truck full of macho armored thugs in the first movie was a gift to queer audiences starved for representation in superhero cinema.

The Bottom Line

	
	Gets the job done but stints on the excitement.
	



Release date: Wednesday, July 2Cast: Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Veronica Van, Henry Golding, Uma Thurman, Chiwetel EjioforDirector: Victoria MahoneyScreenwriters: Greg Rucka, Sarah L. Walker

									Rated R,
								1 hour 45 minutes			






	Again adapted by Greg Rucka from the graphic novel series he authored with illustrator Leandro Fernandez, this time working with co-writer Sarah L. Walker, the sequel obviously can't repeat the novelty of its predecessor. But the first film worked not just thanks to the dimensionality of the characters and the charismatic cast. It was also very much about the muscularity Prince-Bythewood brought to the physical action and the corresponding depth she instilled in the emotional beats.

	











Victoria Mahoney, who has directed extensively on episodic television as well as second unit on Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, does a polished job and maintains a confident pace. But the sequel ultimately is more competent than thrilling, and its moments of pathos too seldom resonate.


	The last film ended with Andy (Theron) mysteriously losing her immortality; fellow soldier Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) exiled for 100 years because of a betrayal; and CIA agent Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) switching sides, pledging to use his expertise to cover the group's tracks and steer them to wherever their services were needed. A coda six months later showed Booker drowning his sorrows in Paris, coming home to find Quynh (Veronica Van) in his apartment.


	That immortal was the beloved companion of Andy, way back when it was just the two of them, though the sequel again declines to address the implication that they were lovers. (Why the coyness? Did Netflix think two queer couples were too many?)


	Quynh was condemned for witchcraft 500 years earlier and buried alive at sea in an iron casket wrapped in chains. Her ability, like her fellow immortals, to regenerate every time she dies means she has been coming back to life and drowning again for five centuries. That gave Quynh ample time to feed her hatred for humanity and her rage at Andy, who had promised to be by her side until the end. She's fished out of the ocean and revealed gasping for breath in a brief prologue.

	











	The movie proper gets off to a promising start with its most exhilarating action set-piece, unfolding at a magnificent villa on the Croatian coast where a large arms deal is taking place. (In reality, it's a gorgeous piece of real-estate porn on Lake Como; the production was mostly shot in Italy.) While Nile (Layne) observes from a boat and Joe and Nicky distract some of the guards by speeding off in two vintage sportscars parked outside, Andy and Copley enter the mansion, where she conveniently finds a hefty sword hanging on the wall.


	Mahoney, cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, fight choreographer Georgi Manchev and the cast and stunt crew are all working at the top of their game here, with beatdown after beatdown, intercut with a pulse-racing car chase as Joe and Nicky are pursued by guards. The bravura sequence gets a fresh jolt when Nile abandons her lookout vessel and makes a spectacular entrance.


	Unfortunately, while there are plenty of kickass fight scenes to come, the sequel never quite regains the opening's explosive energy. But nor is it ever dull, meaning fans of the first movie will want to stay the course.


	When the protagonists regroup back at their safe house, Copley informs them that the dead man they believed to be the arms buyer was in fact just a conduit for an unidentified woman, seen in a CCTV photo awaiting facial recognition results. But Nile recognizes her from a dream in a library full of ancient tomes.


	That library is the result of many lifetimes of work by Andy's old friend Tuah (Henry Golding), who dropped out of soldiering to devote himself to documenting the immortals' place in history — the cause and effect of their exploits that Copley traced.

	











	Tuah reveals that several volumes of his work were stolen by a woman of many names, now going by Discord (Uma Thurman), an immortal whose existence predates even Andy's. They learn that Discord has spent five centuries living in the shadows, amassing untold wealth and power. She is now going after an even greater prize, using Quynh to get to Andy and Co.


	Rucka and Walker's script deftly fills in the blanks about the specific way an immortal can become mortal, which provides answers for Andy, as well as the revelation that the surrendered power can be bestowed on another. 


	That leads to affecting developments once the disillusioned Booker is accepted back into the fold. Andy's brooding nature gets fresh fuel with the vengeful Quynh's re-emergence, but with Nile now more accepting of her mentorship, the rapport between those two women acquires a new warmth and humor. “I'm mortal, but I'm not retired,” Andy deadpans when Nile shows concern about her state of mind.


	There's an electrifying fight scene, freighted with emotional baggage and guilt, after Andy tracks Quynh down in Rome and they duke it out in an alley with lots of fancy footwork. While there's no shortage of guns, knives and assorted other blades used in the clashes, the emphasis on physicality, on body against body, is a strength shared by both movies. Ditto the fact that, mortal or immortal, the characters feel the pain of their injuries.


	The hangout scenes once again are pleasurable, even if Kenzari and Marinelli are underutilized aside from their daredevilry in the early car chase. Nothing comes close to the swoony magic of their big moment in the first film, though it's sweet to watch them stagger off to bed together, with Joe playfully berating Nicky over his snoring when he's been drinking. But an intimate scene that appears to be building toward a kiss instead ends with them nuzzling foreheads. Boo! 

	











	Still, the fact that these two have been spared much of the loneliness and sorrow suffered by their comrades because they have always had each other provides a tender note of queer affirmation.


	The climactic stretch, while it folds in some moving moments for Andy, becomes more routine once the action shifts to a Chinese-run secret nuclear facility in Indonesia, rigged with explosives. Everything points toward the inevitable smackdown between Andy and Discord — not to mention between Theron, whose fight skills have been on display not just in The Old Guard, but also in Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde, and Thurman, immortalized as Black Mamba in the Kill Bill movies. But that anticipated face-off underwhelms.


	The cliffhanger ending clearly indicates a third movie in the planning, so maybe the filmmakers are saving their big guns for a final chapter. Whatever its shortcomings, The Old Guard 2 is a better-than-average original streaming feature — well acted by a highly capable cast, peppered with enough action to satisfy most appetites, and underscored with a melancholy vein of introspection about the conflicted roles of superheroes.

Amyl & The Sniffers have issued a pointed statement of solidarity with Bob Vylan and Kneecap in the wake of growing media backlash surrounding the artists' pro-Palestinian messages at Glastonbury 2025, accusing the press of misrepresenting what they say was a festival-wide stance.

	Posting to Instagram Stories on Monday (July 1), the Australian punk rock band criticized the British media's “frenzy” over select sets that included political speech, specifically targeting how coverage framed Bob Vylan and Kneecap as outliers.

	“The British media in a frenzy about Bob Vylan and Kneecap but artists all weekend at Glastonbury from pop to rock to rap to punk to DJs spoke up onstage and there were toned of flags on every streamed set,” the band wrote. “Trying to make it look like just a couple of isolated incidents and a couple of ‘bad bands' so it appears the public isn't as anti-genocide as it is, and trying to make it look like Bob and Kneecap are one-offs, instead of that the status quo has shifted majorly and that people are concerned and desperate for our governments to listen.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	They continued: “And if you don't want politics in music don't blame the musicians, blame the politicians and journalists, and the political landscape in general, for not doing their job, and there'll be more and more of [this] until it stops.”

	











	The statement follows Bob Vylan's controversial performance at Glastonbury, during which the punk-rap duo led chants condemning the Israeli Defense Forces. The BBC later confirmed it “should have pulled” the livestream and did not re-air the performance. Irish rap group Kneecap, who followed Vylan on the West Holts stage, waved Palestinian flags and made their own statements during their set.


	Amyl & The Sniffers — who also performed at the festival — delivered a politically charged set of their own. During a passionate moment onstage, frontwoman Amy Taylor used the platform to discuss colonization, Australia's treatment of Indigenous people, and the importance of political expression. “They want us to shut the f–k up,” Taylor said to the crowd. “Because if we think about Palestine, then back home in Australia, we think about the Indigenous people there… and that's disgusting.”


	Their comments were met with roaring applause, and clips of the speech circulated widely online — though notably, they did not attract the same level of media criticism as Bob Vylan or Kneecap.


	Glastonbury 2025 saw a significant wave of political statements from artists across genres, with Palestinian flags visible at nearly every major stage. Acts from the pop, punk, indie, and dance scenes voiced solidarity, many calling out what they see as governmental inaction and media silence on the ongoing conflict in Gaza.


	Amyl & The Sniffers' statement adds to the growing chorus of artists using their platforms to speak out, echoing a shift in live music where festival stages have increasingly become vehicles for protest and visibility. The band's message is clear: they stand behind artists who speak up — and won't back down from the fight for accountability and awareness.

The fall happened during Malone's performance of ""Pour Me a Drink"" at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.

	Jessica Lynch



Post Malone took an unexpected tumble off the stage during a recent stop on his The Big Ass Stadium Tour — but didn't miss a beat.


	The fall happened during Malone's performance of “Pour Me a Drink” at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz., on Saturday (June 29). As seen in fan-filmed footage that quickly spread across social media, the singer knelt down to toast a front-row fan who had her plastic cup raised, when a piece of the stage gave way beneath him. Malone — still smiling and holding his own cup — suddenly dropped out of frame as the platform collapsed.


	Despite the abrupt fall, the Grammy-nominated artist (born Austin Post) appeared unshaken. He reportedly got back onstage almost immediately, continuing to sing and raising his cup to finish the cheers, drawing cheers of his own from the crowd.

	One fan posted the viral clip on TikTok with the caption, “I am SO sorry Austin. I love you! Such an amazing show,” referencing her role in the moment. Onscreen text read, “I didn't mean to almost break your back,” in a playful nod to the song's lyric: “I've been breakin' my back.”


	Malone's quick recovery brought flashbacks to a more serious onstage accident in September 2022, when he fell through a trapdoor during a show in St. Louis and suffered bruised ribs. That incident led to a hospital visit and prompted the artist to promise fans he'd return to the city for a longer makeup show.


	Malone is currently in the middle of the North American leg of his tour, which supports his F-1 Trillion album. The Arizona show was among his biggest of the summer, and he'll continue the run with more stadium and arena dates before heading to Europe and Asia in August.

	











	“Pour Me a Drink” — the track soundtracking the mishap — is a country-pop crossover duet with Blake Shelton. The song debuted during the 2024 Academy of Country Music Awards and topped Billboard's Country Airplay chart (dated Oct. 12). The collaboration advanced by 5% to 27.9 million audience impressions Sept. 27-Oct. 3, according to Luminate.The song, which Post Malone co-wrote, is his second Country Airplay No. 1, after “I Had Some Help,” featuring Morgan Wallen, dominated for four frames beginning in June. 


	Both hits are from his introductory LP in the genre, F-1 Trillion, which motored in at No. 1 on the Aug. 31-dated Top Country Albums chart and the all-genre Billboard 200 with 250,000 equivalent album units earned in the United States. The set earned 1.1 million units over its first six weeks of release.

	Lorde's new album Virgin has sparked a wave of frustration among fans — but not because of the music. 


	The singer's crystal-clear CD release, promoted for its recyclable design and sleek aesthetic, is reportedly not functioning in many CD players, according to fans across social media.


	TikTok users have shared multiple videos attempting to play the translucent CD, only to be met with errors or silence. “Seems like they didn't account for this,” one fan wrote. “My new Lorde transparent CD doesn't work in this stereo! Seems like older models with older sensors won't play it. pretty disappointing, I know it was for an aesthetic, but at least press it on normal CDs.”

	Lorde's website lists only one CD version — the clear, recyclable edition — which is currently sold out. Multiple vinyl variants of Virgin are also available, but for CD collectors, there's currently no other option.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Fans on Reddit echoed the same issue, with one user writing, “Tried to put the disc into my car CD player and it didn't register at all. I tested another CD and it worked, so it's definitely the disc.”

	











	In an attempt to understand the problem, one TikTok creator hypothesized that the clear CD's lack of a printed label layer may be confusing older optical sensors, which typically rely on reflections and light patterns to read discs. So far, Lorde's team has not publicly addressed the issue.


	The physical design choice — while artistically striking — has left fans calling for a more traditional CD pressing, especially for an album expected to have a long-lasting legacy.


Virgin arrived on June 27 and marked Lorde's return with a new, ambient-influenced sonic direction. 


	On June 30, Lorde shared the album artwork and a breakdown of the album's creation on Instagram, offering insight into the process behind the 11-track record. She revealed that “David” was the first song she started and one of the last she finished, while “Clearblue” was the last track she began. The most difficult song to complete was “Favourite Daughter.” 


	“Hardest song was FD, to write, to produce, to sing,” Lorde shared. “Kicked my a–.”


	Recently, she teased unreleased B-sides and hinted at a deluxe edition in the future, which could offer an opportunity to course-correct with a more playable CD format.

The powerhouse trio join forces on Streisand's new album, The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



Barbra Streisand has dropped a behind-the-scenes video highlighting her recent collaboration with Ariana Grande and Mariah Carey on the stirring track “One Heart, One Voice.” 


	The song appears on Streisand's newly released album The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two, out now via Columbia Records.

	











	Streisand took to Instagram to reflect on the collaboration's emotional core, writing, “When the idea of recording a song with Mariah and Ariana was first suggested, it felt inevitable that it would speak to female empowerment.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	“The lyrics ‘we've got every right to make a choice' resonated with me. The song became a vehicle for three strong-willed women to join in voice and purpose. Thank you to both @mariahcarey and @arianagrande for lending their talent and sharing this special moment with me.”


	In the video, the legendary star reflects on the team-up, saying, “When the idea of recording a song with Mariah and Ariana was first suggested, it felt inevitable that it would address female empowerment,” Streisand shares.


	For Carey, who has often cited Streisand as a personal inspiration, the experience was both surreal and emotional. “Ever since I was a little girl, I've loved Barbra,” Carey says. “So when I got a chance to work with her on ‘One Heart, One Voice,' it was a huge honor.”

	











	Grande, who grew up idolizing both Carey and Streisand, called the moment “a dream come true.” She adds, “Barbra has, quite literally, always been a part of my life. I went to go see Barbra with my mom, and we made it into the concert DVD somehow! We've come a long way from being in the audience to collaborating on the album.”


	The soaring ballad sees all three artists trading lines and harmonizing on a message of unity, resilience, and generational strength. The release marks a major moment for fans of powerhouse vocals and pop history alike, pairing three of the most influential and technically gifted singers of the last six decades.


The Secret of Life: Partners, Volume Two is a follow-up to Streisand's 2014 Partners album, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and featured duets with Stevie Wonder, John Legend, and Blake Shelton. The new collection continues that legacy, featuring collaborations with Paul McCartney, Josh Groban, Hozier, Laufey, and more.


	Streisand, one of the most decorated artists in entertainment history, has notched 11 No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 and earned eight Grammy wins, along with two Oscars, five Primetime Emmys, and countless other honors. Her duet partners on the track are no strangers to accolades either: Carey holds the record for the most No. 1 singles by a solo artist in Billboard Hot 100 history (19), while Grande boasts six No. 1 Hot 100 hits and remains one of the most streamed artists globally.


	“One Heart, One Voice” marks the first time all three artists have appeared together on a single track.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


(Updated with more details) Sean “Diddy” Combs has been found guilty on two counts in his sex-trafficking trial, the jury said today.


	After a total of just 13 hours in the jury room, the panel of eight men and four women found the Bad Boy Records founder guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. However, the jury found Combs not guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The mixed verdict, just read out by the foreman, can only be viewed as a big defeat for the Maurene Comey-led prosecution


	The two counts under the engaging in prostitution charge each carry a maximum sentence of a decade behind bars. Surely stinging from being defeated on the major RICO charge, prosecutors do not think Combs should be allowed out on bond, which is what the defense is arguing for with a million dollars on the table. The defense also wants its client to be able to travel to homes in Florida, L.A. and the Empire State.

	











	Judge Arun Subramanian has asked both sides to submit their POVs to him and the court will gather this afternoon on the bond matter. 


	Certain to face an appeal no matter if the bond is granted or not, today's decision comes after two tense days filled with notes from the jury and an admission late on July 1 that there were “unpersuadable opinions on both sides” when it came to the pivotal racketeering charge. With verdicts on counts 2, 3,4, and 5 — a.k.a.  the two sex-trafficking charges and the two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution – it looked like the month and a half long trial may stumble into a partial verdict at best or worse yet, a mistrial.

	After the verdict was read out, the judge in the case praised the jury, which had a rocky ride at times: “I want you to know that it is inspiring to all of us. You listened, you worked together, you were here every day, rain or shine.” Even before the trial started last month, Judge Subramanian had promised the proceedings would be over by the July 4 holiday — a promise kept. 

	











	For Combs, freedom might also come before Independence Day if the judge rules he can be released on bail – a move that looks likely if for no other reason than the charges the defendant, who has had previous offenses over the years, was found guilty on were of a non-violent nature


	Following nearly a year of abuse and assault allegations, started for the most part by a very quickly settled ($20 million) suit from former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, Combs was arrested in New York City in September on criminal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and more. Failing repeatedly to regain his freedom with a $50 million bail pitch, Combs has been in custody at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center ever since.


	Filled with often harrowing testimony from a then very pregnant Ventura (who got snared in a defense fastball revealing a $10 million payout from an L.A. hotel over a violent 2016 incident by Combs), as well as other rape and abuse accusers' “Jane” and “Mia,” the trial began at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan on May 12. As well as the three victims (and minus a Victim 2 who simply disappeared mere days before the trial), the jury heard from various male escorts hired for the drug-drenched and often filmed “freak-off” sex sessions, rap star Kid Cudi, former Combs employees, law enforcement officials and an expert or two in the prosecution's dense case.


	In a tactic straight out of Harvey Weinstein's last rape retrial, the defense decided not to put their client on the stand and wrapped up their case in around 30 minutes last week with no witnesses at all. In the midnight hour just before closing arguments, the feds trimmed and culled some of the initial charges against Combs claims in what they called an effort to “streamline” the case.


	Attracting a lot of last-minute attention, the largely procedural move changed nothing when it came to a possible outcome of the 55-year-old Combs spending the rest of his life in a federal prison if found guilty on all the charges.


	However, for about an hour on Tuesday it looked as if the case against Combs could at least partially collapse under the weight of the jury's deadlock.


	Buoyed by a rare scenario of agreement between the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York and Combs' 10-lawyer defense bench that the jury should keep deliberating, Judge Arun Subramanian eventually asked the panel to keep at it a bit longer in hopes of reaching a unified verdict. The irony of sorts is that the judge's borderline pleading came right at the end of the day on Tuesday and the non-sequestered jurors went home soon afterwards anyway.


	The New York dozen were back in the courthouse Wednesday at around 9 a.m. ET and back behind closed doors deliberating.


	Surrounded by members of his family like his mother (a near constant presence during the trial) and children, plus lawyers Marc Agnifilo, Alexandra Shapiro, Brian Steel, and others, the now white-haired and sweater wearing Combs was in Judge Subramanian's courtroom first thing this morning too. At one point, Combs took to prayer with members of his family joining in. “Let us pray, please watch over my family,” the “All About the Benjamins” performer said, getting an “Amen” in reply from those assembled.

	











	After the verdict was delivered, Cassie Ventura's lawyer Doug Wigdor put out a statement praising his client. “Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution,” the attorney said in part. “By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.”

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


UPDATED with Trey Parker and Matt Stone‘s statement: South Park fans who have waited for more than two years to get a new season of the hit animated comedy, will have to wait a little bit longer — the Season 27 premiere on Comedy Central, originally slated for July 9, is being moved to July 23. The network has released a new poster for the upcoming season, touting the return of Stan, Kyle, Cartman, Kenny and other popular characters, including Jesus.


	The delay comes amid tension — including a legal threat — over South Park‘s lucrative streaming rights as the series was caught in the uncertainty over Skydance's pending acquisition of Comedy Central parent Paramount Global, which co-owns the joint venture behind South Park, South Park Digital Studios, with series creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone who run it. 

	











	In a statement after South Park's new return was announced, Parker and Stone slammed the move.




			Watch on Deadline		







	“This merger is a sh*tshow and it's f*cking with up South Park,” they wrote on X. “We are at the studio working on new episodes and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”


	The show's $500 million exclusive streaming licensing deal with HBO Max expired a week ago but has not been replaced by a new exclusive one — or multiple non-exclusive ones.


	The latter has emerged as the likely scenario. Paramount Global had long stated that they want the show on the company's streaming platform Paramount+. In May, Paramount Global co-CEO Chris McCarthy told investors on the company's earnings call that “starting this July, [South Park] will be coming to Paramount+ in the US.”

	











	At the same time, South Park streaming rights — believed to be non-exclusive — have been shopped to other platforms, with HBO Max parent Warner Bros. Discovery and Netflix making bids, according to a legal letter an attorney for Parker and Stone's Park County sent recently to RedBird, Skydance and RedBird's Jeff Shell — who is poised to become Paramount Global President upon completion of its proposed acquisition by Skydance — over alleged interference in the deal negotiations. THR reported on the letter, in which Parker and Stone threaten legal action over what the document claims included an attempt to get WBD to agree to a shorter, 5-year term and to take new seasons of South Park after they've had a 12-month exclusive window on Paramount+.


	While the matter is being resolved, the existing 26 episodes of South Park continue to be available on Max as part of an extension during deal renewal negotiations. The show did not launch on Paramount+ July 1 as many anticipated, with no advisory on the status by the streamer, creating confusion among fans. Paramount+, which carries a handful of South Park specials made exclusively for the platform that became the subject of a lawsuit by WBD, is still expected to start streaming the show in time for the new season.


	Co-creators Parker and Stone are executive producers, along with Anne Garefino and Frank C. Agnone II. Eric Stough, Adrien Beard, Bruce Howell and Vernon Chatman are producers. Christopher Brion is the Creative Director of South Park Digital Studios. 


	Here is a teaser for Season 27, which was released at the time of the original premiere date announcement.

	Over the last couple of weeks, Londoners have been gathering every night in the street under the London Palladium balcony to watch Rachel Zegler‘s powerful rendition of Don't Cry For Me Argentina in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's Evita, directed by Jamie Lloyd.


	Yesterday's official opening night was no exception. As ticketed guests walked down the red carpet into the theater, hundreds of people queued for hours on the sidewalk to catch a glimpse of Zegler as Eva Perón for free during her viral balcony scene. Deadline was among the rapt crowd.


	Zegler walked onto the balcony just after 9pm to an adoring audience that cheered her on throughout the 7-minute performance. The outdoor scene was shot live and then relayed onto a big screen to the audience seated in the auditorium. Although Zegler's Perón urged the crowd not to cry for her, several tears were shed after her rendition of the famous song.

	











	Several stars attended the opening night performance, including Keanu Reeves, Pedro Pascal, Sarah Paulson, Ben Whishaw, and Dame Elaine Paige, who created the role of Eva Perón in Evita in 1978.

	After the show, Deadline's Baz Bamigboye spoke to the leading lady about her favorite things about living in London, and her upcoming project with Marisa Tomei called She Gets It from Me with Julia von Heinz directing. You can watch that interview and other top videos from the night below.


Evita will play at the London Palladium for a limited 12-week summer season until September 6.

					By Jesse Whittock 

International TV Co-Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Bella Ramsey has set their next role – as the titular daughter in Daisy Haggard‘s Channel 4 thriller drama Maya. We can also reveal Haggard will make her directorial debut in the Two Brothers Pictures-produced show, alongside co-director Jamie Donoughue (Doctor Who).


Time and The Last of Us star Ramsey will co-lead the six-part series alongside BAFTA-nominated Back to Life star Haggard, who is the writer and creator.


	Ramsey will play Maya, the teenage daughter of Anna (Haggard). The pair leave their lives in London and are forced into a witness protection program with new identities in a small rural Scottish town. The trauma of their past continues to haunt them as the attempt to settle into a new life, with two hitmen intent on tracking them down.

	Channel 4 unveiled the series back in February, as part of a drama slate also including a new version of A Woman of Substance, whose original series remains the UK network's most-watched drama to date, and Adolescence writer Jack Thorne's latest series, Falling.




			Watch on Deadline		







Maya is being billed as atmospheric, darkly comic, aping the warm and humorous style of Haggard's previous shows, which include the Two Brothers-made Back to Life and FX comedy Breeders. Themes in the series include predatory male behavior, family and love, and the unbreakable bond between a mother and her daughter.


	Shooting is taking place entirely in Scotland later this year, with further casting announced in due course.


	“This story and these characters Daisy has created are so alive, nuanced, wickedly funny and scarily dark,” said Ramsey. “Every character jumps off the page, the dialogue is incredibly witty and I'm so excited to get to play Maya opposite Daisy's Anna.”

	











	Ramsey's star continues to rise with the role, and comes after Season 2 of HBO's drama The Last of Us came to a close in the U.S. with a cross-platform audience of 3.7 million. Last year, we reported they are set to portray infamous British terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite, aka the White Widow, in Bruce Goodinson's Girl Next Door, but we hear they are no longer attached. 


	Eslewhere, they were also cast alongside the likes of Ruby Stokes in George Jaques' Sunny Dancer. They have appeared in BBC children's series The Worst Witch and Netflix's animated show Hilda, but first broke through into the mainstream for their role as the fearless Lyanna Mormont in Game of Thrones before landing the lead role in The Last of Us.


Maya will not be the first time Haggard and Ramsey have played mother-daughter roles on-screen, coming after the former played Johanna, parent of Ramsey's titular leader in the Netflix series Hilda.


	“Ever since I first dreamt up this show, there has only ever been one Maya,” said Haggard. “I wrote the part with Bella so clearly in my head and I honestly still can't believe they want to be part of it. Bella is pure magic, just insanely talented, and I can't wait for us to work together. I'm also thrilled to be taking the leap into directing, and excited to have the opportunity to co-direct the series alongside the brilliant Jamie Donoughue.”


	Haggard first came to prominence through roles in BBC comedies Uncle and Episodes, before she co-wrote and starred in BBC Three comedy Back to Life for two seasons. She starred opposite Martin Freeman in parenthood comedy series Breeders, which ran for four seasons, and appeared in Hilda. She also starred opposite to Peep Show‘s Paterson Joseph in BBC drama Boat Story, another Two Brothers series.


	Maya was among the final commissions Director of Film4 and Channel 4 Drama Madden made before it emerged last month he is moving to Netflix in October. He ordered the show alongside Gemma Boswell, Channel 4's Commissioning Editor, Drama. All3Media-owned Two Brothers is the producer, in association with All3Media International, which has international sales. 


	Boswell said: “We are thrilled to have Bella join the cast of Maya. It's testament to the wit and depth of Daisy's writing to entice such fantastic talent and we can't wait to see the dynamic of Maya and Anna on-screen.”


	Haggard is creator and writer and serves as an executive producer, along with Harry and Jack Williams, Sarah Hammond, Alex Mercer and Daisy Mount for Two Brothers. Kenny Tanner is Producer, Donoughue is co-director and co-executive producer and Shaheen Baig is casting director.


	Two Brothers is among the UK's most-prolific drama houses, having made shows such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Prime Video and BBC comedy-drama Fleabag, ITV's Liar, BBC detective drama Baptiste, Boat Story for the BBC and Prime Video, and The Tourist, which stars Jamie Dornan and is for the BBC, HBO Max, Stan and Netflix.


	Two Brothers' Mount and Mercer added: “Bella Ramsey is one of the most incredible talents of their generation and the only Maya we had in mind to play alongside Daisy's Anna. The two characters share such a unique and special relationship and are the heart and soul of the project and we know Bella and Daisy will bring them to life in a way that will resonate deeply with viewers.”


	Haggard is represented by B-Side, Lark and UTA and Ramsey by Conway van Gelder Grant and Gang, Tyre, Ramer, Brown & Passman.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


	The news that Paramount Global will settle Donald Trump‘s 60 Minutes lawsuit for $16 million certainly did not come as a shock to staffers at CBS News.


	For months, there has been a great deal of consternation and even resignation at the prospect of a settlement and the impact that it would have on the news division.


	“People are not surprised but also disappointed,” one CBS News staffer said on Wednesday. “There is hope that if the Skydance deal goes through, that could be a fresh start.”


	CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, in the morning editorial call, noted that the settlement did not include an apology, while urging his team to move forward, per a source. In its announcement of the settlement, Paramount Global also emphasized that there was no apology, as did CBS President and CEO George Cheeks.

			Watch on Deadline		







	Over the past few months, CBS News staffers have had a great deal of consternation over a pending settlement, a prospect that was out of their control. Talks were occurring at the corporate level and having much to do with the circumstances of the pending Paramount Global merger with Skydance Media. Some staffers also have seen the whole affair as obscuring standout work in the news division, particularly in the early months of the Trump administration.


	In the aftermath, a succession of press freedom groups and other organizations have blasted Paramount Global's decision. Trump sued the network over an Oct. 7 60 Minutes interview with his 2024 rival Kamala Harris, claiming that it was intentionally edited to make her look better and boost her electoral chances. CBS News called the lawsuit meritless, and said that there was no deception, and released the transcript in February.


	The network published a story about the settlement early Wednesday morning, quoting legal experts who saw the lawsuit as frivolous. Trump claimed a violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act,  typically used in false advertising and product claims.

	They included Geoffrey R. Stone, law professor at the University of Chicago, who told the network, “That statute is about sales — a salesperson can be held liable for stating that a product has certain positive effects when he knows it doesn't. But CBS is not engaged in advertising here.”


	Within CBS News, there has been some second guessing about how the whole situation could have been handled differently, including that 60 Minutes could have released the transcript of the interview with Kamala Harris much earlier, as some other news organizations routinely do.


	The settlement did include an agreement that in the future, 60 Minutes “will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.”


	As some staffers look to get beyond the whole affair, the legal and corporate aspects are not actually over. A conservative group, the Center for American Rights, filed an FCC complaint over the 60 Minutes broadcast under the agency's news distortion policy. But that has been rarely invoked in the past and under the narrowest of circumstances, while First Amendment attorneys say that the network would have a strong case should it ever come to a fine or other sanction.


	There is also the merger itself. The FCC passed an informal, 180-day timeline to review the deal, and Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, has not said when a decision will be rendered. His spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.


	Unclear is what the ultimate impact that the settlement will have on CBS News, whether that be reputation or ratings. Bill Owens, the executive producer of 60 Minutes, exited the network in April, he said that he no longer make independent decisions about the show. The newsmagazine is consistently a top ratings getter for the network, drawing an average of 8.32 million viewers in its 57th season. As the wrangling over the Skydance-Paramount merger dragged on, the show did a number of hard-hitting pieces on the Trump administration, to the point where the president threatened to file another lawsuit. That potential defamation action also was part of the settlement agreement, per Paramount Global.

How Trump really gains his wealth vs the great businessman he professes to be.
His father gave him millions he puddles away.
He is not pulled himself up by the bootstraps kind of guy.

Shari wants her $8B so they had to settle

I don't know if you can hear this inside your echo chamber, but even if they don't like his personality, normal people living out here in objective reality agree with Trump on most things.

Trump's current approval rating is at 44%. I don't know how you math, but that's not the majority of people “agreeing with Trump.” You're the one in an echo chamber.

‘Normal' people meaning people who look like you, I'm guessing?

I live in a purple state and can tell you most of the people I speak with don't agree with Trump on almost anything. Mainly because they're smart enough to see that he cares only about himself and enriching the already wealthy at the cost of everyone else and the country as a whole.

Time to get off Fox news, Newsmax, and X. Educate yourself.

It's pure corruption but what do you expect from the most corrupt president ever? Shari Redstone wants the merger to go through so she can get her fat payday. 

Paramount's only hope for survival is to use the Ellison billions to turn things around and even then I think they're wasting their money but we shall see.

Never wrestle with a pig…

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Ironheart blurs the line between Marvel prestige and bland comfort TV","https://www.avclub.com/ironheart-finale-recap-episodes-4-5-6","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 04:00:00 GMT","

Did Marvel Studios just produce its first Arrowverse series? Yes, Ironheart is unmistakably a Marvel show—with its budget-busting digital effects and prestige sheen, it can sometimes even look like a Marvel movie—but the final three episodes of the Disney+ miniseries give the uncanny feeling they were beamed in from some parallel-Earth version of The CW. With Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) holed up at Gary's Auto with her friends and family, frantically welding together a new suit in record time, only to have her crew stand around emoting while she processes the next phase of her hero's journey, the back half of Ironheart gave off strong Flash vibes. Gary's Auto had become an ersatz S.T.A.R. Labs: a home base where emotions run high, coffee's on tap, and problems get scienced. Step aside, Team Flash; Team Ironheart is here.

This isn't shade (I happen to enjoy the Arrowverse), but the shoe fits: Like a certain nine-season DC superhero series, Ironheart races past resonance—specifically, the themes of class and marginalization it only gestured at early on—in favor of earnest emotions and a frustrating cliffhanger that left consequences for its lead to be resolved at a later date. (I forget, did Barry Allen ever learn to stop breaking the timeline?) Like The Flash, Ironheart sets up flimsy emotional stakes while occasionally indulging in superhero action but mostly features an ensemble sitting around solving problems caused by a lack of communication. That's Ironheart: dilemmas generated by keeping secrets from trustworthy people, forgiveness given because it's nicer than holding a grudge. Despite all that brimstone creeping in during the finale, the status quo of Ironheart remains uncomplicated and, sadly, uninteresting.

And yet, as we prepare to shelve this series alongside Marvel's other uneven streaming entries, its finale warps the mostly frictionless drama—distilled into astro-glide by the end—into something more spiritually gnarly. After witnessing her AI bestie N.A.T.A.L.I.E. (Lyric Ross) vanish due to magic tinkering by rookie sorcerer Zelma (Regan Aliyah), Riri seemingly trades her soul to a devil she barely understands—Mephisto, or a Kroger-brand version of him (Sacha Baron Cohen)—in exchange for bringing Natalie back. Not a new digital copy, but a living, breathing Natalie. Bad idea? Sure. But it's the kind of impulsive, guilt-driven act a young hero might make and something Ironheart established in its lead quite well. So, what's the price she'll pay? Her soul? Natalie's? After a mostly juiceless first season, this wild twist comes along and demands a second. 

But let me rewind: As episode four begins, we find Parker Robbins (Anthony Ramos), a man of many honeyed words, suddenly at a loss for them after the death of his lifelong friend, John (Manny Montana). Grief is a tight fit for someone used to wearing a billowy number; The Hood is rendered silent, but his eyes write a tome for Riri. (The title might go something like I Know It Was You.) Still, death doesn't slow the Desperito's Pizza crew. There's work to be done, and Riri is central to it. “I have plans for you,” Parker tells her. Meanwhile, Riri's Heirlum misadventure left behind more than a body: The biomesh she borrowed from Ezekiel Stane (Alden Ehrenreich) has been recovered by authorities, exposing his identity and landing him in jail under a domestic terrorism rap. (It's strange that John's body didn't send the cops to Desperito's; maybe he left his business cards at home for once?) Zeke doesn't take her visit well: “You lie, you cheat, you manipulate,” he says, Ehrenreich's eyes swimming with fury. “Even if that means hurting other people.”

Riri needs a solution to at least one of her problems, and magic seems worth exploring. Enter Zelma Stanton, daughter of Maddie (Cree Summer), who, from her perch atop her mother's Wicker Park crystal shop, transports Ronnie, Maddie, and Riri to the “Western Cortex of Neverish,” a nebulous realm where the women can investigate The Hood more freely. We learn Maddie studied at Kamar-Taj (Sorcerer Supreme University), where Zelma hopes to enroll. A more serious revelation unsettles Maddie: “You know how we say there's no bad tech, just bad people using tech? Well, there is bad magic, and it is dangerous for everyone.” This warning finally prompts Ronnie to press Riri for answers. It turns out her casual cool-mom attitude comes from envy. (In happier days, Riri would confide in Gary instead of her.) Riri, not ready to fully unpack this, hops into her suit and flies straight to another mess: Xavier (Matthew Elam), who discovers N.A.T.A.L.I.E.'s existence and is horrified by this digital image of his late sister.

As Riri's life falls apart, Zeke's gets a second lease courtesy of The Hood, who springs him from prison and pulls him into his circle. A fresh start means a new look. His shaved head “is giving store-brand Jason Statham,” according to Slug (Shea Couleé), but the transformation isn't just aesthetic: Parker upgrades Zeke into a willing biotech Frankenstein, which I don't buy even a little. Zeke's speed run to the dark side feels both convenient and underdeveloped; I wish there were a few more scenes to show the depth of his internalized anger. (No such luck—even The Hood gets short shrift in this department.) After all, didn't this bio-nerd feel weird about touching this technology two episodes ago? Now he's grafting it into his flesh?

Anyway, once Slug procures Riri's suit (N.A.T.A.L.I.E. took it after the Xavier drama—how Slug tracked it, who knows), Hood's revenge quest locks into place in “Karma is a Glitch,” and the series finally gets a jolt of action. Natalie go-go-gadgets her way out of Slug's clutches just before they can run Riri down in the street, and Riri, suited up, twists some metal. The effects of the series continue to punch above their weight. The bit where Riri pops the truck into the air while flipping Slug the bird is the kind of gonzo grace note Marvel used to excel at. The high is short-lived: Zeke swings by to tear up her suit with his new bionic abilities, though he spares her life, possibly because his heel turn won't be permanent.

Naturally, Riri's latest low point brings out the best in her friends and family. Gary's Auto comes to life, and his car, which Riri sold between Wakanda Forever and the series premiere, becomes Riri's new protective shell. (This is significant considering she built her suit to protect her family after his death.) Riri rises, powered by the Dark Dimension (courtesy of Zelma) to counter The Hood's magic—and with some new hardware to wield it. As Team Ironheart rushes to finish the new suit, Parker tightens his grip. He fires his crew after failing to ice Riri and asserts control over Zeke, who cuts a path to Parker's ultimate target: his father (Paul Calderón). We find out, too late for the scene to carry much weight, that he kicked Parker out of the house at twelve, took his inheritance, and set him on this dark path. He hands Dad a new contract. “Sign it in ink…or sign it in blood,” he commands, and Dad obeys.

We've seen what the use of The Hood has done to Parker, not just physically (those scars are looking pretty intense) but also mentally. The man has lost himself, enveloped in crimson tatters. This recklessness is mirrored by Riri, who allows Zelma to tap into forbidden magic to upgrade her armor. But Zelma warns that magic has a cost, a price Riri is only too willing to pay. Little did she realize that she'd have to pay in advance. Her first sacrifice, inconveniently, is N.A.T.A.L.I.E., erased by the suit's infusion of magic. 

Parker also feels his cost in the truncated finale, “The Past Is The Past,” where the sum of his choices leaves him feasting alone at the head of his ill-gotten empire. It all started with a handshake with a sinister-looking stranger (Sascha Baron Cohen), who, in flashback, gave Parker his cloak in exchange for… well, he puts it like this: “You won't even miss it.” As for Zeke, his reward for being a dumb-dumb is becoming a lackey, though Riri later manages a hard reset of his systems with a well-placed kick to his groin—a pulled hit, she says, “for the sake of the Stane family name.” Though Zeke complies with this reboot, he, not without affection, insists that they are “not done.” 

All that's left is Parker. It's your standard Marvel boss fight: Riri tests her new gear against The Hood's powers, though how Riri suddenly knows how to wield magic is unknown. (Maybe Zelma gave her a remedial primer during the last episode's montage?) Riri comes out on top, taking The Hood and leaving Parker a weeping mess on the floor. On her way out, however, comes a scene Marvel Zombies have been waiting for since the days of WandaVision: the introduction of Mephisto, sans his scarlet visage (presumably to save on the budget), who gives Riri the same offer he has given many over the millennia—that is, Parker, popes, and a Beatle (poor Ringo). “Tell me: What can I do for you?” the Dark One asks. 

The finale plays with our perception of time. Is Riri back in Gary's Auto, reunited with her friend, or is she just imagining what she knows she can't have? The answer comes quickly, and the moral ambiguity is both compelling and frustrating. Turns out, Riri hasn't learned the cost of taking shortcuts. She hasn't re-coded Natalie. She hasn't reckoned with her impulse to fix everything through force or magic. Despite her brilliance, she's stuck in a loop. That might be the most Marvel thing about Ironheart: not the cameos or the setup for the next story, but the feeling that growth always remains one installment away.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Jason Blum understands why audiences didn't want to play with M3GAN 2.0","https://www.avclub.com/jason-blum-m3gan-2-0","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 05:11:00 GMT","

Following years of hype, an inescapable ad campaign, and a popcorn vessel with a detachable face, M3GAN 2.0 flopped at the box office over the weekend. While many in the industry have been playing Monday morning quarterback over why, Jason Blum called into Matt Belloni's podcast, The Town, to explain what went wrong with the movie everyone thought they wanted. It's the latest in a string of disappointments for the reliable mid-budget hitmaker, with Wolf Man, The Woman In The Yard, and Drop all disappointing before M3GAN 2.0 swooped in on a wingsuit. “If Blumhouse is in a slump, I'd like to tell that story,” Blum said. “I don't want other people to tell that story.”

Blum isn't sugarcoating it for himself. People did go to the multiplex last weekend, just not to see his movie. They'd rather see Brad Pitt show the youngsters how it's done than watch M3GAN confuse her brand. “Clearly, there is a huge audience who is excited to go to the movies,” he continued. “We can't figure out what movies they wanna go see.” Ultimately, it sounds like they tried to make all the movies they might want to see, treating M3GAN as everything other than the mean girl bot who kills people who disrespect her bestie. Blumhouse thought she “was like Superman,” and like Superman, “We could change genres, we could put her in the summer, we could make her look different, we could turn her from a bad guy into a good guy.” She had all those classic Superman traits, but Belloni concludes that audiences wanted “something the same but different.” However, after two years of memes and an antagonistic ad campaign, it felt like Blumhouse was leaning too hard into the joke with M3GAN 2.0. Deliberately camp is a difficult tone to pull off, and whereas M3GAN felt like it came out of nowhere, with M3GAN 2.0, the character became a forced meme, and nobody wants that. Still, a sequel to a massive hit bombing at the box office? It really is, as Blum puts it, “a classic Hollywood story.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","The Old Guard 2 is half an entry to a flailing franchise","https://www.avclub.com/the-old-guard-2-review","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 08:01:00 GMT","

If Netflix's new action sequel The Old Guard 2 told a self-contained story, it would be easy to praise as a good-not-great follow-up to one of the most quietly compelling action movies of the decade. But there's something more complicated going on here. Where the first Old Guard occasionally felt like a pilot for a riveting new TV show, The Old Guard 2 plays more like a cliffhanger season finale. Even more so than Avengers: Infinity War or The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, this film is a middle entry designed to tease a grand conclusion that won't come until the final installment.

The trouble is, the film's much-delayed release schedule isn't a huge vote of confidence that Netflix wants to “renew” this particular trilogy. The Old Guard 2 was filmed back in 2022, but had to pause its post-production due to corporate regime changes and the various Hollywood strikes. So far, Netflix hasn't announced any details about if or when a third installment might arrive, which makes it especially odd to watch a movie that leaves so many of its themes and story beats unfinished. And, unfortunately, that's not the only way in which The Old Guard 2 is less than the sum of its parts. 

The strength of the first film came from the contemplative existentialism and nuanced subtextual character work that director Gina Prince-Bythewood and her cast poured into Greg Rucka's story of immortal warriors working as for-hire mercenaries. What could have just been a basic, well-choreographed action vehicle became something much bolder and more nuanced—a bone-crunching hand-to-hand combat flick that also dealt with depression, suicidal ideation, centuries-spanning queer love stories, moral purpose, and the lived-in friendships of “boss” Andy a.k.a. Andromache of Scythia (Charlize Theron) and her crew of fellow immortals.  

This time around, however, Prince-Bythewood has handed over the directing reins to Victoria Mahoney (Yelling To The Sky) who takes a much more straightforward approach to the material. The cast is back, as is Rucka (who also wrote the graphic novels on which the series is based) so in that sense there's welcome continuity between the two films. But The Old Guard 2 is broader, zippier, and more caught up in explaining the rules of its immortal superheroes rather than simply living in their complex emotional reality.   

At first the vibe shift is fun enough. Where the action scenes of the first film took place in sandy deserts, cramped drug-running planes, and dimly lit backrooms, The Old Guard 2 opens with a heist sequence set inside a brightly lit mansion filled with gaudy neon-colored art. Though Andy lost her immortality in the last film, she found her zest for life again (not to mention a new mullet). She's now happy to joke around with new immortal Nile Freeman (KiKi Layne) and non-powered ex-CIA operative James Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) as they take out security guards, all while everlasting couple Joe (Marwan Kenzari) and Nicky (Luca Marinelli) pull their best Fast & Furious as a distraction. 

It's sweet to see the centuries-old crew in a happier era, and the film has a darkly funny runner about how the immortals handle losing limbs on the battlefield. (Apparently even a beheading isn't enough to take them down.) Yet the emotional stakes start to feel a little odd when we learn it's only been six months since the events of the last film. That's not a particularly interesting amount of time for Nile to have spent grappling with her newfound existence. And it's almost comical how quickly banished betrayer Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) reconnects with the group after they exiled him for 100 years at the end of the last movie. (Is six months even enough time to miss someone when you're immortal?)

Half a year also seems awfully quick for Andy's long-lost bestie Quỳnh (Vân Veronica Ngô) to adjust to modern life after 500 years spent trapped in an iron maiden at the bottom of the ocean. Yet, as the last movie's epilogue explained, she's back and not exactly thrilled that Andy didn't find a way to save her in all the centuries she was alive. Instead, the rescue credit belongs to Uma Thurman's hilariously named Discord, who joins Henry Golding's Tuah as mysterious new characters with their own connections to the immortal crew. 

Unfortunately, where the first Old Guard kept the exposition to a minimum, The Old Guard 2 is the sort of movie where characters pull books from a secret library in order to point out ancient pictographs that explain exactly how the immortal “powers” work. What once felt like an abstract quirk of fate now gets all sorts of different rules and rituals that, ironically, rob this story of its magic. The heart of the film should and sometimes does belong to Andy and Quỳnh and their tense, emotionally fraught reunion. (Mahoney's most impressive directorial touch is a stylish time-hopping oner that tracks their long history together.) Yet the script too often gets sidetracked by mystical schemes that feel like they belong in a much goofier fantasy film—as does Thurman, who channels some campy mid-aughts action antagonist energy in a role that doesn't really call for it. 

Thankfully, the returning cast know their characters well enough that there's still nuance here. Marinelli gets to deliver the big romantic monologue this time around and Schoenaerts gives pathos to Booker's rushed arc. Theron and Layne are reliably great co-leads, even if Nile gets too little focus. And Ngô gives Quỳnh a welcome amount of depth that isn't necessarily there on the page. Still, on the whole, Prince-Bythewood's humanistic approach has been replaced by something more generic. The clunky dialogue stands out more when there are no quiet observational pauses between the lines. Even the action is a little less human this time around, rooted in heightened martial arts wirework and vehicular CG spectacle as much as bloody gun vs. axe battles.

The Old Guard 2 is still a relatively enjoyable watch, particularly for those who fell in love with these characters in the first film. But with how little it wraps up its themes and arcs, it's hard to recommend it as a standalone story. The best thing about The Old Guard 2 is that it will help people appreciate just how special the first film truly is.

Starring: Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Matthias Schoenaerts, Vân Veronica Ngô, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Uma Thurman, Henry Golding

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Jimmy Swaggart, infamous and scandal-ridden televangelist, dead at 90","https://www.avclub.com/jimmy-swaggart-obituary","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 00:13:00 GMT","

Born in 1935 in Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart first “spoke” to the Lord while waiting in line outside a movie theater. “‘Don't go in there, but give me your heart,'” Swaggart recounted the voice he heard. “‘I want to save your soul and set you apart as a chosen vessel used in my service.'” That service included a string of sex scandals, pilfering children's aid funds for his luxurious compounds, and collecting checks from the elderly. When Zoe Vance, a wealthy California widow, died, she left her fortune to Swaggart's ministry. Lawyers for the Vance family accused the preacher of “preying upon her loneliness and illness” to secure donations. According to ABC News, Jimmy Swaggart Ministries generated an estimated $142 million in revenue in 1986.

Swaggart came from humble beginnings. He first preached with an accordion outside a grocery store in Louisiana, where the young preacher realized that music brought crowds. The cousin of rock ‘n' roll innovator Jerry Lee Lewis and, later, a two-time Grammy nominee, Swaggart turned down a record deal with Sun Records, which sought an entry into the gospel business. Swaggart began cutting records himself, slowly building a media empire through radio and live performances. Swaggart was a passionate preacher able to bring that energy to the airwaves, where his influence and bank account began to grow.

In the early 1960s, he founded his radio ministry and slowly accumulated a following. By the end of the decade, he had founded the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, LA. With the '70s approaching, he began focusing on television, where his fiery sermons captivated millions. He used his power to lambast Roman Catholics (“a false religion”), Jews (“because of their rejection of Christ, they have known sorrow and heartache like no other people on the face of the Earth”), and homosexuals (“we've got to get those limp-wristed preachers out of the pulpits”). In 2004, he remarked that if a man ever looked at him “like that,” he would “kill him and tell God he died.”

Despite being the preacher who “helped engineer” fellow televangelist Jim Bakker's downfall, a tactic he had employed against other supposedly pious competitors, he was undone by his own infidelity. A year after the Bakker scandal broke, Swaggart was photographed with a sex worker, who told reporters that they didn't have sex; he took nude pictures of her. Swaggart would give a tearful apology to the viewing audience at home and those in the pews of a Family Worship Center. Three years later, he was pulled over for driving on the wrong side of the road in an unregistered Jaguar with another sex worker.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Teaser for Christopher Nolan's Odyssey has leaked to X, the everything app","https://www.avclub.com/the-odyssey-trailer-leaks","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 02:30:00 GMT","

As much as Christopher Nolan values the cinematic experience, his clout-hungry public does not. Still in production on his upcoming epic, The Odyssey, for Universal, Nolan and the studio produced a teaser for his $250 million movie and attached it to Universal's biggest release of the summer, Jurassic World Rebirth. Unfortunately, someone lucky enough to attend an early screening already recorded the trailer and put it on X, the everything app, where people can watch pirated videos to their heart's content.

The teaser, which we won't be linking to, is very much a tease. Running 70 seconds long, the clip opens with a voice-over saying, “Darkness. Zeus' law was smashed to pieces. I'm without a king since my master died. He knew it was an unwinnable war. And then, somehow, he won it.” It then cuts to Telemachus (Tom Holland) asking Jon Bernthal's character about his father, and Bernthal's character screams about rumors regarding the missing father as images of Odysseus in the sea and on his journey flash by. It somewhat resembles Batman Begins at times, but set to a discordant soundtrack that evokes the sound of 2001's “Encounter With Monolith.” He shouts at an unseen crowd, asking if anyone knows anything about Odysseus, and the scene closes on a shot of the wayward traveler on his raft, before reminding the audience that The Odyssey is coming out “one year from now.”

For those looking to watch it, one can head over to the modern-day 4chan, where they can see shaky, cameraphone footage from the film, amid ads for other Universal releases and random Nazis just trying to get the word out. Or, they could do what Phantom Menace hounds did with Meet Joe Black, i.e., pay to see Jurassic World Rebirth and leave after the trailer.

During Baylee Littrell's run on season 23 of “American Idol,” he had no bigger cheerleader than his dad, Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell. But in an interview published on July 2, 2025, Brian told Parade Magazine that initially, he wasn't keen on the idea of his son trying out for the show. 

“To be honest with you, I didn't want him to do it at first,” he admitted. “But they courted him for a couple of years. They were like, ‘Come and audition,' and he was like, ‘Nah.' I don't think he was ready at that time, but he did well.” 

In addition to the thousands of tens of thousands of singers who audition for producers virtually each season, “American Idol” casting producers also scour social media and performance venues for up-and-coming talent, encouraging rising stars to give the show a shot. Baylee, who's been trying to make it as a country and contemporary Christian artist, finally decided it was worth the exposure. 

A post shared by Ryan Seacrest (@ryanseacrest)

Brian was a proud papa throughout 20-year-old Baylee's journey, from singing with his son for part of his audition, to cheering for him from the balcony during Hollywood Week. 

“He stepped up,” he told Parade of his son, who made it to the Top 20. “He's super professional. He's just a great individual. He's just a great person. He has a heart of gold, and he's super talented.” 

The 90s pop icon, who still tours extensively with the Backstreet Boys, often got emotional while supporting his only child with wife Leighanne Littrell, to whom he's been married since 2000. 

“I get choked up a little bit when I talk about my boy,” Brian said. “He's just (the) most inspiring thing in my life right now. He inspires me more than anything. Top 20 isn't a bad thing out of 124,000.” 

Brian's bandmates also chimed in, telling Parade how cool it was to watch Baylee on “American Idol,” since he's been joining them backstage — and even onstage — since he was a little boy. 

AJ McLean said, “We've known Baylee his whole life, so to watch him come from singing with us during soundcheck to opening up for us back in the day to now, having his own career … He's an incredible songwriter. It's unbelievable, the level of talent. Obviously, the apple didn't fall far. Honestly, he did fantastic in my opinion.”

On June 24, Baylee released the original single he performed during Hollywood Week on “American Idol” called “Hey Jesus.” 

“I wrote it in a very dark time in my life,” Littrell told CCM before releasing the song. “A big common misconception is that God won't let us fall down. That's part of the journey, that's part of learning …”

“Three years ago I found myself questioning everything, even the big man upstairs,” he told the outlet. “The growing pains of life weighed heavy on my shoulders and I lived every day in fear of the next. At the time, I had never fully put my trust in God. I thought I had to be a certain way for Him to see me—but He took me as I was. That's when I wrote ‘Hey Jesus.'”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Luann de Lesseps' Thoughts on a Potential Return to RHONY","https://entertainmentnow.com/real-housewives/luann-de-lesseps-rhony-return/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:04:53 GMT","

Luann de Lesseps has a lot of thoughts on the “Real Housewives of New York City,” both the OG version and the reboot. She believes that the new cast was never entirely accepted by longtime fans, and Lu offered up an easy solution in an exclusive interview with Parade.

“I think that they should combine the cast,” de Lesseps says of the original and new cast members.

Fans were skeptical when Bravo first announced that they were going to reboot the cast of RHONY, because the original cast members are extremely popular. Taking a fresh approach with a younger cast made the old beloved series feel foreign. The irony is that if the same cast had launched in a brand-new series, it likely would have worked.

Lu believes that replacing the cast was Bravo's big mistake. “I mean, I think the first problem was that they had an all-new cast and they didn't keep the OGs. I think that was a big problem, and I'm sure they realized that was probably not the best. But it is what it is. It happened, so let's see what they're gonna do moving forward. Watch what happens! You gotta watch what happens!” 

De Lesseps said in her interview with Parade that the original series — which premiered on Bravo in 2008 and ran for 13 seasons before going on hiatus in 2021 — was nothing short of “epic.” 

“It's like Sex and the City, right? Those days — you capture them and, thank God, they're captured on film, right? Because I can't get those back. It's that kind of thing. I mean, listen: know, they talked about [bringing it back],” she reveals. 

“I don't know where they stand on that and where the girls stand. Ramona [Singer] has moved to Florida. Sonja [Morgan] moved to Florida. She finally sold that townhouse, thank God. And you know, Jill [Zarin] is in Florida. Kelly [Killoren Bensimon] and I are in New York, and Dorinda [Medley]. So, you know, we'll see what they cook up. I never say never. I say maybe.”

What do you think is the best way to revive the “Real Housewives of New York City”? Would you like to see a few members from each cast combined? Or should Bravo put a pin in the series if the original cast won't return?

Teddi Mellencamp has had a challenging year so far due to battling cancer and going through a divorce from Edwin Arroyave. Recently, he took to social media to not only highlight her courage but to remark on the excellent example the former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star is setting for their children. 

Edwin said in his Instagram post, “Happy birthday @teddimellencamp! Your resilience, tenacity, and strength have taught our children what a true warrior is. May God bless you with your best year ever.” 

A post shared by Edwin Arroyave (@edwinarroyaveofficial)

The picture accompanying the caption features Teddi and Edwin, along with their four children, one of whom is from Edwin's previous relationship. In it, Teddi is wearing a blue dress, while Edwin Arroyave is wearing a pair of black pants, a grayish shirt, and a blazer. 

According to PEOPLE, Teddi Mellencamp also took to Instagram to share a photo for her birthday. She said in the caption, “43 was pretty rough, but couldn't ask for a better start to 44 with [the] world's best cuddlers.”

The picture Teddi posted includes herself as well as the three kids she shares with Edwin Arroyave. Notably, they have Slate, who is 12, 10-year-old Cruz, and Dove, who is 5. The three kids are surrounding their mother in bed, and a football can also be seen. 

A post shared by Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave (@teddimellencamp)

Shannon Beador left a comment that said, “Happy birthday.” Jackie Goldschneider, Kiki Barth, and Adriana de Moura could also be seen in the comment section sending warm wishes to the former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star. 

Teddi Mellencamp joined “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” during the show's eighth season. She then left the series after its 10th installment in 2020 and made no secret that Bravo had decided not to renew her contract. 

According to Reality Tea, Teddi recently opened up about her exit on her “Diamonds In the Rough” podcast, which she hosts with Erika Jayne. She said, “I think I lost my job season two.” Erika then agreed with her podcast co-host.

Teddi Mellencamp continued, “I think I lost my job season two, and they kept me around for season three, and I became a nothing burger, and then that was the end.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","How ‘American Idol' Brought Jelly Roll & The Rock Together for Emotional 1st Meeting","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/jelly-roll-met-dwayne-johnson-the-rock-meeting/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:59:07 GMT","

When Jelly Roll and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson embraced in a big bear hug backstage at “American Idol” in May 2025, it was much more than a scene of two celebrities greeting each other. Incredibly, the meaningful moment marked the first time in the men's nearly 10 years of friendship that they'd met in person. 

Johnson, 53, shared a lengthy tribute to Jelly Roll, 40, in an Instagram post on June 30, 2025, which included footage of their emotional meeting on the “American Idol” soundstage on May 12. He revealed the two had been corresponding for years, helping each other through some dark times in their lives. But the timing had never worked out for them to meet up — until that fateful night at “American Idol.” 

A post shared by Dwayne Johnson (@therock)

Jelly Roll was on set at “American Idol” on May 12 because he was the show's first-ever artist-in-residence, a mentorship role he served in throughout season 23, guiding and encouraging the contestants. 

Johnson, meanwhile, was on set at “American Idol” that night for two reasons. First, his daughter performed in the Polynesian children's choir that backed up 2023 “American Idol” winner Iam Tongi, who sang his song from the new live-action “Lilo & Stitch” movie. 

Tongi was asked to cover “Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride,” the classic tune from the original 2002 movie, and a new generation of students from Kamehameha School's Children's Chorus appear on the song. Johnson posted on Instagram on May 12 about what a proud “girl dad” he was as he watched the choir back up Tongi. 

Johnson also promoted his upcoming animated Disney film, “Moana 2,” while in the audience at “American Idol,” in a brief segment with Ryan Seacrest. But it was the long-awaited meetup with Jelly Roll that clearly meant the most to the actor. 

In his July 1 post, Johnson explained that he had first reached out to Jelly Roll before he was an international sensation, writing, “Several years ago (roughly 2017) I was going through a very hard thing at the time, I was struggling. My mental wellness turned into my mental hellness. Many of you know the drill, you put on ‘the face', show up to work, smile and get through it. Perhaps not the healthiest thing to do, but it's what I was used to doing at the time.” 

“Then a song came on through my headphones one morning on a random shuffle playlist. ‘Only' from Jelly Roll. The lyrics rocked me. Hard core. The words moved me so much that I reached out to Jelly. I said you don't know me and I don't know you, but this song of yours is helping me through some stuff I'm dealing with. I just called to say thank you brother. Our bond was born.”

A post shared by Dwayne Johnson (@therock)

The June 30 post included a video about Jelly Roll and The Rock's bond. After Jelly Roll emerged from his trailer, the two embraced for a long time, telling each other how much they loved each other. 

“Jelly Roll and I have been buddies for almost 10 years — texting, showing love, support, always there for each other, whatever you need, I got you,” Johnson said. “We'd never met. So yesterday at ‘American Idol' was the first time we ever met and it was very special.” 

Among the things they've bonded over is growing up in Nashville without stable families, as well as Jelly Roll's recent health journey. When the two say each other, he told Johnson that he had lost 200 pounds and was prepared to lose another 100.  

In November, Johnson posted on Instagram Jelly Roll's health journey. It included a clip of Johnson on “The Kelly Clarkson Show” reading lyrics from “Only” and why Jelly Roll's song meant so much to him, and well as clips of Jelly Roll's progress losing weight. 

He wrote, “Always believed in you brother☝🏾 your music & friendship helped me thru a very hard time in my life when I was struggling to find a way. Keep kicking ass, shaking cities and moving crowds ~ with gratitude and a smile 🥃🖤”

The cast of “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” has undergone significant changes over the years. Sanya Richards-Ross appeared on two seasons of the show and spoke openly about wanting to expand her family. Now, the Olympic gold medalist has welcomed a new addition to her family. 

According to PEOPLE, Sanya Richards-Ross took to her Instagram on July 1 to announce that she and her husband, Aaron, had welcomed baby number three. She said on her Instagram Story, “He's here! I'm so happy.”

The accompanying video features Sanya, her son, and the new baby boy. Notably, she tagged Aaron in the video. The couple also shares a seven-year-old and a one-year-old. 

Sanya Richards-Ross opened up about expecting her third child in February. She stated in a post on Instagram, “I knew this birthday would be special, but this was A LOT more than I could have imagined.”

She continued, “On this birthday and my 15 YEAR ANNIVERSARY… @rossboy31 and I will be adding one more little prince or princess to our crew. My birthday and anniversary is actually on the 26th, but we're celebrating today, so let's just pretend…. Haha.”

A post shared by Sanya Richards-Ross (@sanyarichiross)

The former “Real Housewives of Atlanta” star continued, “Love y'all. I'm about to be a Mommi of THREEEEEE AHHHHHHH!!!!”

The Instagram post features multiple images of Sanya and Aaron, as she proudly shows off her baby bump. Notably, she wore a gold and black dress. Aaron donned all black for the “Coming To America” themed photoshoot. One of the pictures has Sanya holding up three fingers to represent three kids. 

Sanya Richards-Ross joined “The Real Housewives of Atlanta” for the show's 14th season. It premiered on Bravo in May 2022. As mentioned, Sanya and Aaron were vocal about their desire to expand their family. At the time, they only had one child, their son, Aaron Jr. 

Sanya remained on the hit show for its 15th season but didn't return for the most recent installment. She spoke to US Weekly about her departure and said, “I honestly think God knows best because I don't think I could have done everything that I've done in the last few months while filming the show.”

Sanya continued, “I was like, ‘Oh, it's no problem. I'll have the baby, and it'll be fine. And people get to see that because obviously when we started, we weren't sure we were going to have it. I was excited about that possibility.”

She added, “And then when it wasn't happening, I was like, this is a blessing because it's been a lot and I really needed to be present. I needed to be present for my family and for my husband and for my eldest son.”

Riz Ahmed is cleaning up corporate messes, one corrupt client at a time, for David Mackenzie‘s “Relay.” The film, which debuted at TIFF 2024 and was later acquired by Bleecker Street, stars “The Night Of” alum as an anonymous “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corporations and individuals threatening to expose them. However, after one client's case proves to be even more layered than usual, things go sideways.

The official synopsis reads: “A nameless character, he keeps his identity a secret by using a message relay service called Relay, which is usually used by people with a hearing or speech disability to make and receive telephone calls via text. Yet when a message arrives from a potential client (Lily James) who needs his protection just to stay alive, Ahmed's character abandons his own ironclad rules of communication.” Sam Worthington, Willa Fitzgerald, Matthew Maher, Helen Eigenberg, Pun Bandhu, Eisa Davis, Purva Bedi, Aaron Roman Weiner, Reed Northrup, Sasha Sen, Brian O'Neill, and José Báez co-star.

IndieWire previously debuted the teaser here, which encouraged audiences to text the number to get a special message from Ahmed's character.

“Hell or High Water” director Mackenzie helms the action-thriller, which was financed by Black Bear. The company also produced alongside Thunder Road Pictures and Sigma Films. Additional producers include Basil Iwanyk for Thunder Road, Gillian Berrie for Sigma, Teddy Schwarzman for Black Bear, and MacKenzie. The executive producers are Black Bear's Michael Heimler and John Friedberg, and Thunder Road's Erica Lee and Charlie Morrison.

“It was just the idea that this person is doing everything without any direct communication with other human beings, which sort of adds to the aloneness of it and the sort of weird sort of tension and paranoia,” Mackenzie told IndieWire of directing the feature, which was written by Justin Piasecki.

The IndieWire review deemed “Relay” a “modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre's '70s heyday [with] Justin Piasecki's knotted script absolutely delighting in the process of Ahmed's character's work. Smooth but vulnerable, clever but anonymous, desperate to provoke a human response but willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done, ‘Relay' isn't out to set the world on fire, it just wants to be a hand-crafted thriller that communicates a real sense of personal investment at a time when corporations would rather kill a single whistleblower than spare the lives of 1,000 customers, and it pulls that off with expert precision.”

 










Ahmed told IndieWire that “Relay” is a return to classic indies. “This isn't a high-concept AI, internet kind of movie,” Ahmed said. “Definitely one of the most distinctive aspects about it is how the main characters communicate or don't communicate. From an acting point of view, that was really exciting to me, that you've got a director like David who can just bring characters to life with so little and bring out these complex relationships. It felt like a lot of fun.”

Bleecker Street will premiere “Relay” in theaters August 22. Check out the trailer below.

It was an ordinary spring day in 1962 Italy… ordinary outside of a warm greeting between the very married superstar Elizabeth Taylor and the very married actor Richard Burton that a photographer happened to catch. The “kissing picture,” as it would become known, caught like wildfire, and the paparazzi never let up. Richard Burton dubbed the ensuing press storm “Le Scandale,” and the judgement of the world swiftly followed — included a condemnation from the Vatican newspaper calling it Taylor's “erotic vagrancy.”

At the center of Le Scandale — one which TCM host Ben Mankiewicz calls the “biggest in the history of American celebrities” — was a mammoth film, perhaps the biggest in the history of American cinema: 20th Century Fox's “Cleopatra.”

“The first photograph of them kissing as the rumors were circulating that they were involved was [taken by] a paparazzo hiding under a car, under like a Fiat… lying on the ground, taking a picture of them,” Mankiewicz said in an interview with IndieWire. “[Fellow ‘Cleopatra' star] Martin Landau [said] there were photographers in the trees. This had never happened on a movie before.”

 










The film was always going to be a giant undertaking, but an almost comical series of unfortunate events had curtailed it into becoming one of the most expensive pictures Hollywood had ever produced… long before Burton even joined the project. By the time of their steamy tryst began, “Cleopatra” had been in production — in fits and starts — for roughly four years. Taylor had signed on for the unheard sum of $1 million in 1959 (a salary she reportedly asked for only in jest).

Then she had health problems (she almost died).

The original Marc Antony and Julius Caesar dropped out (Stephen Boyd and Peter Finch, respectively).

The first director Rouben Mamoulian dropped out.

Footage was scrapped.

Numerous drafts of the script were rejected. 

The entire production moved from London to Rome, where sets had to be reconstructed.

By the time cameras were rolling on “Cleopatra” scenes that would actually make it into the bloated four-hour epic's final cut, it was not just over budget — it had blown past any semblance of a budget. For a time, it was the only production 20th Century Fox had going. That studio lot back in Century City? Virtually empty.

 










It would be thanks to the perceived failure of the movie — notoriety it perhaps should not have earned — that the kind of studio system the American film industry had operated under since the '20s would largely die. New Hollywood came in swiftly after with an era that would be defined by maverick filmmakers and stars with increased financial agency and power.

Almost everyone and everything involved with “Cleopatra” survived and thrived after its release. Taylor and Burton outlived the scandal and appeared together in the all-timer “Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff?” Fox eventually released “The Sound of Music” and financially recovered. Co-star Rex Harrison led in the biggest movie of 1964: “My Fair Lady,” and won an Academy Award for it. 

But then there was Joseph L. Mankiewicz — the one-time boy wonder of Hollywood, who set an Oscar record by winning back-to-back trophies for both writing and directing (1949's “A Letter to Three Wives and 1950's “All About Eve”). The man came into “Cleopatra” halfway, and he seemed up to tackling the gargantuan responsibility. He had enjoyed great success a decade earlier with his Marlon Brando-starring “Julius Caesar,” so he knew the time period. He had directed Taylor in the big 1959 hit “Suddenly, Last Summer,” so he knew the talent. When he joined the film, he was 51-going-on-52, very squarely in his prime.

 










“Cleopatra” would break Joe Mankiewicz.

By the time the movie was wrapped, in theaters, and finally sending some money back to Fox, Mankiewicz was a shell of the powerhouse he had once been. He would direct just three more narrative features, only one of which would receive any real critical or commercial success (the brilliant “Sleuth” in 1972). At one time the most lauded writer/director combo, he'd never pen another screenplay, though he lived another 30 years after the release of “Cleopatra.” Not only that, but the filmmaker struggled to write anything at all, including personal letters and Christmas cards.

“The Plot Thickens,” Turner Classic Movies' podcast series that tackles various aspects of Hollywood history, will explore the troubled history of this unwieldy Egyptian epic in its new season — out July 17 — through a uniquely personal lens. Released first for IndieWire, TCM has unveiled a trailer, narrated by Joe Mankiewicz's great nephew, Ben, who serves as the series host.

 










“[Joe] would have said his biggest professional regret certainly would have been ‘Cleopatra.' He said it was an act of ‘whoredom.' He did it for the money. But I mean, a lot of people in Hollywood do things for money, and then make something great,” Ben Mankiewicz said. 

“Cleopatra” became an albatross for Ben's uncle… a nightmare he was never able to escape and something he never again wanted to discuss. Through Joe's personal diaries. “The Plot Thickens” reconstructs the history of the complicated production through the eyes of its writer/director.

“[When] most people think of Cleopatra, they think about the about the affair and the scandal, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and then these sort of myths [about] the movie that destroyed a studio,” Ben Mankiewicz said. “We dispatch a lot of those myths in the podcast, but we probably wouldn't have done [the podcast] without the family angle… Joe was broken by it in really substantive ways. And he had been one of the truly finest filmmakers of the 1950s. But it did a number on him and that was worth examining.”

The Mankiewicz family is true Hollywood royalty. Joe's brother Herman won an Oscar for some overlooked gem called “Citizen Kane.” Joe's son Tom wrote three James Bond flicks. Herman's son Don wrote a score of features in the '50s, '60s, and '70s. Ben's father Frank was president of National Public Radio, was Robert F. Kennedy, Sr.'s press secretary, and headed up George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. Frank's other son Josh is a journalist on NBC's “Nightline.” 

 










“There was a line I heard a lot growing up. Family members used to say it,” Ben Mankiewicz says in “The Plot Thickens” promo. “The line was that my grandfather wrote the best movie ever made — ‘Citizen Kane' — and that my great uncle directed the worst movie ever made.”

Through its reframing in “The Plot Thickens,” it becomes clear that the efforts at the center of “Cleopatra” were that of passionate film professionals — people who cared about the movies. If Joe Mankiewicz had his way, in fact, it would've been two epics instead of one: one part focused on Julius Caesar, the other on Marc Antony.

“This sort of historical costume drama is not my kind of movie, but… one of the myths is that it's the worst movie ever made. It's not even one of the 3,000 worst movies ever made. Some of it's pretty good. And I think that if Joe Mankiewicz, my uncle, had gotten his way and released it as two three-hour movies, that some of the issues — the pacing problems, where it actually seems slow — would have been better, because you would have had two tighter, three-hour movies,” Ben explained. “It's funny. Now, if you say, ‘Listen, I know you asked me to shoot one movie, but I've actually shot two. Do you want both?' Every studio would be like, ‘Is this a trick question? Yeah, we'll take two, sure.'”

 










As it stands, though there have been various versions presented over the years, “Cleopatra” exists as one 243 minute film. But it would eventually be a success on the books. It scored a Best Picture nomination, and though it did not actually turn a profit for a few years due to its reported $44 million budget, it was not the total financial disaster some later claimed — in reality, it was the top grossing movie of 1963.

“Spyros Skouras had been the president of the company prior to Darryl Zanuck coming back. Spyros quit, but basically got fired,” Ben explained. “But his time had come to an end, and he and the board sort of blamed him for the fiasco of ‘Cleopatra,' and then Zanuck came and blamed Joe. Spyros Skouras… what he really [was good at was] his relationships and [setting] up deals with theater owners, and he had set up a deal where they had prepaid for ticket sales of ‘Cleopatra.' And so, right off the bat, ‘Cleopatra' had $20 million come in very quickly… and then more after that at the box office, to where — okay, it lost a lot of money — but still brought back, let's say, $25 million. And obviously, Fox doesn't get all that, but they get a lot of it. And by the time 1965 rolls around, when they sell it to network TV, it's in the black.”

So this particular “The Plot Thickens” season is a little bit different for TCM's resident savant. More than the narrator of a fascinating chapter in film history, Mankiewicz is recasting his own family's heritage and the reputation of a film whose impact, while great, is perhaps unfairly perceived.

 










“What you get from this podcast is [that] Joe threw everything into this. I mean, he poured his heart and soul into this movie. Because of the money, [there was] this perception that he came in, he wasn't the right director, [and] he didn't know what he was doing. He definitely knew what he was doing,” Ben said. “He just tried to do too much, among the other things, tried to do too much. First of all, he was a therapist to Elizabeth and to Richard and to Rex and to everybody else on the cast.”

Joe Mankiewicz used speed, Ben explained, to help him through the grueling shoot days. He actually ended principal photography in the wheelchair after mistakenly shooting up and hitting a sciatic nerve.

“He's in a wheelchair, and he's got to get over sand. So they carried him out to the shot on a stretcher. And he's like writing on the stretcher, while a bunch of guys carry him out so he can sit and and direct the scene,” Ben recounted. “[His] diaries reveal a guy who was a director in the day, and then frequently would go home [and] write the screenplay at night… He needed help.”

This, along with the controversies surrounding Le Scandale, weather delays, the recurrent health issues of cast members, the haggling over the film's final cut, and, of course, the movie's legacy as the film that changed Hollywood… all will be explored when “The Plot Thickens: Cleopatra” begins dropping weekly episodes starting July 17, wherever you get your podcasts.

An uncommonly credible Netflix actioner about a team of immortal mercenaries who sell their skills to the highest bidder, Gina Prince-Bythewood's “The Old Guard” was an oasis in the desert when it dropped on Netflix at the height of the pandemic, but I'd be lying if I said that it's really stuck with me over the last five years. And yet, there's one detail of its story that I haven't been able to shake — a character fate so grim that it made living forever seem like a fate worse than death. 

If you've seen the movie (or read the graphic novel series on which it's based), you know what I'm talking about: An eternal warrior named Quỳnh (Van Veronica Ngo) is sealed inside an iron maiden during a 16th century witch trial and cast into the bottom of the sea, where she's doomed to drown, gasp back to life, and then drown again until the end of time. Not fun! 

 








Related Stories Beyond ‘Erotic Vagrancy': TCM Reframes Legacy of ‘Cleopatra,' Elizabeth Taylor, and the Director Who Went Down with the Sphinx '40 Acres' Review: Danielle Deadwyler Protects Her Farm in a Dystopian Home Invasion Saga 

Be that as it may, Quỳnh didn't seem too happy when she inexplicably reappeared on the surface at the end of the film. The look on her face was less “I'm so relieved to have air in my lungs for the first time in more than 500 years,” and more “It's too bad that my friends are forever, because I really want to murder them for letting me choke in hell for half a millennium.” 

 










What we already know, and what Quỳnh is conflicted to learn towards the beginning of “The Old Guard 2,” is that fate will give her the chance for revenge, as her ride-and-not-die bestie Andromache (Charlize Theron) somehow lost her powers during the course of the previous movie. And so the stage would appear to be set for a fun — and emotionally fraught — grudge match of a sequel about two several-thousand-year-olds who fight over the best way to spend the rest of their suddenly finite time together. 

Alas, neither of these women can imagine just how finite that time will be. For one thing, the oldest immortal of them all (Uma Thurman as Discord) has returned with a plan to purge the Earth of her own kind. For another, “The Old Guard 2” is frustratingly — if also pointedly — rushed for a movie about people who've been alive for eons, and it never gives any of its characters the chance to meaningfully hash out how the bonds of friendship might pull tighter as they get twisted over the course of a few hundred decades. 

What does it entail to hurt someone who lives forever? How deep can a wound fester when time fails to heal it? Were Andy and Quỳnh in love, or is the Hays Code-level homoeroticism between them meant to reflect a relationship too vast to be defined by mortal parameters? Some of these topics are nominally addressed through aggrieved wire-fu and/or an elaborate shootout near the core of a nuclear power plant, and “The Old Guard 2” — which hits the ground running, and takes palpably goofy pleasure in being unburdened from the table-setting that sucked the fun out of the first one — excels in the rare moments when its action stems from the loaded question of what its characters are really fighting for. 

 










To an even greater degree than its predecessor, however, this sequel is too busy satisfying the basic conditions of its genre to do anything memorable with them. Worse: the gallingly incomplete nature of its story — which ends on Netflix's biggest cliffhanger since “Squid Game 2,” but without the benefit of a third chapter in the can — leaves the movie with a putrid aftertaste, not only because it's so unsatisfying, but also because it affirms the moral of Greg Rucka's script in the worst possible way. Andy tells us that time is only as meaningful as you make it. In that sense, it's hard not to feel like the 104 minutes it takes to watch “The Old Guard 2” are more of a waste than they're worth. 

Anyone still endeared to these characters from Prince-Bythewood's installment will probably enjoy the chance to catch up with them, however brief it might be. Helming her first movie since 2011's “Yelling to the Sky,” replacement director Victoria Mahoney seizes on the fun of watching Andy's crew run toward danger without a care in the world,  and this sequel's explosive opening sequence — a raid on an arms dealer's mansion in Croatia — is made a million times more enjoyable by the devil may care attitude that immortals like Nicky (Luca Marinelli, fresh off his silent but sublime performance in “Death Stranding 2”) and Joe (Marwan Kenzari) bring to the James Bond-coded car chase that caps things off. 

 










Nile Freeman (KiKi Layne) was a new recruit the last time around, but she's already outgrown any fear of death, much to the same extent that the newly mortal Andy has yet to develop one. Chiwetel Ejiofor's CIA liaison also returns as an audience surrogate of sorts (someone needs to gawp at all of the carnage), and though he doesn't get a ton to do, no movie has ever been made worse by having more Chiwetel Ejiofor in it. And what of Matthias Schoenaerts' Booker, who was exiled for betraying the Old Guard as part of a bid to cure his eternality? Well, he's back too, if only so Quỳnh can use him to find Andy. 

While his scenes with the group are some of the movie's best for how they weigh a single misstep against several millennia of solidarity, there are other traces of nuance in the early going of this story. Still one of the great undersung action stars of the 21st century, Theron might delegate most of her performance in these movies to her jet-black wig, but she convincingly sells the idea that Andy is enjoying her newfound mortality and all that it entails — the hangovers are brutal, but getting drunk is a lot more fun. The double-edged sword of her reunion with Quỳnh is sharpened by the looming specter of death, and Mahoney tees it up with a clever (and seemingly in-camera) shot that finds Andy walking through the centuries in order to meet up with the woman who once walked alongside her.  

 










But as the movie begins to bullshit its way through the whys and hows of living forever, the procedure of it all starts to distract from the emotions at hand, and Discord is never remotely interesting enough as a villain to justify all of the legwork required to make sense of her plot. Henry Golding plays a bookkeeper whose sole purpose is to set up the lore, but Discord's threat always feels more contrived than inevitable. 

Thurman glowers with the best of them, but a furtive plan and a few hard stares isn't enough to support a character who's supposedly been miffed at we mortals ever since she watched Jesus get crucified before her eyes. Does she want to purge us off the planet, as hijacking a nuclear power plant might suggest, or is she more concerned with her own suffering? “The Old Guard 2” tells us the answer, but forces us to wait until the next movie, if there even is a next movie, to give a shit about how she got there, or what it could mean for Andy's ever-complicating relationship with Quỳnh. 

And there's precious little pleasure to be found in that deferral, as the climactic fight — in which Beatrix Kiddo finally gets to flex her skills — is an under-lit CGI blah-fest that epitomizes how eager this franchise is to sacrifice its eternal characters at the altar of hyper-ephemeral streaming dross. That non-finale is especially disappointing at the end of a movie that makes an effort, at least during its first half, to run with its premise. The action can be choppy, and the camerawork grows increasingly focused on compensating for little cheats in the film's stunt work, but Mahoney never misses a chance to crush a pair of legs that can grow right back, or to smash someone through a window without any concern for what might happen if they catch a shard of glass in their neck. 

 










Watching Joe smush his disembodied thumb back onto his hand with a perfect “thumbs up,” it's hard not to wish that his franchise could magically pull itself together in the same way. Alas, those who loved “The Old Guard” are going to be the ones most annoyed by the decision to leave its sequel severed in half. Whether it's the ultimate goal of her plan or just a byproduct of what she's really after, Discord is happy for people to suffer; one way or another, she's about to get her wish.

“The Old Guard 2” is now available to stream on Netflix.

Taron Egerton is bringing his action skills once more to the big screen. The actor leads “She Rides Shotgun,” which Nick Rowland directs. Ana Sophia Heger co-stars as Egerton's onscreen daughter whom he must protect from gang members and corrupt cops after leaving prison. 

The official synopsis for “She Rides Shotgun” reads: “Marked for death by unrelenting enemies, Nate (Egerton) must now protect his estranged 11-year-old daughter, Polly (Ana Sophia Heger) at all costs. Shy, precocious, and wary of her father, Polly is swept up in Nate's dangerous plight as they flee to evade the corrupt sheriff and brutal leader of a gang who will stop at nothing to protect his criminal interests. With scant resources and no one to trust, Nate and Polly form a bond forged under fire as he shows her how to fight and survive — and she teaches him what unconditional love truly means in this intense, moving story about loyalty, strength, and redemption.” Rob Yang and John Carroll Lynch co-star.

Rowland directs from a script by Jordan Harper, Ben Collins, and Luke Piotrowski; the film is adapted from Harper's book of the same name. Rowland previously helmed the Netflix film “Calm with Horses” starring Barry Keoghan and Cosmo Jarvis. The feature earned 10 BIFA nominations including Best Director, and 4 BAFTA nominations including Outstanding British Film. 

 










“She Rides Shotgun” was acquired by Lionsgate earlier this year. Actor and producer Egerton, who recently led series “Smoke,” explained in a statement to Variety that “She Rides Shotgun” is one of his career highlights. “I cannot recall a happier or more soul-enriching experience than making ‘She Rides Shotgun.' It is without doubt the most tender and felt relationship I have had with an actor onscreen,” he said. “Ana Sophia Heger was 10 when we made the film and she is nothing short of extraordinary. In Nick Rowland, I found the kind of like-minded friend and collaborator that comes along once or twice in a lifetime.”

Director Rowland added, “Working on ‘She Rides Shotgun' was about honoring Jordan Harper's brutal, beautiful novel while finding a cinematic language that could carry both its savagery and its soul. The film is about two people — strangers, really — who find a way to become a real family in the most brutal of circumstances. What moved me most was the emotional survival in it. There's tenderness in the trauma. That's what I wanted to explore — how love can grow even in the darkest places. Taron Egerton brought such depth and volatility to Nate, and Ana Sophia Heger blew us away with her heart and fearlessness as Polly. I'm incredibly proud of what we created together — it's a ride, and it doesn't let go.”

 










“She Rides Shotgun” is produced by Brad Weston, Collin Creighton, Nate Matteson, Hiro Murai, and Egerton. The executive producers are Ken Kao, Josh Rosenbaum, Teddy Schwarzman, John Friedberg, Walter Parkes, Laurie Macdonald, Alexis Garcia, Chris Rice, Christopher Slager, and Graham Taylor. Lionsgate and Fifth Season present, in association with Waypoint Entertainment, the Makeready and Super Frog production. Blanck Mass crafted the original soundtrack for the movie.

Rowland is next reuniting with Fifth Season for crime thriller “The Final Score.” 

Lionsgate will release “She Rides Shotgun” in select theaters August 1. Check out the trailer below.

6.0

Genre:

Rap

Label:

SossHouse / Interscope

July 2, 2025

There's a chorus on Made in Paris where Pi'erre Bourne repeats, “J'adore bitch, pardon my French” 16 times. Another song called “La Loi, C'est La Loi” has a synthetic accordion line that sounds like a token French guy walking into an episode of Spongebob. Twelve out of 17 song titles are in French. Get it?

This is “The Pi'erre Bourne Album You've Come to Expect: Paris Edition.” Pi'erre can still pen a Pi'erre song full of dazzling production and endearingly strange writing that will make you ask, “Is this good or bad?” (If heads have been debating your rap skills for six years, chances are you're good—just ask Silkk the Shocker.) There are hookup tales, old flames, dates at Red Lobster, a reference to the “soss economy” that he never elaborates on. Barely a minute into the album, Pi'erre compares his dick to a Twinkie.

It's all good fun if you've bought into Pi'erre's solo career, but this is also why Made in Paris feels regressive. Almost every song could've been plucked from the cutting room floor of an earlier Pi'erre album; some literally were. It is a cut-and-paste assembly that doesn't add enough soss to the catalog to justify its existence.

Let's face it: Pi'erre Bourne's probably got some Illmatic syndrome. Where do you go after making both some of the past decade's defining beats for Playboi Carti and the vibe-out classic The Life of Pi'erre 4? On his previous album, the polarizing Good Movie, Pi'erre painted a more complex self-portrait, tapping into the dancehall he soaked up on lifelong trips to Belize to convey new shades of gray in life. (His uncle, who appears on the Made in Paris intro, was the late reggae and dancehall artist Mobile Malachi.) Good Movie was a weird, uneven album, hot and stormy like a New York summer; it came out during COVID and is generally regarded as his worst, but I've grown to appreciate how its stilted, four-on-the-floor simulacra maps onto his mundane relationship drama.

Cast against the response to that record, Made in Paris feels like a course correction, leaning hard on Pi'erre's tried-and-true sounds—lion roars, 808s that soak up all the airspace, somber chords that pulse like a heartbeat—as it settles into its groove. Gaudy transitions, too, although uneven mixing prevents them from landing quite right. The two singles “Blocs” and “Pop” were boring choices to promote the record, both staid and inoffensive compared to the bulk of the material here. Neither is as sticky as “Temps de Chasse,” a ballad full of delicious keyboard stabs where our Parisian expat delivers the hilariously nonsensical quip, “The grass ain't greener on the other side/Girl, you know it's purple in my place.”

I'm equally intrigued by the sheer magnitude of some of these songs. “Retraite” folds three beat switches into three electric minutes, ending with a blown-out coda in step with the new generation of rage freaks. (In addition to the artists on his SossHouse label, Pi'erre has recently worked with buzzing chaos agents like Diorvsyou and Sk8star, so this tracks.) “Toot It Up” is like a Jodeci instrumental from hell, with cranked-up bass that fully submerges Pi'erre's vocals—a disruptor like his collaborator Young Nudy would've given this one the spark it deserves. (I must instead recommend Queens rappers Shawny Binladen and Big GLTAOW's own Paris sabbatical record, G's in Paris, made with French MC Jwles.)

It is refreshing to hear a producer like Pi'erre, now a decade into his career and inspiring a wave of new artists, still totally committed to a world of sound, textures, and vocal ideas he can confidently call his own. There is virtually zero trend-chasing on any Pi'erre album, including this one. But the risk in making music to please diehards, the type of fans who'll point out every kink and flaw in the CDQs versus the “OG versions,” is that you end up making fine, failsafe albums like Made in Paris. You make “L'amour,” which sounds like if the TLOP5 cut “Amen” was left out on the pavement for a few hours. Even though he recorded it overseas, on Made in Paris you can hear Pi'erre retreating closer to home.

Last year, American Football celebrated the 25th anniversary of their landmark debut album with a series of live performances. Now, that tour will be immortalized in the form of a concert film. American Football (Live in Los Angeles) was recorded across two nights at Los Angeles' El Rey Theatre. Directed by Steph Rinzler and featuring interviews with Ethel Cain, Yvette Young, and M.A.G.S., the film is set to premiere tonight (July 2) at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on the band's YouTube channel.

American Football (Live in Los Angeles) is accompanied by the official release of American Football's first live album. The record, which includes renditions of all the songs on the emo lodestars' debut, was originally made available on Bandcamp earlier this year, with proceeds going to benefit victims of the California wildfires. Vinyl pressings will come with an eight-page booklet of photographs from the El Rey Theatre shows taken by Atiba Jefferson. Listen to the album below.

Alongside remastering and reissuing their debut LP in 2024, American Football shared a full-album covers compilation with contributions from Iron & Wine, Manchester Orchestra, and Blondshell, among others. The house that appears on the cover of American Football—which the band co-owns alongside Polyvinyl Records—has also been available to rent on Airbnb since last year. American Football shared their third and, to date, latest studio album, also titled American Football, in 2019.

Foo Fighters have returned with “Today's Song,” their first new song in nearly two years. It follows the band's 2023 full-length, But Here We Are—their first album without the late drummer Taylor Hawkins—and the newly shared cover of Minor Threat's “I Don't Wanna Hear It.” Listen to Foo Fighters' new single below.

Foo Fighters parted ways with Josh Freese, who took over on drums following Hawkins' death, back in May of this year—much to his confusion. A press release for “Today's Song” does not specify who is playing drums on the new single. It does, however, specify that the Foo Fighters lineup has otherwise remained unchanged, with Grohl on lead vocals and guitar, Nate Mendel on bass, Pat Smear on guitar, Chris Shiflett on guitar and backing vocals, and Rami Jaffee on keyboards.

In a statement shared online, Dave Grohl wrote, “It should go without saying that without the boundless energy of William Goldsmith, the seasoned wisdom of Franz Stahl, and the thunderous wizardry of Josh Freese, this story would be incomplete, so we extend our heartfelt gratitude for the time, music, and memories that we shared with each of them over the years. Thank you, gentlemen.”

“And… Taylor,” Grohl continued. “Your name is spoken every day, sometimes with tears, sometimes with a smile, but you are still in everything we do, everywhere we go, forever. The enormity of your beautiful soul is only rivaled by the infinite longing we feel in your absence. We all miss you beyond words. Foo Fighters will forever include Taylor Hawkins in every note that we play, until we do finally reach our destination.”

There are voices all over Geir Jenssen's albums as Biosphere, and few of them are reassuring. Like transmissions from a post-apocalyptic world, they drift in dead airspace, bereft of a reply, their trails of static scuffing the clean contours of Jenssen's antiseptic ambient techno beats. So many of the most memorable moments in the Norwegian's catalog come from these dispatches, seemingly scoured from the most haunted backwaters of the radio dial—two twins on “Phantasm” who had the same dream last night (never a good sign), a Soviet psychic on “Kobresia” whose basso profondo voice is burdened by his clairvoyant visions.

No Biosphere album to date has placed more importance on its vocal samples than The Way of Time, which centers the voice of actress Joan Lorring from a 1951 radio play of Elizabeth Madox Roberts' 1926 novel The Time of Man. Lorring's voice last appeared in Jenssen's music on the 2017 mini-album The Petrified Forest, which sampled a radio adaptation of the eponymous Bette Davis film. Here, Lorring plays a young girl from Kentucky named Ellen Chesser, and her broad accent (Hong Kong-born Californian channeling rural Southern) cuts a curious texture against the icy Euro-ness of the beats.

The Time of Man, a literary sensation in its time, contrasts the rhythms of life in rural Kentucky with the implacable pace of nature. “Is there a time of rocks and stones, like there's a time of man?” Lorring wonders on “Time of Man.” Her asides alternate between wide-eyed wonder and alarming apocalyptic invocations. On “Like the End of the World,” the noises of the night (doves, crickets, rustling leaves) merge with a snatch of echoing organ. “It's a lonesome sound,” Lorring observes, “like the end of the world.”

The end of the world has good reason to be on Jenssen's mind. He's based in Tromsø, within the Arctic Circle, a region whose melting ice is now being eyed by capitalists with dollar signs in their eyes. Jenssen is a pioneer of “Arctic ambient,” a late-'90s style that proceeded in blissful ignorance of the climate crisis, treating the great white expanses of the north as one of the last unspoiled places on the map. As shipping routes threaten to replace the sea ice, it's not hard to imagine Lorring giving voice to Jenssen's own fears about the eventual fate of his home.

This apprehensive slant wouldn't be without precedent in Jenssen's catalog. His 2011 album N-Plants was inspired by concerns about Japan's nuclear infrastructure that would be validated shortly thereafter by the Fukushima disaster. The Time of Man sounds a little like N-Plants, all rolling sequencers and brittle drum machines. This is Jenssen's comfort zone, and for all his oddball experiments like L'Incoronazione de Poppea, he can be relied on to deliver something in this style every few years.

The biggest surprise is how unyielding the album's sound is. Its palette varies so little you might not even notice that “The Way of Time (On and On)” is a remix of “The Way of Time” until you looked at the tracklist. Meanwhile, Lorring's pseudo-Southern diphthongs wrap around the beats like vines on a trellis; her voice works simultaneously as a textural flourish, an emotional throughline, and even something like a conscience. “Are you scared of the end of the world, Jasper?” she asks an unheard partner. The real question, Jenssen implies, is: Are you scared enough?

	After a seven-week trial, Sean Combs was convicted on two of the five felony charges against him, but in a boon to the embattled mogul, he was acquitted on the most serious counts.


The mixed verdict found Combs guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution related to his ex-girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, and an ex-girlfriend who testified under the name “Jane.” But he was found not guilty on the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.


	Had he been convicted on all charges, or even some of the more serious ones, Combs could have faced up to life in prison. The guilty verdicts for the two prostitution charges could still land him in prison for some time, but the penalty is expected to be much less severe.


	Each violation of the Mann Act carries up to 10 years in prison, meaning Combs technically faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. Most legal experts, however, do not expect Judge Arun Subramanian to hand down such a harsh punishment. Combs has no prior criminal record, which could lead to a more lenient sentence, while Subramanian could also allow him to serve concurrent sentences for the two counts.

	More pressing at the moment is whether Combs will be remanded back into custody or released on bond as he awaits sentencing. After the verdict was read, the prosecution and defense squabbled over the matter, with Subramanian expected to make a decision later today.

	











	The government raised concerns that, if released, Combs could “disregard orders from this court,” citing evidence that the mogul “continued to commit a litany of crimes” — such as alleged abuse and drug use — even after he knew he was under federal investigation. Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo, however, pushed for his client's immediate release on bond, saying he would be “nothing short of a fool” to violate a court order.

	So there are these immortals, y'see — folks who have been around for millennia, and are capable of healing from any wound, regenerating any severed limb. Cut off a finger? No problem! A group of these gifted, unkillable ass-kickers have banded together and, led by a centuries-old Scythian warrior named Andromache (Charlize Theron), will take on the dirtiest of mercenary jobs for a price. There's also Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts), who fought in the Napoleonic Wars before joining up; Nicky (Martin Eden‘s Luca Marinelli), a former priest from Italy; and Joe (Marwan Kenzari), a former merchant from Iran. Both of these men first battled each other during the Crusades, continually trying to slay the other over many eras. The two eventually became lovers. 


	“Andy,” as she's known by her colleagues, runs a tight ship. Even when she's having issues with their latest recruit, a U.S. marine named Nile (KiKi Layne) who's just discovered she's an immortal, or is attempting to shield the group's existence from Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a nosy C.I.A agent, Andy watches everyone's backs and makes sure the job gets done. Calling themselves the Old Guard — get it? — they are the type of superheroic anti-heroes for whom ballads are written. Or comic books. Or screenplays that milk those comic books for a potentially lucrative franchise for a streaming service.

	











	Anyone who's not a die-hard stan (a Guardhead?) will definitely need a refresher before going into The Old Guard 2, which just dropped on Netflix, as the sequel to the 2020 movie assumes that viewers know every bit of backstory backwards and forwards. An impressive take on Greg Rucka's comic book series that benefited from the writer adapting his own work, the original Old Guard had a lot going for it: Theron capitalizing on her post-Atomic Blonde action-flick chops, director Gina Prince-Blythewood (Love & Basketball) finding a nice balance between character development and choreographed fight sequences, a same-sex love story that felt genuinely romantic in a genre usually allergic to even token LGBTQ+ representation.

	What this second installment has in its favor is familiarity, a built-in fanbase — it remains one of Netflix's most popular original, blockbuster-style movies, according to Netflix — some extra star power in the form of Uma Thurman, and the fact that you don't need to extend much energy to pick up a remote control. That's really about it. Building off the deep lore of the first film and ending on a cliffhanger that telegraphs its creators are crossing their fingers for a third film, The Old Guard 2 is an extension of a story that takes your investment in these people, concepts, and situations. It's a new chapter in a saga, yet like its characters who've been practicing the art of war since Sun Tzu coined the term, the sequel somehow feels ancient and a little creaky.


	Remember Quynh (Victoria Ngo), Andy's old immortal running partner who was sealed in a sarcophagus and dropped into the sea, sentenced to a life of perpetual drowning? She's been found and retrieved by Thurman's all-purpose bad guy, who goes by the supervillain handle Discord. Remember how Andy mysteriously lost her powers of regeneration partway through the first film, which is a huge disadvantage when your whole deal is “warrior for hire who can never be killed?” That's still an issue. Remember when Copley decided that, rather than bust these off-the-books mercs, he'd help conceal their identities? The former intelligence agent is now aiding them in missions that involve, say, the occasional siege on a Croatian crimelord's fortress. Remember how Booker was sentenced to a year-long exile after shooting Andy? He's still persona non grata, but not for long.


	Long story short, Discord has plans for using Quynh and her eye on Nile. This caricature of an all-powerful, morally bankrupt no-goodnik is actually the oldest immortal around. “I was there, you know,” Discord says, staring at something offscreen. “I can still remember it, the acrid stench of hate in the air.” Cut to: a painting of Jesus on the cross. [Slow clap] Nile, she believes, is the “last immortal to ever be born,” and may hold the key to killing off everyone. Meanwhile, an immortal librarian named Tua (Henry Golding) thinks he knows why Andy lost her powers, and has a theory on how she might regain them.

	Theron can still pull off the fight scenes. Thurman can still handle a katana like an expert, even if it's not one forged by Hattori Hanzo. Marinelli and Kanzari's kiss-kiss-bicker-bicker double act is still charming, if a little underutilized. New director Victoria Mahoney (whose personal narrative arc is a thousand times more interesting, moving and compelling than anything happening here) throws in the occasionally inventive bit of filmmaking, as when she stages Andy walking through an alleyway that morphs from one historical period to the next with every step she takes. Shots are fired, punches are thrown, and things blow up real good. Everyone reads their lines clearly, hits their marks, and the camera stays in focus.

	











	There's a sneaking suspicion that, while Mahoney, Theron, her costars, and the crew are doing their best to sell this superhero story — and by extension a franchise that Netflix can use to produce numerous other sequels, possible TV spin-offs, etc. — in the most professional manner possible, The Old Guard 2 isn't quite the movie it wants you to think it is. Or rather, it's dangerously close to not being a movie at all so much as just one more piece of expensive “content” that the streamer can slap into menus and use to game your viewing algorithms. If you have not been fully converted to Team Old Guard going into this, you will not click off your TV having suddenly become a O.G. devotee. And yet, because this has all of the busy bells and whistles we associate with blockbusters, it will likely be paraded as a runaway success story regardless. It's the oldest trick in the book.

	Scenes of “law enforcement” that look like lawlessness are unfolding, daily, on the streets of America. 


	Masked agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other federal agencies jump out of unmarked cars. They wear masks and are often irregularly uniformed, in a slapdash assemblage of jeans and security vests. Some may have labels reading POLICE. Some may have badges. Others dress in t-shirts and baseball caps. They often refuse to identify themselves or produce warrants. 


	These squads are snatching individuals off the streets, and out of federal courthouses, and wrestling them into vehicles to be spirited away in a spectacle that even a U.S. senator has likened to “being kidnapped.”


	This anarchic authoritarianism is playing out in isolated pockets, for now. But if the budget reconciliation legislation known as President Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” becomes law, the horror will spread nationwide. 


	“This bill is a force multiplier for ICE,” Nayna Gupta, Policy Director of the pro-immigrant American Immigration Council tells Rolling Stone. “It allows them to hire 10,000 more agents around the country,” she says, “while simultaneously deputizing state and local police departments to do things like interrogate, arrest, detain and deport immigrants.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	The Senate's version of the bill steers an astonishing $130 billion into immigration enforcement, detention, and border security, according to the American Immigration Council's tally, which includes funding for Trump's border wall. In the buildup to passage in the Senate, this funding became the central MAGA sales pitch. “Everything else” — including the bill's staggering cuts to the social safety net — “is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions,” Vice President J.D. Vance posted on X Monday night,  Vance's post preceded, by hours, his casting the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.

	











	Stephen Miller, Trump's nativist policy chief, touts the Big Beautiful Bill for the same reason Gupta blasts it: “The BBB will increase by orders of magnitude the scope, scale and speed of removing illegal and criminal aliens,” Miller posted on X in June, branding the bill, with a chauvinistic flourish, “the most essential piece of legislation… in the entire Western World, in generations.”

	Building the case for the bill, Trump's so-called Border Czar, Tom Homan, appeared last week at a conference in Washington D.C. held by the Faith & Freedom Coalition, a right-wing organization led by the scandal-tainted evangelical power broker Ralph Reed. Homan got raucous cheers from the Christian audience for a profanity-laced speech, in which he touted the administration's agenda to arrest and remove the strangers among us. “If I offend anybody today,” Homan said, “I don't give a shit.”


	In his speech, Homan advanced a version of the Great Replacement conspiracy theory. He baselessly alleged that Democrats under Joe Biden “unsecured the border on purpose” to build a new political power base of immigrants. “They knew exactly what they're doing,” Homan said. “They saw future political benefit on doing it. They thought millions of people coming into the country are going to be future Democratic voters.” Homan continued: “They sold this country out for future political power. And to me, that's treasonous.”


	Homan talked up congressional passage of the Big Beautiful Bill as a countermeasure: “They pass that bill, we're gonna have more money than we ever had to do immigration enforcement,” he said, adding gruffly: “You think we're arresting people now? You wait till we get the funding to do what we got to do.” (Homan's comments were first highlighted by Right Wing Watch.)

	The Big Beautiful Bill will swell the ranks of ICE agents. The Senate bill earmarks about $30 billion for recruiting and retention; the House version specifies the hiring of nearly 10,000 new agents, or “boots on the ground,” as Homan described them, militaristically. The bill also has more than $45 billion to ramp up detention facilities and detainee transportation — to turn the Trump deportation machine into what acting ICE director Todd Lyons envisions as an Amazon-like logistics operation: “Like Prime, but with human beings.” 


	Gupta, the immigrant-rights policy advocate, tells Rolling Stone: “The dollar numbers that we're seeing here will have the effect of creating an immigration detention system as large, or larger, than the U.S. federal prison system.” She adds that the law would create an “enforcement regime that militarizes American communities in a much more extreme way than what we've already seen in the first six months of the Trump administration.”

	











	Homan, in his speech, pointed to current ICE detention capacity as limiting arrests, with the administration playing a constant “chess game” to clear out enough beds to then jail more migrants. “We need 100,000 beds. So I can fill 100,000 beds,” Homan said. “We should be coming to work every day saying, Get everybody you can get. And we got the bed waitin'.”


	Homan's current “game” has deadly consequences for detainees held in crowded conditions: “We've already seen 10 deaths in immigration facilities in just five months,” says Gupta, citing reports of “horrific conditions inside the facilities, including starvation, lack of gynecological care for women, [and] delayed insulin treatment for diabetic patients.” In a press availability Monday, Homan responded with indifference to the report of the recent in-custody death of a 75-year-old Cuban immigrant who'd first arrived in the United States in 1966: “People die in ICE custody,” Homan said. “People die in county jails. People die in state prisons.”


	Speaking to the religious audience in D.C., the border czar insisted that President Trump's orders to target “the worst first” is still in effect. But he made clear that anyone without legal status should live in fear of what's coming. “The media has been hitting me up lately saying, Homan is lying. They're not arresting just criminals and public safety threats. They're arresting non-criminals. What they're afraid to tell you is: Yeah, they're in a country illegally. So they're on the table too.”The Big Beautiful Bill also provides, Gupta says, $10 billion in funding to deputize local law enforcement into the detention and deportation ranks — a move that seems destined to exacerbate the rag-tag optics of armed men wearing face gaiters jumping out of cars and tackling alleged undocumented immigrants.In a recent TV interview, ICE's Lyons said he would prefer that officers not mask, because it is “hot” and “dangerous.” But he justified the practice, because “ICE agents are being doxed at a horrible rate.” Doxing refers to making personal details public. The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about Lyons' definition of doxing, in what circumstances it is a crime (there is a narrow federal anti-doxing provision), or what horrific metric Lyons was referring to. 


	However DHS makes no apologies for the fact that “undercover” federal officers on immigration duty look like irregular combatants. “When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted,” Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rolling Stone.


	In a separate statement, DHS maintained that its agents always “verbally identify themselves as with ICE or Homeland Security,” that they “wear vests that say ICE/ERO or Homeland Security,” and that they're “flanked by vehicles that also say the name of the department.” Such claims are contradicted by viral videos and Senate hearings. 


	Consider the case of Brad Lander, the New York City mayoral candidate who was tackled and detained after trying to accompany a New Yorker through the hallway of a federal court courthouse after an immigration proceeding. One of the apparent under-cover agents who nabbed Lander wore jeans and a shirt branded “Rogue” — from a clothing company whose motto is: “We do not come in peace.”In a recent Senate hearing Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.) pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi on the dangers of masked ICE agents who do “not follow required protocol to identify themselves as law enforcement.” Peters told Bondi he was “deeply concerned” about the “lack of identification” by federal agents, calling it “dangerous both to the public as well as to the officers themselves.” He told Bondi that “the public risks being harmed by individuals pretending to be immigration enforcement which has already happened.” He added that federal agents “also risk being injured by individuals who think they're basically being kidnapped or attacked by some unknown assailant.”

	











	In the face of this questioning, the attorney general struck a pose of ignorance. “Senator Peters, that's the first time that issue has come to me.” But Bondi countered that agents “are being doxed,” adding: “They're being threatened; their families are being threatened.”


	In his speech to Faith & Freedom, Homan talked up how the feds are arresting those who challenge ICE and its irregular operations — making plain that legal peril awaits any would-be Good Samaritan who misapprehends an authorized ICE arrest as violent crime: “You can't impede our enforcement efforts. That's a felony, and we will prosecute,” Homan said. “You cannot put your hands on an ICE officer. We're prosecuting two judges. We're prosecuting a member of Congress,” he bragged. “You can't cross the line.”


	ICE's current director, Lyons has blamed the city of Portland, Oregon, for the agency's masking imperative, telling an interviewer: “We had ICE officers' names, addresses, and family Instagrams [and] Facebook posted and spread all around the city of Portland, saying ‘No Rest For Ice.'”It will not come as any surprise that ICE agents are not celebrated in the biggest, bluest city in Oregon, a sanctuary state, where law enforcement is largely prohibited from participating in immigration enforcement. Portland has been ground zero for confrontations between protesters and the feds in recent years. Trump pioneered a militarized crackdown on protesters in Portland in 2020, when citizens were snatched off the sidewalk into unmarked cars, and feds shot chemical munitions and less-lethal projectiles against people protesting police violence.Though they have not matched the intensity of the conflict in Los Angeles, where Trump federalized the National Guard and deployed the Marines, anti-ICE protests here have been smoldering here for weeks.


	The ICE facility in Portland is catty corner to the city's main Tesla dealership — itself the target of incessant protests in recent weeks. The ICE building resembles a minimum security prison, and it occupies an odd-angled city block hemmed in by a freeway and overgrown trolley tracks. The three-story taupe concrete structure is currently up-armored in plywood, its windows and doors covered to the second floor. 


	The building is also splashed with graffiti ranging from Zen-like scolding — “LOOK INWARD” — to the bloodthirsty — “Kill KKKops.” Many of the messages equate ICE with the “Gestapo.” One grafito reads: “NAZI CUCKS.” Across the street from the gates of the main driveway, a small group of protesters is gathered by a folding table and a sun tent. Some are yelling “Fuck ICE!”  They have a sign for passing motorists reading: “YOU'RE NOT SAFE, YOU'RE NEXT.”


The air on a recent weekday afternoon is spicy with the scent of exploded pepper balls and “green gas,” a crowd-control chemical, deployed against protesters the previous night when federal agents in riot gear emerged to confront a woman, whom DHS's McLaughlin alleges “threatened officers with a large knife by swinging it and then throwing it at them.” (The woman has been charged with attempted assault of a federal officer.)

	











	A 47-year-old protester who identified herself only as Jezzy told Rolling Stone that she'd been coming to the “nonviolent encampment” most nights since the “No Kings” rallies against Trump in mid-June, along with her “Latina Aztec daughter,” who's 18. Jezzy says she left before the violent clash the previous night, but added that showdowns between protesters and the feds were commonplace.

	“I don't know how many times we've been smoke bombed,” Jezzy says. “We got gassed very badly our first night.” After dark, as Jezzy describes it, feds in riot gear often emerge from the gate and fire pepper balls against protesters. She accuses them of “ripping up protester signs.” 


	She describes these federal agents as “very, very angry” and “abusive of all the fucking rights anybody has as a human — or as an American.” Despite a personal toll, Jezzy insists she's committed to showing up to defend community members at risk from Trump and his faceless forces. She describes her new daily ritual: “I work. I protest. I do it all over again.”

Follow all of our Sean Combs trial coverage


Sean Combs has been acquitted of sex-trafficking and racketeering-conspiracy charges, the hip-hop mogul dropping to his knees, praying, and thanking God after the jury shuffled out of the room Wednesday morning.


	While the 55-year-old was acquitted on the more serious charges, Combs was found guilty on lesser felony charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. “I'm going home,” Combs mouthed to his weeping family members.  


	From the moment Combs' ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura filed her bombshell sex-trafficking lawsuit against him in November 2023, which led to his arrest on the same allegation last September, Combs has adamantly maintained his innocence. High-powered defense attorneys for the Bad Boy Records boss did not shy away from his brutal and frequent violence toward Ventura, but repeatedly emphasized that “domestic violence is not sex trafficking.” 


	Facing life in prison if convicted of racketeering conspiracy, Combs put his hand over his face and bowed his head with relief as the first “not guilty” count was read aloud. His family, who have stood by his side throughout, gasped aloud before breaking out into cheers. As the jury left, Combs clasped his hands and, gesturing towards the jury, said, “Thank you, thank you.”


	But the jury rejected Combs' claim he was simply paying male escorts for their time and not for handing them cash after having sex with his girlfriends. Prosecutors called their defense a “ridiculous argument.”

	











	The prostitution conviction could land Combs in prison for up to 20 years, with each charge carrying a possible sentence of up to 10 years. Legal experts, however, have noted that the actual sentence could be less severe, especially since Combs had no prior criminal record. A sentencing date has not yet been set.

	











	More immediately pressing was Judge Arun Subramanian's decision on whether to remand Combs back into custody or to release him on bond as he awaits sentencing. Prosecutors raised concerns that Combs would “flagrantly disregard orders from this court” if released. They cited evidence presented during the trial that Combs “continued to commit a litany of crimes” — such as alleged abuse and drug use — even after he knew he was under federal investigation.


	“This is very, very serious conduct,” said lead prosecutor Maurene Comey, who also expressed concerns that Combs would “commit new crimes” and be a flight risk.

	Combs' attorneys, however, have argued he should be released today on “appropriate conditions.” Lawyer Marc Agnifilo said, “Mr. Combs has been given his life by this jury,” adding that his client would be “nothing short of a fool” to violate a court order. “He will not run afoul of anything this court imposes on him,” Agnifilo said.


	Subramanian will make a decision on Combs' release later today, with both sides asked to submit letters to the judge on the matter by 1 p.m. ET.


	The verdict was read aloud to a packed courtroom after a group of eight men and four women took 13 hours to deliberate. The panel had largely made up their minds by Tuesday evening, telling Subramanian they had reached verdicts on the sex-trafficking and transportation-to-engage-in-prostitution charges related to Ventura and an ex-girlfriend who testified under the name “Jane.” 


	However, they said they were “unable” to agree on the racketeering-conspiracy charge due to “unpersuadable opinions on both sides.” But after Subramanian instructed the jury to continue deliberating, they returned a final verdict the next day. 


	“Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex-trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution,” Ventura's lawyer, Doug Wigdor, said in a statement. “By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.” Wigdor added that Ventura “brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussion.”


	The three days of deliberation followed 28 days of grueling and emotional testimony from 34 government witnesses. During closing arguments last week, lead defense attorney Agnifilo choked back tears and accused the government of unfairly targeting Combs in a broad overreach of power. Prosecutors, Agnifilo alleged, used Ventura's lawsuit as a springboard to pry into Combs' private life and slap him with criminal statutes based on his untraditional sexual preferences. 

	











	In what was described as the busy mogul's “personal time” and “release,” Combs would film his girlfriends having dayslong sexual encounters with male escorts. He allegedly treated the sessions as his personal adult-film sets, filling hotel rooms with designer candles, choreographing the sequences of events, and giving instructions on what should happen next. 


	Prosecutors claim Combs kept Ventura and Jane high on a buffet of drugs, particularly Ecstasy, and refused to hear “no” when they tried to avoid participating in the freak-offs. In a yearslong pattern, Combs allegedly manipulated and forced the women to submit to his sexual desires through physical force, coercion, and/or threats of financial harm and to release the women's explicit tapes.


	Flipping between outrage and incredulity, Agnifilo downplayed the so-called “freak-offs” that were the heart of the government's case against Combs. He called them “beautiful” gatherings filled with nice music, good food, and “vulnerable” intimacy. “You want to call it swingers, you want to call it threesomes, whatever you want to call it, that's what it is. That's what the evidence shows,” Agnifilo said of Combs hiring male escorts to have sex with his girlfriends. “He wouldn't think in a million years that there's anything wrong with it.” 


	The jury seemed to agree, acquitting Combs of sex-trafficking Ventura and Jane. He was also cleared of using a team of high-ranking staffers, security members, and “young and eager” personal assistants that were more akin to foot soldiers as part of a racketeering conspiracy.


	Combs appeared confident throughout the trial, so much so that his high-powered defense team did not put on any witnesses when presenting their defense. Instead, his attorneys read aloud a series of texts between Ventura and Combs, where the R&B singer seemingly expressed eagerness about the dayslong, drug-fueled encounters. Within 25 minutes, they rested, confident the evidence — or lack thereof — was in their favor.  


	The government claimed that from 2004 up until his September 2024 arrest, Combs was the leader of a racketeering conspiracy that largely revolved around his sex life with his girlfriends. As part of the enterprise, Combs and his alleged co-conspirators were accused of carrying out crimes at their boss' direction, including three separate instances of kidnapping; firebombing Kid Cudi's car over the musician's fling with Ventura; bribing a hotel employee with $100,000 to make damning footage of Combs attacking Ventura disappear; witness tampering and drug distribution, among others. 

	











	Throughout the alleged racketeering conspiracy, Combs was sex-trafficking his girlfriends, prosecutors alleged, first with Ventura between 2009 and 2018, and then with Jane between January 2021 and September 2024. He allegedly paid for male escorts to fly in from various cities to join him in Los Angeles, New York, Miami, and Turks and Caicos, paying them in cash after the men had sex with his girlfriends. 


	This is not the first time Combs has emerged largely unscathed from a criminal trial where the weight of the law seemed stacked against him. The man who was known to wear a gold Lazarus chain was facing 15 years in prison over his alleged role in a 1999 nightclub shooting — his future ascent to running a billion-dollar empire hanging in the balance. But he walked free in March 2001, hugging his mother Janice outside a courthouse just a few blocks away from the federal courthouse where Combs could soon depart.  


	And although no criminal charges were ever filed, New York City officials were pointing fingers at a 22-year-old Combs for his part in promoting and overselling a charity basketball game at City College of New York in December 1991, where nine people died in a stampede. After issuing apologies and settling several civil lawsuits, the tragedy became a footnote in Combs' legacy as he went on to found his iconic label Bad Boy Records in 1993 and discover the Notorious B.I.G.

	Combs still faces more than 50 civil lawsuits. Ventura's lawsuit, which was settled for $20 million within 24 hours, sparked a tidal wave of similar allegations from both men and women. The alleged sexual assaults were sprinkled throughout Combs' three-decade career beginning in 1990, and as recently as July 2024, as models, music-industry figures, and people who had one-off encounters claim Combs preyed on them.  


	Combs had vehemently denied all accusations of sexual assault. “Mr. Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex-trafficked anyone — man or woman, adult or minor,” his legal team has previously said in a statement.

	Lootings. Fights. Things thrown at customer service workers. Arguments in grocery stores. The trial of a 17-year-old alleged stabber. High schoolers dancing to rap music at graduation. A Black, female Iron Man. 


	To scroll on these kinds of videos online is to interact with different communities. But while the average internet user might see a viral fight, some are using clickbait videos as concrete proof of a popular phrase: Black fatigue. On social media sites like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and TikTok, the term is being used by conservative-leaning social media users to describe an exhaustion with both Black culture, and the prioritization of Black people. Social media users comment on violent videos or on clips of Black people speaking about white privilege, but often accompanied by thinly veiled racist rhetoric. “It's when I can hear you 10 aisles away in Walmart with your fucking five kids,” said one TikTok creator. “When you have no home training and no idea how to act in public.” But before the term was a viral digital punchline, it was a concept used to describe how racism and microaggressions in the workplace can lead to physical symptoms in Black communities. Author Mary-Frances Winters, who popularized the term in 2020, tells Rolling Stone that while she's not surprised the phrase has been co-opted, she's choosing to not let it get to her — because that's exactly what online trolls want. 

	











	“I have given my life to this work. When I was in high school, I was an activist. When I was in college, I was an activist,” says Winters, 74. “I'm not gonna live the rest of my life — however much of it I have left — letting Black fatigue impact who I am.”

	A DEI consultant and researcher, Winters first encountered what she later described as Black fatigue while conducting diversity focus groups and interviews with Black employees at major companies. Group after group told her the same thing: microagressions, racism, and a lack of diversity at work had done more than make them upset. It was wearing them down physically and emotionally. That was when Winters began exploring research linking racism to poor physical outcomes. With that starting point in mind, she wrote her 2020 book Black Fatigue: How Racism Erodes the Mind, Body, and Spirit.

	“In my book, Black fatigue is the mental and physical exhaustion that comes from repeated acts of discrimination over time,” Winters says. “It's not just, ‘I'm tired because I had a long, busy day.' No, it's this repeated racism that wears you down, over and over again.” 


	While Winters' book helped popularize the term in 2020, following the death of George Floyd and the national focus on the Black Lives Matters movement, it was only earlier this year that she realized the phrase was being turned on its head online. According to Know Your Meme, Black fatigue regained prevalence on social media after the stabbing arrest of 17-year-old Karmelo Anthony in Texas. The Black teen was arrested and indicted on murder charges in April for allegedly stabbing white teenager Austin Metcalf to death at a track and field meet. The racial components of the alleged murder made Anthony a heavy topic of discourse online and on conservative news channels, especially after his family started a GoFundMe to raise money for his legal defense. People used Black fatigue to describe being frustrated with supporters of Anthony, then Black violence in general, and finally, the entire Black community. 


	Zari Taylor, a faculty fellow and digital culture expert at New York University, tells Rolling Stone that the reframing of social justice or anti-racism is a tried-and-true tactic on social media, especially for right-leaning pundits. Many phrases used in social justice are first mocked, and then transformed to mean something else entirely. It's a way of using a phrase's popularity to further an alternative agenda. “Conservatives tend to do a lot of co-opting of Black politics, especially in the digital space. So Black Lives Matter, Blue Lives Matter, woke versus woke, Black fatigue, black fatigue,” she says. “It's the same thing. Once those words reach a certain level of mainstream [recognition] within digital culture, people like to co-opt them for their own purposes.”

	Taylor points to the ongoing wave of anti-DEI and social justice movements in national politics as one reason why people might feel more emboldened to say more overtly racist things on social media. President Donald Trump and Republican leadership have blamed everything from passenger jet crashes to bridge collapses on diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. And Elon Musk's purchase of X has transformed the social media site from a functioning tool to an echo chamber of conspiracy theories, anti-LGBT rhetoric, and outright racist language. It makes sense that the new definition of Black fatigue has continued to proliferate on the app — it's right at home.

	When Winters first realized how the phrase was being reimagined online, she was initially “devastated,” she tells Rolling Stone. But she says after looking into many of the accounts and groups who were using it to defend racist takes and punchlines, she decided that it wasn't going to make her stop advocating for the Black community, and solutions to Black fatigue as she defines it. 


	“People who are in these extremes are not open to a conversation. I'm choosing not to let it impact me personally, emotionally,” Winters says. “I'm not going to get involved in whatever delusions, disinformation, or pain that causes people to be racist. I don't know what they're dealing with. But I know what my truth is. And I'm sticking to it.”

							By 

	Daniel Kreps



	To coincide with the band's 30th anniversary, Foo Fighters returned Wednesday with “Today's Song,” their first new music in two years.


Dave Grohl revealed the song on the band's official website, accompanied by a reflective 13-minute audio statement where he acknowledged, for the first time, the departure of drummer Josh Freese, who joined the band following the death of Taylor Hawkins.


	“Over the years, we've had moments of unbridled joy and moments of devastating heartbreak. Moments of beautiful victory, and moments of painful defeat. We have mended broken bones and broken hearts. But we have followed this road together, with each other, for each other, no matter what. Because in life, you just can't go it alone,” Grohl said.


	“It should go without saying that without the boundless energy of William Goldsmith, the seasoned wisdom of Franz Stahl, and the thunderous wizardry of Josh Freese, this story would be incomplete, so we extend our heartfelt gratitude for the time, music, and memories that we shared with each of them over the years. Thank you, gentlemen.”

	











	Grohl's lengthy statement reminisces about encountering Nate Mendel for the first time on Thanksgiving in 1994, and how that chance meeting resulted in the birth of the Foo Fighters. “A few heaping plates of food, a few bottles of wine, one thing leading to another, and before long we had started a new band with other dear friends, Pat Smear and William Goldsmith,” Grohl said. “We called it Foo Fighters.” The band's self-titled debut album arrived on June 26, 1995.

	Later in the note, Grohl paid tribute to his late friend and band mate Hawkins. “And… Taylor. Your name is spoken every day, sometimes with tears, sometimes with a smile, but you are still in everything we do, everywhere we go, forever,” Grohl added. “The enormity of your beautiful soul is only rivaled by the infinite longing we feel in your absence. We all miss you beyond words. Foo Fighters will forever include Taylor Hawkins in every note that we play, until we do finally reach our destination.”


	“Today's Song” itself echoes many of the themes in Grohl's note, namely the passage of time. “Two sides to a river / Too troubled to cross / It might take you under / Today's song,” Grohl sings on the track. “We'll drown in the middle / Which side are you on / One way or another / Today's song.”

	The track marks the Foo Fighters' first new original music since their 2023 album But Here We Are; the band quietly resurfaced for the first time amid all the domestic drama recently to release a Minor Threat cover.


	It appears Grohl and company are revving up for their grand return as the band has announced October concerts in Indonesia, Singapore, and Japan, their first shows together in over a year.

CONNECTICUT — World UFO Day 2025, celebrated on July 2, commemorates the 78th anniversary of what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers.” It started with the first widely publicized U.S. sighting of an unidentified flying object by a civilian pilot searching the Cascade Mountains of Washington for a crashed military aircraft, followed by the crash of a mysterious object near Roswell, New Mexico, on July 2, 1947.

Ever since we have known what to look for, it has been clear that Connecticut gets better than its fair share of visitors from strange planets. The National UFO Reporting Center takes thousands of reports a year from people who can't explain what they're seeing, whether a bright light, a peculiarly shaped object, or an aircraft that rapidly accelerates and decelerates just as quickly, seemingly exceeding current understanding of propulsion.

This year alone, 13 reports have been made about unusual sightings in the skies over Connecticut. 

Just last week in Hamden, a skywatcher reported ""at least 6 craft"" bathed in the ""whitest light … changing directions and formations/colors flashing at times."" The sky show lasted for 25 minutes, ending just after 4 a.m.

Two weeks ago, a couple driving northward just past the National Guard Armory ""looked up and saw what I would describe as a large automobile front-end. It had red and blue lights where the headlights would be and spanning between them was an array of 4 to 6 very bright white lights. The red and blue lights were not pulsating … It was so big, I compare it to standing a few feet away from the front of a semi-truck's cab.""

Shortly after 9 p.m. on May 1, Trumbull residents caught on video ""something flying towards us that wasn't normal"" in their backyard. The 8-second clip uploaded to NUFORC shows ""six lights in a teardrop formation and a very loud noise kinda like a helicopter but sounded like waves.""

We know they're there, but do they know we know they're there? Their bold, recurring shenanigans above a couple of Connecticut towns this year suggest they just might.

In January, a Norwalk resident of 57 years extended an open invitation to like-minded skywatchers to visit Couch Street any evening and see the alien parade for themselves: 

Another concerned citizen reported to NUFORC in January that they had ""been seeing star like flying things"" every clear night for a month, over a pond in the middle of some woods in Killingly. 

‘Summer Of The Flying Saucers'

On June 24, 1947, civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, when he saw nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at about 10,000 feet at about a nearly impossible speed for the times of 1,200 to 1,700 mph. .

It wasn't the first sighting of a UFO, but the public quickly became fascinated — and slightly terrified — after Arnold's sighting was reported worldwide. News coverage often included references to a “flying saucer,” a play on Arnold's statement that the object moved “like a saucer would if you skipped it over water.”

More reports followed during what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers,” including the Roswell incident. The Roswell Army Air Field announced in a July 8, 1947, news release that it had recovered the wreckage of a “flying disc” from W.W. “Mac” Brazel's ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell. 

The release was straightforward, noting:

“The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff's office of Chaves County.

“The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. Not having phone facilities, the rancher stored the disc until such time as he was able to contact the sheriff's office, who in turn notified Major Jesse A Marcel of the 509th Bomb Group Intelligence Office.

“Action was immediately taken and the disc was picked up at the rancher's home. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.”

The Roswell Army Air Field mentioned nothing in its press release about alien life, but people were already growing uneasy about what might be circling overhead. Brazel was among them. 

He thought the object he found on his ranch was similar to what Arnold had seen, or to the objects described in stories about flying saucers and discs, so he gathered some of the material from the wreckage, including rubber strips, tinfoil and thick paper, and deposited them with Sheriff George Wilcox, who in turn turned it over to the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Air Field.

Military Said It Was Mistaken

Within 24 hours of the original press release, the military backtracked and said a mistake had been made and the “flying disc” was in reality a crashed weather balloon.

The story was widely accepted, and the Roswell incident might have become a forgotten chapter in history if not for a 1978 conversation between physicist and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman and Marcel, by then retired, according to an account in BBC's Sky At Night Magazine.

Marcel said the weather balloon story had been a cover, the photos had been staged, weather balloon debris had been substituted for the real wreckage, and that everyone involved in the retrieval believed it to be an extraterrestrial craft. The story was corroborated by a number of other retired military personnel who had been at Roswell at the time.

Some skeptics dismissed it as a tall tale, saying Marcel and others were seeking attention or writing themselves into the story. Regardless, Roswell became embedded in pop culture books, documentaries and movies.

One story that captured the attention of conspiracy theorists was that the wreckage had been seized by the military to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial flight at Area 51 — a highly classified Air Force military installation in the Nevada desert primarily known for its role in developing and testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems. And a fake film clip purported to show “an alien autopsy” connected to Roswell.

Bowing to public pressure about the incident in the 1990s, the government launched a retrospective investigation that concluded the object that crashed was a Project Mogul weather balloon carrying top-secret equipment designed to search the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests.

A Government-Fueled Conspiracy?

2025 brings an interesting new twist to the story. 

According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal published on June 6, the government fueled the UFO conspiracy theories, especially during the Cold War, to hide its true mission at Area 51. Specifically, the Pentagon wanted to conceal the development of advanced aircraft, such as the otherworldly-looking F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, according to the report.

The disinformation campaign was uncovered by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, established by the Pentagon in 2022, to investigate UAP reports. A report last year dismissed the notion that the government covered up the existence of extraterrestrial life But, The Journal reported, “public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.”

As an investigation of the possibility of deliberate misinformation to hide secret programs continues, the government continues to take UAP and other unexplained phenomena seriously, The Associated Press reported.

THE first ever bombshell footage of the infamous ""Mosul orb"" UFO captured by a US spy plane in Iraq has now been released. 

The declassified video, filmed in 2016 by a US MC-12 surveillance aircraft, shows a mysterious metallic spherical object flying over the city of Mosul.  

Interestingly, the four-second footage shows the UFO flying at a constant speed without dropping altitude. 

The object appeared suddenly and moved erratically in and out of the camera's view. 

The clip was obtained by Dustin Slaughter, a leading UFO investigator, through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request - and was shown to the public by UFO podcaster Jeremy Corbell. 

It comes two years after the first still image from the video was declassified by the Pentagon. 

The image was part of a classified briefing for US officials and was later released to the public.

 It's considered part of the ongoing investigation into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs) by the US intelligence community. 

Corbell said at the time: ""For the first time, we are releasing a military filmed image of a UAP over an active conflict zone,” he said.

“UAP pose a significant risk to our service men and women, and this case highlights this – and is unfortunately not unique.

“Origin, capability, operator and intent have not been determined in relation to this intelligently controlled UFO over Mosul, Iraq.

""At a minimum UAP pose a fundamental intelligence and combat identification problem that must be addressed.”

Meanwhile, another declassified UFO footage showed a similar mystery metal orb soaring above the ground - leaving US officials puzzled.

In 2023, A testimony was heard at Capitol Hill, Washington DC, as the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office revealed the shocking clips.

The videos released in the declassified cases are said to have been observed by US military drones.

The footage showed a mystery ""metal orb"" as it hovered and flew across open airspace.

The incidents were believed to have been recorded in the Middle East and South Asia.

Corbell has been behind a string of high-profile leaks featuring encounters between UFOs and the US military one which was played at a landmark hearing held by Congress.

FOR decades, UFOs and aliens were considered to be make belief things created by people in tinfoil hats but they are now considered a threat to national security.

Long gone are those who claim conspiracy theories are all false as many are now discussed at the highest levels of government with US officials even admitting their existence.

As more and more credible witnesses continue to come forward to tell their extraordinary stories publicly.

The 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security.

Across the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing ""dead alien corpses"" on display for Congress.

Researchers recently verified the legitimacy of a set of three-fingered mummies as potential evidence of ""non-human"" life forms.

A line-up of doctors confirmed at Mexico's Congress on Tuesday that the bodies, purportedly not of this Earth, were in fact real, once-living organisms.

The Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme.

The haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans, sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech.

Top UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity ""in our backyard.""

The Pentagon's UFO analysis office launched a UFO reporting service to the public after admitting to uncovering ""some things"" and calling the high number of suspicious activity either a foreign power or aliens.

Navy jet footage has revealed the intriguing images of a government-confirmed UFO baffling the internet.

The United States Government launched the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) in 2022 to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs).

He urged the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office to dedicate resources to “this enduring mystery on behalf of the American and global public”.

Corbell had previously directed 2018 documentary film Bob Lazar: Area 51 and the Flying Saucers.

It tells the story of Lazar, who claims to be a former US government physicist who worked with tech from UFOs.

It comes after a picture claiming to show a 1,000ft wide silver UFO flying over the US was released by an infamous Pentagon whistleblower.

The picture was allegedly snapped by an airline pilot in 2021 while flying 21,000ft above the Four Corners Monument - spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado.

The spooky picture shows what looks like a circular object floating above the Earth.

The UAP Disclosure Fund shared the image on X, and wrote: “Captured near Four Corners at FL20 — estimated 600 – 1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped.”

“Several speakers confirmed Department of Defense and Intelligence Community hold hundreds of similar UAP images + sensor files still classified.

“It's time for full declassification and open scientific analysis.”

But sceptics were quick to challenge the discovery - claiming the photo merely showed irrigation circles that are common in desert climates.

Residents and businesses asked to reduce non-essential water use starting June 13.  Read more.

Back by popular demand, the City of Weyburn will welcome Canadian Paranormal Expeditions to Weyburn's Heritage Village on July 19th for the second annual Paranormal Investigation.

Leisure Services Manager for the City of Weyburn, Amanda Wallace, said this year's event will include four time slots. 

""The four times are 7 p.m., 9:30 p.m., a Midnight tour [12 a.m.], and a Witching Hour tour [2:30 a.m.]. Last year we saw quite a demand in some of the earlier times. But post-event we've been hearing from the public that they really are interested and eager to do a Witching Hour tour. The Witching hour technically occurs at 3 a.m., so we're trying to hit that right in the middle, so we are going to kick things off at 2:30 a.m. and by the time instructions and everything are all said and done, you'll be on your way and doing your investigation by 3 a.m. in the hopes to get all of the spookiness that may occur for the Witching hour."" 

The CPE leaders on hand will be, 'certified ghost hunters', who will provide a half-hour instructional session as well as all of the specialty ghost hunting equipment. 

""Some of the programs that the CPE leaders or ghost hunters use do have cell phone capabilities in order to communicate with the spirits. We encourage people to just really be thoroughly engaged in the experience."" 

""What will happen is you register at the front gate with the staff, and then we will get instructions to the masses, and then we divide it out,"" she explained. ""Post instructions, you'll be grouped. Then in your group, you're assigned a CPE, a Canadian paranormal Expeditions Leader, and then they will take you on a guided-esque tour. You will kind of follow the CPE Ghost Hunter to a designated area, they will do some speaking prompts and then you will be able to hold and manipulate ghost equipment while you're in throughout the village.""

The different toys, Wallace noted, include a cat ball, with some new to this year's tour. She said everyone should bring a photo identification as well as a flashlight.

""We encourage people to come with an open mind because, I mean, if you come with a closed mind, you're not going to get a lot of the experience. But even if you're a non-believer, come with an open mind and you never know what might pop up or what you might experience. I know some individuals last year came through and didn't really think they might get a lot out of it, and lo and behold, they got a lot out of the event.""

Wallace added an advisory for attendees to be respectful of the environment and facilities, and to plan to be as sober as possible for the event.

The number of people able to register for each time slot has been reduced to 30 this year, with only 27 spots for the last tour. Given the limited spots, early registration is encouraged.

Anyone experiencing difficulty with registration can call the Leisure Service Department at 306-848-3280.","{'href': 'https://discoverweyburn.com', 'title': 'DiscoverWeyburn'}","other"

The viral 2019 Facebook event is revisited in 'Trainwreck: Storm Area 51', premiering July 29 on Netflix

 Netflix is revisiting the viral Facebook event that took the internet by storm. 


 On June 27, 2019, 21-year-old Matty Roberts created a satirical Facebook event titled ""Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us."" Intended as a joke, the post invited users to band together and raid Area 51 — a highly classified United States Air Force facility in Nevada — to uncover extraterrestrial life, long rumored to be hidden there.


 “I had no idea what I'd started,” Roberts, now 26, says in the trailer for Trainwreck: Storm Area 51, which will premiere on July 29 as part of Netflix's six-episode Trainwreck documentary series. “It just seemed like a hilarious idea to me.”

 What began as a sarcastic question — “What if every fool on the internet converged on Area 51 what would they do? Shoot everyone?” — suddenly seemed plausible after more than 2 million people marked themselves as “going,” and another 1.5 million as “interested.”


 “We're about to storm one of the most heavily guarded military bases in the world,” a man says in the trailer, exclusively shared with People. “Why? Because the internet told us to.”


 To coincide with the event, organizers planned a music festival — Alienstock — in Rachel, Nev., the tiny town nearest to Area 51. As the date approached, law enforcement prepared for a potentially dangerous situation. The trailer includes ominous government warnings: “Anyone breaching Area 51 will be shot.” One official remarks, “It'd gotten out of hand, and it had gotten out of hand in a hurry.”

 The challenge of preparing the remote town for an influx of visitors was daunting. “Where do you host a million people in the middle of nowhere?” a man asks in the trailer. “We were building a city from nothing.” A woman adds, “We have a restaurant, camping space, and ten rooms. That's it.”


 As the event gained momentum, Roberts grew concerned. “This whole time I'm sitting here with less than a thousand dollars in my bank account,” he says, alongside videos of him being interviewed on television.


 In the end, there was no raid and no aliens — just a few thousand attendees, many in costume, celebrating a viral moment in internet history. “We are going to dress as sexy aliens,” a woman says in the trailer. “We're going out into the desert, and we're getting probed.”

The second half of Ironheart has arrived on Disney+, and you can find a full breakdown of how things play out here. Like almost every MCU movie and TV show, there is a post-credits scene, but figuring out what it means for the future is easier said than done. 

After having his Hood taken from him by Riri Williams, Parker Robbins heads to the store run by Zelma Stanton's mom and seeks out the teenager's help. Well, some ""supreme"" help that he hopes she can assist him in tracking down (earlier in the series, Zelma mentions that she trained at Kamar-Taj for a time, so he's likely hoping to be connected with the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong). 

The scene ends with him suggesting they do a little ""abracadabra"" together, and it feels a lot like this was meant to lay the groundwork for the Strange Academy TV series that's now on hold. 

The idea was presumably for Zelma and Parker to train under Wong, with the latter hoping to regain his soul from Mephisto. Riri Williams may have even factored into the show, but as things stand, this is a pretty confusing stinger that only really confirms there are plans for Parker and Zelma's stories to continue...somewhere. 

Ironheart has been sitting on the shelf since it wrapped shooting in 2022, and much has changed for Marvel Studios since then.

Midnight Sons, Blade, and perhaps even a Ghost Rider movie are thought to be in production, but the likelihood of the stories of these streaming characters continuing in any of those movies surely can't be any better than 50/50. We'll have to wait and see. 

Set after the events of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Marvel Television's Ironheart pits technology against magic when Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) - a young, genius inventor determined to make her mark on the world - returns to her hometown of Chicago.

Her unique take on building iron suits is brilliant, but in pursuit of her ambitions, she finds herself wrapped up with the mysterious yet charming Parker Robbins aka ""The Hood"" (Anthony Ramos).

The series also stars Lyric Ross, Alden Ehrenreich, Regan Aliyah, Manny Montana, Matthew Elam and Anji White. Chinaka Hodge is head writer and executive producer; episodes are directed by Sam Bailey and Angela Barnes.

""Ironheart soars when Dominique Thorne, Anthony Ramos, Alden Ehrenreich, and Lyric Ross are on screen,"" we wrote in our 3* review, ""but a by-the-numbers story means the series falls short of reaching the same heights as Iron Man. Still, the finale is an undeniable must-see.""

All episodes of Ironheart are now streaming on Disney+.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Let's Face It, Supernatural Season 15 Made The Right Call Reversing The Show's Original Ending","https://screenrant.com/supernatural-season-15-reverse-original-ending-made-sense/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 03:40:00 GMT","

Supernatural season 15 brought the long-running CW series to a somewhat divisive end; while some viewers appreciated the larger story beats, others felt they could've been executed more seamlessly. There's always the argument to be made that Supernatural should have ended in season 5, as it was intended to. But overall, there are enough highlights in its 15 seasons that this stance doesn't hold up.

And in a way, Supernatural's true ending resembles that of season 5's ""Swan Song."" The show's final episode, ""Carry On,"" still kills one of the Winchesters — and leaves the other to move on without them. The penultimate episode of Supernatural, ""Inherit the Earth,"" also features a high-stakes confrontation on par with Sam and Dean's stand-off with Lucifer. 

However, it's the Winchesters' fates at the end of Supernatural season 15 that are most notable, as they're reminiscent of their circumstances after ""Swan Song."" The only difference is that ""Carry On"" reverses their roles, and it does so in a way that feels more in line with their stories.

Supernatural season 15 flips the series' original season 5 ending, as it swaps the Winchesters' fates. In ""Swan Song,"" Sam sacrifices himself in order to trap Lucifer back in Hell and prevent the apocalypse from happening. Dean watches as his brother condemns himself to this fate, and then he returns to Lisa and attempts to live a normal life without hunting. 

Supernatural is still immensely popular, years after its ending, and Jensen Ackles had the perfect response to a potential revival of The CW show.

This doesn't last very long, as Supernatural season 6 sees Sam returning to the world of the living and Dean resuming his usual lifestyle. And season 15 turns their original endings on their heads, with Dean losing his life on the job and Sam giving up hunting for good.

Although many find ""Swan Song"" more satisfying, ""Carry On"" makes the right call by reversing its outcome.

There's been some debate about how this outcome was handled, but it does make more sense given the brothers' previous character arcs. Although many find ""Swan Song"" more satisfying, ""Carry On"" makes the right call by flipping its outcome.

Supernatural opens with Sam Winchester getting pulled back into hunting, despite his desire to lead an ordinary life, so season 15's finale feels like the natural conclusion to his journey. It's only his father's disappearance and Jessica's death that get him wrapped up in the family business again.

Sam finally getting to live out the life he envisioned for himself is a touching outcome for his character, and it highlights his ability to move on from all his losses. It's just as emotional as sacrificing himself for the greater good of the world — perhaps even more so.

Meanwhile, Dean is the type of character that will always get drawn back to hunting, as it's been his purpose since childhood. One of the least believable elements of Supernatural's original ending is Dean never trying to bring Sam back. He's a fighter through and through, and it makes sense that he'd go out that way in the series finale. 

Although Supernatural season 15's ending is the logical conclusion for both of the Winchester brothers, I do wish that Dean's send-off was a little bit stronger. Dean doesn't perish during some high-stakes, world-altering confrontation. Instead, he's killed tracking down a vampire, which feels underwhelming and unrealistic after everything he goes through.

""Carry On"" has the right idea when it comes to the Winchesters, but the way Supernatural's ending plays out leaves something to be desired.

It makes sense for Dean to go out on a hunt, but the way that job is handled is incredibly disappointing. This is one of the reasons Supernatural's series finale has gotten so much backlash. ""Carry On"" has the right idea when it comes to the Winchesters, but the way Supernatural's ending plays out leaves something to be desired.

I would argue that Dean didn't die from a ""random vampire"" but rather a random accident, because that vampire wasn't purposely aiming to put Dean on a spike.  And it speaks to the fact that since God wasn't wasn't writing their story and pulling their strings that all the randomness of life, whether it was good, bad or ugly, would define their future lives just like everyone else.

Season 15s ending sucked hard... loved the show, all through, but did not like the finale episode at all....

No, the show should have ended 10 seasons after Crowley was introduced.



That would have been the perfect ending. It would have implied that the show creator made a deal with the crossroads demon. Thing and when the 10 years was up, it's time to go.



That season finale should have cut to black at the end. And you should have heard hellhounds howling as it fades out.



How they got to that last episode would have been up to them, but that would have been the ending point of the show that made the most sense.



There's a reason you're not a show writer. 

Deans death was always going to happen but I think what disappointed me most was the way Dean died, I was late to supernatural so read online what happened so I've never watched that episode and never will.

They should bring the show back.  I wasn't ready for it to end. Why can't it be a long running show? The cop shows are!

It's one of the longest running live action shows…

Supernatural season 16 is discussed by cast and crew a whole lot with no sign of starting, and Jensen Ackles has revealed why that may be.

With Scott Gimple leaving the door open for Steven Yeun's The Walking Dead return, the series has the opportunity to feature an emotional reunion.

In a recent appearance on Amy Poehler's podcast, Idris Elba opened up about the iconic Stringer Bell scene from The Wire that he wasn't sure about.

After The Wheel of Time's surprise cancellation, this news about one of Prime Video's most anticipated fantasy adaptations is even more disappointing.

Mark Hamill's Joker casting was so groundbreaking that not even his fellow actors believed he was voicing the villain in Batman: The Animated Series.

Although this Fourth Wing character may appear cruel at first, Iron Flame and Onyx Storm reveal she was right to push Violet outside her comfort zone.

Although I'm excited for The Lincoln Lawyer season 4, which isn't here yet, I'm already eager for Netflix to adapt Michael Connelly's new book.","{'href': 'https://screenrant.com', 'title': 'Screen Rant'}","other"

For decades, people have been claiming to have been abducted by aliens. To these people, something profound has happened to them, but can we really say it is the result of extraterrestrials, or is something else going on?

For years, Steven Kilburn had felt uneasy when driving a particular stretch of road between Pikesville, Baltimore, and Frederick, Maryland. It was an uncanny feeling, not based in any solid memory; just an overwhelming sense of wrongness, like he was being watched. 

According to Steven, the feeling first started one night while driving home from the place where his college girlfriend had lived. “I don't know whether someone was watching me or I was watching something strange,” he explained. “Whatever it was that particular time, I remember I felt that something maybe had just happened to me, or was going to happen, and it was this very weird feeling.”

Whatever was going on, Steven was sure of one thing: “Every time I passed that approximate area, I felt for some reason something right there had happened.”

This sense of unease persisted for years until May 1978, when Steven was introduced to Dr Girard Franklin, a psychologist who was training in hypnosis at the time. Curious to know whether Steven's strange feelings were in fact the result of some sort of suppressed memory, Dr Franklin subjected him to hypnosis, which was increasingly used by people to access details their minds had supposedly “repressed”. What came next, however, was unexpected. 

Under hypnosis, Steven relived and narrated the events of the drive home that set this whole situation in motion. His voice was soft, almost slightly slurred as he recalled what he now “saw”. At first, the details of his drive home seemed normal, but suddenly, Steven paused, becoming hesitant. According to the events he was reliving, his car had inexplicably stopped working and he was forced to get out and investigate it on that lonely stretch of road. And then it happened: “It's on my shoulder,” Steven cried out, “...a clamp... it hurts. I can't move!”

Steven was terrified, his face streaming with tears, but he nevertheless continued explaining what he was seeing. Over the course of the next hour and a half, Steven relayed an incredible account of how, on that night years ago, he had been abducted by some unknown entities he described as being near human size, but with white skin and no hair on their heads. 

This account was recorded in Budd Hopkins' 1981 bestselling book Missing Time, which detailed various first-hand experiences from people who believed they had been abducted by aliens with no or little memory of their ordeals. The book provides various accounts from people Hopkins and colleagues interviewed on the subject of their supposed abduction experiences, most of which were gathered by way of hypnotic regression. 

So many people came forward, each with memories that appeared to have been wiped by alien influence, that Hopkins became convinced there was effectively a secret abduction plague going on. As he recalled in Missing Time:

 “An inescapable conclusion to be drawn from all these cases is that anyone could have been abducted, with no memory of it, no conscious recall even of a preliminary event like the sighting of a UFO.”    

However, is this conclusion sound? The obvious answer is probably not, but that doesn't mean something interesting wasn't occurring. Unbeknownst to Hopkins, as well as many other unidentified flying object (UFO) researchers at the time, this collective work came to show how many so-called alien abduction stories were in fact the result of created memories produced by the hypnotist/subject interaction. Or, to put it differently, rather than revealing the extent to which aliens were nabbing everyday people, Hopkins' work revealed how flexible memory can be and how false ones can be constructed. Today, this is one of the leading scientific explanations concerning alien abduction cases, but it is not the only one. 

Given the above account, you may be thinking one of three things. Firstly, that these people are mentally unwell and delusional. Secondly, they're lying. Or thirdly, that it all must be true, and therefore aliens are routinely abducting people. Of course, the final possibility is a little hard to support as doing so would also require substantial evidence in other scientific fields related to physics, biology, and so on. 

There is also no doubt that many people who claim to have encountered aliens, seen UFOs, or even been abducted have deliberately lied, either for attention, boredom, or sheer mischief. But what about those accounts made by people who are completely sincere and, more importantly, do not exhibit signs of any other psychological issues that might produce hallucinations or delusions?

This is an important and consistent point. Anyone who reads Missing Time or abduction claims made since the 1980s will be struck by how earnest many speakers are. In fact, I have received incredibly frank emails from IFLScience readers who wish to state plainly how they are not looking for attention or notoriety, but they are convinced that they have been abducted, and it was real. One individual even told me he had not believed in aliens or UFOs until his own experience. It's hard not to take someone at their word when they come across so earnest. 

This is something that struck Hopkins and many other avid alien encounter investigators over the years; people who underwent hypnosis to retrieve “lost” memories not only believed they were genuine encounters but were deeply traumatized by them. The whole phenomenon baffled Hopkins to such an extent that he became convinced he had stumbled on some sort of secret untold reality whereby countless unknowing people had no conscious memory of being abducted by aliens he believed were ultimately non-malevolent but nevertheless terrifying. 

In some cases, women who had supposedly become pregnant after an abduction – despite having no memory of the event or having had sex with anyone since then – would suddenly find they were no longer pregnant. Such strangeness was explained away as the person having been impregnated by an alien and then re-abducted before their due date, all so the visitors from outer space could collect their hybrid infants. 

It was this genuine sincerity that helped Hopkins' work become so popular. In fact, his approach even convinced Professor John E. Mack, who, during the early 1990s, was a Pulitzer Prize winner and eminent head of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. This led Mack to publish his own lengthy book on the subject of alien abduction accounts retrieved by hypnosis, which the author utterly believed were real. For Mack, alien abductions were even positive things, ultimately leading to spiritual enlightenment, and were akin to religious experiences scattered throughout history.

Anyone who's been reading to this point has likely noticed a repeated part of these stories – hypnotic regression. This tricky, sneaky technique is now largely recognized as highly controversial at best, or otherwise completely untrustworthy by mainstream scientific communities. To be sure, there's a whole history of hypnosis I couldn't do justice to here, but suffice it to say that hypnotic regression became particularly contentious in the so-called “memory wars” of the 1980s and 1990s. This was an extremely complex situation where the validity of supposedly recovered memories led to accusations of childhood sexual abuse. 

In short, under the influence of “memory recovery” techniques like hypnosis, some people became convinced they had been abused as children but had subsequently suppressed the memory. That is, until the hypnosis allowed them to “re-” discover them, often resulting in trauma and significant upset for the individuals and their families. In some cases, the recovered memories involved satanic rituals, cannibalism, and human sacrifice. And, as you can now probably guess, many such claims turned out to be the result of the hypnosis that assisted in creating and structuring these terrifying but untrue memories. To be clear, these were not lies; many people who had their memories “recovered”, like their alien-abduction counterparts, believed they were real.

Unfortunately, child abuse is a very real and far more prevalent phenomenon than many would like to believe, and so such cases should be taken seriously and investigated properly. However, in this context, the “memory wars” really demonstrated how slippery memory can be and how prone to imagination it is. 

Aside from these perspectives, there are other psychological factors that can lead some people to believe they've experienced an alien encounter more than others. Past research has demonstrated that people who measure higher for fantasy-proneness (a tendency to engage in vivid and elaborate mental worlds inside your own head), dissociativity (one's susceptibility to a sense of separation from the world around them), and absorption (the trait of becoming lost in an activity), all correlate with paranormal beliefs, experiences, and even false memories.  

Then there is the fascinating but complex subject of sleep paralysis, which has been identified as a likely source for alien abduction experiences, as well as those related to other fantastical creatures, such as witches, vampires, and demons from across the world. 

For more detail on this, especially in relation to alien abduction claims, I would thoroughly recommend reading anomalistic psychologist Chris French's new book: The Science of Weird Shit.  

When it comes to UFOs, alien encounters, and even alien abductions, Dr Robert Bartholomew is clear about one thing: “They're living folklore. They're modern myths in the making,” he told IFLScience.

Bartholomew, a medical sociologist and Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Auckland's Department of Psychological Medicine, is not alone in linking modern alien encounters with folklore traditions. Even during the heyday of alien abduction reports, folklorists identified parallels between alien encounters and fantasy /supernatural elements found in folklore. For example, in 1989, the folklorist Thomas E. Bullard wrote that “UFOs defy physical laws by making right-angle turns at high speed or disappearing in mid-flight. Short beings reminiscent of fairies appear from inside the craft. Men in Black haunt witnesses and share significant properties of traditional devils.”

Bullard went on to note that “for all the science fiction trappings, abduction reports sound like rewrites of older supernatural encounter traditions with aliens serving the functional roles of divine beings or nature spirits.”

Folklorists have identified multiple themes in abduction narratives that have been present in human storytelling and individual experiences for centuries. Aside from obviously being an encounter with some non-human beings (e.g. fairies, spirits, elves, djinn, or goblins), abductees are often taken to some otherworldly place (e.g. the fairyland, the realm of the dead, and so on). 

The person may experience lost time, which is also a phenomenon present in many folklore traditions when someone stumbles back into the real world several days later, believing they had only been gone a few hours. In many instances, the entities are ambiguous creatures, sometimes cold and distant, while other times providing wisdom or a warning. In many cases, these encounters serve as personal ordeals, causing some sort of transformation for the abductee (such as offering spiritual enlightenment or literally allowing them to develop psychic powers). 

These are just a few examples of crossovers between folk traditions and modern abduction stories. To be sure, the literature on this topic is rich. But why have these themes persisted? Some might argue that this is evidence that something really has been going on for centuries, and this continuity proves it. However, given the paucity of evidence outside of personal testaments, plus the malleability of such claims, this seems doubtful. Instead, it is likely that such narratives speak to a deeper part of human consciousness and experience, especially in today's secular society. 

“They are very exciting. They're interesting. They open the door to a different world with different laws of physics and stuff like that,” Bartholomew told IFLScience. In addition, he added, they offer people a chance to be part of something bigger.

“All you have to do to be part of one of the greatest ‘mysteries' in the world is to go outside into your backyard and look up into the sky. Maybe you just saw an extraterrestrial spacecraft. Or maybe you just saw Starlink. But which one is more alluring?”

“I think it's part of the human condition. You know, we want to believe. We want to think that there's something greater than us.”

For Bartholomew, this is one of the secrets to the power of alien abduction and encounter stories. They serve as a kind of folkloric bridge between the secular modern world and old psychological or cultural needs for something more. They re-enchant the world. In fact, ideas about aliens within wider alien-believer communities has reached a point where they have essentially become vehicles for, as Bartholomew explained, “transcendence” in a similar way to some religions. 

For instance, some people believe that aliens built the pyramids and visited Earth millennia ago, helping to kick-start civilization and shaping humanity. Such entities are effectively gods due to their unparalleled technology or their abilities to move between dimensions, and so on. One day, perhaps these aliens will share these secrets with us and so we too will become immortal. 

The same is true for stories about ghosts because, as Bartholomew said, “if ghosts are real, then they offer proof of life after death”. They offer a sliver of hope that there is something beyond our everyday mortal experience. 

At the same time, people who believe in aliens and things like cryptids – Big Foot, the Loch Ness Monster, or chupacabra – are taking part in beliefs that undermine the power of science, the darling of the secular age. To put it another way, if someone local, say a farmer who lives down the road, claims to see Big Foot, even though science says Big Foot is not real, then they have secret knowledge that limits the knowing gaze of science more generally. This opens up the possibility for more things “science” does not know, meaning it ultimately has less power. 

This latter factor represents the point where fringe ideas meet politics, where the former becomes a reason to reject trust in the latter. In this sense, some people arm themselves with these types of beliefs not just because they enrich their world and themselves with something meaningful, but because they also undermine the established order. 

In many ways, the near-contemporaneous Satanic Panic of the 1980s and early 1990s serves the same purpose: it represented an example of mass hysteria that reacted to perceived societal changes related to family structures and shifting values concerning sexuality, feminism, and secular education in America. And, like all good folktales, these stories persist, transforming and adapting with each generation.  

As such, it is probably not worth looking to the sky for evidence of extraterrestrial beings, but rather within our minds, and at, as Bartholomew explained, “what deep-seated psychological needs are being fulfilled? In other words, why do we need our monsters, why do we need our aliens, what need is being fulfilled?”

Ivanka Trump just attended Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's “the wedding of the century,” but according to one psychic, the days in Venice might be more than just a social outing.

Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, were among the 200 elite who travelled to celebrate the luxurious wedding of the Amazon founder. The party was held in a renovated Venice amphitheatre on a privately owned island in Italy and involved such celebrities as Oprah, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Orlando Bloom, as well as all of the Kardashian family.

Ivanka vowed in a salmon-pink strapless gown by Tony Ward Couture, featuring silver floral details, delicate cutouts, and a thigh-high slit. She completed the look with silver strappy heels and minimal jewellery. 

Jared kept it classic with a navy suit and black bowtie.

Psychic Athos Salomé, aka ‘Living Nostradamus', who predicted COVID-19 and Queen Elizabeth II's death, told Daily Mail, “Ivanka is not running away from the past — she's trying to buy it back with a new storyline,” adding that her Venetian weekend is “just the first chapter.”

The Brazilian clairvoyant cited a 70% chance the weekend will lead to one or two major projects for Ivanka, possibly a book, a docuseries, or a fashion venture.

“Premium publishers are looking for behind-the-scenes White House memoirs that don't exalt Trumpism, in line with the electoral climate of 2028, when the public will be hungry for ‘clean' versions of history,” he said.

“By the second half of 2026, she should announce a book with Amazon Publishing.”

Salomé also believes there's a 50% chance of a short-format docu-series on Amazon Prime Video. “The connection with Jeff Bezos isn't just for selfies,” he told Daily Mail.

“It offers direct access to Amazon Prime Video, whose catalogue has an appetite for behind-the-scenes content about public figures.”

Salomé envisions the series as “four episodes on women's philanthropy in emerging markets.” He called it “an easy product to approve” and “excellent for image cleaning.”

Ivanka's former fashion brand, which she shut down in 2018, has only a 25% chance of being revived, according to Salomé.

If she were to give it another go, he suggests it should be a “limited capsule collection with recycled fabrics and a carbon-neutral footprint, co-signed with a luxury maison.”

“It's the kind of project that the Bezos Earth Fund would love to sponsor,” he said.

Former UK minister says platform, which will use AI to draft community notes, is ‘leaving it to bots to edit the news'

A decision by Elon Musk's X social media platform to enlist artificial intelligence chatbots to draft factchecks risks increasing the promotion of “lies and conspiracy theories”, a former UK technology minister has warned.

Damian Collins accused Musk's firm of “leaving it to bots to edit the news” after X announced on Tuesday that it would allow large language models to write community notes to clarify or correct contentious posts, before users approve them for publication. The notes have previously been written by humans.

X said using AI to write factchecking notes – which sit beneath some X posts – “advances the state of the art in improving information quality on the internet”.

Keith Coleman, the vice-president of product at X, said humans would review AI-generated notes and the note would appear only if people with a variety of viewpoints found it useful.

“We designed this pilot to be AI helping humans, with humans deciding,” he said. “We believe this can deliver both high quality and high trust. Additionally we published a paper along with the launch of our pilot, co-authored with professors and researchers from MIT, University of Washington, Harvard and Stanford laying out why this combination of AI and humans is such a promising direction.”

But Collins said the system was already open to abuse and that AI agents working on community notes could allow “the industrial manipulation of what people see and decide to trust” on the platform, which has about 600 million users.

It is the latest pushback against human factcheckers by US tech firms. Last month Google said user-created factchecks, including by professional factchecking organisations, would be deprioritised in its search results. It said such checks were “no longer providing significant additional value for users”. In January, Meta announced it was getting rid of human factcheckers in the US and would adopt its own community notes system on Instagram, Facebook and Threads.

X's research paper outlining its new factchecking system criticised professional factchecking as often slow and limited in scale and said it “lacks trust by large sections of the public”.

AI-created community notes “have the potential to be faster to produce, less effort to generate, and of high quality”, it said. Human and AI-written notes would be submitted into the same pool and X users would vote for which were most useful and should appear on the platform.

AI would draft “a neutral well-evidenced summary”, the research paper said. Trust in community notes “stems not from who drafts the notes, but from the people that evaluate them”, it said.

But Andy Dudfield, the head of AI at the UK factchecking organisation Full Fact, said: “These plans risk increasing the already significant burden on human reviewers to check even more draft notes, opening the door to a worrying and plausible situation in which notes could be drafted, reviewed, and published entirely by AI without the careful consideration that human input provides.”

Samuel Stockwell, a research associate at the Centre for Emerging Technology and Security at the Alan Turing Institute, said: “AI can help factcheckers process the huge volumes of claims flowing daily through social media, but much will depend on the quality of safeguards X puts in place against the risk that these AI ‘note writers' could hallucinate and amplify misinformation in their outputs. AI chatbots often struggle with nuance and context, but are good at confidently providing answers that sound persuasive even when untrue. That could be a dangerous combination if not effectively addressed by the platform.”

Researchers have found that people perceive human-authored community notes as significantly more trustworthy than simple misinformation flags.

An analysis of several hundred misleading posts on X in the run-up to last year's presidential election found that in three-quarters of cases, accurate community notes were not being displayed, indicating they were not being upvoted by users. These misleading posts, including claims that Democrats were importing illegal voters and the 2020 presidential election was stolen, amassed more than 2bn views, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","other"

Police are engaging in ""proactive patrolling"" at the locations of 5G network masts in order to ""provide greater security"" around these sites after a spate of arson attacks mostly in west Belfast. 

A sixth arson attack on 5G towers in three weeks was reported on Monday.

Since June 2023, 16 arson attacks on 5G towers took place in west Belfast, with the most recent attack near the Rathcoole estate, in Newtownabbey, bringing the total to 17. 

Sinn Féin councillor, and lifelong west Belfast resident, Ronan McLaughlin said the attacks are being driven by ""dangerous conspiracy theories online"". 

McLaughlin has been critical of the police's response to the west Belfast incidents.

He said there had been a ""spate of attacks"" in the last three weeks and he had ""not seen one arrest"". 

The PSNI ""need to do much better"", he said.

""You can see the majority of the masts that have been burned have been in the Colin area, I would hope that this is a small minority of individuals.""

The PSNI said local neighbourhood policing teams are ""actively engaging with communities in the area and have increased police visibility around the affected areas"".

It added that detectives were pursuing a number of lines of enquiry and were ""committed to identifying those responsible and bringing them to justice"".

A recent survey carried out by Sinn Féin MP Paul Maskey found that out of 2,602 people who responded, 87% described phone signal in west Belfast as poor or very poor, with only 3% saying it was good or excellent.

Belfast's Deputy Lord Mayor Paul Doherty, from the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), said this type of digital infrastructure is ""key to everyday life now"" and is ""impacting thousands of people"". 

He told BBC News NI that the lack of phone signal in west Belfast in particular is having a serious impact on ""elderly and vulnerable people"", who could find themselves having a fall or becoming seriously ill but are ""not able to pick up the phone to emergency services"".

""The fact that there is CCTV cameras, dashcam footage, Translink cameras up and down these stretches of road and we have seen no evidence and no arrests, people are very much frustrated as a result.""

A director at the trade body for the UK's mobile network operators has warned of the economic impact of the attacks as, alongside the cost of repairing and replacing the masts, local businesses may be impacted by the loss of signal.

Gareth Elliott, the director of policy and communication at Mobile UK, told BBC's News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme that the future development of these areas could also be affected as the damage and lack of signal ""deters investment, exacerbates digital exclusion and hinders economic growth"".

5G masts or network towers carry signal for internet phone network connectivity. 

While the direct motive of the recent spate of attacks has not been identified by police, both McLaughlin and Doherty cite the spreading of ""dangerous misinformation"" and ""conspiracy theories"" online. 

Cornerstone, the firm responsible for maintaining the physical masts which provide signal for network providers, previously told BBC News NI it was aware that some people have concerns about mobile phone base stations.

""The strong consensus of expert groups and public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, is that no health risks have been established from exposure to the low-level radio signals used by these base stations,"" Cornerstone said.

Speaking to the Nolan Show on Tuesday, Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said ""there is absolutely no evidence from any properly controlled study that the use of any mobile phone technology of any sort is a risk"".

""5G masts emit a low dose of radiation"" but ""simply isn't powerful enough to cause any problems"", he added.

PSNI Det Insp McAnee said the police were taking the issue in West Belfast very seriously.

The PSNI said it was important that the companies who own and operate the masts take ""active steps to secure their infrastructure and commercial assets"".

""Hospitals that are affected are experiencing communication difficulties in contacting patients and managing critical on-call arrangements, and members of the public—particularly those who are vulnerable—are being left in a position where they are unable to make emergency calls or contact family.""

They are appealing to members of the public to help by coming forward with any information they may have.

A judge says Daryl Patton from Newtownabbey had been operating on a 'commercial scale'.

Zak Hughes, 28, from Ardglen Place in north Belfast, is also charged with child destruction.

12 hours ago

Trump's Second Term:

The Trumps have used their name and connections to profit from digital assets at a quicker clip than from their traditional real estate business.

On the surface, Donald Trump's personal net worth looks remarkably unchanged since retaking the White House: $6.5 billion on Election Day, $6.4 billion now.

But digging deeper into the figures reveals an unprecedented and unmistakable shift in how he and his family are buttressing their empire — and how much more quickly they stand to potentially profit from their fame, influence and power.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The US is suspending its supply of weapons to Ukraine as part of its “America first” policy, Washington's envoy to NATO Matthew Whitaker has told Fox Business. America needs to make sure it has enough air defense systems in its own arsenal before anything else, he stated.

Several Western news media outlets, including Politico and NBC News, reported this week that the Pentagon had halted shipments of several categories of US-made weapons to Kiev.

The list reportedly included dozens of Patriot missile interceptors, Stinger and AIM air-to-air missiles, hundreds of Hellfire and GMLRS systems, as well as thousands of 155mm artillery shells.

The decision allegedly followed an internal review of American weapons reserves ordered by US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. 

“This is what ‘America first' looks like. We first have to take care about the United States' needs,” Whitaker told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo on Wednesday. The Pentagon needs to “make sure that the US has the strategic defense capabilities necessary to project power,” he said, adding that this is what Washington and its NATO allies want.

“We have to make sure that we have enough Patriot missiles and we have enough air defense and all the things that we need to ensure our own success on the battlefield,” the envoy stated.

The weapons in question had been funded under the administration of former US President Joe Biden administration through two mechanisms: direct drawdowns from existing US military stockpiles and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), which contracts new production from defense contractors. The Trump administration has not requested any additional aid for Kiev.

US President Donald Trump had previously questioned the rationale behind endless aid to Ukraine. He also made no specific promises to Kiev at a meeting with Vladimir Zelensky on the sidelines of the NATO summit in The Hague last week.

Hegseth said last month that the White House is reducing military funding for Kiev as part of its “America First” strategy, in the hopes of achieving a diplomatic settlement. Kiev has repeatedly voiced frustration over what it sees as dwindling support from Washington.

Program mirrors earlier successful mission to fight new world screwworm fly, whose larvae can infest living tissue

The US government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.

That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the US from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.

“It's an exceptionally good technology,” said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. “It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.”

The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the new world screwworm fly. The US Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies – sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and, over time, the fly population dies out.

It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the US and other countries north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.

The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.

Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the new world screwworm fly and its old world counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers – and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.

“A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,” said Michael Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.

Veterinarians have effective treatments for animals suffering from an infestation, but it can still be unpleasant – and also cripple an animal with pain.

Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infested cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.

“It smelled nasty,” he said. “Like rotting meat.”

The new world screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive midwestern or great plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the US and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.

The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.

One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: females mate only once in their weeks-long adult lives.

Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the US temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.

But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.

Decades ago, the US had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.

The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million flies a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5m on the Texas site and $21m to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.

In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.

But, she added, “You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.”

Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.

In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and on to the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing resembling a dark brown Tic Tac candy. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.

Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's extension service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.

Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.

In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a “whiz packer”.

The method is still much the same: light planes drop crates containing flies.

Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's “crowning achievements”.

Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.

“Something we think we have complete control over – and we have declared a triumph and victory over – can always rear its ugly head again,” Burgess said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

“News media owners are much better off standing strong than acquiescing,” said Reporters Without Borders USA.

The parent company of CBS News, Paramount Global, announced Tuesday that it has agreed to pay U.S. President Donald Trump $16 million to settle what legal experts called an entirely meritless lawsuit over the media organization's handling of a pre-election “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris.

Under the reported terms of the settlement, the money will go toward Trump's legal fees and his future presidential library. Paramount said the settlement deal does not include a formal apology, but the company agreed to release written transcripts of future “60 Minutes” interviews with presidential candidates.

Critics responded with outrage to news of the settlement, which one observer characterized as “spineless capitulation to extortion.” Some posted screenshots to social media showing they canceled their Paramount+ subscriptions in response.

As Paramount engaged in talks with Trump's legal team over the lawsuit in recent weeks, press freedom advocates and members of Congress implored the organization not to settle, warning that caving to the president would reward and embolden his attacks on media outlets he views as his political enemies.

“If you settle cases, you're going to send a message to your news team to not push the envelope for fear of people being sued,” media attorney Edward Klaris told The Washington Post, “and you're going to court more cases against your company because they might think that if they sue you they're going to collect.”

Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, supported a settlement with Trump in the hope that it would “clear the way” for federal approval of the company's merger with the entertainment company Skydance, according to The Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the internal discussions. Bloomberg reported that Redstone could reap $180 million in “severance and other benefits on top of hundreds of millions from the sale of her stock” if the merger goes through.

In May, the Freedom of the Press Foundation — a Paramount shareholder — cautioned that a settlement with Trump “could amount to a bribe” to the Trump administration in exchange for approval of the merger. The advocacy group said it would sue Paramount if the company caved to the president, arguing that “a settlement of Trump's meritless lawsuit may well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system.”

Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) similarly warned Paramount that a settlement with Trump could run afoul of federal anti-bribery laws.

“Paramount appears to be attempting to appease the administration in order to secure merger approval,” the senators wrote in a May 19 letter to Redstone.

Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders USA, said in a statement Wednesday that the settlement was “a shameful decision by Paramount.”

“Shari Redstone and Paramount's board should have stood by CBS journalists and the integrity of press freedom,” said Weimers. “Instead, they chose to reward Donald Trump for his petty legal assault against both. A line is being drawn between the owners of American news media who are willing to stand up for press freedom and those who capitulate to the demands of the president.”

“Paramount's leaders chose to be on the wrong side of that dividing line, but they'd be mistaken to believe appeasing Trump today will stop his attacks in the future,” Weimers added. “News media owners are much better off standing strong than acquiescing.”

Follow:


            Dozens of House Republicans are — for now — standing in the way of delivering President Donald Trump the first major legislative victory of his second term.
    


            For weeks, Trump and his team have promised Hill Republican leaders that he would deliver the headstrong GOP hardliners who are still vowing to defy the president on his agenda, according to three people familiar with the discussions.
    


            Now, it's all coming down to the wire. Trump and his team have spent much of the day in talks with the GOP holdouts on the bill, including summoning groups of Republicans for meetings at the White House to air their grievances with the Senate-passed version of the package. And Trump's key ally Speaker Mike Johnson is again facing a test of his powers in the narrowly divided House, as he seeks to steer his fractious conference to swallow a vote that many of them dislike.

            In a meeting with centrist-leaning Republicans, Trump's tone was “cordial,” one GOP member in the room said. The White House brought in Dr. Mehmet Oz – who leads the agency in charge of Medicaid – to help educate members on related provisions in the Senate GOP bill, such as provider taxes and a bolstered fund for rural hospitals, and the potential impacts to hospitals in their districts, according to another person familiar with the discussions. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were both in attendance, helping to convince members to back the bill, those two people said.
    


            “Those meetings are having a big impact, members are moving to yes,” Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told reporters after returning from the White House meeting with Oz, Trump and Vance.
    


            House Majority Whip Steve Scalise nodded to the importance of Trump's involvement in the discussions earlier Wednesday, telling reporters at the US Capitol, “The president from day one has been our best closer, and he's going to continue to be through today.”
    


            Both Johnson and Trump have been adamant that the bill land on Trump's desk in time for him to sign it on the Fourth of July, leaving almost no time for more talks. They also have almost no room for error: House Republicans can only afford to lose three votes if they have full attendance. So far, Republicans are still missing multiple members as lawmakers race to Washington after multiple storm-related flight delays.
    


            It all amounts to a pivotal week that could define Trump' second term: So far, the push to pass his agenda in Congress has been marred by weeks of tense GOP infighting that has even some Republicans worried about how the bill could play in the 2026 midterms.
    


            Yet if it passes next out of the House, Trump and his Hill allies believe it will help cement his legacy on issues like border security and tax policy – including fulfilling his campaign promises of no taxes on tips or overtime pay – while attempting to rein in federal spending by instituting work requirements for able-bodied adults for Medicaid and SNAP.
    


            Meetings were ongoing at the White House as of midday Wednesday, but key conservatives were still insisting they want to change the Senate bill — a promise that Trump and Johnson aren't willing to make.
    


            “It's not ‘take it or leave it.' I don't need take it or leave it legislating. How about we send it back to him. We say, ‘Take it or leave it,' all right? So the Senate doesn't get to be the final say on everything,” Texas Republican Rep. Chip Roy, one of the most vocal critics of Trump's bill, said before he left for the White House on Wednesday. “We need more spending restraint.”

Here's how Trump's megabill will affect you



            Roy is a leading member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which outlined their opposition to the Senate's version of Trump's domestic policy bill in a new memo obtained by CNN.
    


            The right-wing group of Republicans pointed to more than a dozen problems they have with the current bill, including what they described as watered-down energy tax credit measures, an increase to the deficit and various Medicaid provisions that differ from the House-passed version of the bill.
    


            And in another troubling sign for the White House, the Freedom Caucus' chairman, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, told reporters he declined to attend the meeting with Trump. “I'm still voting no on the rule. We have to get this thing right,” Harris said.
    


            Another possible “no” vote, Rep. Keith Self of Texas, said he was not invited to the White House.
    


            The Senate's Tuesday passage of the bill had been a hard-fought victory for Trump, who spent days wrangling fellow Republicans behind the multi-trillion-dollar bill, which includes tax cuts and funding boosts for the Pentagon and border security. It also includes more contentious spending cuts to pay for the rest of the bill, including the biggest downsizing of the federal safety net in decades.
    


            Across the Capitol, House GOP leaders are confident the latest version can pass the House, according to multiple sources. But it will likely take significant political muscle, as Johnson grapples with his own high-stakes battle between centrists and right-wing hardliners.
    


            The legislative brawl inside the US Capitol has also included some dramatic moments – including over the weekend when a key Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis, stunned Washington by announcing he would not seek reelection after defying Trump and voting to block his bill on the floor. (Within a day of Trump threatening to primary him, Tillis exited the race altogether.)
    


            Those high-stakes moments will likely continue on Capitol Hill. Before the bill can come to a final passage vote in the House, the chamber must first take a key procedural vote known as a vote on the rule – and some conservative are threatening to rebel against it, creating a new headache for the speaker. (That vote was already delayed by several hours Wednesday.)
    


            The bill did clear one early hurdle in the House: The House Rules Committee voted to advance the rule on Trump's agenda bill in the early hours of Wednesday morning after the panel met for almost 12 hours. GOP Reps. Ralph Norman and Chip Roy, two conservatives who have harshly criticized the Senate's version of the package, joined Democrats on the panel to oppose advancing the rule.
    


            Some Republicans, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, still insist July 4 was an “arbitrary” deadline.
    


            Massie, who has consistently voted against the bill over his deficit concerns and has faced the ire of Trump, said he intends to stand firm against the bill.
    


            Asked if there was anything at all leadership could do to win his vote, he said, “We could go back to the drawing board.” Asked about the self-imposed deadline, he added: “There's no reason to bankrupt the country because you want to go shoot off some fireworks.”

The June NATO summit, held in The Hague, ended with a significant headline: a collective pledge to increase annual defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035. This bold target, far exceeding the current 2% benchmark, signals a new era of militarization in the West, reflecting anxieties about a rapidly changing world order. While China was notably absent from the summit's final declaration, the specter of the Asian giant loomed large over the event. The omission appears tactical rather than strategic – a thinly veiled attempt to avoid escalating tensions, even as NATO members ramp up rhetoric and military preparations clearly aimed at containing Beijing.

Though the summit declaration remained silent on China, the alliance's leadership left little doubt about their true concerns. NATO's secretary general, Mark Rutte, used the summit sidelines to sound alarm bells over China's “massive military build-up”. Echoing the now-familiar Western narrative, Rutte linked China – alongside Iran and North Korea – to Russia's military operations in Ukraine, accusing Beijing of supporting Moscow's war efforts.

These remarks followed Rutte's June address at London's Chatham House, where he described China's military expansion as happening “at breakneck speed” and labeled Beijing, Tehran, Pyongyang, and Moscow as an “awful foursome.” This framing makes clear that the NATO establishment and US leadership regard China not as a partner or even a rival, but a threat.

The perception of China as an imminent danger was also echoed at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in May, where US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned of a potential Chinese military move against Taiwan and reiterated Washington's commitment to regional allies – albeit while pressing them to increase their own defense budgets. His remarks left no doubt: the US strategic focus is firmly on the Indo-Pacific, even at the expense of its traditional European commitments.

In a notable diplomatic snub, the leaders of Australia, Japan, and South Korea – the so-called “Indo-Pacific partners” of NATO – cancelled their plans to attend the summit in The Hague. This decision, viewed by observers as a pointed message, undermined NATO's aspiration to consolidate its influence in the region.

Since the 2022 Madrid summit, when NATO adopted its “Strategic Compass” and for the first time classified China as a “systemic challenge,” the alliance has moved steadily to incorporate the Asia-Pacific into its strategic thinking. It now considers developments in East Asia as directly relevant to Euro-Atlantic security. As such, NATO seeks deeper cooperation with Australia, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand to uphold what it calls the “rules-based order” – a euphemism for Western hegemony.

However, the absence of these Indo-Pacific leaders suggests a growing discomfort with NATO's expanding footprint. For many regional actors, NATO's presence in Asia represents not stability, but the risk of being drawn into geopolitical conflicts under the guise of shared security.

Further adding to regional unease, French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a controversial message at the Shangri-La Dialogue, warning Beijing that NATO could be involved in Southeast Asia unless China convinces North Korea to withdraw its troops from Russia. This statement not only mischaracterized Beijing's independent foreign policy and its complex relations with Pyongyang but also marked a sharp departure from France's previous resistance to NATO's involvement in Asia-Pacific matters. Such remarks, however, are increasingly aligned with the alliance's real trajectory: NATO is no longer content with transatlantic defense. Its strategic horizon is now global, and its compass points East.

NATO-China relations, once limited and mostly symbolic, are now strained to the point of near-hostility. The first Chinese representative visited NATO headquarters in 2002, and both sides cooperated on anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden after 2008. Since then, however, the relationship has eroded amid intensifying geopolitical competition and diverging security philosophies.

Beijing has become increasingly vocal in its criticism. Chinese authorities responded sharply to Rutte's remarks at The Hague, accusing NATO of spreading disinformation about China's stance on Ukraine and conflating the Taiwan question – which Beijing insists is a purely domestic matter – with a war between states. Chinese officials emphasized that NATO's role in the Asia-Pacific is unwelcome and destabilizing, viewing the alliance as a Cold War relic now repurposed to uphold US dominance and contain China's rise.

For China, NATO is not just a military alliance, but a political tool used by Washington to limit Europe's engagement with Beijing. From this perspective, NATO's eastward ambitions threaten to derail the potential for constructive China-Europe cooperation, replacing it with division and distrust. China's concerns are not limited to NATO. The revival of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), the emergence of the “Squad,” and the 2021 formation of AUKUS – a trilateral pact between the US, UK, and Australia – have only deepened Beijing's fears of encirclement.

The AUKUS agreement, under which Australia is to receive nuclear-powered submarines from the US worth $240 billion, has introduced a new and dangerous element into regional security dynamics. Canberra will gain long-range strike capability for the first time and become only the second nation – after the UK – to receive access to US nuclear propulsion technology. Though the Trump administration has initiated a formal review of AUKUS, few expect significant changes. On the contrary, the pact is likely to reinforce the militarization of the region and increase the risk of nuclear proliferation.

In contrast to NATO's bloc-based approach, China promotes a regional security framework rooted in multilateralism, inclusiveness, and dialogue. Beijing advocates for an ASEAN-centered architecture and supports institutions like the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus (ADMM-Plus), the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), and the East Asia Summit. It also backs the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA) and has launched the Global Security Initiative to advance regional stability. Most significantly, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has emerged as a key platform for Eurasian states to coordinate on security, with the June meeting of defense ministers in Qingdao underscoring its role in promoting collective peace without resorting to confrontation or hegemonism.

The NATO summit may have avoided naming China, but it failed to conceal the reality of growing confrontation. While the alliance doubles down on military spending and expands its strategic reach into Asia, the Global South and a number of key Asia-Pacific states appear increasingly wary of NATO's global ambitions.

As the world stands at a strategic crossroads, two competing visions of international security are on display. On one side, NATO and its partners advocate a “rules-based order” backed by military alliances and deterrence. On the other, China offers a model grounded in multipolarity, multilateral cooperation, consensus-building, and mutual respect.

The choice, increasingly, is not between East vs. West – but between confrontation and coexistence.

Germany will send navy ships to patrol Arctic waters in response to Russia's growing military presence in the region, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced on Monday. Russia has insisted that it is mirroring NATO moves in the far north to maintain balance.

Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized that Moscow is  implementing an appropriate response strategy to potential encroachments on the country's sovereignty across Russia's 24,000km Arctic coastline.

At a joint press conference in Copenhangen with his Danish counterpart, Troels Lund Poulsen, Pistorius delcared “as early as this year, Germany will show its presence in the North Atlantic and the Arctic.”

The deployment, dubbed ‘Atlantic Bear', will be a response to mounting maritime threats and because “Russia is militarizing the Arctic,” he claimed.

A support ships would “go from Iceland to Greenland and then on to Canada” to take part in joint military drills with NATO allies, including Denmark, Norway, and Canada, Pistorius claimed.

“In addition, we will deploy our maritime patrol aircraft, submarines, and frigates to demonstrate our commitment to that region,” he added.

NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said in April that members of the US-led military bloc are “working together” in the Arctic to “defend this part of NATO territory.”

The Kremlin has insisted that NATO's continuing militarization of the region is unwarranted, and that Russia will mirror the moves taken by the bloc.

In March, Putin reiterated that Moscow is “concerned by the fact that NATO countries as a whole are more frequently designating the far north as a bridgehead for possible conflicts.”

“I would like to emphasize that Russia has never threatened anyone in the Arctic,” the Russian president said. He stressed, however, that Moscow would “reliably protect” its interests in the region by reinforcing its military contingent in response to Western actions.

Zhi Alan Cheng, 35, admits to filming assaults of patients and acquaintances in his apartment and workplace

A New York City doctor charged with raping or otherwise sexually abusing several hospital patients and acquaintances has pleaded guilty.

Zhi Alan Cheng, a gastroenterologist, acknowledged filming assaults in his apartment and the hospital where he had previously worked, New York-Presbyterian Queens, state prosecutors said in a statement on Monday after his guilty plea.

He is expected to receive a 24-year prison sentence from Queens supreme court justice Ushir Pandit Durant at a hearing tentatively set for 28 August.

“The level of violence and perversion displayed by Zhi Alan Cheng in sexually abusing multiple victims is compounded by the fact that he took an oath to do no harm as a medical professional,” said a statement attributed to local district attorney Melinda Katz.

The guilty plea resulted from one of several prosecutions of prominent physicians in New York and other parts of the US on allegations they violated patients in medical settings.

As prosecutors put it, authorities arrested Cheng on 27 December 2022 on allegations that he had raped a woman whom he knew at his apartment. That woman discovered videos depicting her and other women being assaulted by Cheng, and an attorney of the survivor approached Queens prosecutors with that information.

An ensuing investigation led to the seizure of numerous devices containing videos of Cheng sexually abusing unconscious women who were his patients or over at his apartment. Investigators also seized recreational drugs – fentanyl, ketamine, cocaine, LSD and MDMA – as well as powerful medical sedatives, including propofol and sevoflurane.

In August 2023, prosecutors obtained a 50-count criminal indictment charging Cheng, who had been held without bail since his arrest.

He faced additional charges in an indictment handed up against him in March 2024 after another hospital-related victim came forward.

Ultimately, Cheng, 35, pleaded guilty to four counts of rape and three counts of sexual abuse, all in the first degree. He also entered what is known as an Alford plea to one count of sexual abuse, which means he maintained his innocence on that charge but conceded overwhelming evidence against him would probably get him convicted at a trial.

Four of the survivors involved in the case against Cheng were described as hospital victims, prosecutors said. The rest, prosecutors said, were described as apartment victims.

“I thank the brave victim who initially came forward and exposed this abuse,” Katz remarked in her statement. “We hope the guilty plea allows all the victims to continue to heal.”

Authorities have said that the hospital which had employed Cheng cooperated in the case against the disgraced doctor.

“As caregivers, we are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of our patients. It is a sacred trust. The crimes committed by this individual are heinous, despicable, and a fundamental betrayal of our mission and the patients' trust. We are deeply sorry for all that the victims and their families have endured,” New York-Presbyterian hospital spokesperson Angela Karafazli said in a statement.

News of the charges against Cheng came about two weeks after former Manhattan obstetrician-gynecologist Robert Hadden had been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment for sexually abusing numerous patients.

Back then, Cheng's attorney, Jeffrey Lichtman, said he recognized “how serious the charges” against his client were.

Lichtman on Monday thanked prosecutors for his client's plea agreement and said: “The charges to which Mr Cheng has pleaded guilty today are extraordinarily serious.”

Marwan al-Sultan, a renowned cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital, is the 70th healthcare worker to be killed by Israeli attacks in the past 50 days, says Palestinian medical organisation

An Israeli airstrike has killed one of Gaza's most senior doctors in a “catastrophic” loss to the already decimated healthcare system. A number of family members were reported to have been killed alongside him.

Dr Marwan al-Sultan, a renowned and highly experienced cardiologist and director of the Indonesian hospital in the Gaza Strip, is the 70th healthcare worker to be killed by Israeli attacks in the last 50 days, according to Healthcare Workers Watch (HWW), a Palestinian medical organisation.

“The killing of Dr Marwan al-Sultan by the Israeli military is a catastrophic loss to Gaza and the entire medical community, and will have a devastating impact on Gaza's healthcare system,” said Muath Alser, director of HWW.

“This is part of a much longer and systematic atrocious targeting of healthcare workers sanctioned by impunity. This is a tragic loss of life, but also an obliteration of their decades of lifesaving medical expertise and care at a time when the situation facing Palestinian civilians is unfathomably catastrophic,” Alser added.

“We are in great shock and grief. He cannot be replaced,” said Dr Mohammed Abu Selmia, director of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. “He was a prominent scholar and one of the two remaining cardiologists left in Gaza. Thousands of heart patients will suffer as a result of his killing. His only fault was that he was a doctor. We have no option but to be steadfast, but the sense of loss is devastating.”

Earlier this month, al-Sultan spoke to the Guardian about the critical situation he and other staff at the Indonesian hospital were facing as they struggled to cope with the number of civilian casualties after the escalation of Israeli attacks in May.

Among the healthcare workers killed in the past 50 days were three other doctors, the chief nurses of the Indonesian hospital and al-Nasser children's hospital, one of Gaza's most senior midwives, a senior radiology technician and dozens of young medical graduates and trainee nurses. On 6 June, the first day of Eid, nine healthcare workers were killed in one day in airstrikes in the north of Gaza, where they were sheltering with their families, according to HWW.

Fares Afana, who leads ambulance services in northern Gaza, lost his son in June. Bara'a, who was also working as a paramedic, was at an apartment block in Gaza City's al-Tuffah neighbourhood on 9 June treating people injured in an Israeli airstrike when the building was hit for a second time by Israeli artillery, killing everyone inside.

“They were directly targeted,” said Afana, who says that Bara'a died alongside two other paramedics. “When I went to the place, it was a horrible sight and cruel to see their bodies torn to pieces. If there had been some reaction from the world when healthcare workers were first targeted by the Israeli forces, they would have not dared to commit more of these attacks.”

He said his son had dedicated his life to the medical profession and had dreams of being a doctor. “He was kind and loved by everyone who knew him.”

The total number of healthcare workers who have lost their lives in military attacks since the war began in October 2023 now exceeds 1,400 according to UN figures.

Insecurity Insight, a conflict data NGO, says it has verified the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers who have been killed inside health facilities, while attempting to reach wounded civilians, by Israeli sniper fire, when travelling in ambulances, while evacuating patients, at checkpoints and inside schools and refugee camps used as temporary shelters since October 2023.

It is believed that hundreds more healthcare workers from Gaza remain in Israeli detention, where they have reported being tortured, beaten and held without charge.

Medglobal, a medical NGO based in the US that provides medical services and care in Gaza, says it believes more than 300 medical staff are in Israeli prisons, among them senior physicians including Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan hospital who has been held in detention since December 2024.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Iranian Foreign Ministry has summoned the Ukrainian charge d'affaires to protest ""inappropriate remarks"" by Kyiv regarding recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran, the ministry said on July 1.

Tehran threatened Ukraine with unspecified ""consequences"" should such statements be repeated.

The diplomatic spat follows a wave of Israeli and U.S. air strikes targeting Iran's nuclear program, with Iranian forces attacking Israel and a U.S. base in Qatar in response.

Highlighting Iran's military support for Russian aggression against Ukraine, Kyiv responded by calling for the dismantling of the Iranian nuclear program to prevent it from threatening the Middle East or the wider world.

In response, Shahram Farsaei, head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Eurasian affairs department, relayed a protest note to Ukraine via the Ukrainian envoy in Iran, Kyrylo Pozdniakov. The ministry did not specify what exact comments prompted the reaction from the Iranian side.

Tehran also said that Ukrainian officials have ""disregarded Ukraine's international legal obligations concerning respect for the principles and purposes of the U.N. Charter as well as the four Geneva Conventions.""

Iran has provided ballistic missiles and thousands of Shahed drones to Russia, directly backing its armed aggression in Ukraine, itself launched in violation of international law and the U.N. Charter.

Moscow has backed Iran diplomatically after U.S. and Israeli attacks, urging a response from the U.N. Security Council and calling the attacks an ""unprovoked aggression.""","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) released on July 1 video footage showing domestically produced drones striking multiple Russian air defense assets and a fighter jet in occupied Crimea in what it described as a successful special operation.

The undated footage shows the combat use of UJ-26 drones, commonly known as Bober (Beavers), targeting high-value Russian military systems.

""These reliable weapons in the hands of HUR special forces are turning critically important Russian targets into useless scrap,"" the agency said in a statement. 

HUR added that the Bober drones are effectively ""gnawing through"" Russia's expensive air defense systems ""like barberries.""

The released footage shows that the strikes destroyed or severely damaged several Russian military assets, including a Pantsir-S1 air defense system and its crew, a Niobium-SV radar, a Pechora-3 coastal radar, a Protivnik-GE radar, and a Su-30 fighter jet stationed at the Saky airfield in occupied Crimea. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify HUR's claims.

The strikes are part of Ukraine's ongoing efforts to degrade Russian military capabilities in Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Moscow reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the peninsula earlier on July 1, with the Crimean Wind Telegram channel reporting attacks in the vicinity of S-300/S-400 air defense systems.

Ukraine has increasingly deployed new drone systems to target Russian military assets on the front line and deep inside the Russian rear.

Lisa Lambert is the chief executive officer of Quantum Industry Canada.

The world is shifting beneath our feet. A new economic race is under way – beyond just jobs or growth. It's a race for the advanced technologies that will shape Canada's prosperity, resilience and security for decades to come. 

Quantum technologies harness the strange behaviour of nature at its smallest scales, unlocking a powerful new platform poised to transform industries and national security. Quantum computers, for example, use entirely different rules than today's machines, allowing them to solve certain problems – such as simulating molecules and optimizing complex systems – that are beyond the reach of even the most powerful conventional computers. Quantum has now become a defining front in that new economic race.

Canada's quantum sector is already making global waves. Across the country, researchers and companies are solving problems once thought to be decades away. A striking example: three Canadian firms – Xanadu Quantum Technologies Inc., Nord Quantique and Photonic – have each recently made world-first breakthroughs in quantum error correction, one of the hardest challenges to scaling quantum computing systems. Their work is drawing international attention: All three were selected by DARPA – the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), which was behind the internet and the Global Positioning System – for its elite Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. 

These breakthroughs represent just one part of Canada's broader quantum strengths. We're not just experimenting – we're building the frontier systems the world is racing to deploy.

Quantum technologies are no longer a lab curiosity. They're real, they're moving fast and they're becoming infrastructure – reshaping how we communicate, compute, sense and secure critical systems. Canada has what it takes to lead – but only if we act with urgency and intent.

BTQ Technologies CEO buys as Carney puts quantum computing in the G7 spotlight

Canadian quantum company Xanadu Technologies opens packaging facility

Prime Minister Mark Carney has set a clear ambition: to build the strongest economy in the Group of Seven countries. That won't happen with incrementalism. In June, he declared quantum a core focus of Canada's G7 agenda. Also last month, he announced accelerated defence investments, including Ottawa's new Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Innovation and Science for frontier technologies such as quantum, cyber and artificial intelligence. Inspired by the successes of DARPA, BOREALIS sends a clear message: Quantum is integral to Canada's economic and strategic future.

Canada was ahead of the curve. We were one of the first countries to recognize the quantum opportunity, making early strategic investments that positioned us as a global leader. Canada made the right foundational bets: funding research, growing a base of talent and building an emerging quantum industry that delivers a global impact that exceeds our scale. Today, we're known for it: Per capita, we have more quantum small- and medium-sized enterprises than any other country. 

But our early lead is under pressure. Canada's National Quantum Strategy, launched in 2021, is no longer globally competitive. Other countries are scaling fast, backed by strategic investment and national urgency. If we don't move now, we'll be locked out of systems, supply chains and decision-making tables being built without us – shutting us out of the very systems we helped make possible.

We've seen this pattern before. Canada led groundbreaking AI research, built aerospace clusters from scratch and developed world-class telecom networks. But too often we've stopped short of translating scientific leadership into lasting economic and strategic advantage. We have been strong in discovery, but slow on scale.

If we want to lead in quantum – and secure the greatest strategic advantage for Canada – we can't just innovate. We have to industrialize.

Commercialization brings technologies to market. Industrialization builds capacity: fabrication, integration, secure supply chains and deployment at scale. It's how we ensure that high-paying jobs, national prosperity and strategic control stay in Canada. Without it, we may be forced to rely on others for the very systems that underpin our economy and security.

Quantum is not niche; it's a nation-building project. And it requires more than research grants and trickles of startup capital. We need co-ordinated public-private investment, agile procurement and bold, milestone-based support that accelerates scale and sends a clear signal to global markets. Public investment won't replace private capital – it will crowd it in.

We also need those investments to protect what we've built. Some of our most strategic companies are being eyed by foreign investors. Others are looking south for faster scale. 

The opportunity is enormous. McKinsey & Co. estimates that quantum technologies could unlock upward of US$2-trillion by 2035. Canada's National Research Council projects it could contribute more than 3 per cent of our gross domestic product by 2045, rivalling aerospace in scale and strategic importance.

Quantum is not next; it's now. And every delay increases the chance we'll be left behind – for good.

As Prime Minister Carney has said, Canada must build bold, build big and build now. Industrializing quantum is exactly that kind of project. It will deliver economic resilience, national security and long-term strategic relevance for Canada.

We can help shape the future or depend on systems with Canadian roots that were ultimately built and owned by others.

The choice is ours. Let's make the right one.

The Republican-led U.S. Senate approved President Donald Trump's mammoth domestic policy bill Tuesday by the narrowest of margins.DREW ANGERER/AFP/Getty Images

The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act squeaked through the U.S. Senate by a single vote Tuesday – requiring Vice-President JD Vance to break the tie – bringing the central legislation of President Donald Trump's agenda one step closer to meeting his self-imposed July 4 deadline for passage.

The bill would fund mass deportations and tax cuts by taking away health coverage and food stamps from millions of low-income Americans, ending programs to fight climate change, and racking up debt.

The Senate version of the prospective law made some changes compared to the earlier legislation passed by the House of Representatives, which means the two chambers must hash out their differences before sending a final version to the White House.

With all Democrats vehemently opposed and the Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both houses, the next two days are almost certain to see some down-to-the-wire legislative manoeuvring.

Here is what is in the bill.

Deportations, the wall and the military

The bill would pay for the centrepiece of Mr. Trump's political program by allocating nearly US$30-billion to his effort to round up and deport immigrants and US$46.5-billion to continue construction of the wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.

The President is aiming to deport all 11 million people who are in the country without legal status as well as millions more who came legally under immigration programs that he is cancelling.

The White House has ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to step up deportations with the goal of arresting 3,000 people per day. This has led agents to raid farms, restaurants, factories, warehouses and other workplaces.

The bill would also add US$153-billion in military spending, including US$25-billion to start Mr. Trump's promised “Golden Dome” missile defence system, which Canada is negotiating to join.

The spend on taxes

The legislation contains a long list of tax changes. At the centre are measures that would make permanent a series of temporary tax cuts Congress passed during Mr. Trump's first term. These include cuts to corporate tax rates, personal income tax rates, a larger standard deduction and a cut to taxes on pass-through entities such as limited liability companies.

In addition, the bill would add a new tax deduction of up to US$25,000 for tips and US$12,500 for overtime pay until 2028, increase the child tax credit from US$2,000 to $2,200, with later adjustments for inflation, and raise the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes to US$40,000 from US$10,000.

According to modelling by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Mr. Trump's alma mater, 70 per cent of the benefits of the tax cuts would flow to the top 10 per cent of income earners.

Cutting Medicaid, Obamacare and food stamps

To partially offset the cost of the tax cuts, the bill would cut over US$1.3-trillion in spending from the country's social safety net, the largest such reduction in more than a generation.

To save US$930-billion, for instance, it envisions adding additional red tape for people applying for Medicaid, a government program that pays for health care for the poorest Americans.

In theory, the new rules are designed to press people on Medicaid who are not currently working to find a job or go back to school. In practice, they will likely take away health care from a range of low-income Americans who do not comply with the new paperwork requirements.

The bill would also make cuts to Medicare – the program that provides health care to senior citizens and younger people with certain disabilities – and not renew some subsidies for people buying private insurance through the Obamacare system.

According to an estimate by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, these measures combined would take health insurance away from nearly 12 million Americans.

Meanwhile, 4.7 million people would lose access to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP), colloquially known as food stamps, because of a US$285-billion cut, according to the CBO.

Ending climate policy

In a partial rollback of former president Joe Biden's signature climate policies, the legislation ends US$488-billion in tax credits for electric vehicles and subsidies for new wind and solar projects that come online after 2027. On the flip side, it offers a subsidy for some coal production.

What happens now

Even with all of these cuts, the bill would still require a US$3.3-trillion increase in government borrowing and therefore also raises the country's debt ceiling by US$5-trillion.

And this is why, despite its centrality to Mr. Trump's agenda, the legislation remains so contentious within his own party. On one side, moderates are balking at the cuts to social spending. On the other, deficit hawks argue the plan is far too expensive.

Republican North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis voted against the bill over its Medicaid cuts, as did moderate Mainer Susan Collins. Libertarian Kentuckian Rand Paul opposed it for raising the debt ceiling.

Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, the final, key vote for the bill, came around after party leaders added money to a rural hospital fund and softened the SNAP cuts for her state.

Now, a joint legislative committee will try to merge the Senate and House versions of the bill in a way that the slim majorities in both houses can live with.

The Senate, for instance, rewrote a Medicaid tax provision in a way that could put more of the burden of paying for the program onto state governments, something House moderates are likely to be unhappy with. The upper chamber also passed a higher debt-ceiling increase, however, risking the support of the few remaining fiscal conservatives in Congress.

Still, Mr. Trump holds an iron grip over his party. He is certain to be squeezing as hard as possible to fulfill his goal of signing the bill by Independence Day on Friday.

Record-setting temperatures have forced school closures across Europe, with Spain and Portugal bearing the brunt of the heat wave. At least four people have died amid the extreme weather.

Here are the top headlines regarding the heat wave in Europe on Wednesday, July 2:

The town of Andernach in western Germany has recorded 39.3 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Farenheit), marking the highest temperature so far this year, according to preliminary data from the German Weather Service (DWD).

Tangerhütte-Demker in Saxony-Anhalt logged the second-highest reading at 39.2 C, while Kitzingen in Bavaria followed with 39.1 degrees.

These figures fell short of Germany's all-time heat record of 41.2 C, set on July 25, 2019 at DWD stations in Tönisvorst and Duisburg-Baerl in North Rhine-Westphalia.

Final readings for some locations on Wednesday are still to come.

Meteorologists have forecast thunderstorms for later in the day that were expected to bring relief and drop temperatures.

The weather service warned of a ""localized risk"" of severe weather as storms move across parts of the country.

The weather service warned of a ""localized risk"" of severe weather as storms move across parts of the country.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) says heatwaves, floods, and wildfires are costing Europe billions of euros every year.

In 2023 alone, climate-related events cost Europe over €45 billion.

According to the EEA analysis, the leading causes of the damage were floods, storms, wind and hail, while heatwaves caused the most deaths.

Germany, Italy, France, and Spain saw the highest monetary losses.

The environmental agency says little of this damage was insured.

Coldiretti, Italy's main umbrella organization for farmers and agriculture, issued a dire message on Wednesday about the effect the heatwave is having on food production.

In Lombardy, for example, where half of Italy's milk is produced, there has been a 10% drop in production due to the heatwave. 

In Piedmont, Tuscany, and Umbria, where much of the country's fruits and vegetables are produced, farmers are rushing to cover their crops with tarps. Coldiretti reported that hundreds of kilograms of melons have literally been cooked on the vine.

Wheat, barley, grapes, and eggplants have also been heavily affected.

Umbria had already reported major issues for spring crops like sunflowers and corn were already struggling due to the heat.

Coldiretti also warned that the unstable weather was likely to adversely effect Italy's colder, mountainous regions to the north due to landslides.

Thirteen of Italy's 20 regions have halted all outdoor work between 11 am and 4 pm, including Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna, home to much of the country's industry.

The news came after it was confirmed that a 47-year-old construction worker who died in Emilia-Romagna on Monday lost his life due to complications from heatstroke.

Hospitals across Italy have reported 15-20% in emergency admissions in the past week.

Germany's national railway operator Deutsche Bahn (DB) has announced nationwide disruptions due to heat.

Across the country, rail lines that had been due for maintenance could not be repaired due to unsafe conditions for workers.

DB also announced line closures in the country's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia due to the weather.

Many DB-operated bus lines were also down, the company said, due to lack of air conditioning and other risks to equipment due to extreme heat.

Tourists would not be able to visit the viewing deck at the summit of the Eiffel Tower in Paris until Thursday at the earliest, city officials said, saying the decision was for ""everyone's comfort and safety.""

The Ile-de-France region, which includes the capital and its surroundings, said it had received at least 900 calls on the heatwave emergency hotline.

Some 300 people had been treated by local hospitals for heat-related illnesses, officials said.

It appeared that the power grids in several Italian cities were not equipped to handle the increased demand for climate control on Wednesday — leading to black outs in Rome, Florence, Milan, and Bergamo.

Air conditioning in homes is not the norm for Italy, even in the summer, but due to increasing heat waves, more and more people are buying units for their houses and apartments.

In Florence, some people got stuck in elevators and traffic lights stopped working across the city as the power went out.

Some 48 passengers had to be rescued from a train in the town of Elsfleth in northern Germany on Tuesday evening after it became stuck on a rail bridge.

The train was forced to make the unplanned stop due to a technical fault, which also caused the air conditioning to work at limited capacity.

As the carriages became hotter and hotter, the passengers called the local emergency rescue services, who were able to extract them from the bridge.

State police and ambulances rushed to the site to attend to the passengers and crew. Two teenage passengers had to be taken to a local hospital but no one was seriously hurt.

A wildfire that broke out in Spain's Catalonia region due to the extreme heat and dryness has killed at least two people, authorities confirmed on Wednesday.

The blaze began in Torrefeta on Tuesday afternoon, and has destroyed large swaths of farmland.

""The fire was extremely violent and erratic due to storms and strong winds, generating a convection cloud that complicated extinguishing efforts,"" the local fire department said in a statement.

Some 14,000 residents had been warned to stay inside their homes. However, the blaze was largely contained by Wednesday and the area was awaiting thunderstorms that were expected to further extinguish the fire.

Meteorologists in France and Germany have predicted that the continent's deadly heat wave will likely break overnight on Wednesday, as rain and thunderstorms roll in from the Atlantic.

""Our latest forecasts confirm the arrival of cooling from the west on Wednesday, which will quickly affect the northwest of the country,"" Meteo-France said, expecting thunderstorms near the German border.

Germany's national weather service (DWD) said that while the mercury could hit 40 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country on Wednesday, the average was expected to fall to 27 by Thursday.

In Spain and Italy, which have seen the most extreme temperatures at up to 46 degrees Celsius or 114 Fahrenheit, the weather is expected to cool by the weekend.

French scientists have said that June 2025 was the second-hottest for the country since it began keeping records in 1900.

""June 2025 has become the second hottest June since records began in 1900, behind June 2003,"" French Ecology Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said on Wednesday morning.

Later on Wednesday, Pannier-Runacher said that ""more than 300 people have been taken into emergency care, and two have died as a result of heat-related illnesses,"" in the country.

French President Emmanuel Macron has attempted to enact climate protections, such as banning domestic flights, to varying degrees of success. However, some initiatives have resulted in major discontent from voters, including a fuel tax that led to the Yellow Vest protests that lasted from 2018 to 2020.

Teresa Ribera, who heads up the European Commission's green transition team, has accused the bloc's political leaders of being too scared to address climate change as life-threatening temperatures cripple Europe.

Speaking with the British newspaper The Guardian, she said that Wednesday's forecast showed ""absolutely terrible temperatures that have a very serious impact on ecosystems, on the economy and on health. And I think that there hasn't yet been a real shift from the headlines about extreme meteorological phenomena to preparing people and understanding what needs to be done in the case of certain events.""

In light of this, she said she could not understand why many major political parties ""continue to insist, quite vehemently, that climate change does not exist.""

Ribera said she believes that fear of how much it will cost — politically and financially — to address the climate emergency is driving much of the inaction, but warned that allowing climate breakdown will be much more costly in the long run.

National weather services across central and northern Europe have issued warnings over excessive heat in many of the continent's largest cities, according to aggregator MeteoAlarm.

Brussels, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Paris, and Budapest are all expected to see temperatures of at least 35 degrees Celsius, or 95 degrees Fahrenheit.

""Drink water several times a day. Continue to eat normally. Wet your body several times a day using a spray, a washcloth or by taking warm showers or baths,"" read a warning issued by France's meteorological service. ""Do not go out during the hottest hours.""

Europe continues to suffer under a brutal early summer heat wave on Wednesday, with temperatures in southern Spain expected to read 40 degrees Celsius, or 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Further north in Paris, temperatures are expected to drop slightly, but still hover around 35 degrees Celsius. 

Meteorologists predict that rain and thunderstorms overnight should break the heat in many places by Thursday.

Schools remained closed in many cities, including in Italy and France, due to the weather — intensifying debate as to whether the school year needs to be adjusted to reflect the changing climate.

The heat has also affected cultural events and sports, with the Wimbledon tennis tournament in the UK, which continues on Wednesday, recording its highest-ever temperatures.

The German Foreign Ministry said it will not tolerate ""any threat to Jewish life"" in the country. Meanwhile, Germans have been grappling with Europe's first major heat wave this summer.





Berlin has summoned the Iranian ambassador following the arrest of a Danish man suspected of spying on Jews in Germany.

The man was arrested in the Danish city of Aarhus last Thursday.

He is believed to have been tasked by an Iranian intelligence service early this year with gathering information on ""Jewish localities and specific Jewish individuals"" in the German capital Berlin.

Germany's Foreign Ministry stressed it does not tolerate ""any threats to Jewish life"" in the country.

Below, you can read a mix of news, analysis and background of what Germany was talking about on Tuesday, July 1..

Travelers on Germany's rail service, Deutsche Bahn, had to deal with major disruptions to service in the north on Tuesday.

A World War II bomb disposal operation near the central train station in the northwestern city of Osnabrück, located on the main line from Hamburg, resulted in many trains being rerouted. 

Bushfires brought on by a heat wave near Hamburg and in the states of Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt also caused rail service disruptions.

Long-distance InterCity Express (ICE) trains on the Mannheim-Frankfurt-Braunschweig and Berlin routes were delayed by 70 minutes after being diverted.

Express trains between Hanover and Berlin were also being diverted and delayed by about 90 minutes. 

Germany's Federal Police on Tuesday said that since the introduction of more stringent border checks on May 8, there were 7,960 unauthorized entries registered at Germany's land borders.

Police immediately turned back 6,193 people. 

Among them were 285 people who had expressed a request for asylum.

Since taking office in May, Germany's government has taken a tougher stance on irregular migration. 

Unlike the previous government, the current government allows for asylum-seekers to be turned away if they enter from what is considered to be a safe country. As it is surrounded by EU member states and Switzerland, also deemed a safe country by the German government, this policy enables authorities to turn away asylum-seekers at all of Germany's land borders.
Exceptions exist for people from particularly vulnerable groups.

German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider has called climate change the biggest social issue of the 21st century as Europe — including Germany — struggles through a heat wave.

""If one considers that the richest 1% of the global population causes as much in greenhouse gas emissions as the poorest two-thirds taken together, this poses serious questions of distribution,"" Schneider said.

He argued the heat was exposing social inequality. ""People with less money are able to protect themselves less well against the consequences of heat. Poor people more frequently live on busy roads and in densely built homes where heat builds up,"" the minister said, noting that those with money can afford air-conditioning or cooling gardens.

Schneider said the federal government was supporting local authorities and social institutions with advice and funding to expand cooling measures. He said €73.5 million ($86.5 million) had been approved for almost 500 projects since 2020, with at least €11.5 million available for this year and next.

Berlin has summoned the Iranian ambassador in Germany over the arrest in Denmark of a Danish national accused of spying on Jews in Germany for Iran.

""We will not tolerate any threat to Jewish life in Germany,"" the German foreign ministry said in a post on X, adding that the allegations needed to be ""thoroughly investigated.""

According to German prosecutors, the man's suspected aim was to collect information on Jewish sites and individuals in Berlin.

The man allegedly spied on three properties in June 2025 and prepared for further intelligence activities, possibly terrorist attacks on Jewish targets.

A regional court in Braunschweig has suspended the criminal trial over the VW diesel scandal against former CEO Martin Winterkorn because of his ongoing illness.

The court said his condition currently prevents the trial from continuing. It said Winterkorn was unfit to stand trial for now, leaving it unclear whether the case can ever be concluded.

The economic crimes chamber will continue to monitor his health with the help of an expert to assess if he might become fit to appear in court again. If that happens, proceedings against the 78-year-old would resume.

The VW emissions scandal broke in September 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency revealed the company had manipulated emissions tests on diesel vehicles. VW admitted to the cheating shortly before the announcement. Days later, Winterkorn resigned and the company faced one of the biggest crises in its history.

The trial began in 2024, with Winterkorn denying the allegations and arguing that the affair had damaged his successful career. A serious accident led to the trial being interrupted just days after it opened.

Following an altercation in a bar in Stuttgart, police shot an 18-year-old in the upper body, who died on the spot, despite resuscitation attempts.

The 18-year-old is said to have injured a 29-year-old man in the neck with a sharp object, according to police and the public prosecutor's office in the state capital of Baden-Württemberg. The suspect then fled while the victim was taken to hospital.

The suspect was then confronted by a police officer in a backyard.

The exact sequence of events is the subject of an ongoing investigation, the statement continued. The investigation into the use of firearms has been taken over by the State Office of Criminal Investigation.

Stuttgart is the capital city of the southwestern state of Baden-Württemberg.

Poland said it would impose temporary checks on its borders with Germany and Lithuania starting on July 7.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that the measure was aimed at reducing irregular migrant crossings.

""We consider the temporary restoration of controls at the Polish-German border necessary to limit and reduce to a minimum the uncontrolled flows... of migrants back and forth,"" Tusk said, adding that similar checks would be imposed on the Lithuanian border.

""We are aware that this decision entails certain consequences regarding the freedom of movement of people... There is no other way,"" he said.

A Danish citizen has been arrested on suspicion of spying for Iran, German prosecutors said Tuesday.

According to the prosecutors, the man's suspected aim was to collect information on Jewish sites and individuals in Berlin.

The man allegedly spied on three properties in June 2025, with him preparing for further intelligence activities, possibly terrorist attacks on Jewish targets.

In accordance with the German privacy law, the man was identified only as Ali S.

*Editor's note: DW follows the German press code, which stresses the importance of protecting the privacy of suspected criminals or victims and obliges us to refrain from revealing full names in such cases.

Twenty-seven people were arrested across Germany in suspicion of growing and selling cannabis illegally. 

They are suspected to have generated millions of euros of income through the illegal sale of the drug.

Some 30 buildings across three German states were searched as part of the investigation.

Several arrested were suspected of belonging to an illegal gang, according to police.

Among the states were North-Rhine Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate in the west and Hesse in central Germany.

One person was killed and two were seriously injured by a man with a sharp object at a company in the southern state of Bavaria, police said.

The stabbing took place in the town of Mellrichstadt in the Lower Franconia region, with a 21-year-old German man being arrested in connection with the incident.

Neither the motive nor the company involved have been named by police, who said there is no further danger to the public. 

A wildfire broke out in the largest forest in the city of Dresden in Germany's eastern Saxony state.

Around one hectare of forest went ablaze, with the fire already largely being under control.

Twenty-six firefighter teams are on site and have already managed to reduce the fire to about 8,000 square meters, the local fire brigades told local outlet Tag24.

In light of the heat wave in Germany, with expected temperatures reaching 40 degrees Celsius, education trade unions have called for nationwide heat protection regulations in schools.

""There must be uniform occupational health and safety regulations for students and school employees,"" said Anja Bensinger-Stolze, a board member of the Education and Science Union (GEW), in an interview with the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland (RND) newspapers.

In addition to modernizing schools with green roofs and shade sails, Bensinger-Stolze continued, a ""nationwide supply of free drinking water"" is necessary for all children, young people, and employees.

Additionally, first aid and safety training on how to deal with heat must be offered across the board, she added.

Gerhard Brand, the head of the Association for Education and Upbringing (VBE), suggested that spaces outside the school should be used more often during hot times of the year ""if it fits with the curriculum.""

Brand also believes that school authorities have a duty to equip existing school buildings so ""learning can be guaranteed even during high outside temperatures.""

Due to the ongoing heat wave, German hospitals are requesting additional funding to retrofit clinics.

""Severe heat poses challenges for hospitals and staff. Due to a lack of investment funds, only a few hospitals have air-conditioned rooms, offices, and waiting rooms,"" said Gerald Gaß, the head of the German Hospital Federation (DKG), in an interview with the Rheinische Post newspaper.

""In the long term, we need a climate protection and adaptation program to renovate old buildings,"" he said, adding that this is the only way clinics can protect patients and staff from the consequences of climate change.

Currently, hospitals rely on measures such as shading facades and cooling packs, Gaß explained.

Europe is currently experiencing an early and extreme heat wave. Temperatures as high as 40 degrees are expected in Germany by the middle of the week.

			US president urges Hamas to also accept deal ‘for the good of the Middle East'

Israel has agreed to the terms of a ceasefire agreement intended to end the war in Gaza, Donald Trump has claimed.

The president announced on social media that Benjamin Netanyahu had agreed in principle to a 60-day break in the fighting, following long meetings between top US and Israeli officials on Monday.

Although the full details of the proposed deal are unclear, it is thought to involve the release of some of the approximately 20 remaining living hostages and an increase in humanitarian aid to be delivered straight into population centres.

During this time, discussions would also be held about ending the war for good. Mr Trump urged Hamas to accept the proposal on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday evening.

It comes ahead of a visit to Washington by Mr Netanyahu next week, and a surge in confidence in both capitals following last month's bombing operations in Iran.

“My representatives had a long and productive meeting with the Israelis today on Gaza,” he said.

“Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions to finalise the 60 day ceasefire, during which time we will work with all parties to end the war.”

“The Qataris and Egyptians, who have worked very hard to help bring peace, will deliver this final proposal.”

“I hope, for the good of the Middle East, that Hamas takes this Deal, because it will not get better – IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”

Known to have become impatient with the grinding war in Gaza, Mr Trump increased the pressure on Israel to find a solution at the conclusion of the Iran campaign.

Despite the optimism and sense of momentum in both Washington and Israel, Hamas has not indicated that it will respond positively to the proposed deal.

It appears to be essentially the same as the unsuccessful formulation proposed back in February by Steve Witkoff, the US's Middle East envoy, to stop the then ceasefire collapsing.

So far, Hamas has refused to countenance the release of any hostages without a framework in place for a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

However, Mr Netanyahu's government has repeatedly placed the total destruction of Hamas within the enclave as a key war aim, alongside getting the hostages home.

The prime minister's fragile coalition government depends on the support of ultra-nationalists who openly call for continuance of the war at the expense, if necessary, of the hostages' lives.

There have been mixed messages in recent days.

On Sunday, Mr Netanyahu made comments strongly suggesting that recovering the hostages was now the priority, ahead of defeating Hamas.

However, reported leaks last night from a security cabinet meeting, claim he told the IDF's chief of staff Eyal Zamir: “We are going to kill every person bearing arms, nothing short of that.”

With the current IDF offensive in Gaza, named Operation Gideon's Chariot, drawing to an end, Gen. Zamir is thought to be arguing that expanding the fighting will risk the hostages' lives.

On Wednesday Gideon Sa'ar, the Israeli foreign minister, said on X: “There is a great majority in the government and also among the people for a framework to release hostages. If there is an opportunity to do so – we must not miss it!”

Hamas has been severely degraded from the organised terror army that crossed into Israel on October 7.

However, as a guerrilla organisation fighting in small groups in and amongst the rubble, they are undefeated and continue to kill Israeli soldiers.

Public opinion in Israel is for a conclusion of the war.

Although Israeli officials have spoken of a “window of opportunity” in recent days, they say the essential gap between them and Hamas remains, and there are currently no plans to dispatch a delegation to either Doha or Cairo for formal talks with Hamas.

Concluding the war in Gaza and allowing reconstruction which will benefit the Palestinians, would unlock the potential to expand the Abraham Accords, the groundbreaking series of normalisation deals between Israel and Arab countries brokered by the White House during Mr Trump's first administration.

Mr Trump is also thought to be keen on getting Israel to agree to a peace deal with the new regime in Syria.

Even if nothing substantive is agreed, the very fact of Mr Netanyahu's visit to Washington next week, reportedly brought forward at the prime minister's request, is a victory of sorts, as it delays his corruption trial in Jerusalem for at least one more week.

Proceedings were postponed this week following an unprecedented intervention by Mr Trump, calling for the case to be dropped, and a closed-door session involving security chiefs.

			Sharay Hayes, nicknamed The Punisher, attended Combs's ‘drug-fuelled parties' on a number of occasions

Sharay Hayes is 6ft 2, rippling with muscles and nicknamed “The Punisher”.

In 2015, working as an exotic dancer at the top of his game, he was described by the New York Post as giving Channing Tatum “a run for his money”.

The Punisher, whose Instagram profile is all abs, leather and chains, partied with some of America's most beautiful women, hunkiest men and biggest stars.

He never thought that his glamorous lifestyle would lead him to a courtroom, in which jurors would be shown footage of him having sex with the R&B singer Cassie Ventura during the sex trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs.

On Wednesday, Combs was cleared of racketeering conspiracy, and two counts of sex trafficking. He was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. He denied all charges.

The mogul was accused of intimidating women, including Ventura, into participating in “freak-offs”. A jury decided on Wednesday that this was not the case.

The parties were days-long, drug-fuelled orgies with male escorts, in which participants rubbed baby oil on each other and had sex as Combs watched.

Prosecution lawyers had previously claimed Combs was the “leader of a criminal enterprise”, who “doesn't take no for an answer”. Combs's team had argued that he was simply into the swinging lifestyle.

For Mr Hayes, his first entanglement with the music mogul and performer “Diddy” began on the evening of Oct 14, 2012.

That night, he received a call from a woman named “Janet”, asking for a male dancer to entertain her and some friends, he told The Telegraph.

He packed up and travelled to the Trump International Hotel in midtown Manhattan for the 3am booking.

But when a “stunning woman” with an “inviting smile” greeted him at the door of the suite in nothing but a bathrobe, he soon realised he was walking into an entirely different scenario.

“She immediately explained to me that she was not looking for a dance performance, that she wanted to set up this sexy scene where we would sit on couches adjacent from each other and put baby oil on in a sexy manner, and at some point her husband would come out and watch,” he said.

She handed him $800 in cash – four times the fee he had quoted for a dance – and he agreed, he said.

Mr Hayes has since said he would like to apologise to Ventura for his role in these nights, which she claimed she did not want to take part in. He says he was not aware of this.

Ventura was just 19 when she first met the rapper and was quickly signed to his label, Bad Boy Records. She claims that he pressured her to sleep with other men, sometimes for days at a time, and was physically, financially and psychologically abusive to her.

During the trial, the court heard testimony from the singer in which she claimed she had been pushed to her limits during the sessions, at one point blacking out and waking up in the shower, and also being forced to have sex while suffering from infections.

The court was shown a video of the rapper beating her and dragging her by her hair in a hotel in 2016. She claimed that the CCTV clip was captured as she attempted to leave one of these sessions: “Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but to recover and just try to feel normal again.”

Recounting the night he first met Ventura in 2012, Mr Hayes, 51, said after agreeing to take part, he was told to go into the bathroom and take off his clothes and come out nude or in a towel.

The room was dimly lit with candles and the furniture was covered in sheets, which he now realises was to protect it from being damaged by baby oil.

“I was instructed to sit on one single chair that was kind of adjacent to a sofa, she positioned herself on the sofa, and then we began to do the baby oil... I would put it on myself, she's putting it on herself, we would put [it] on each other, and then there were sexual gestures of self pleasuring and stuff like that to try to set the mood,” he said.

Eventually Combs, who he believed was Ventura's husband, and says he did not realise at the time was the A-list musician, came out completely nude, with a niqab covering his face, and sat in a chair around 12 to 15ft away.

“It was very strange, just the idea of understanding a partner would come in was already strange but, seeing his face completely covered, it threw me off,” he said.

Combs would give them directions, Mr Hayes said, mainly based on the lighting and the positioning of their bodies, or if he wanted them to apply more baby oil.

“It was clear that this scene was based on his preference and something that he enjoyed,” he said.

The “scene” lasted around 25 to 35 minutes, when Combs left the room, Ventura followed.

Five minutes later she returned and told him it had been “perfect”, and asked him if he would like to finish, he says. He declined, and she handed him an extra $1,200.

A few months later, Ventura called him again and they carried out the same scenario with the baby oil, but this time had sex.

He would see the couple around eight to 12 times over a two-and-a-half-year period, and would be paid between $1,200 to $2,000 each time.

Each session would last for a minimum of four hours, he said, with the sexual activity lasting up to 45 minutes.

Sometimes Combs would leave the room, Ventura would follow, and then they would return and Mr Hayes would be asked to resume.

During one session, when Mr Hayes and Ventura were having intercourse on the bed, Combs “slammed” a stack of hundred dollar bills down “in approval”, he said.

“[Ventura] kind of looked at him... to gauge was he okay or whatever, and he just says, ‘I'm fine. I like that s---, I'm enjoying this s---.'”

Mr Hayes said he never saw Combs being aggressive towards Ventura, and she did not appear as though she was being forced to take part in the sexual acts.

There were moments she appeared “frustrated” and would sigh, but he said these were in response to Combs's directions, which could be as specific as telling her to move a candle slightly to the left.

Mr Hayes said he did not discover who the celebrity couple were until around 15 months after their first encounter, when he saw a sign on the television at JW Marriott Essex House saying: “Welcome Mr Sean Combs.”

His final encounter with the couple took place in 2015 after an extended break. Mr Hayes explained he felt uncomfortable and was unable to perform sexually, and they did not call again.

He has since written a self-help book on erectile dysfunction called In Search of Freezer Meat, which included an anonymised passage about the couple.

Mr Hayes said he did not feel used, but felt “special” that this high-profile couple had chosen him.

“Now in hindsight, I know I was one of many and it kind of killed that, burst that bubble, but in the moment I thought it was something to be honoured to be a part of,” he said.

Testifying in court last month was a nerve-wracking experience, Mr Hayes said, adding that he was physically shaking when he took the stand.

He avoided eye contact with Combs until the end of his testimony, when they nodded at each other as he left the courtroom.

On Wednesday, Combs was accused, and found guilty of, transporting male escorts across state lines to engage in the “freak-offs”. But he was cleared of the most serious charges.

Initially, Mr Hayes was confused why he had been called to testify, as he did not witness physical abuse and did not travel across state lines for these encounters.

But his role in the case became more apparent when the jury was played videos of “freak-offs”, which Mr Hayes said he was unaware had been filmed.

“I had no idea anything was possibly filmed, so it's a surprise to me to know that there is video footage,” he said, adding: “It creates a degree of worry.”","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

Washington Times' Stephen Dinan praises the Trump administration for the work it's done to secure the border on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order that sought to prevent migrants crossing the border from seeking asylum or applying for withholding of removal in the U.S., a major blow to Trump as he looks to further enforce his broad immigration crackdown.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Daniel Moss, an Obama appointee, said Wednesday that Trump's Jan. 20 proclamation, which sought to block all migrants ""engaged in the invasion across the southern border"" from claiming asylum or seeking withholding of removal, exceeds his authority — siding with a group of 13 asylum-seekers and immigrants rights groups who sued over the proclamation earlier this year.

The group urged the court in February to block Trump's proclamation from taking force, arguing that the action was ""as unlawful as it is unprecedented.""

Moss, who heard arguments in the case in April, appeared to agree. Trump, he said in his order, ""lacks the inherent constitutional authority"" to supplant federal statutes governing removals.

""To hold otherwise would render much, if not most, of the INA simply optional,"" the judge said.

Moss elaborated further in the 128-page opinion, saying neither the U.S. Constitution nor the Immigration and Nationality Act grant Trump the authority to ""replace the comprehensive rules and procedures set forth in the INA and the governing regulations.""

""The Court recognizes that the Executive Branch faces enormous challenges in preventing and deterring unlawful entry into the United States and in adjudicating the overwhelming backlog of asylum claims of those who have entered the country,"" Moss said in his order.

""But the INA, by its terms, provides the sole and exclusive means for removing people already present in the country, and, as the Department of Justice correctly concluded less than nine months ago, neither § 1182(f) nor § 1185(a) provides the President with the unilateral authority to limit the rights of aliens present in the United States to apply for asylum.""

Moss stayed the order for a 14-day period to allow the Trump administration to seek emergency relief and appeal the case to a higher court. 

The judge also granted plaintiffs' request to certify a class of migrants who would were either subject to the proclamation or would be in the future, which he said would not be affected by last week's Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. Casa, which limited the scope of injunctive relief courts can provide.

The decision was blasted by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who described Moss as a ""marxist"" judge in a post on X.

""To try to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling on nationwide injunctions a marxist judge has declared that all potential FUTURE illegal aliens on foreign soil (eg a large portion of planet earth) are part of a protected global ""class"" entitled to admission into the United States,"" Miller said.

The news comes as Trump has sought to prioritize hard-line immigration policies in his second presidential term. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments earlier this year over another order Trump signed, which seeks to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. 

The administration has also cracked down on deportations, invoking a 1798 wartime immigration law to more quickly send hundreds of migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador earlier this year.

The ‘Fox News Sunday' panel discusses the vital Supreme Court race in Wisconsin capturing the attention of the nation and more.

\The Wisconsin Supreme Court's newly elected liberal majority on Wednesday voted to strike down a near-total state abortion ban, voting 4-3 to overturn the stringent, 176-year-old law. 

The decision reflected a deeply partisan split, with all four liberal justices voting to invalidate the 1849 abortion law and the three conservative justices dissenting.

It also crystallized the impact of the state's Supreme Court election earlier this year that raked in millions of dollars in donations, the highest amount in U.S. history for a judicial race. It included involvement from then-Trump ally Elon Musk, former President Barack Obama and others.

Writing for the majority, Justice Rebecca Dallet said the law had been superseded by more recent precedent, including a 1985 statute that allowed for abortions up to the point of fetal viability, or around the 20-week mark.

""We conclude that comprehensive legislation enacted over the last 50 years regulating in detail the 'who, what, where, when, and how' of abortion so thoroughly covers the entire subject of abortion that it was meant as a substitute for the 19th century near-total ban on abortion,"" Dallet wrote. 

""Accordingly, we hold that the legislature impliedly repealed [the 1849 ban] to abortion, and that [that law] therefore does not ban abortion in the State of Wisconsin.""

Conservative Justice Annette Ziegler, in a dissent, described the ruling as ""a jaw-dropping exercise of judicial will"" and charged that the liberal justices ruled on the matter based on their personal preferences.

The 1849 law, and efforts to revive it, came to the fore in Wisconsin in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade — effectively snapping back into place the state law that had been dormant for decades.

The Wisconsin law made it a felony for individuals in Wisconsin to perform abortions, including when the health of the woman was at risk, and without exceptions in cases of rape or incest. 

Though the law was not enforced by the state in recent years, at least some Republicans had urged the state Supreme Court to keep it in place, prompting opponents to push more urgently for it to be struck down.

The 4-3 decision puts to rest the possibility that it could be revived. 

NINTH CIRCUIT REJECTS TRUMP'S BID TO REINSTATE BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP ORDER

It's also the clearest sign to date of the impact that liberals on the bench could have after they regained the court majority in 2023 for the first time in 15 years. 

The closely watched state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin was the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, attracting more than $100 million in donations and far eclipsing the $56 million spent on the state Supreme Court race just two years earlier, according to figures compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice. 

Susan Crawford ultimately beat out conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who was backed by President Donald Trump and Musk.

Musk personally donated $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party earlier this year, while his two super PACs spent more than $17 million on Schimel's behalf.

Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers praised the state Supreme Court decision Wednesday, describing it as a win ""for women and families"" and healthcare professionals in the state.

""Three years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court upended five decades of precedent and threw reproductive freedom in Wisconsin and across our country into chaos,"" Evers said in a statement. ""I promised then to fight like hell to ensure every Wisconsinite has the freedom to consult their family, their faith and their doctor and make the reproductive healthcare decision that is right for them, and I've never stopped.

""Today, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld that basic freedom.""

After facing several months of backlash, the Colorado state Capitol has replaced a controversial portrait of President Donald Trump, which he claimed was ""purposely distorted"" by the artist. 

A new presidential portrait, recently donated by the White House, was installed last week at the Denver Capitol, the Colorado Capitol Building Advisory Committee told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. It replaces Colorado artist Sarah Boardman's painting, which had hung since 2019.

Despite the previous portrait's six-year run on display, Trump took to social media last spring to criticize the artwork, saying Boardman ""must have lost her talent as she got older"" and had ""purposely distorted"" his image. The Colorado Springs artist denied the claims. 

While Boardman's painting depicted a much younger Trump, the latest display by Arizona artist Vanessa Horabuena mirrors Trump's intense official presidential photo.

COLORADO TO TAKE DOWN TRUMP PAINTING AT STATE CAPITOL

""Thank you to the Highly Talented Artist, Vanessa Horabuena, and the incredible people of Colorado,"" Trump said Tuesday on Truth Social.

Horabuena is a ""Christian worship artist"" who has done several other depictions of Trump as well as Abraham Lincoln, Mount Rushmore and Jesus Christ, according to her website. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. 

Boardman told Fox News Digital she had no comment on the new painting.

TRUMP WANTS 'DISTORTED' PORTRAIT OF HIMSELF REMOVED FROM COLORADO CAPITOL, SLAMS GOV. POLIS: 'TRULY THE WORST'

The Horabuena portrait was installed as a temporary display following a Thursday decision by the advisory committee, which oversees art displays at the Capitol. 

""The Capitol Building Advisory Committee has agreed at the committee's meeting on June 26, 2025, to temporarily display this donated portrait and will consider the disposition of the full presidential portrait collection at a future meeting,"" the committee told Fox News Digital. ""The new portrait is installed in the third floor gallery of the Colorado Capitol.""

Lois Court, a former state lawmaker who chairs the committee, told the Associated Press that installing the donated artwork was the right move.

""There was a blank on the wall,"" Court said. ""It seemed inappropriate. We knew that the White House had sent us this replacement and it simply made sense to put it up.""

Boardman's portrait was removed from the Capitol's presidential gallery wall in April, according to the committee, after Colorado Democrats – who control the legislature – agreed to take it down at the request of local Republican leaders.

""Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before,"" Trump said in March on Truth Social. ""The artist also did President Obama, and he looks wonderful, but the one of me is truly the worst. She must have lost her talent as she got older.""

Peter Lumaj, former U.S. Senate candidate and attorney who fled communist Albania, speaks on fears over New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's allegedly 'communist' ideas.

President Donald Trump vowed to ""save New York City"" from mayoral hopeful Zohran Mamdani on Wednesday.

Trump made the statement from his Truth Social account, blasting the Democratic Party's nominee for mayor and claiming that he has the power to step in and take action if he chooses.

""As President of the United States, I'm not going to let this Communist Lunatic destroy New York,"" Trump wrote. ""Rest assured, I hold all the levers, and have all the cards. I'll save New York City, and make it 'Hot' and 'Great' again, just like I did with the Good Ol' USA!""

The post was only Trump's latest salvo against Mamdani, who has faced intense criticism from conservatives and even some Democrats over his socialist policies and refusal to condemn terrorism-linked rhetoric.

HAKEEM JEFFRIES SAYS NYC HOPEFUL MAMDANI NEEDS TO 'CLARIFY' HIS POSITION ON 'GLOBALIZE THE INTIFADA'

Zohran Mamdani is a ""communist lunatic"" who will ""crush"" New York City if elected mayor, says President Trump. 

Mamdani's campaign did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Trump had previously threatened to pull federal funding from the city, saying in a Fox News interview that aired Sunday, ""I can tell you this – whoever's mayor of New York is going to have to behave themselves, or the federal government is coming down very tough on them financially.""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Mamdani would ""crush"" New York City if he is elected mayor.

Fox News' White House correspondent Peter Doocy asked Leavitt about recent calls for Mamdani to be deported, citing calls from one lawmaker who said Mamdani should be denaturalized.

""I haven't heard him say that. I haven't heard him call for that. But certainly he does not want this individual to be elected. I was just speaking to him about it and [Mamdani's] radical policies that will completely crush New York City, which is obviously a city that the president holds near and dear to his heart,"" Leavitt responded.

Leavitt went on to say that Trump would be willing to work with Mamdani if he is elected, though she predicted that the relationship would be difficult.

""Look, the president is always willing to work with everyone. He's working with Democrats across the country, Democrat governors. And he said he'll work with people on the far left. He works with Republicans. He works with people in the middle. He wants to do what's right for America,"" Leavitt said.

""But surely someone who holds these values and is quite literally a communist and condemns every value that makes this country great: common sense, law and order, low taxes, working hard, and earning your keep in this country. He's against all of that. And I think the president would find it difficult to work with someone like that, if he is elected. I'm sure you'll hear more from the president on that, but we'll have to see. Hopefully, the voters of New York City choose wisely,"" she finished.

The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for legal permission to fire three Democratic-appointed members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission after the move was blocked by a lower court.

U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox previously ruled that Trump's termination of Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr. was unlawful. He argued that the firings went against the provision that a president could only fire commissioners for neglect of duty or malfeasance. Solicitor General D. John Sauer is now taking the matter to the nation's highest court.

In the filing, Maddox alleged that the three members immediately worked to sabotage the work of the CPSC, and were effective in doing so due to their making up a majority on the five-member board. He also pointed out that they were undermining the work of the CPSC's acting chairman, to whom “Congress has vested the agency's ‘executive and administrative functions.'”

Maddox further alleged that the members were threatening staff, throwing the agency into chaos.

“The Acting Chairman views respondents' actions as procedurally improper and thus invalid, but one of the respondents has threatened agency staff: ‘If you chose to ignore the directive of the Commission, I suggest you read the [district court's] order and decide whether you want to personally violate it,'” Maddox wrote.

THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO COULD DEFECT TO SINK TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

“Respondents' actions have thus thrown the agency into chaos and have put agency staff in the untenable position of deciding which Commissioners' directives to follow,” he added.

The episode represents the latest of many legal struggles faced by the Trump administration, which has been hounded by legal barriers every step of the way in carrying out its agenda.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Donald Trump had a very busy Tuesday.

Not long ago, I ran into an old friend, a well-regarded Democratic intellectual who recently has moved to my right, but who still holds liberal values and is not a Donald Trump supporter. After we commiserated about the excesses of the far left, I mentioned offhandedly that Trump's maniacal authoritarianism makes the fact that Democrats can't get their act together so much worse.

He reacted, to my surprise, with indignation. Trump wasn't canceling elections, he protested, nor was he calling brownshirts into the streets. So how could I call the president authoritarian?

Many highly educated Americans share my friend's intuition. They believe that if elections are occurring and criticism of the president is not banned outright, then democracy is not under threat. They fail to see the administration's slow-moving efforts to break down the norms and institutional barriers that otherwise inhibit the ruling party from asphyxiating its opposition. Political scientists who study democracy have a term that clarifies the phenomenon: democratic backsliding. Backslide far enough, and you end up in something called “competitive authoritarianism.” Elections are still held, but the ruling party has commandeered so many institutions in society and has violated so many laws to enhance its own power that the opposition hardly stands a chance. These are dry phrases, but they capture the way in which democracy and authoritarianism are not binary alternatives, but values that lie on a continuum.

Steven Levitsky: The new authoritarianism

I thought back to my friend's comments yesterday, because in a single day, Trump took or was revealed to have taken six shocking new assaults on liberal democracy. They would have been shocking, anyway, before he spent a decade bludgeoning our civic nerve endings to the point where these things now register as mere routine politics.

Yesterday alone:

1. Trump floated the notion of arresting New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The president was responding to a question about Mamdani's promise to “stop masked ICE agents from deporting our neighbors.” But he proceeded to suggest that he was explicitly targeting Mamdani's political beliefs—“We don't need a communist in this country”—and publicly entertained the groundless accusation that Mamdani, a U.S. citizen, is “here illegally.”

2. Trump threatened to prosecute CNN for reporting on the existence of an app that allows users to alert one another to ICE activity and on a Defense Intelligence Agency preliminary analysis suggesting that American air strikes had set back Iran's nuclear program by only a few months. “We're working with the Department of Justice to see if we can prosecute them for that,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced, referring to the ICE-app story, “because what they're doing is actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities, operations and we're going to actually go after them and prosecute them.” Trump endorsed Noem's threat, and added, “They may be prosecuted also for giving false reports on the attack on Iran.”

3. The president mused about the prospect of financially punishing Elon Musk for criticizing the Republican megabill. “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!”

To examples such as these, my friend might reply that Trump doesn't always deliver on his rhetoric. That is true, but only to a point. Especially in his second term, Trump follows through on quite a lot of his threats. Indeed, yesterday's litany of authoritarian moves is not limited to words. It includes at least three actions:

4. The New York Times reported that Trump has appointed Jared L. Wise to the Justice Department's Weaponization Working Group. In 2023, federal prosecutors had charged Wise, a former FBI agent, for participating in the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, allegedly egging on fellow rioters to assault police officers with shouts of “Kill 'em! Kill 'em! Kill 'em!” Like the rest of the January 6 defendants, Wise was pardoned on the first day of Trump's second term. Now he is working under Ed Martin, a fellow supporter of Trump's efforts to secure an unelected second term in 2021, and who has tried to intimidate various administration targets with a variety of legal and extralegal punishments.

Tom Nichols: Ed Martin has completely disqualified himself

5. The administration impounded $7 billion of Education Department funding for after-school and summer programs, English learners, teacher training, and other school functions. The funds had been appropriated by Congress, but Trump once again decided to seize the power of the purse from Congress for himself, in violation of the structure laid out by the Constitution.

6. Paramount, the parent company of CBS, settled a groundless nuisance lawsuit Trump had filed against the CBS show 60 Minutes. The suit absurdly claims that Trump suffered mental distress because the show aired an interview with Kamala Harris in 2024 that had been edited for length (which is, in fact, standard practice in television news, as Trump and his lawyers surely know). The only apparent reason Paramount settled was to grease the skids for the Trump administration to approve the company's bid to buy a Hollywood studio. (The company has denied that this was its motivation.)

None of these moves is a one-off. All follow what has become standard practice in the second Trump term. The president has declared a new order in which the supporters of his insurrection have been vindicated and freed from any consequences for their crimes, the president claims sole authority over the government's powers of spending and regulation, and these powers are to be used only to punish his enemies and reward his friends.

This new order, if unchecked, will at some point reach a level at which opposition becomes prohibitively dangerous and the commanding heights of business, media, and academia all submit to Trump's whims. We might not arrive at that end point. But it is very clearly where Trump is trying to take us.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The U.S. is hacking away at support for state-of-the-art forecasting.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Clouds are the bane of a hurricane forecaster's existence. Or they were, until about 20 years ago, when forecasters got access to a technology that Kim Wood, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Arizona, told me to think of as cloud X-ray vision: It cuts through the cloud top to help generate a high-resolution, three-dimensional image of what's happening below.



Known as the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder, or SSMIS, it rides on a series of satellites and allows forecasters to see a storm's structure, which might otherwise be invisible. The Hurricane Hunter planes that fly into storms can also be used to generate three-dimensional storm images, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which is responsible for hurricane forecasting, has only two of those aircraft. They can't be everywhere at once. With the SSMIS, forecasters had an autonomous, powerful eye in the sky. But now the Department of Defense says it will cease processing and distributing the crucial imagery from this sensor at the end of this month. Losing these views threatens the National Hurricane Center's ability to see what's forming, Wood told me.



For years, the National Hurricane Center has been improving the accuracy of its forecasts, and one short year ago, the United States was better at predicting storms' tracks than it had ever been. But the Trump administration has been cutting the forecasting staff and budgets. And now these satellite data will be missing too. The U.S. is rapidly losing state-of-the-art hurricane forecasting, just in time for hurricane season's busiest months.



The data were nice while we had them. After all, no one likes a surprise hurricane. When the sun goes down, convective storms over open ocean often grow stronger, juiced by the changing temperature dynamics. But that's also when types of storm surveillance that rely on what's visible are least able to determine what's going on. Infrared imaging can see in the dark, but the picture is typically low-resolution and grainy, and can obscure key shapes. When the sun comes up, forecasters can suddenly be looking at a fully formed storm eye. Forecasters dread the “sunrise surprise,” which is exactly the sort of thing that the microwave imagery from SSMIS is most helpful in preventing. It gives a clearer picture, even through clouds, and even in the dark.



Plus, the technology is vital to picking up on telltale signs of rapid intensification, a phenomenon that has become more common in recent years, most notably with Hurricane Otis in 2023 and Hurricane Milton in 2024. Storms that intensify faster and reach higher peak intensities just before hitting land are a nightmare for forecasting, and climate scientists worry they will become only more common as the planet warms. Research suggests that certain signature formations in a storm could indicate that it may intensify rapidly, Andrew Hazelton, an associate scientist working in hurricane modeling and research at the University of Miami, told me. Those structures are simply easier to see with the SSMIS images.



A few other satellites can provide microwave imaging. But, as the meteorologist Michael Lowry has pointed out, their instruments either are orbiting more infrequently or are inferior to the one being discontinued. NOAA suggested to Lowry that its Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder instrument would be able to fill the gap, he wrote. But that suggestion is misleading, Hazelton said: The information from that satellite is so low-resolution that the eye of a hurricane looks like just a few pixels instead of a more detailed image. “It's really hard to pick out details,” he told me—including the aspects of a storm's structure that may signal that it could rapidly intensify. Plus, having fewer microwave instruments operating in the sky means fewer snapshots of oceans where hurricanes might form. Without SSMIS, the number of microwave-image glimpses that forecasters get over any given spot will be essentially cut in half, Lowry wrote; many more hours could go by without observations when they're most needed. (I reached out to NOAA for comment, but the agency redirected me to the Department of Defense.)



SSMIS is part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program; a Navy spokesperson told me the entire satellite program is slated to be discontinued in September 2026. When I asked about previous reports citing cybersecurity concerns as a reason for the closure, the Navy spokesperson responded only that the satellite program is “no longer compliant with Department of the Navy information technology modernization requirements.” In the meantime, the Defense Department will just stop processing and distributing the data it collects. A spokesperson from the U.S. Space Force also told me the satellite system will be replaced by two other satellite systems, the second one of which is slated to be operational in 2027. But that still doesn't explain why this data stream is being cut off now, more than a year before the satellite program is slated to be decommissioned, Hazelton said. “We need all the microwave data we can get while it's available.”



These aren't the only data forecasters have lost, either: Right now, across the U.S., fewer weather balloons are being launched because of staffing shortages at National Weather Service forecasting offices. Balloons offer insights into how the atmosphere is behaving; data picked up on the West Coast are the East Coast's business, too, as they'll predict the weather coming just hours in the future. “We want the complete picture of the state of the atmosphere so that we have a way to then estimate the next step,” Wood said. “Upstream information is often just as critical as information right at the point where the storm might be.”



NOAA is losing the experts who can interpret those data, too. And cuts to staff this year already mean that more duties are piled higher on individual people, “which means they may be less able to properly use the data once it comes in,” Wood said. Those cuts extend all the way to the people who work on underlying weather models. Hazelton, for example, was on a team at the National Weather Service where he worked to improve hurricane modeling. In February, he was axed along with some 800 employees who had been recently hired; he'd worked for NOAA as a contract employee for nearly a decade, on Hurricane Hunter missions and improving storm modeling. He was part of the group of fired NOAA employees who were hastily rehired after a judge temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's cuts, and was refired after a subsequent Supreme Court ruling. At the University of Miami, he's now continuing his work on hurricane models through a federal partnership.



The latest proposed NOAA budget for 2026, released Monday, aims to remove even more workers, along with whole programs. It zeroes out, for instance, the line item for the entire Oceanic and Atmospheric Research office, a network of federal research centers whose work helps develop new techniques and tools for forecasters and improve weather models. If this budget passes, the forecasts of the near future—three, five, 10 years down the line—will suffer too, Hazelton said.



This year has been a miserable cascade of losses for the American hurricane-safety apparatus. Any one of these losses might have been papered over by other parts of the system. But now it's just losing too many components for that. As James Franklin, the former chief of the National Hurricane Center's hurricane-specialist unit, put it in a post on Substack, “Resiliency is being stripped away, piece by piece.” What's easy to see coming now are the possible consequences: at best, a needless evacuation. But just as easily: a rushed evacuation, a surprise landfall, a flattened house.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Bridget Brink, the former ambassador to Ukraine, on that country's war with Russia, America's betrayal of Ukraine, and why she resigned

On this episode of The David Frum Show, The Atlantic's David Frum opens with a warning: The United States' support for Ukraine is collapsing under Donald Trump's second term—and with it, the global system of peace and security that has protected Americans for decades. David explains what Trump's latest actions reveal about his motivations, and why Ukraine's survival may now depend on the outcome of the 2024 election.

Then David is joined by the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and now Democratic congressional candidate Bridget Brink, who served under both President Biden and President Trump. They discuss the true stakes of the war, the failure of the Trump administration to develop or execute a coherent Ukraine policy, and why Brink ultimately chose to resign her post. She offers a firsthand account of life in Kyiv during the early days of the full-scale invasion, the dangers facing American diplomats in war zones, and the institutional breakdowns now threatening U.S. foreign policy from within.

The following is a transcript of the episode:

David Frum: Hello, and welcome to another episode of The David Frum Show. I'm David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic. I'm speaking to you today from the offices of The Picton Gazette, one of the oldest continuously published newspapers in all of Canada. It's Canada Day week here in Canada, and many of our usual facilities are closed. So I'm very grateful to the editors and publishers of the Gazette for making their offices available to me to record this opening discussion.

My guest this week will be Ambassador Bridget Brink, who was appointed by President Biden as ambassador to Ukraine and then served under President Trump until her resignation earlier this year. Ambassador Brink is now running for Congress for the Democratic nomination in Michigan's Seventh District. Our conversation was recorded before she made that announcement.

Before I turn to our conversation about Ukraine and the struggle for independence, and about the inconsistent and unfavorable attitude of the Trump administration toward Ukraine that she observed as ambassador, I want to say a few personal words about what is at stake in this Ukrainian cause.

The United States has built, since 1945, an extraordinary system of peace and security embracing much of the planet. It is a system from which many countries benefit, but Americans too. That Americans do not need to learn a second language in most cases; that they can travel about the world with a feeling of security; that when they do business, they do business under legal systems that are often inspired by the American example; that when they travel as tourists or students or in any capacity, they can put down a credit card, and if they have a dispute, have that credit card dispute adjudicated, usually under American law—all of those things that we take for granted as we move about a world that is ever more accommodating to the American way of life and to American interests, all of that is one of the prizes for the American investment in global peace and security.

Now, that system of peace and security received one of its severest tests when Russia accelerated its attack on Ukraine. The war began in 2014 with the attack on Crimea and the occupation of Crimea. But in February of 2022, Russia made a direct lunge for the capital, Kyiv. The heroism and endurance of Ukrainian soldiers beat back the Russians, and Ukraine has continued to fight for its independence to this day. This is a war not about boundaries, but about Ukraine's sovereign existence. The Russians and President Putin, their dictator, have made it very clear that what they are offended by is that Ukraine imagines it has any right to exist as an independent nation at all.

As Putin has told many people, including American interviewers—including pet American interviewers, like Tucker Carlson when Tucker Carlson interviewed Vladimir Putin—what this war is about from Putin's point of view is that Ukraine is not a country. It's just part of Russia. It has no history. It has no language. It has no literature. It has no right to be any kind of separate people at all. It's little Russia, in his mind, that must be ruled forever by big Russia. The Ukrainians see it otherwise, and they have fought and struggled and died to maintain their national existence.

Under President Biden, the president who appointed Ambassador Brink, the United States assisted Ukraine, not as fully as it should. It often seems that President Biden's policy was to say, What does Ukraine need? Give them half, and give it late. Tanks and airplanes and other kinds of assistance always arrived too little amounts and too slow in time to turn the tide of war when the war was ready to be turned, especially in the summer of [20]23. It often seemed that there was a lack of urgency in the Biden administration, that they never took it seriously, that November '24 would be, among other things, a referendum on Ukraine's survival, and that if there was anything that was left undone by the United States as of November '24, there was a real chance that the next administration, which might be Donald Trump's, would turn off the flow of aid and doom Ukraine altogether. If the war was not won by November of 2024, it might never be won at all.

But that lack of urgency was a flaw from a generally positive policy. President Biden did seem to understand what was at stake and did want to help, even if it was never in time and never enough. But now, in the Trump presidency, we are in a very different world, a world of outright hostility to Ukraine, where Donald Trump's goal seems to be to pressure Ukraine, sometimes risking Ukrainian lives, sometimes dooming Ukrainian lives, pressure Ukraine to a negotiated form of submission to Russia.

I don't know that we have yet or ever will get to the bottom of the reason for Donald Trump's strange attachment to Russia. The why question—it's been speculated about, psychological blackmail, cronyism. It's been speculated about forever. And I have to admit, I sometimes have joined in some of the speculation, but I think always we need to have skepticism about it. We don't know and maybe we'll never know the why of the Trump-Russia attachment.

But we can see the what. We can see the thing. We can see that there is something going on here that is way beyond the usual about how Americans feel about foreign dictators—a kind of something that is influencing American policy in ways that are injurious to all kinds of societies, not only Ukraine, and that has biased American policy toward the support of the goals of this aggressive dictatorship in Moscow.

Now we find ourselves, really, in a moment of crisis. The United States has demonstrated in Iran that American power can be used. This administration has proven that all those op-eds and think pieces and campaign propaganda about Trump as a dove, as a noninterventionist were nonsense. Trump struck Iran. Right now, there are American Predator drones flying over Mexico. And many in the Trump administration, including the vice president, have talked about using American military force inside Mexico—again, with or without the permission of the Mexican government. They're not noninterventionists. They're not pacifists. They're not doves. What they are are people who are hostile to the Ukrainian cause.

The Ukrainian cause is a great cause. It's one that deserves respect and support from Americans, as it has gained and deserves support from America's allies. Ukraine has done so much by itself. It has fought and struggled and defended itself, but it probably cannot win by itself. To win, it needs help. That help was forthcoming—inadequately, but forthcoming—from the Biden administration, and it's been dialed back by the Trump administration. It needs to be a top-of-mind issue in our national discussion today.

What can be done to help Ukraine? Why won't Donald Trump do it? How can it be pressured to do it? In that debate, Ambassador Brink has been and will be one of the most important voices, first as a successful and effective ambassador, then as a powerful critic of the administration she served, and now as a candidate for Congress.

So in a few moments, my conversation with Ambassador Bridget Brink, but first: a quick break.

[Music]

Frum: Ambassador Bridget Brink, is a career diplomat, a native of Michigan, and a graduate of Kenyon College. Her service to the United States commenced during the Clinton administration. She has represented the United States in Uzbekistan, Georgia, and the Slovak Republic. In between, she rose to higher and higher positions and ranks at the State Department and on the National Security Council staff.

In February 2022, as Russian columns raced toward Kyiv to capture that Ukrainian capital, and as Russian airborne troops descended on the Kyiv airport, President Biden asked Bridget Brink to serve as his ambassador to Ukraine, an emerging war zone, one of the most dangerous posts in all of U.S. diplomacy.

She was formally nominated in April of 2022 and has led the mission until earlier this year. She resigned in 2025 to protest President Trump's persistent refusal to acknowledge Russia's responsibility for the war Putin started.

And Ambassador Brink, thank you so much. Welcome to The David Frum Show. Let me ask you to take us back to that moment when you got the nod to serve in this historic role at this historic time. How did that happen? What was that like?

Bridget Brink: Well, thanks David. Thanks so much for having me on. Well, I remember it like it was yesterday, but now it was more than three years ago. As you know, or probably know, we have a long process to bring new ambassadors into positions.

So I knew for a while, even before the war started, that I was the president's candidate and had to go through the formal confirmation process. And when the war started, I got a call. And I was asked, Are you still interested in this post? Because we think we may have to close the embassy. We don't know where the embassy will be. We don't know what will happen with the war. What's your position?

And I remember very distinctly, I said, No, I absolutely am committed. I think this position is more important now than maybe ever, and so keep going. And I also said we need to stay and then go back, and that's what we did.

Frum: Yeah, I want to protect us both against the temptation that a lot of Americans have to think that the war started in February of 2022.

Brink: Yes.

Frum: In fact, it started in 2014. But for a long time, the fighting was localized to certain border regions between Russia—the Ukrainian territory but near Russia. In February of '22, we had an escalation of the war where the capital itself became under siege.

So when did you arrive in Kyiv?

Brink: I arrived in Kyiv at the end of May—May 29, 2022—and I came in by land. At that time, we were driving, and I came in; I had a chargé [d'affaires] that I was replacing. We hadn't had a confirmed ambassador in Ukraine for over three years. And I remember that very distinctly because it was me and nine other diplomats.

That's who returned back to help reestablish and reopen the embassy. And when I got there—of course, embassies, when they close, they're taken down in a way to protect our national security. So areas that are sensitive or things that are sensitive are removed or destroyed. And so when we got to the embassy, we literally had nothing that you could plug into the wall.

So if you think about What do you need when you're working? well, you need your computer, and you need your various things that help you do your job, and because of a closure, that did not exist. So this was the unexpected, I'd say, challenge that we had in the first few days and weeks. Because not only were we coming back into a war zone, not only did we not at the time have any air defense (because it was the early part of the war, it was very uncertain)—we also didn't have a functioning, operating embassy. And that, I have to say, was a huge and heavy lift because usually when you reopen an embassy, you reopen it in conditions of peace, not in conditions of war. But here we were, trying to do that in conditions of war.

Frum: Where did you sleep and eat?

Brink: So in the first three months, I slept in the embassy. So I actually was given a room in the Marine house. So we didn't have Marines at that time. Marines usually protect embassies overseas. Me—and it's a small seven, six or seven rooms—and so I had a room just like everybody else's room in the Marine house, whatever Marines live in. I think it's now called, like, the “ambassador's room.”

And I slept and ate at the embassy. We have a small cafeteria, and I ate there. And, in fact, I didn't want to leave, because after three months, we moved to another location—because we were getting bigger as I pushed very hard to bring more people back. And I didn't want to move, because literally from the time I opened my eyes in the morning until the time I closed them, I was working.

And I didn't want to take the time that I needed to do any kind of commuting back and forth to the embassy. And so I think I was the last one to leave the embassy, purely because of that—not because I didn't want to go and normalize, but because I worried it would, like, take precious seconds and minutes off of what we needed to do the job.

And as I told everybody, we're working at the speed of war. But finally, I was convinced: Like, no, it's important. It's important that the ambassador move, as an example. And if we were going to help the Ukrainians fight this fight, we needed, also, to give people a little bit of ability to have a little downtime and perform. And that was absolutely correct, and that's what I tried to do.

Your first question about Why did I do this job? It's because I believe this was the most important, or at least one of the most important diplomatic jobs on the planet for the United States. And as I think that we, as the United States, should lead and lead with our values and our interests, I was so honored to be asked to do this job.

It was like an honor of a lifetime—really, sincerely an honor of a lifetime to do it, even though it was so challenging and hard every single minute of every single day.

Frum: Did the embassy ever come under fire, intentional or purportedly accidental?

Brink: I mean, here's the challenge we faced: In the first year that we were there—this is prior to receiving any Patriot systems or other types of advanced American air-defense systems—there literally was not air defense. And so for the first year-plus, I think, that I was there, we were—everyone in the country was, but we were, as the American representation—in a situation where we didn't have the ability to protect people.

So when the air alerts went off, we had to make sure that we had everybody in a place that was the most safe possible, and that was underground. So many times we had situations where missiles—or at that time in the first year, it was missiles mostly—missiles would hit really close to wherever we were, and we had shrapnel hit a building, for example, that we were in.

I went, actually, with the USAID administrator—this was a bit later, actually, in the war, but—to Odessa. We had a meeting in a building one day, and then it was attacked and bombed the next day and destroyed. And then that was 12 hours or less later. And then, of course, I eventually was able to move into my residence, and we found some shrapnel missile fragments in the yard of the residence. And yeah, so the missiles and then the drones come down everywhere. And then, of course, when air defense is going up to counter that, there's a lot of activity. It's very dynamic in the air, and you gotta be somewhere where you can be protected.

Frum: And things fall back to earth. Friendly fire also falls back to Earth.

Brink: Eventually everything falls back to earth. Yeah, gravity works.

Frum: So you mentioned going to Odessa. Now, I think most people watching this will be aware that Ukraine is a large country. They may not understand how large it is in terms of hours and that there is no air travel. Anytime you went anywhere, you had to go by land, and with all the risks.

So tell: How did you move about the country, and what kind of protection did you have as you did?

Brink: Well, of course, going in and out of the country—and I did travel in and out of the country a lot to go back to Washington to make the case on the hill or with the administration—to do everything I could to get around the country,

I was the biggest proponent to push for ability and permission, because some of this was controlled initially by Washington, to move around the country so that we could do really important jobs to implement the president's policy and the administration's policy. That includes outreach to people, including people that are suffering from the war, but to also oversee and check on weapons and other assistance that we are giving to Ukraine. And third, to provide advice and support in various ways that we do diplomatically or militarily. So we did all of that—most of that—by train, and the reason was it was the most efficient. The Ukrainian train system is amazing.

I think they've kept their trains on time throughout the war; the trains were used to evacuate people at the beginning of the war. They're used to transport people. Now they're used to transport many different things, probably. I wouldn't want to go into detail, but they're a very effective part of the war effort.

And so I relied on that same thing on the Odessa trip we had, maybe, early on. I think this was in July. Again, this is a very early part of the war, so it was quite—you know, these early moments are really critical to kind of what we do. And I'm a big believer in using American power wisely and using it to shape the environment and shape events and that diplomats are not people who sit back and watch what's going on, but actually shape toward a goal that matches our interests and our values.

So in July, we were trying hard to help get—or keep the economy alive, because Ukraine's economy is really dependent on exports. And the world is also dependent on grain to feed people, especially in food-scarce countries.

And so Ukrainian grain, we were trying to figure out ways to help get it out. And one of them was through the Black Sea ports. But they had been shut down, effectively, by Russian attacks. And so I worked with the Ukrainians and the UN and the G7 partners, and we came up with an idea to go to Odessa and have a G7—that's the Group of 7; that's the main group that supports Ukraine diplomatically—have a G7 meeting down in Odessa to get this Black Sea Grain Initiative going. It was an agreement that would be with the UN and Russia, so I traveled down there. But it was a very hard decision to make.

But we were on our way down, and the train stopped in the middle of the night.

And I probably had a group of—I don't know how many—maybe 20 people, including the security people who were traveling with me. And the train stopped, and I could hear my security guy get a call in the next train cabin. I hear him just say, Yes, yes. He comes back to me, and he says, There's a missile directed. It's going to land somewhere near us, somewhere nearby.

And we're stopped. And I thought, Okay. And at that point, I hoped and I prayed that my team would be okay, and that that decision had been the right one. And then we waited, and that's all you can do is wait. Fifteen minutes, 20 minutes went by, and the train started again. And then we went down.

Frum: Let me ask you about your assessment of the war, as it stands today. We're speaking in the middle of June. At the beginning of June, Ukraine scored one of its most remarkable successes in this war, disabling some number of Russian strategic bombers. I don't know the exact count. You probably do.

It's maybe as high as 40. But it's a big war with many factors. Life for the people of Ukraine—the 40 million people who remain in the country—is very difficult. They're trying to operate schools and old-age pensions and hospitals. Give us a sense of both the military and the economic state as of mid-June 2025.

Brink: Well, I mean, I think one thing's very clear, is that Putin has figured out that he can show—or pretend, I would say—that he's ready to negotiate while he continues to fight on the ground and to try to gain more territory and change facts and conditions on the ground. I think that's a mistake for us to allow that.

I think the situation for the Ukrainians is: The Ukrainians continue to fight. And I think they will continue to fight until they can't in any way, shape, or form. And so I think that in this situation, we face an ongoing, continuing war, and one that risks a greater war by not putting more force and pressure on Putin to come to the table. The Ukrainians did have a very, I'd say, successful attack on Russian military assets last weekend. And I think that that was something that they had—I was not aware of this plan—but that is something they had, I heard, in the planning for a long time.

But I just want everyone to remember that this is in defense [that] the Ukrainians hit military assets. The Russians also, in the last week or so, have launched hundreds of drones and missiles across the country of Ukraine that have killed many civilians, including children. And this is happening and has been happening throughout the war.

Frum: As I listen to you speak, I hope this comes out the right way, because I don't mean this in any way a disrespectful or querulous point. But I notice you're arguing with a lot of things that you would think no rational person would propose in the first place.

You're arguing that Russia is the aggressor, not Ukraine. You are arguing that the defense of this embattled, invaded democracy is something that Americans should care about. You sound a little bit like someone who's been on the receiving end of arguments with the most anti-democratic, anti-social, anti-American people you can possibly imagine over the past number of months. And that is the judo pose in which you are ready to spring into action.

Am I hearing the reverberation of six months of discussions against people who would say things like, Well, maybe Ukraine's at fault. Maybe this isn't important?

Brink: Well, I mean, of course, you've heard what the administration and what the president's position has been, you know, to be some kind of independent—or, yeah, like, independent mediator.

I strongly disagree that that is a position that is good for U.S. interest. In the small sense, and this is really important for Ukraine, it's really vital that we don't allow Putin as an aggressor to just change borders by force, because this sets a terrible precedent here. It sets a terrible precedent in other places around the world.

But I think what I want to say is that, more strategically, I think Putin's goals are much bigger. I don't think it's just Ukraine. I think people who think that, Oh, Putin will stop at Ukraine, that's not my experience in 28 years working in this part of the world. Putin doesn't stop unless stopped, unless given clear positioning that we and partners will oppose a specific direction. I believe he's going to keep going. I think it's clear to me that he wants to reverse Ukraine's path toward not just the EU, which is where this all started, but also to NATO, to weaken NATO, to divide Europe, and to weaken the United States.

And to me, we need a policy that is strategic in the sense of framing what our actions are to achieve the goal, which I think should be to stop Putin from being successful in this attempt.

Frum: But you've spent a lot of time arguing things that one would've thought were settled, like this war is Russia's fault, not Ukraine's fault.

Brink: Yes. I mean, the challenge in the current moment—well, maybe two things I would say. One, I think what's at risk now is so much bigger than just Ukraine. I think Ukraine is—I care very deeply. I spent three years of my life in a war zone trying to protect my team but also advance our goals of keeping Ukraine free.

But I think even more broadly than that, what's at risk is the peace and prosperity that we have enjoyed for 80 years since World War II—because we have relied on some fundamental principles, including, especially: We, the United States, support democracy and freedom at home and abroad. We, the United States, believe that it's important to work with our friends and allies. We, the United States, think that we need to stop aggressors from achieving their goals and compete with China.

I think people don't maybe think about it in this sense, but I think about how undermining some of these principles is risky. It's risky for us. It's risky for our children and future generations because we're taking away some of the foundation of what has built our own prosperity, what has built our own success as a nation.

Frum: I suppose where I'm going with this is: Every major conflict, there are many, many choices. They're all very difficult. If the questions weren't difficult, they wouldn't be at your level in the first place. And the way we think the United States government operates is: people of good faith and unquestioned patriotism and commitment to shared values, dealing with hard issues of what's the right way to go, dealing with un terrible uncertainty and lack of information and trying to come to some kind of balance.

And certainly, in the first years you were in Ukraine, there were many of those discussions, and my opinion: And a lot of them went the wrong way. The United States was late to give Ukraine the things it needed and the chance to score more-decisive gains in the summer of 2023.

Maybe it wasn't ever there, but if it was there, it wasn't seized. But as I listen to you, I hear the reverberations of something that sounds like some kind of cheesy, paranoid Cold War novel—where back home, in Washington, there are important voices that aren't people of good faith, aren't imbued with shared patriotic values, don't stand up for democracy and actually want to see our friends lose, not our friends win.

Brink: Well, I think the challenge we have now with—well, what happened with me is pretty simple, is that for 28 years, I felt very strongly that I could and I was able to offer my opinion and my advice about what's the best course for foreign policy. In our business, you sometimes prevail in that effort, and sometimes you don't. And sometimes because I did it for so long and worked in an area that was in a similar area, I had the ability to come back to issues sometimes and then prevail in a different administration.

For example, when I worked before in Washington, I was part of the group that helped to give Ukraine—or make a recommendation that the then-President Trump, in the first administration, gave weapons to Ukraine, defensive weapons. Those weapons helped to save Kyiv. But now, coming back in the second administration, here's what happened. Every day I woke up, and I was told I might be fired, so I should be careful what I say and what I do. That's fine in terms of: We all serve at the pleasure of the president. That's the way the system works for ambassadors.

But what has happened under an administration with President Trump with such dramatic changes, for example, destroying and changing institutions, like USAID or Department of Education or other institutions, is that what happens with the bureaucracy is: The bureaucracy becomes not a strong advocate of whatever is the recommended approach. What we do as career people is that we make recommendations and then ultimately, of course, it's the leadership—it's the elected leadership and the president—who decides.

In my experience in this Trump administration, there was no space to make recommendations if they conflicted with whatever was the, I think, perceived view of the president. That's highly problematic. I can tell you many times during the Biden administration, I am sure I annoyed or aggravated people because I was so persistent, but I felt it was my duty and my job in my views, and I never—of course, I would implement, once a decision was made, whatever was required or decided—but I never felt that I was at risk of being fired or that I would, by annoying people, was going to be problematic for me personally.

And I believe sincerely that—even though, again, I'm sure in many times, I thought we should be doing something else; you don't get to win every argument—but what you need is a structured policy approach so that you can make the case, and so you can come to a decision, and so you can know the facts.

I need that as ambassador. The president needs that as president, and that's what doesn't exist. Moreover, this fear makes people not want to give their opinion, and so in that period, I said my view was that this is the most important diplomatic job on the planet. I've gotta do it in a way where I'm not fearful. I have to do it in the best way that I can. And then when I couldn't, that's why I left.

Frum: Can I press you to be more specific? Who had the job of advising you that you might be fired?

Brink: Well, I would say this is more the career folks that are literally, I think, pulling their punches and scared.

Frum: To whom do you report as ambassador to Ukraine? I mean, ultimately, the secretary of state, but who's your immediate report? To whom do you address your cables when you send them home?

Brink: Well, you report to the secretary of state, and you report to your chain of command, which goes through the secretary of state and then to the White House. But your day-to-day interactions are, in many cases, with career officials who are in very senior positions in the department.

Frum: Undersecretaries and so on. And so is that the person who would say, You might be fired if you say this thing in your cable?

Brink: Oh, it was many people. It was people in Washington. It was people on my team. It was many people.

Frum: Did you talk to—I mean, Secretary Rubio, who was once a friend of Ukraine, once an advocate of traditional American leadership, and who seems to be making his own calculations, did he ever communicate to you, You're going too far. You're in danger?

Brink: No, he did not.

Frum: Wasn't that his job?

Brink: Well, I don't know if that was true or not. I think a lot of it, I mean, I heard and respected. I always want to hear divergent views. And I heard that, but it didn't change what I did. I still believed that I had to do it a certain way. And I want to hear when people think—I need my advisers or I need people in Washington to give me a steer on which way to go. And I want to keep—as a person of the career service, you can't step out and have your own policy. You have to keep within the policy lines.

But at the same time, it was very hard to have a policy that had been very clear about who's to blame—who's responsible, what's happening on the ground that children are being killed, that people are losing their lives and their homes, and this is happening today, right now—and not be able to speak about that publicly. But it was my job to continue to try.

So that didn't deter me from trying to do the job, but it made it—it really underscores to me what worries me. Because having institutions that are strong, they need to execute policy as decided by the president. But you need institutions that can offer advice and guidance so that the president can make the best decision. And that is a structure that exists and has existed in every administration. And some are not so great and some are better, but there's always been the structure.

Frum: That's assuming that the president wants to make decisions in the best interest of the country, meaning this country. Sometimes you may have a president who wants to make the decisions in the best interest of some other country, and then you have a real problem.

But let me ask you: If there were someone in your shoes but one stage, one train car, back in her career and was considering the next step on the train car, how would you advise that person one train car back to think about service to this president and this administration? You're a person of normal American patriotism. You're being invited to do something for this administration. We've seen how it has sucked the soul out of some of the people who had those, like the secretary of state, once a normal American. How would you advise them to think about whether it's wise or not to serve, or whether they should wait for another moment?

Brink: Well, what I've always told people, now and before—because I've had to mentor and lead a lot of younger officers, and I've had myself fantastic mentors and leaders above me who have really shaped me and helped me—is that our job is to give the best advice and to fight very hard to relay that advice in the best way possible to our elected leadership as career people, and that if, at the end of the day, you feel you can't execute the policy that has been decided, you have some options.

The first option is: There's lots of places in the world that you can serve, and you can go, probably, find someplace or something that aligns with your own values. You can do that. Second option: You can go into our training cadre, which is really important to train the diplomats of the future. And I think and hope those diplomats will be very active, because I think this is very important. We are the frontline of freedom, as diplomats, in the area of Europe in which I worked.

And then the third is you can decide that your conscience doesn't allow you to execute, and you can resign. And I always said it's important to work and do everything possible to serve our country and do the best that you can. But if you come to that point, you have to make that decision. And I believed, and I've always said, you should work as if it's your last day in government and think about everything you do, especially in places that are such high stakes as Ukraine, as if you're not going to have a job tomorrow.

It's really hard to do that, but that's my advice.

Frum: Let me interrupt you there just to say: What you're describing is a thinking process that one might have had in January of 2025, when it was uncertain what the second Trump administration would look like. In June of 2025, we know exactly what the second Trump administration is going to look like.

So if you are someone who's offered to be ambassador to one of the countries that Trump doesn't like or one of the countries that Trump likes a lot, you know what it's going to be. You don't have to do that three-part assessment you just described. You know the answer already. So knowing the answer of what this administration is like, how do you advise then? Because obviously, the business of government has to be carried on. If someone is offered a job as ambassador to Ukraine, how should they think about that?

Brink: I think that has to be an individual decision. I think being ambassador is one thing. You're the public face of the policy, and so you really have to make that decision individually. I think for the staff and the younger officers, it's extraordinarily important that we have this career service, and it's extraordinarily important that they serve and provide the knowledge and recommendations and active diplomacy that makes us like the tip of the spear of our government overseas. So I just think that has to be a decision of individuals, and they have to make it with their own conscience.

Frum: Well, let me ask you this way: When and if President Trump appoints new people to run Ukraine policy, he's got a special representative who's in charge of negotiating, who seems very in thrall to the Russian point of view, whose son is operating a crypto business that is getting money from God knows who and God knows where. How do we as citizens evaluate the people who are making these policies supposedly in the interest, in name of the United States?

Brink: I think it's a mistake not to rely on people with expertise in the area. I think it's a big mistake, especially in Russia. Putin has a larger strategic plan, which is very dangerous to the United States, and we ignore that plan at our peril.

And although he operates tactically, so he can be defeated. But I think it requires a very thoughtful, strategic, coordinated approach, and that's something that in the second Trump administration, my challenge had been getting advice to the right person, because there are a number of different people who are working on Ukraine and on Russia policy. And in that bifurcated way, it was very difficult to get advice.

And when I asked, How I best relay advice and information? I was told I had to go to a multiple number of people across our government in order to affect the policy because there wasn't, as I said, a policy process, a decision-making process. And my problem was: I was in a war zone.

I was really busy. I did not have time to call individual people to try to make the case for a specific policy recommendation. And I think that's something that can still be put in place. But that was and is a big part of the problem. It's the chaos of the policy process, which: I don't know why that's the operating style, but it is not conducive to our ability to execute and implement a strategic foreign policy that deters Russia, sends the right signal to China, and advances American interest for Americans here at home.

Frum: So you're saying that it's kind of a secret hierarchy, where, theoretically, the secretary of state is in charge, but, actually, the president of the Kennedy Center is a lot more important than the secretary of state to American foreign policy.

And that's not a hypothetical example. That may be a very real one.

Brink: I think the challenge I had was that I didn't know who was—I could, of course, talk to some people within the administration who I thought genuinely understood the challenge of Ukraine and how to approach it. I did not sense that there was an ability to inform the president in a way that would help us advance our policy.

And that's an untenable position for an ambassador, an ambassador in a war zone, an ambassador has a thousand people to protect and make sure are safe, and that is trying to accomplish one of our top foreign-policy goals.

Frum: Let me ask one final question: As you departed from Ukraine, when the Ukrainians in the summer of 2025 look back toward the United States, the country that gave them some if maybe not enough aid at the beginning of the war, what do they see now? And what do they think of Americans?

Brink: Well, maybe I'll tell you a story of my last few days, when I was in Ukraine and met with a very senior official. It was one of my last calls. Basically, he showed me what he said had been presented to the Ukrainians as a possible way forward in terms of a peace negotiation.

That paper, which I won't go into detail of, included what I would say Putin's wish list of everything that he wants. And he looked at me and he said, You are our closest strategic partner. That's all he said. And I had nothing I could say, because I myself, as someone who dedicated a big part of my life to supporting freedom and democracy in Ukraine and in the wider European space for the benefit of Americans, I had nothing to say either.

Frum: They feel that the United States is lost to them.

Brink: I don't think they understand. I don't think I understand, or many of us who are experts and long patriots and public servants understand.

Frum: Is it that we don't understand, or that we do understand and our hearts can't accept the answer?

Brink: I think it's a different administration, and it's a threat to our future, and that's why I've come out. That's why I left. That's why I'm speaking publicly. I think it's bad for America to be where we are. It's not who we are. And I just—we have to be on the right side of history. There are very few pivotal moments in history. And as someone who has now done this for 28 years, I think it's vital that we stand on the right side.

Frum: Ambassador Brink, thank you so much for your time today. Good luck with the book. I look forward so much to reading it as you work on it. And good luck to—I know you have some important personal decisions to make and career decisions to make about what comes next for you. And we're all watching those with keen interest, and we all hope that your service to the United States has not ended and that the United States that you believed in has not ended either.

Brink: I don't think it has. I'm sure it hasn't. Thank you. Thank you, David.

It cuts taxes, slashes the safety net, funds deportations, harms the clean energy industry, and sends the debt soaring.

Republicans are close to passing President Donald Trump's so-called One Big Beautiful Bill, which will cut taxes, slash programs for low-income Americans, ramp up funding for mass deportation, and penalize the solar and wind energy industries.

Oh, and it adds enormously to the nation's debt — but who's counting? (Independent analysts are, and they estimate it will add at least $3 trillion.)

The sprawling, 887-page bill contains far too many provisions to name here. But to get a better sense of the bill's impact, it's worth running down what it does in a few key areas. 

The big picture, though, is that Trump is targeting Democratic or liberal-coded programs and constituencies — programs for the poor, student borrowers, and climate change — to cover part (but nowhere near all) of the cost of his big tax cuts and new spending.

The bill makes a variety of changes to tax law, some of which are about keeping tax breaks set to expire soon, others of which are adding new goodies in the tax code.

1) Making the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent: In Trump's first term, Republicans lowered income and other tax rates with his 2017 tax law. However, in a gimmick to make that law look less costly, the new lower rates they set were scheduled to expire at the end of 2025 — meaning that, if Congress did nothing, practically everyone's taxes would go up next year.

So the single most consequential thing this bill does, from a budgetary perspective, is making those 2017 tax levels permanent, averting their imminent expiration. 

That saves Americans from an imminent tax hike, but notably, it just keeps the status quo tax levels in place. So, in practice, many people may not perceive this as a new cut to their taxes.

2) New “populist” tax cuts: The bill also creates several new tax breaks meant to fulfill certain Trump 2024 campaign promises, such as “no tax on tips.” There will be new deductions for up to $25,000 in tip income, $12,500 in overtime income, $6,000 for seniors, and a deduction for interest on loans for new US-made cars. The bill also creates savings accounts for children called “Trump accounts,” in which the government would invest $1,000 per child.

3) Tax cuts for the wealthy and businesses: Wealthy Americans wanting to pay less in taxes have the most to be happy about from this bill, because they benefit hugely from making the 2017 Trump tax cuts permanent. 

Other wealthy winners in the bill include owners of “pass-through” businesses (partnerships, LLCs, or other business entities that don't pay the typical corporate income tax); they get their tax cuts in Trump's 2017 bill made permanent. Some wealthy heirs stand to gain too, as the exemption from the estate tax was raised to inherited estates worth $15 million).

Affluent blue state residents got a big win. The 2017 Trump tax law had sharply limited a deduction that typically benefited them — the state and local (SALT) deduction, which it capped at $10,000. (People in blue states tend to have more state and local taxes they can deduct.) The new bill raises that limit to $40,000.

Businesses also get some big benefits, as the bill makes three major corporate tax breaks permanent: bonus depreciation, research and development expensing, and a tax break related to interest deduction. 

All this, combined with the cuts for programs for poor people, is why many analysts calculate the impact this bill would be regressive overall — it will end up financially harming low-income Americans, and benefiting the rich the most.

Trump has repeatedly promised that he wouldn't cut Medicaid, and this bill breaks that promise bigly. Its new work reporting requirements and other changes (such as a limit to the “provider tax” states may charge) could end up cutting Medicaid spending by as much as 18 percent. The bill also makes changes to the Affordable Care Act individual insurance marketplaces. Altogether, these provisions would result in 12 million people losing their health insurance, per the Congressional Budget Office.

Food stamps are another target. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) could be cut by as much as 20 percent, due to new work requirements and new requirements states pay a higher share of the program's cost. One bizarre last-minute provision, aimed at winning over swing vote Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), seemingly gives states an incentive to make erroneous payments, because states with higher payment error rates get to delay their cost hikes.

Student loans also come in for deep cuts, as the bill overhauls the existing system, ending many repayment plans, requiring borrowers to repay more, and limiting future loan availability. 

Three years ago, with the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats enacted a swath of new incentives aimed at making the US a clean energy powerhouse. Trump's new bill moves in the exact opposite direction. It repeals many of Biden's clean energy benefits, but it doesn't stop there – it goes further by singling out clean energy, particularly solar and wind, for harsh treatment.

Under the bill, new Biden-era tax credits for electric vehicles and energy efficiency will be terminated this year. Biden's clean electricity production tax credits, meanwhile, will be gradually rolled back, though solar and wind will see their credits vanish more quickly. The bill also requires clean power projects to start using fewer and fewer Chinese-made components, which much of the industry heavily relies on. 

Things could be worse, though. A recent draft of the bill included far harsher policies toward solar and wind, which could have had truly apocalyptic consequences for the industry — but some of them were dropped or watered down to get the bill through the Senate.

Counterbalancing some of these spending cuts on the safety net and clean energy, Trump's bill also spends a bunch more money on two of his own top priorities: immigration enforcement in the military.

About $175 billion will be devoted to immigration, including roughly $50 billion for Trump's border wall and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, $45 billion for expanding the capacity to detain unauthorized immigrants, and $30 billion for enforcement operations. This is a lot of money that will now be devoted to Trump's “mass deportation” agenda, and the question will now be whether they can put it to use.

The military, meanwhile, will get about $150 billion from the bill, to be used to start construction on Trump's planned “Golden Dome” missile defense shield, as well as on shipbuilding, munitions, and other military priorities.

In the end, Trump's spending cuts were nowhere near enough to balance out the enormous cost of the tax cuts in this bill. So, estimates suggest, at least $3 trillion more will be added to the debt if this bill becomes law.

Every president this century has come in with big deficit-increasing bills, dismissing concerns about the debt, and the sky hasn't yet fallen. But all these years of big spending are adding up, and interest payments on the debt are rising. This could make for a significant drag on the economy in future years and make even more painful cuts necessary.

Republicans are betting that the tax cuts in this bill will juice business and economic activity enough to keep the country happy in the short term — and that the cuts, targeting mainly low-income people or Democratic constituencies, are unlikely to hurt them too much at the ballot box.

The budget bill sabotages one of the biggest growth sectors of the US economy.

The first solar cell ever made was built in the United States. Tesla, based in the US, was once the largest EV manufacturer in the world. The lithium-ion battery was codeveloped in the US.

But today, China — not the US — is the largest manufacturer of solar cells and batteries. China's BYD — not Tesla — is the largest EV manufacturer in the world. And China is starting to outrun the US on research and development investment. 

The US has a long history of taking the lead in clean energy, and a long history of losing it. And President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” which passed the Senate on Tuesday, would again leave the US on the margins of a global clean energy revolution that it could have dominated. 

For years now, clean power has been the largest source of new electricity in the US. Solar, batteries, and wind are on track to make up more than 90 percent of new electricity capacity on the US power grid this year. Wind and solar now produce more electricity on the US power grid than coal. Almost twice as many Americans work in clean energy compared to fossil fuels, and the sector is still growing. 

But thanks to the bill, that may not be the case for much longer. 

Some of the more extreme provisions in earlier drafts of the bill have been removed, like an excise tax targeting renewable energy. But the latest version of the bill rolls back many of the investments from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the single-largest US investment to address climate change by giving the energy transition a boost. It calls for more rapid phaseouts of tax credits for wind and solar power and eliminates a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of a new electric vehicle. The spending bill working its way through Congress doesn't just undo incentives for clean energy — it also creates a new tax credit for coal. 

These provisions are in line with Trump's longstanding antipathy toward renewable energy and disbelief in climate change. But they stand to hobble the US economy more broadly. 

The US is facing significant load growth on the power grid for the first time in decades as the tech industry scrounges for electrons to power their electricity-devouring data centers. Energy demand is rising and the cheapest, most readily deployable supplies of energy are being throttled. 

The alternatives, however, are not likely to make up the gap in time. Fossil fuels take longer to ramp up. The US is currently the largest oil and gas producer in the world, but it can take years to site, permit, and acquire the materials to build power plants that burn these fuels. Since these are internationally traded commodities, their prices can fluctuate based on factors beyond the US's control. 

Right now, oil prices are at four-year lows and natural gas prices are falling, and when prices are low, it's much harder to make the business case for more mining, drilling, and power plants, even with incentives. Trump may have some levers to pull — he can, for example, open up more federally managed lands for energy production — but many of those leases sit unused because energy companies don't want to create a supply glut. Meanwhile, employment in the oil and gas industry remains volatile, while coal jobs are continuing their decades-long decline. 

“We're in this moment of surging demand and you can't build another gas turbine for at least five years beyond what's already been booked,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director for modeling and analysis at the think tank Energy Innovation. “We have this demand growth that's going to have to be met. The only thing you can build to meet it on the timeline needed over the next five to 10 years is solar, wind, or battery storage.”

The Senate bill does extend tax credits and loan programs for nuclear energy and geothermal power. However, the cuts in the bill would also slow efforts to build up the domestic energy supply chain needed to bolster other zero-emissions technologies, from raw materials like lithium and rare earth minerals to battery factories. It would do little to relax the bottlenecks for connecting new power plants to the grid, which are adding years to project timelines. The US is also dismantling research and development that could yield the next energy breakthrough. On top of all this, Trump's tariffs are raising operating costs not just for renewables, but also for the fossil fuels he loves so much.

The net result is a policy suite that will not only hamper clean electricity, but energy overall, making it more expensive for everyone across the country. According to Energy Innovation, the Senate bill would reduce how much energy the US adds to the grid in the years to come compared to the current trajectory, thereby increasing household electricity prices on average by $130 per year, eroding almost a trillion dollars in economic productivity, and costing 760,000 jobs by 2030. 

While the US is putting clean energy in reverse, other countries are racing ahead. Clean energy technology investment is poised to increase to $2.2 trillion this year around the world. Renewables are on track to overtake coal as the biggest power source in the world this year. Wind, solar, and batteries are still getting cheaper. Effectively, the US is ceding one of the biggest growth industries in the world to China, particularly as developing countries industrialize and other wealthy countries look to decarbonize their economies. 

The case for more clean energy — lower costs, faster deployment, fewer greenhouse gas emissions — remains robust. Even with all the deliberate obstacles the Trump administration is placing ahead, there are some wind, solar, and battery projects still poised to come online in the US as they work their way through the pipeline, albeit at a much slower pace than before. 

But without continued investment, the US will lose ground to the rest of the world and condemn itself to dirtier, more expensive energy while worsening a problem that will extract a dear toll from the economy.

Microsoft is cutting more workers in another major round of layoffs at the company this year.

The company said it is making cuts affecting less than 4% of its total workforce. That would be around 9,000 employees based on its head count of around 220,000 employees.

Multiple employees confirmed to Business Insider that the layoffs have begun. One affected employee said they have until July 8 to sign a severance agreement, after which they'll receive 60 days of paid leave.

""We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told BI in a statement.

The spokesperson said the company is focused on reducing layers with fewer managers and streamlining processes, products, procedures, and roles to become more efficient.

A current employee told BI that cuts to the sales organization were expected after the company said it would consolidate sales ""solutions areas."" BI previously reported on the internal slides that detail those changes.

The latest cuts come months after Microsoft in May announced layoffs affecting about 6,000 workers.

Executives previously told BI that those layoffs were intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders to non-coders on projects as Microsoft aimed to grow its ""span of control,"" or the number of employees who report to each manager. But those cuts also ended up including many individual-contributor-level engineers. A spokesperson told BI at the time that those cuts were not performance-driven.

It's not just Microsoft. Many of its Big Tech peers are making similar cuts to flatten management levels and become leaner in the name of efficiency.

Google recently cut vice president and manager roles by 10%. Amazon has been working on increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers.

Besides managers, Microsoft and Meta have also recently cracked down on workers they deemed ""low performers.""

If you ever happen to see Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT at OpenAI, muttering to himself on a weekday morning, it might be because he's talking to a chatbot.

Turley said that ChatGPT's voice feature is his favorite tip for using the technology on a recent episode of the OpenAI podcast.

""On my way to work, I'll use it to process my own thoughts. With some luck, and I think this works most days, I'll have the restructured list of to-dos by the time I actually get there,"" he said, adding that the voice feature isn't yet mainstream because there are a bunch of small ""kinks"" still. He said he finds it valuable to force himself to articulate his thoughts aloud, and wants to see the feature improve next year.

Mark Chen, OpenAI's chief research officer, said on the podcast that he's a fan of the deep research feature, especially before an introduction.

""When I go meet someone new, when I'm going to talk to someone about AI, I just preflight topics,"" Chen said. ""I think the model can do a really good job of contextualizing who I am, who I'm about to meet, and what things we might find interesting.""

And podcast host Andrew Mayne, who was formerly OpenAI's science communicator and worked on ChatGPT, said he uses the technology when he's out at a restaurant.

""I take a photograph of a menu and I'm like, 'Help me plan a meal or whatever, I'm trying to stick to a diet,"" Mayne said.

Turley, however, cautioned against using the same trick for the wine list. ""It keeps embarrassing me with hallucinated wine recommendations, and I go order it and they're like, 'Never heard of this one,'"" he said.

Corporate executives across companies are using AI in their daily lives, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is no different. Altman said on the ""ReThinking"" podcast in January that he uses it in ""the boring ways,"" for things like processing emails and summarizing documents.

When Altman spoke on the OpenAI podcast in June, he said that he uses ChatGPT ""constantly"" as a father. At the time, he said he was mainly using it to research developmental stages.

""Clearly, people have been able to take care of babies without ChatGPT for a long time,"" Altman said. ""I don't know how I would have done that.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Amazon rolls out a stricter performance review process — with culture as a key metric","https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-stricter-performance-review-process-leadership-principles-2025-7","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 15:40:00 GMT","

Amazon is leaning harder on its ""Leadership Principles"" to rate employee performance, as CEO Andy Jassy continues to create a more disciplined workforce at the tech company.

Starting this quarter's mid-year review cycle, Amazon managers will use a three-tiered system to evaluate how effectively corporate employees demonstrate the company's core values in their work, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider.

Although the Leadership Principles have long been central to Amazon's culture and considered in performance reviews, this is the first time they've been formally embedded into the evaluation process. Amazon relies on its 16 LPs, which stress things like customer focus and cost discipline, to guide nearly all business decisions.

As part of this shift, Amazon is streamlining the rating scales for the other two evaluation criteria (""performance"" and ""potential""). Together with how employees use LPs, these factors determine an Overall Value (OV) score for each corporate employee, which influences future raises and whether they may be placed on a performance improvement plan.

The internal guideline said the changes will ""improve our ability to identify top talent and further strengthen our culture."" It added that only 5% of the employees will be eligible for the top ""role model"" grade when measuring their LP behavior.

""By making Leadership Principles a formal input to Overall Value ratings and increasing the granularity of the input rating combinations, the updated process helps us strengthen the connection between performance and culture,"" the guideline added.

The move is part of a wider wave among tech giants to rethink how they manage performance and reward employees. Microsoft has a new 2-year rehire ban on ousted underperforming employees. Both Google and Meta have also made policy changes that better reward high performers this year.

The initiative demonstrates Jassy's ongoing commitment to cultivating a more rigorous workforce and a more cohesive corporate culture.

In the past year, Jassy has enforced a full return-to-office policy, reduced management layers, and updated its pay model to better reward top talent. Last year, he also shared a video series explaining each LP, and recently warned that AI will reduce Amazon's workforce because of efficiency gains.

Amazon's spokesperson Sam Stephenson told BI that the company regularly reviews its performance review process to ""ensure it best supports the growth and development of our employees.""

""Our unique culture, which is rooted in our Leadership Principles, drives the innovation we deliver for customers each day,"" Stephenson said. ""These changes streamline the process for managers and help to ensure greater consistency.""

Amazon's performance review policy has long been controversial.

Some employees have cited concerns over limited oversight and the potential for misuse, with one former employee describing the system as ""predatory and opaque."" Some people have also criticized Amazon's cutthroat ""stack-ranking"" culture, in which a fixed percentage of the workforce is replaced every year.

Amazon managers group their employees in five broad buckets of performance tiers: Top Tier (TT), Highly Valued 3 (HV3), Highly Valued 2 (HV2), Highly Valued 1 (HV1), and Least Effective (LE). Teams with more than 50 employees should categorize 20% as TT, 15% as HV3, 25% as HV2, 35% as HV1, and 5% as LE, the internal guideline said.

Amazon seems to recognize the nuanced nature of performance evaluations. The internal guideline urges managers to dedicate sufficient time to reviewing each employee to ensure accurate assessments.

""Evaluating employees is a high-judgment decision,"" the guideline said. ""You should invest sufficient time in gathering comprehensive and objective feedback to ensure accuracy and minimize unconscious bias.""

Summer internships: where ambition and imposter syndrome so often collide.

At KPMG, the tiny fraction of applicants who landed a coveted place on its program are now working to secure a full-time job post-graduation.

A summer internship at a Big Four professional services firm is as competitive as it is prestigious. For most interns, the two-month KPMG internship comes after more than 18 months of applications, networking, and building up their resumé. Just 2,200 of more than 42,000 applicants made the cut this year.

Business Insider asked KPMG partners, including its head of talent, how they should impress in an office of busy people, new AI-enabled ways of working, and tight competition.

""You are in a job interview for the whole internship,"" Wendy Lewis, managing partner of KPMG's Richmond, Virginia office, told BI at the company's purpose-built Lakehouse in Florida, where around 225 interns gathered in June for four days of inductions and training.

Interns often have a misconception that they only need to be technically impressive, but soft skills are equally important, Lewis said.

She told BI she's interested in whether interns can communicate well, take initiative, and demonstrate their eagerness to learn.

Leaders aren't expecting interns to conduct audits themselves, Lewis added — attitude makes them stand out.

Jason LaRue, KPMG's national talent & culture lead, also emphasized the importance of attitude. LaRue told BI that an intern should be ""a great learner.""

He said that requires transitioning from classroom learning to an environment where you learn on the job with colleagues. ""You have to make that shift from one mindset to the other,"" he added.

KPMG interns start that transition at the firm's Lakehouse, where they attend training sessions and can unwind with mini-golf and karaoke alongside partners and their peers, before returning to work in KPMG offices around the country.

""The people who really stand out and are the ones who are sponges. They're looking to be able to build new skills all the time to give themselves that extra advantage,"" LaRue said.

Becky Sproul, the talent and culture leader for KPMG's audit division, said interns should show curiosity, especially amid rapid change in the industry.

The Big Four are restructuring as they try to recover from a recent slowdown in demand for consulting, while also trying to anticipate how AI will change the world of work and their business models.

Sproul described the industry's rapid pace of change as ""the new world order."" In that kind of environment, continuous learning and agility are important traits, she said.

Rema Serafi, KPMG's vice chair of tax, said interns should show curiosity about the firm's business model and take advantage of its tech tools. Show that you're ""interested in what we do as a business,"" she said.

She said some Gen Zers now entering the workforce are already knowledgeable about generative AI and automation.

""Ideas are welcome,"" Serafi said, adding that she wanted to know how interns thought KPMG could enhance its use of generative AI.

BI spoke to two KPMG interns at the Lakehouse who said they were worried about impostor syndrome.

""I've talked to interns about this too, not just at KPMG but also my friends interning at other companies, and impostor syndrome comes up a lot,"" said Andre Gaviola, a 21-year-old audit intern, adding it could feel intimidating to be around so many older, more experienced people.

Evelyn Nunez-Alfaro, a 22-year-old tax intern, told BI that, though she loved stepping outside her comfort zone, she has wondered, ""Am I really supposed to be here?""

""Deep down, usually we all feel the same. We're a little nervous, we're a little scared, and don't want to ask the wrong question or seem like we don't know,"" Nunez-Alfaro said.

LaRue told BI he advised interns to find support figures in their workplace who can coach them through moments of imposter syndrome and sponsor them as they progress in their careers.

At a Q&A at the Lakehouse, one intern asked partners what advice they had for managing impostor syndrome.

Lewis told the interns to build up their self-confidence and realize that they can be themselves and still be successful.

Tell yourself, ""I am confident. I can do this. I do belong here,"" she said.

Here's a stylized history of US public stock markets. In the olden days, anyone could raise money for a project by selling stock to the public, and lots of people did, often by making false promises. This crested in the 1920s, as people rushed to buy stocks and borrow money to juice their speculative bets. Then there was a crash and a Great Depression. To restore confidence in markets, Congress passed some laws — particularly the Securities Act of 1933 and the Exchange Act of 1934 — to regulate public stock markets. From now on, a company that wanted to sell stock to the general public had to explain its business and publish audited financial statements and disclose important events, so that public investors would know what was going on.

Of course, this only applied to public companies, and there were exceptions for companies that did not raise money from the general public. If your father-in-law gave you some seed money to open a local hardware store, obviously the federal government did not require you to give him audited financial statements. Over time, these exceptions grew in importance. In the 1920s, the best way to raise a lot of money for a business was to sell your stock broadly, on the stock exchange, to thousands of individual investors who wanted to buy it. In the 2020s, the best way to raise a lot of money for a business is often to call up one guy, Masayoshi Son at SoftBank Group Corp., and ask him for $10 billion. He will probably say yes, and then you will have $10 billion, and you won't need to sell stock to the general public or file financial statements or anything like that.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg'}","business"

In this article

Intel's new chief executive is exploring a big change to its contract manufacturing business to win major customers, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a potentially expensive shift from his predecessor's plans.

If implemented, the new strategy for what Intel calls its ""foundry"" business would entail no longer marketing certain chipmaking technology, which the company had long developed, to external customers, the people said.

Since taking the company's helm in March, CEO Lip-Bu Tan has moved fast to cut costs and find a new path to revive the ailing U.S. chipmaker. By June, he started voicing that a manufacturing process that prior CEO Pat Gelsinger bet heavily on, known as 18A, was losing its appeal to new customers, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

To put aside external sales of 18A and its variant 18A-P, manufacturing processes that have cost Intel billions of dollars to develop, the company would have to take a write-off, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Industry analysts contacted by Reuters said such a charge could amount to a loss of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars.

Intel declined to comment on such ""hypothetical scenarios or market speculation."" It said the lead customer for 18A has long been Intel itself, and it aims to ramp production of its ""Panther Lake"" laptop chips later in 2025, which it called the most advanced processors ever designed and manufactured in the United States.

Persuading outside clients to use Intel's factories remains key to its future. As its 18A fabrication process faced delays, rival TSMC's N2 technology has been on track for production.

Tan's preliminary answer to this challenge: focus more resources on 14A, a next-generation chipmaking process where Intel expects to have advantages over Taiwan's TSMC, the two sources said. The move is part of a play for big customers like Apple and Nvidia, which currently pay TSMC to manufacture their chips.

Tan has tasked the company with teeing up options for discussion with Intel's board when it meets as early as this month, including whether to stop marketing 18A to new clients, one of the two sources said. The board might not reach a decision on 18A until a subsequent autumn meeting in light of the matter's complexity and the enormous money at stake, the person said.

Intel declined to comment on what it called rumor. In a statement, it said: ""Lip-Bu and the executive team are committed to strengthening our roadmap, building trust with our customers, and improving our financial position for the future. We have identified clear areas of focus and will take actions needed to turn the business around.""

Last year was Intel's first unprofitable year since 1986. It posted a net loss attributable to the company of $18.8 billion for 2024.

The Intel chief executive's deliberations show the enormous risks - and costs - under consideration to move the storied U.S. chipmaker back onto solid footing. Like Gelsinger, Tan inherited a company that had lost its manufacturing edge and fell behind on crucial technology waves of the past two decades: mobile computing and artificial intelligence.

The company is targeting high-volume production later this year for 18A with its internal chips, which are widely expected to arrive ahead of external customer orders. Meanwhile, delivering 14A in time to win major contracts is by no means certain, and Intel could choose to stick with its existing plans for 18A, one of the sources said.

Intel is tailoring 14A to key clients' needs to make it successful, the company said.

Tan's review of whether to focus clients on 14A involves the contract chipmaking portion of Intel, or foundry, which makes chips for external customers.

Regardless of a board decision, Intel will make chips via 18A in cases where its plans are already in motion, the people familiar with the matter said. This includes using 18A for Intel's in-house chips that it already designed for that manufacturing process, the people said.

Intel also will produce a relatively small volume of chips that it has guaranteed for Amazon.com and Microsoft via 18A, with deadlines that make it unrealistic to wait for the development of 14A.

Amazon and Microsoft did not immediately comment on the matter. Intel said it will deliver on its customer commitments.

Tan's overall strategy for Intel remains nascent. So far, he has updated his leadership team, bringing in new engineering talent, and he has worked to shrink what he considered bloated and slow-moving middle management.

Shifting away from selling 18A to foundry customers would represent one of his biggest moves yet.

The 18A manufacturing process includes a novel method of delivering energy to chips and a new type of transistor. Together, these enhancements were meant to let Intel match or exceed TSMC's capabilities, Intel executives have previously said.

However, according to some industry analysts, the 18A process is roughly equivalent to TSMC's so-called N3 manufacturing technology, which went into high-volume production in late 2022.

If Intel follows Tan's lead, the company would focus its foundry employees, design partners and new customers on 14A, where it hopes for a better chance to compete against TSMC.

Tan has drawn on extensive contacts and customer relationships built over decades in the chip industry to arrive at his view on 18A, the two sources said.

America's Top States for Business 2025 will be revealed July 10 - stay tuned for coverage of this year's rankings

Six months after wind-whipped wildfires killed 30 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in and around Los Angeles, the scenes in Altadena and Pacific Palisades are still horrific, with block after block of burned out homes and businesses. 

But every so often, there are small signs of rebirth, from a property owner cleaning up their lot, or workers repairing a home that was merely damaged. Occasionally, one can even see homes being rebuilt — the owner having navigated the complicated permitting process, and, crucially, having managed to obtain insurance.

""The situation in insurance has actually been remarkably stable, considering everything that happened,"" said Scott Wilk, an independent insurance agent and owner of the Santa Clarita, California, branch of TWFG Insurance.

That is not to say that premiums are not surging after the wildfires. The online marketplace Insurify projects California premiums will rise 21% this year, even in areas that are far from Los Angeles, in what experts had predicted would be a year of only modest increases in the state.

""An event like that in California just has a really significant impact on how much we project premiums to go up,"" said Chase Gardner, data insights manager at Insurify. He added that when insurance companies ""are paying out more than they're bringing in premiums, the more that goes up, the more they need to raise prices.""

In fact, Insurify is projecting premium increases in all 50 states this year, averaging around 8%. California's increase is not even the largest. That distinction belongs to Louisiana, where premiums are projected to rise 28%. Nor is the phenomenon limited to coastal states. Iowa and Minnesota are also looking at double-digit increases.

""It's not just a story for areas like coastal Florida or the wildfire prone parts of California. It's really a much more national story,"" said Benjamin Keys, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ""We're seeing states like Vermont with rising costs related to recent floods. We're seeing states like Colorado, which historically was a middle of the pack state when it came to the cost of insurance, seeing rapidly increasing insurance costs due to recent wildfires, and increased hail storms in many parts of the Midwest.""

Insurance premiums are regulated state by state, so in theory, a company can't use a disaster in one state to justify a rate increase in another. But in practice, experts say, there is a ripple effect as companies try to balance their risk by more aggressively seeking premium increases in some states, and by reducing their exposure in others by not renewing policies.

""These insurance companies are national companies, and this could affect things like their overall book of business,"" Gardner said. ""Even if they're profitable in ten states, if they're really unprofitable in one state, that can impact how they think about business and how they think about acquiring new customers.""

Premiums vary widely from state to state, with Florida's the highest at $15,460 on average as projected by Insurify, though increases in the state appear to have moderated after the state adopted a series of reforms. The lowest average premium is in Vermont at $1,248, despite its recent increases. Even with this year's 21% increase, California's projected average premium of $2,930 is less than Insurify's national projected median premium of $3,520.

That disparity among the states can be a factor in competitiveness. Companies deciding where to locate or expand frequently consider the cost of living for prospective employees. So, CNBC is using Insurify data on premiums and projected increases as components of the Cost of Living category in this year's America's Top States for Business study.

""Home insurance is just becoming a bigger and bigger chunk of people's monthly housing payments,"" Gardner said. ""I think it's kind of really eating into the idea of homeownership being a really stable, cost-capped long term bet, especially if you live in a state like Florida or California, or even Texas.""

Experts expect the increases to continue as storms and other natural disasters become more severe, and home values and replacement costs continue to rise.

Wilk said that while the worst of the crisis in California may be over, there is more sticker shock to come.

""There's a very long process for a rate change to get through. Sometimes it can take between 12 to 36 months,"" he said.

State Farm, the state's largest insurer, which dropped thousands of California policyholders just before the January fires, won state approval in May for a 17% emergency rate hike. But the company had sought a 30% increase, and it has already petitioned state regulators to approve the remaining 13%.

Wilk said that there are still affordable options, relatively speaking, from smaller carriers in California, or from so-called ""non-admitted"" firms that can sell policies to California homeowners independent of the state regulators.

He said that many of his clients are happy just to be able to get insurance.

""Early on in my career, pre-insurance crisis, if I had a customer's rate go up by five bucks a month, I could be hearing about it and hearing complaints about it,"" he said. ""Now, people are just excited when their policy renews and it's still in force.""

In this article

It's the what-could-have-beens that hurt the most. The childhood sweetheart who moved to a different country. The early opportunity to invest in a company designing graphics chips for games. The lower interest rates if not for tariffs.

On Tuesday, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that tariffs — and, specifically, their unexpectedly large ""size"" — are the chief reason the central bank hasn't lowered rates this year since it last cut them in December.

Imagine that. We could have been living in a world where the fed funds rate is at a range of 4% to 4.25%. If inflation was staying obediently below the Fed's 2% goal, the range could even be 3.75% to 4%, given that the central bank in June kept last year's projection of two rate cuts in 2025.

The thought stings. But it might help to think that if U.S. President Donald Trump hadn't slapped tariffs on partners and penguins, his other policies could have similarly pushed inflation forecasts higher.

Remember how all three major U.S. indexes surged and hit new records on Trump's election victory because Wall Street was anticipating tax cuts and looser corporate regulation. Without the dampening effect of tariffs, economic optimism might have spilled over into exuberance and higher inflation.

Better to play the cards we were dealt with than to lapse into imagined futures.

Tariffs are keeping U.S. interest rates high. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday the central bank would have lowered rates this year if not for Trump's tariffs, which caused inflation forecasts to go up ""materially.""

The S&P 500 dips from record. On Tuesday, the index slipped 0.11%. Tesla shares tumbled after Trump suggested DOGE take a look at the company's subsidies. Asia-Pacific markets mostly fell Wednesday, but Singapore stocks hit a record high.

XPeng maintains steady sales in June. The electric car startup delivered 34,611 cars, the eighth straight month of breaking the 30,000 level. BYD remained the market leader, delivering more than 10 times the number of vehicles XPeng did.

Trump's megabill squeaks through the Senate. Vice President JD Vance cast a final, tie-breaking vote that sends the bill back to the U.S. House for approval. While the bill would increase the deficit, some banks think it'll give the U.S. economy a shot in the arm.

[PRO] Hedge funds are betting against the Swiss franc. The move is part of a ""carry trade,"" a strategy in which investors borrow in a currency with a lower interest rate — the franc, in this case — to buy a currency with a higher rate and pocket the difference.

Germany's defense industry is booming. Here's where its weapons are going

The value of German military exports hit 13.2 billion euros ($15.5 billion) last year, according to preliminary figures — more than double 2020′s 5.82 billion euros. Related stocks have also boomed.

Where are the record orders going?

According to the German government's most recent export log, 80% of arms exports were to ""close partner countries"" in the first quarter of 2025.

The crypto market is serving up a classic rotation play as meme coins steal the spotlight from their blue chip cousins.

Global crypto markets posted gains alongside traditional equities following geopolitical easing, with overall market sentiment shifting from fear to greed. Traditional markets are providing strong tailwinds—the S&P 500 inched higher to a fresh record this week, breaking above the psychologically important 6,000 level for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the geopolitical picture has improved dramatically as oil prices fell sharply Tuesday, returning to levels last seen before the Iran-Israel conflict, with Brent crude dropping 6% to $67.14.

As investors feel calm in the markets, and consider putting money on riskier bets, the cryptocurrency market as a whole grew 2.5% today to $3.33 trillion, with 98 of the top 100 coins in the green for the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin's modest 3.59% gain to $109,507 masks the underlying strength in the world's largest cryptocurrency, supported by a bounce after two days of correction, testing the resistance of a bearish channel in play since mid-May. The price action reflects healthy consolidation after the recent surge, giving the market time to digest gains.

Technical indicators paint a cautiously optimistic picture. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Bitcoin is at 60, suggesting BTC has momentum but isn't overheated. You can think of RSI like a temperature gauge where 70+ means the engine is running too hot and might need to cool down. This moderate reading suggests there's enough fuel in the markets for another leg higher.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, provides crucial support below current prices, acting as a safety net that institutions often use to add positions. This indicator measures the average price of an asset for a given period of time. The 200-day EMA sits further below, creating multiple layers of support that would need to break for any serious correction.

However, the Average Directional Index, or ADX, at 12 indicates weak trend strength, which is to be expected considering this small correction happens in the middle of what is a heavily bullish trend in play since at least before the last halving. ADX measures the strength of a trend, regardless of direction.

Key levels: Immediate support at $104,000 (psychological round number), strong support at $96,000 (200-day EMA). Immediate resistance at $112,000 (recent rejection zone), strong resistance at $115,000 (measured breakout target and new ATH zone).

Ethereum's 3.16% rise to $2,559 shows the smart-contract blockchain king refusing to go down without a fight, even as technical indicators flash warning signs. The network scored a major adoption win as Robinhood's deployment of 213 tokenized stock contracts on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 network, signals growing enterprise adoption, proving that real-world utility continues expanding despite price struggles.

The technical setup presents challenges that traders need to navigate carefully. The RSI at 54 sits right in the middle of its range—neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a market in equilibrium waiting for a catalyst. This neutral reading often precedes sharp moves once the market picks a direction. The ADX at 11 shows essentially no trend.

The elephant in the room is the bearish EMA configuration: the 50-day EMA currently trades above the 200-day EMA, still in bearish configuration. But the gap between those two price zones is very, very small, showing markets are basically trading sideways, with traders opening and closing positions with little margin.

The Squeeze Momentum Indicator confirms volatility is compressed, suggesting a significant move is imminent. With institutional adoption accelerating, the bias leans bullish, but a strong bullish breakout is needed in order to wake up the markets. During compression phases, it is easy to predict that a major movement will happen—but whether it is bullish or bearish is not always clear.

Key levels: Immediate support at $2,400 (round number psychology), strong support at $2,200 (previous accumulation zone). Immediate resistance at $2,600 (50-day EMA rejection zone), strong resistance at $2,800 (breakout target).

But enough about boring ol' Bitcoin and Ethereum: Welcome to the fun meme coin madness of the day.

Underdog meme coin SPX6900 just won't quit. The token's explosive 12% surge to $1.27 represents a textbook oversold bounce that's catching traders by surprise, being the best performing cryptocurrency in the entire top 100 coins by market cap.

The meme coin crashed 10% on July 1 due to aggressive shorting, creating a perfect storm for contrarian buyers. Smart money didn't waste time: on-chain data shows a greater number of net inflows to private wallets, suggesting whales accumulated at lower prices.

The technical picture is still bullish. The RSI for SPX6900 sits at 52, showing plenty of room to run higher without hitting exhaustion levels that typically trigger profit-taking. The ADX at 23 is approaching the critical 25 level, and is a good sign for traders considering the meme coin is set to break out of a triangle pattern that could be decisive for its longer term future.

The 50-day EMA at $1.10 now acts as a floor. When price stays above the 50-day EMA, it signals short-term bulls are in control. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows compression is ""on,"" meaning volatility has tightened like a coiled spring and it could be potentially bullish if all the other indicators remain valid.

Key levels: Immediate support at $1.08-$1.17 (bounce zone), strong support at $0.92 (previous breakdown level). Immediate resistance at $1.40-1.50 (support/resistance wicks during June), strong resistance at $1.70 (June highs).

ByBilly Bambrough,

 Senior Contributor. 

Bitcoin and crypto prices have traded sideways since May—even as U.S. president Donald Trump's crypto czar predicts a “big” July—after it surged through the first few months of Trump's second presidency.

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can ""uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!""

The bitcoin price is up almost double from July last year, with predictions of “trillions and trillions” of dollars still on the sidelines helping to fuel sky-high bitcoin price bets.

Now, as a ""huge"" BlackRock crypto market bombshell suddenly appears on the horizon, the U.S. M2 money supply has hit a record $22 trillion—named by analysts as a potential catalyst for a bitcoin price breakout.

""As M2 money supply begins to rise again, history suggests that a portion of this liquidity will flow into bitcoin and other digital assets,"" Matt Mena, crypto research strategist at 21Shares, said in emailed comments.

Historically, the bitcoin price has tracked the M2 money supply, which is the Federal Reserve's estimate of liquid assets, including cash, money deposited in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other short-term saving vehicles such as money market funds.

""If bitcoin continues to follow money supply growth, we could see $150,000 per coin before year end,"" Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano, a crypto influencer who's set to lead a new bitcoin acquisition company, wrote in an emailed note.

The increase in the M2 money supply comes as Fed chair Jerome Powell continues to argue the case for keeping interest rates on hold.

“In effect we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs,"" Powell said this week during a conference panel discussion, it was reported by The Guardian newspaper, referring to Trump's Liberation Day of trade tariffs that sent shockwaves through the global economy.

""Essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs. We didn't overreact, in fact we didn't react at all. We're simply taking some time.”

Last month, the Fed kept interest rates on hold again after kicking of a reduction cycle in September, despite a growing number of Fed officials arguing for rate cuts.

“It's clear that the Fed expects inflation to continue above target,” David Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said in emailed comments. “That being the case, it sounds as if the Fed will only cut rates if the U.S. employment situation deteriorates significantly.”","{'href': 'https://www.forbes.com', 'title': 'Forbes'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Will Bitcoin benefit from ‘Big Beautiful Bill' passage and US debt ceiling increase?","https://cointelegraph.com/news/will-bitcoin-benefit-from-big-beautiful-bill-passage-and-us-debt-ceiling-increase","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 19:40:00 GMT","

 Traders say Bitcoin will benefit from the proposed $5 trillion increase to the US debt ceiling, but data could suggest otherwise. 

Key takeaways:

Historical data fail to show a consistent link between Bitcoin price gains and US debt ceiling increases.

Bitcoin's resilience reflects investors' belief that the US dollar will continue to lose value due to US domestic fiscal policy. 

United States Senators successfully advanced President Trump's ‘One Big Beautiful Bill' on Tuesday, moving it one step closer to becoming law. The proposed $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling has stirred significant controversy, and many Bitcoin (BTC) advocates believe the move could be a catalyst for a new all-time high in 2025.

Although several solid analyses point to a bullish outlook for Bitcoin, past US debt ceiling increases and suspensions have generally led to bearish outcomes, at least in the six months that followed. In fact, the June 2023 event stands as the only instance where BTC posted gains afterward.

Some might argue that markets price in these developments in advance. However, that assumption weakens when looking at Bitcoin's flat performance. On Tuesday, Bitcoin held steady at $105,000, the same level as five months earlier.

Bitcoin's resilience occurred despite widespread expectations that the Trump administration would push through the debt ceiling increase. At that time, economists projected the government would run out of funds by mid-August.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposed legislation will add at least $3.3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. The nearly 900-page bill passed in the Senate by a one-vote margin and now returns to the US House of Representatives.

Sven Henrich, founder of NorthmanTrader, criticized US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's claims that the bill represents a step toward “controlling the US debt.”

According to Henrich, raising the debt ceiling while “running record deficits” and lowering interest rates aligns with “modern monetary theory”—an approach suggesting that governments can fund expenditures by creating money, rather than through taxes or borrowing.

Rather than focusing solely on lawmakers' decisions, attention should turn to how the central bank will respond. If the US Federal Reserve maintains higher interest rates, debt servicing costs rise. On the other hand, a shift toward looser monetary policy could undermine the US dollar's strength.

Generally speaking, higher US Treasury yields reflect reduced investor confidence, as buyers demand greater compensation for perceived risks. Historically, this indicator has shown a positive correlation with Bitcoin's price, meaning both tend to rise together, given the cryptocurrency's appeal as an alternative asset.

Therefore, Bitcoin holding above $105,000 while the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.25% from 4.50% on June 6 suggests early signs of a decoupling. Even so, it remains too early to declare Bitcoin a proven reserve asset, particularly as both gold and the S&P 500 approach their own all-time highs.

In effect, broader markets appear to be pricing in a weaker US dollar, as evidenced by capital flowing into assets that traditionally benefit from currency debasement, such as equities, commodities, and Bitcoin itself.

According to “The Kobeissi Letter,” the dollar's devaluation comes as investors react to tariffs, the US deficit spending crisis, and pressure on the Fed to cut rates.” 

Ultimately, while the debt ceiling increase may coincide with a Bitcoin rally above $110,000, historical patterns do not support a direct causal link between these events.

The crypto market is serving up a classic rotation play as meme coins steal the spotlight from their blue chip cousins.

Global crypto markets posted gains alongside traditional equities following geopolitical easing, with overall market sentiment shifting from fear to greed. Traditional markets are providing strong tailwinds—the S&P 500 inched higher to a fresh record this week, breaking above the psychologically important 6,000 level for the first time since February. Meanwhile, the geopolitical picture has improved dramatically as oil prices fell sharply Tuesday, returning to levels last seen before the Iran-Israel conflict, with Brent crude dropping 6% to $67.14.

As investors feel calm in the markets, and consider putting money on riskier bets, the cryptocurrency market as a whole grew 2.5% today to $3.33 trillion, with 98 of the top 100 coins in the green for the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin's modest 3.59% gain to $109,507 masks the underlying strength in the world's largest cryptocurrency, supported by a bounce after two days of correction, testing the resistance of a bearish channel in play since mid-May. The price action reflects healthy consolidation after the recent surge, giving the market time to digest gains.

Technical indicators paint a cautiously optimistic picture. The Relative Strength Index, or RSI, for Bitcoin is at 60, suggesting BTC has momentum but isn't overheated. You can think of RSI like a temperature gauge where 70+ means the engine is running too hot and might need to cool down. This moderate reading suggests there's enough fuel in the markets for another leg higher.

The 50-day Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, provides crucial support below current prices, acting as a safety net that institutions often use to add positions. This indicator measures the average price of an asset for a given period of time. The 200-day EMA sits further below, creating multiple layers of support that would need to break for any serious correction.

However, the Average Directional Index, or ADX, at 12 indicates weak trend strength, which is to be expected considering this small correction happens in the middle of what is a heavily bullish trend in play since at least before the last halving. ADX measures the strength of a trend, regardless of direction.

Key levels: Immediate support at $104,000 (psychological round number), strong support at $96,000 (200-day EMA). Immediate resistance at $112,000 (recent rejection zone), strong resistance at $115,000 (measured breakout target and new ATH zone).

Ethereum's 3.16% rise to $2,559 shows the smart-contract blockchain king refusing to go down without a fight, even as technical indicators flash warning signs. The network scored a major adoption win as Robinhood's deployment of 213 tokenized stock contracts on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer-2 network, signals growing enterprise adoption, proving that real-world utility continues expanding despite price struggles.

The technical setup presents challenges that traders need to navigate carefully. The RSI at 54 sits right in the middle of its range—neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a market in equilibrium waiting for a catalyst. This neutral reading often precedes sharp moves once the market picks a direction. The ADX at 11 shows essentially no trend.

The elephant in the room is the bearish EMA configuration: the 50-day EMA currently trades above the 200-day EMA, still in bearish configuration. But the gap between those two price zones is very, very small, showing markets are basically trading sideways, with traders opening and closing positions with little margin.

The Squeeze Momentum Indicator confirms volatility is compressed, suggesting a significant move is imminent. With institutional adoption accelerating, the bias leans bullish, but a strong bullish breakout is needed in order to wake up the markets. During compression phases, it is easy to predict that a major movement will happen—but whether it is bullish or bearish is not always clear.

Key levels: Immediate support at $2,400 (round number psychology), strong support at $2,200 (previous accumulation zone). Immediate resistance at $2,600 (50-day EMA rejection zone), strong resistance at $2,800 (breakout target).

But enough about boring ol' Bitcoin and Ethereum: Welcome to the fun meme coin madness of the day.

Underdog meme coin SPX6900 just won't quit. The token's explosive 12% surge to $1.27 represents a textbook oversold bounce that's catching traders by surprise, being the best performing cryptocurrency in the entire top 100 coins by market cap.

The meme coin crashed 10% on July 1 due to aggressive shorting, creating a perfect storm for contrarian buyers. Smart money didn't waste time: on-chain data shows a greater number of net inflows to private wallets, suggesting whales accumulated at lower prices.

The technical picture is still bullish. The RSI for SPX6900 sits at 52, showing plenty of room to run higher without hitting exhaustion levels that typically trigger profit-taking. The ADX at 23 is approaching the critical 25 level, and is a good sign for traders considering the meme coin is set to break out of a triangle pattern that could be decisive for its longer term future.

The 50-day EMA at $1.10 now acts as a floor. When price stays above the 50-day EMA, it signals short-term bulls are in control. The Squeeze Momentum Indicator shows compression is ""on,"" meaning volatility has tightened like a coiled spring and it could be potentially bullish if all the other indicators remain valid.

Key levels: Immediate support at $1.08-$1.17 (bounce zone), strong support at $0.92 (previous breakdown level). Immediate resistance at $1.40-1.50 (support/resistance wicks during June), strong resistance at $1.70 (June highs).

The Ethereum Community Foundation will champion projects enforcing ETH burning mechanisms to support network's economic integrity without new token issuance.

Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content.

Ethereum developer Zak Cole is spearheading a new initiative called the Ethereum Community Foundation (ECF), which will primarily work to enhance the digital asset's economic value.

The initiative was announced during the Ethereum Community Conference in Cannes, France.

Founded by Cole and a group of ecosystem supporters, the ECF has reportedly already raised “millions” and intends to allocate its treasury to projects that enforce immutability, avoid issuing new tokens, and implement mechanisms to burn Ethereum (ETH).

These requirements align with the foundation's mission to reduce circulating ETH supply and strengthen the network's monetary policy.

The ECF's initial initiative, known as the Ethereum Validator Association (EVA), will give validators greater influence in protocol development by enabling them to signal preferences using their staked ETH.

The EVA will also invest in validator infrastructure to improve decentralization and network security.

Beyond validator initiatives, the ECF aims to fund real-world asset integrations that bring traditional financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, and real estate onto Ethereum's blockchain. The foundation views these integrations as critical to institutional adoption, which it sees as a key driver of long-term network value.

Additionally, the ECF will prioritize funding for public goods that address technical challenges within the Ethereum ecosystem, including adjustments to mispriced blob space used in data availability layers.

Funding decisions will be governed by coin voting, allowing the broader Ethereum community to participate in determining grant allocations. The ECF has emphasized that all funding decisions, treasury movements, and project milestones will remain publicly transparent to ensure accountability and alignment with the community's goals.

The launch of the ECF comes at a pivotal time for Ethereum, as the network undergoes a reorganization following executive changes at the Ethereum Foundation.

The ECF's mandate extends to engaging with governments, regulators, and policymakers to promote Ethereum as a trusted institutional infrastructure layer. While specific backers of the foundation have not been publicly disclosed, further announcements regarding its supporters and upcoming funding rounds are expected in the coming weeks.

By focusing on projects that reinforce ETH's economic integrity without introducing new tokens, the ECF is positioning itself as an alternative funding avenue within the ecosystem. It aims to complement but also differentiate from the Ethereum Foundation's current priorities.

Stocks tied to the price of ether, better known as ETH, were higher on Wednesday, reflecting renewed enthusiasm for the crypto asset amid a surge of interest in stablecoins and tokenization.

BitMine Immersion Technologies, a bitcoin miner that announced plans this week to make ETH its primary treasury reserve asset, jumped about 20%. It's gained more than 1,000% since the announcement. Betting platform SharpLink Gaming, which has also initiated an ETH treasury strategy, added more than 11%. Bit Digital, which last week exited bitcoin mining to focus on its ETH treasury and staking plans, jumped more than 6%.

""We're finally at the point where real use cases are emerging, and stablecoins have been the first version of that at scale but they're going to open the door to a much bigger story around tokenizing other assets and using digital assets in new ways,"" Devin Ryan, head of financial technology research at Citizens.

On Tuesday, as bitcoin ETFs snapped a 15-day streak of inflows, ether ETFs saw $40 million in inflows led by BlackRock's iShares Ethereum Trust. ETH ETFs came back to life in June after much concern that they were becoming zombie funds.

The price of the coin itself was last higher by 5%, according to Coin Metrics, though it's still down 24% this year.

Ethereum has been struggling with an identity crisis fueled by uncertainty about the network's value proposition, weaker revenue since its last big technical upgrade and increasing competition from Solana. Market volatility, driven by geopolitical uncertainty this year, has not helped.

The Ethereum network's smart contracts capability makes it a prominent platform for the tokenization of traditional assets, which includes U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. Fundstrat's Tom Lee this week called Ethereum ""the backbone and architecture"" of stablecoins. Both Tether (USDT) and Circle's USD Coin (USDC) are issued on the network.

BlackRock's tokenized money market fund (known as BUIDL, which stands for USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund) also launched on Ethereum last year before expanding to other blockchain networks.

Tokenization is the process of issuing digital representations on a blockchain network of publicly traded securities, real world assets or any other form of value. Holders of tokenized assets don't have outright ownership of the assets themselves.

The latest wave of interest in ETH-related assets follows an announcement by Robinhood this week that it will enable trading of tokenized U.S. stocks and ETFs across Europe, after a groundswell of interest in stablecoins throughout June following Circle's IPO and the Senate passage of its proposed stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act.

Ether, which turns 10 years old at the end of July, is sitting about 75% off its all-time high.

Prometheum Inc., a market infrastructure provider for blockchain-based securities, announced its subsidiary Prometheum Capital, a FINRA member firm and SEC-registered special purpose broker-dealer (“SPBD”), is now authorized to provide correspondent clearing services to third-party broker-dealers. Prometheum's FINRA member and SEC-registered broker-dealer network will support introducing broker-dealers seeking to transact in on-chain securities under federal securities laws.

Correspondent clearing allows Prometheum Capital to provide clearing, custody, execution, and recordkeeping services on behalf of other broker-dealers, enabling their clients to access and transact in on-chain securities.

Product issuers are increasingly distributing securities on-chain, with more than $24 billion of securities products already issued on blockchain networks, according to RWA.xyz. Correspondent clearing is a critical gateway for broader market participation with these assets, supporting the modernization of U.S. capital markets and accelerating institutional and retail access to on-chain securities.

“Financial markets are evolving from electronic to digital, blockchain-enabled infrastructure, facilitating the migration of the $130 trillion securities industry on-chain,” said Aaron Kaplan, founder and co-CEO of Prometheum. “Broker-dealers require a turnkey solution to access these products and offer on-chain securities alongside traditional securities products. Prometheum Capital is excited to support the broker-dealer community's growth by offering a pathway into digital markets.”

This development expands Prometheum's role as a leading on-chain securities infrastructure provider, allowing broker-dealers—who currently cannot custody or directly transact in on-chain securities—to access these products and expand their offerings into digital assets.

Crypto World News

July 2, 2025 by Abbas Zagham 

PENGU Token, a Solana meme coin linked with the Pudgy Penguins project, surprised investors with a humongous 47% valuation jump in the past week, increasing its market capitalization by a staggering $300 million despite rampant crypto market fluctuations.

Currently trading at $0.01475, PENGU registered a marginal 1.86% appreciation over the preceding 24-hour trading period but is still dominant across top exchanges as a very highly traded token. This unwavering support is despite rising activity among so-called “whale” players, crypto wallets that hold over a million dollars in assets.

Most recent on-chain records indicate these whales have acquired a total of nearly 240 million tokens throughout the past week, evidencing growing optimism among veteran market players.

The token's rise coincides with a broader resurgence in the NFT sector. The NFT marketplace has increased 33.8% during the week and outperformed every other part of crypto, according to analytics firm Artemis. CryptoSlam data also records a massive 191% jump in volume traded over a single 24-hour day in Pudgy Penguins NFTs, a sign of a new sense of excitement around the brand's digital collectibles.

Following that momentum, the team behind Pudgy Penguins is set to introduce “Pudgy Party,” a mobile phone game that is intended to attract mainstream players and further expand the project's ecosystem beyond traditional ownership of NFTs to phone entertainment. The move is intended to increase community growth and usage over the long term.

For those not aware, @pudgypenguins is about to drop a mobile game called Pudgy Party.Gameplay looks fun AF, think Mario Party meets Fall Guys. I've talked to a couple people who've played (it's testing in select regions) and they said it's incredible.Built by Mythical Games,… pic.twitter.com/J2tDuoKerd

Even institutional demand is rippling out. Cboe BZX recently filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to trade shares of a potential PENGU exchange-traded fund (ETF) managed by Canary Capital. The filing is a good indication that the meme coin is gathering mainstream acceptability and may be more attainable for mainstream investors shortly.

Analysts have pointed out the meteoric growth of the tokens and likened it to the explosive growth of a different meme coin, Pepe, last January. Notable crypto analyst “degengambleh” pointed out similarities in pricing behavior and foresaw a very bullish upside target of $0.1774, more than 10 times the spot level.

Meanwhile, trader Ali Martinez pointed out that a close above the resistance level of $0.015 to $0.017 per coin might ignite a very strong breakout and drive PENGU still further in the short term.

While PENGU basks in the limelight, a different budding project, Subbd, is silently gathering steam in the creator economy. Poised to disrupt a market worth a whopping $85 billion in content subscriptions,

Subbd is harnessing Web3 and AI technologies to offer a tokenized experience that lets creators programmatically deliver content and fans enjoy distinctive, interactive experiences.

Subbd's native Ethereum-based token, SUBBD, powers the ecosystem through granting premium access to content, staking rewards, and features enhanced through AI. Token holders who stake SUBBD gain access to more perks such as special livestreams, behind-the-scenes posts, and special releases of content, leading to a more active and loyal fan base.

The project has been able to raise a total of $465,670 via its ongoing presale, and there isn't much time left before the next pricing level is activated, showing strong early investor demand.

The world of finance is shaking up as central banks worldwide speed up exploration and creation of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies).

The process that started as a somewhat tentative exploration of digital solutions has become an all-out race to update monetary infrastructures among various global nations.

More than 100 countries are currently studying or testing their digital currencies.

CBDC revolution comes into shape

CBDCs are more of an overhaul of what money should be.

Unlike alternative cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, CBDCs are online equivalents of a national currency, given the equivalent value of the government-issued paper notes.

Still, they have the stability and the support of classical cash paired with the efficiency and creativity of digital currency.

The drive towards CBDC development has never been as high before.

According to the latest figures given by the Bank for International Settlements, among central banks, 93% already work on CBDCs, and many have shifted the focus to actual pilot programs and policy designs.

The current uptake indicates that the world has realized that digital currencies are not just experimental technology but needed infrastructure in the future of finance.

Who is taking the front seat in global CBDCs

China has become the leader in implementing CBDC DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) or the digital yuan.

China has already conducted billions of dollars of digital yuan transactions through huge pilot programs in large cities such as Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, showing the practical feasibility of retail CBDCs on a large scale.

The European Central Bank has been thorough in its methodology in the digital euro project, involving research and consultations with stakeholders.

Protecting privacy and living in harmony with cash are of primary importance in the design, highlighted by the ECB officials due to the current issue of people being afraid that the central bank could spy on them and become financially excluded.

The United States Federal Reserve has been cautious and has concentrated on research and international cooperation rather than being in a hurry to do anything.

Federal Reserve officials say they are less concerned with being the first country to distribute CBDC and more interested in getting its design correct, with the global consequences of the digital dollar.

The Bank of England is still exploring that idea further through extensive research papers and consultation with the public.

The Bank of Japan has already conducted proof-of-concept experiments with lower-level CBDC functions and system stability tests.

Technical architecture and design of consideration

Technical and policy decisions relating to the CBDC development are pretty complex and will determine the future of digital money.

Central banks must balance against set priorities – privacy and transparency, innovation and stability and financial inclusion and security.

A decision on wholesale versus retail CBDCs is a basic design choice.

The wholesale CBDC is aimed at interbank payments and high-dollar transactions, giving the possibility of transforming settlement systems and cross-border payments.

The availability of retail CBDCs to consumers and businesses can change how people conduct everyday transactions and the transmission of monetary policy.

Privacy protection is a critical aspect of the design of CBDC.

Though central banks have understood that privacy is essential, they have also taken note of the regulatory need in combating AML (anti-money laundering) and terrorist financing.

Such a delicate balance between finding the right balance needs advanced technical solutions, such as ZKPs (zero-knowledge proofs) and techniques of differential privacy.

Functionality when not online is another major factor, which would ensure that the digital currencies can be used even when not connected to the network or when there is low connectivity.

This would be necessary to facilitate the universal accessibility of physical cash.

Policy and economic implication

CBDCs have severe implications for the effectiveness of the monetary policy and financial stability.

There is a chance that central banks might gain greater insight into the flow of money and the economy and be in a better position to react to economic shocks and targeted intervention.

Commercial banks' disintermediation is a significant issue in CBDC design.

If consumers directly own digital currency with the central banks, the traditional banks may lose deposits and have difficulties in their lending operations.

Some possible methods the central banks are considering to counter this risk are interest rates and holding curbs.

The DCC implementation may revolutionize cross-border payment.

Transactions across borders, which nowadays require days to complete and come with exorbitant costs, might be made instant and cost-effective.

This will, however, need the coordination of central banks and solving intricate regulatory and technical interoperability issues.

Financial inclusion is one of the most significant potential uses of enhancing CBDC.

Digital currencies would offer banking services to the unbanked, allowing them to send remittances at a lower cost and allowing a more efficient provision of government payments and social assistance.

Difficulties and risks

Although it is possible to note the potential benefits of CBDCs, central banks have to consider many essential issues.

Cybersecurity may be the biggest threat since digital currencies may become the focus of sophisticated attacks.

Central banks have to adopt a high level of security without compromising performance and experience.

The public stakeholders have been focused on privacy issues. The citizens are concerned about government spying and the possibility of surveillance of transactions.

Central banks must balance what people are rightfully entitled to in providing privacy and what they require in compliance with regulation and law enforcement.

There are also permanent difficulties of technical complexity – CBDCs must be linked with current payment systems, regulatory regimes and international norms.

Designing systems that can be up and running 24/7 and resilient thrusts on complexity even further.

Relationships with the existing system of payments must be considered well when CBDCs coexist.

Central banks need to be sure that digital currencies should co-exist with cash and private means of payment, not substitute them, and thus preserve choice and competition in the payment environment.

The road ahead is to emerge.

Since the pace of creating CBDC is growing worldwide, some main trends are starting to appear.

As the number of countries launching their CBDC grows, so will the need to have interoperability between various systems of different CBDCs.

International bodies strive to develop harmonized parameters and procedures to enable cross-border transactions of CBDC.

Public-private partnerships are becoming necessary for the successful implementation of CBDC.

Central banks are partnering with technology providers, financial establishments and payment providers to exploit already established expertise and infrastructure and remain regulatory supervisors.

Launch plans of CBDC differ significantly across jurisdictions and continue to evolve as priorities, technical capacity and regulatory frameworks differ.

Although certain countries might issue retail CBDCs by the end of the current decade, others will engage in less ambitious plans, which may also take the position to the end.

Consequences of cryptocurrency system

The entire cryptocurrency world has some significant implications for the development of CBDC.

Although the demand that CBDCs and cryptocurrencies address, and the markets where they operate, resemble each other, their co-existence will probably transform the digital asset market.

CBDCs can popularize the idea of digital funds and speed up the transition to digital payment, which can cause beneficial spillover into cryptocurrency consumption.

The interoperability of both, however, is not transparent in most jurisdictions.

CBDCs' programmability properties have the potential to add components of DeFi (decentralized finance), which would allow smart contracts and automated transactions in the classic monetary environment.

Such would confuse the boundary between conventional finance and cryptocurrency innovation.

Conclusion

On a worldwide scale, exploring the possibility of using central bank digital currencies is a breakthrough in monetary history.

Since central banks are transitioning to implementation and not research, today's choices will define future generations' financial fabric.

Technical, economic and social factors are complicated and require serious negotiations.

The central banks must coordinate innovation and stability, efficiency and privacy, nationalistic interest and international collaboration.

The risk is significant – inadequate design or launching of CBDCs might destroy the public confidence in digital money and INGRESS – redraw the process of financial innovation.

The following period of CBDC development will play a critical role in defining whether crypto can make good on its potential to become more efficient, inclusive and resilient money.

With pilot programs in full swing and the horse being put at the launch starting gates, the world awaits to be surprised as to whether CBDCs will bring about a whole new era of digital finance or endure the pressures that have traditionally undermined monetary innovations.

The CBDC revolution cannot be summed up in terms of technologies – it is the redefinition of the infrastructure that modern economies rely on in the digital world.

To succeed, it will be necessary to achieve levels of collaboration between central banks, governments, technology providers and consumers never-before-seen to design digital currencies that satisfy the interests of all parties to the system without undermining the stability and trust that are the hallmarks of the modern monetary system.

The post Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) – Global Officials Look at New Era of Digital Finance appeared first on The Daily Hodl.

The world of finance is shaking up as central banks worldwide speed up exploration and creation of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies).

The process that started as a somewhat tentative exploration of digital solutions has become an all-out race to update monetary infrastructures among various global nations.

More than 100 countries are currently studying or testing their digital currencies.

CBDC revolution comes into shape

CBDCs are more of an overhaul of what money should be.

Unlike alternative cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, CBDCs are online equivalents of a national currency, given the equivalent value of the government-issued paper notes.

Still, they have the stability and the support of classical cash paired with the efficiency and creativity of digital currency.

The drive towards CBDC development has never been as high before.

According to the latest figures given by the Bank for International Settlements, among central banks, 93% already work on CBDCs, and many have shifted the focus to actual pilot programs and policy designs.

The current uptake indicates that the world has realized that digital currencies are not just experimental technology but needed infrastructure in the future of finance.

Who is taking the front seat in global CBDCs

China has become the leader in implementing CBDC DCEP (Digital Currency Electronic Payment) or the digital yuan.

China has already conducted billions of dollars of digital yuan transactions through huge pilot programs in large cities such as Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai, showing the practical feasibility of retail CBDCs on a large scale.

The European Central Bank has been thorough in its methodology in the digital euro project, involving research and consultations with stakeholders.

Ripple Labs (XRP) has applied for a national banking license with the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The firm filed its application Wednesday and is looking to join the rush of crypto platforms entering mainstream finance, according to a Wall Street Journal report.

JUST IN: 🇺🇸 Ripple applies for US banking license.

Being granted a national trust bank charter would also place Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin within the OCC's remit. Ripple would likely also consider offering other crypto services through its banking license if approved. “The dual nature of that regulation would basically have set a new bar for transparency and compliance in the stablecoin market,” said Jack McDonald, senior vice president of stablecoins at Ripple.

Presently, crypto custodian Anchorage Digital is the only digital-currency firm in the country with a federal bank charter. Circle, the USDC stablecoin issuer, also recently applied for a national bank charter. While Ripple boasts a far smaller market cap than those two, its popularity in the crypto sector has exploded in the past two years, in part thanks to its high-profile case against the SEC.

According to the WSJ, separately, Ripple subsidiary Standard Custody & Trust Company applied for a Federal Reserve master account on Monday. If granted, the account would allow Ripple to custody the reserves directly with the Fed, and issue and redeem stablecoins outside of normal banking hours.

Ripple's native XRP cryptocurrency is up on Wednesday following the platform's US banking license application. In the last 24 hours, the altcoin is up nearly 4%.

It's looking to fortify its coffers with stablecoins.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Oculus VR founder and flip-flop evangelist, Palmer Luckey is part of a collective of tech billionaires who are founding a new crypto-focused U.S. bank called Erebor. This bank will focus on providing capital for technology start-ups, AI-ventures, defence and manufacturing industries, and cryptocurrency endeavours, as well as for individuals looking to invest in these spaces.

The Columbus, Ohio-based Erebor has applied for a national bank charter, and is pushing a digital-only model. It will be headed by co-CEOs Owen Rapaport and Jacob Hirshman, the latter of whom was a former adviser to stablecoin company Circle, as per Reuters.

While they'll be the face of the company, the money behind it is coming from billionaires like Luckey. He's joined by the Peter Thiel-backed Founders Fund, and Joe Lonsdale, who co-founded Palantir with Thiel. Both are cited as major donors to U.S. President, Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.

The bank is looking to fill the empty boots of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), which collapsed in 2023 amidst an insolvency crisis. Before collapsing, SVB was the most popular bank for new technology ventures and was often seen as a source of capital for enterprises that wouldn't meet liquidity standards for more traditional banking organizations.

Like SVB, the filing suggests Erebor would look to “differentiate itself,” by doing business with entities and customers that are not as well served by traditional financial institutions. It would particularly look to serve those with “insufficient access to credit.”

In an effort to head off concerns of SVR-like liquidity issues at Erebor, the backing group has announced that they'll hold cryptocurrency stablecoins on its balance sheet. These crypto assets have their value pegged to traditional fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, which can provide more stability for their value than other, more volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

That hasn't proved foolproof in the past, though, as the TerraUSD algorithmic stablecoin and Luna cryptocurrency collapsed in 2022, destroying $45 billion in value overnight.

However, cryptocurrency assets have become increasingly common on the balance sheets of many financial organizations in recent years as a way to hold value and to accelerate cross-border payments which can be slow and fraught with fees.

Erebor said that it aimed to become ""the most regulated entity conducting and facilitating stablecoin transactions"", in its charter application.

It may have stiff competition, though. PYMNTS quotes Brett McLain, head of payments at cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken, ““Everybody's jumping into stablecoins right now [...] “All the big banks, they're talking about creating their own; others want to leverage existing ones.”

Regulation of this new banking space is expected to take some time, but the impetus is clearly there to make stablecoins a major component of modern finance and credit, and Erebor is looking to be at the forefront of that new endeavour.

REX Shares and Osprey Funds have selected Anchorage Digital as the exclusive custodian and staking partner for their newly launched REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), the first crypto staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) listed in the U.S.

The fund, which offers investors exposure to Solana SOL$152.48 while generating staking rewards, began trading Wednesday on the Cboe exchange Wednesday at $25.47 per share.

Unlike existing spot bitcoin and ethereum ETFs, which fall under different regulatory frameworks, SSK is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. That means a qualified custodian — not the fund issuer — is required to hold the underlying assets. Anchorage Digital, currently the only federally regulated bank authorized to both custody and stake digital assets, will fill that role.

“Staking is the next chapter in the crypto ETF story,"" said Nathan McCauley, CEO and co-founder of Anchorage Digital, in a release. ""The launch of crypto staking ETFs marks a win for consumers and a significant step forward in full access to the crypto ecosystem.""

The ETF gives investors indirect exposure to Solana while also participating in the blockchain's staking mechanism, which provides additional yield by helping to secure the network. Staking allows holders of certain cryptocurrencies to earn rewards by locking their tokens into the network, a process that previously required technical know-how and direct interaction with crypto protocols.

By packaging staking into an ETF structure, REX Shares and Osprey aim to make that process accessible to a wider range of investors through traditional brokerage accounts.

SOL is higher by 2% over the past 24 hours to $150.



The SSK launch comes as the crypto ETF market continues to evolve beyond bitcoin and ether, with issuers exploring new ways to bring blockchain-based products to regulated exchanges. The introduction of staking ETFs marks a new phase for the industry, combining income-generating features with exposure to digital assets, all within an SEC-regulated investment vehicle.

Bitcoin BTC$109,428.91 is bouncing hard towards $110,000 on Wednesday, shrugging off Tuesday's brief risk-off wave that dragged the price below $106,000.

Recently, the largest crypto traded at its strongest price since June 11, around $109,500, up 3.5% over the past 24 hours.

The action came as Donald Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam, helping risk assets across the board. The Nasdaq at midday is ahead 0.8%.

Under the deal, the U.S. will impose a 20% tariff on goods from Vietnam and a 40% levy on transshipped goods—products routed through Vietnam on their way to the U.S. U.S. exports, in turn, will face no tariffs when entering the Vietnamese market.

Boosting crypto sentiment specifically could be the debut of the REX-Osprey Solana + Staking ETF (SSK), the first such crypto staking product available in the U.S.

""Volume in $SSK now at $20M, which is really strong, top 1% for a new launch,"" wrote Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas a short while ago. Balchunas noted that SOLZ — a futures-based SOL ETF that opened for business in March — did just $1 million of volume on its first day of trade.

July is shaping up to be a potentially volatile month for bitcoin, driven by Trump administration's policies, according to Vetle Lunde, head of research at K33. 

Trump is expected to sign a controversial expansionary budget bill dubbed the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" by Friday. The bill, which could widen the U.S. deficit by $3.3 trillion, is seen by some as bullish for scarce assets like BTC, Lunde said. 

Another key date looming is the July 9 tariff deadline, which could see more aggressive trade posturing from Trump.

Thirdly, July 22 is the final deadline for action on long-awaited crypto executive order, with potential updates on the U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

""July is crowded with latent Trump volatility,"" Lunde said. Still, crypto markets are relatively calm without excessive froth, he noted.

""There are few reasons to expect a massive broad deleveraging of the crypto market, as crypto-leverage remains contained,"" he said. ""This favors maintaining spot exposure and staying patient as we progress into a period well known for its seasonal apathy.""

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) is now generating more revenue than one of the asset manager's most iconic products, the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), according to Bloomberg data.



Despite having just $52 billion in AUM — a fraction of IVV's $624 billion in total assets — IBIT's higher fee structure has turned it into a bigger moneymaker for the world's largest asset manager. Bloomberg estimates that IBIT brings in roughly $187.2 million annually through its 0.25% management fee.



By comparison, IVV, which tracks the S&P 500 and has been a staple in retail and institutional portfolios for years, charges just 0.03%. That means it generates around $187.1 million in annual fees, despite managing roughly nine times more in assets than IBIT.



IBIT launched in January 2024 as part of a wave of spot bitcoin ETFs approved by U.S. regulators. Since then, the fund has seen inflows every month except one, amassing $52 billion in assets to date. That makes it the largest spot bitcoin ETF on the market by a wide margin.



The rapid growth of IBIT highlights the ongoing demand for regulated bitcoin investment products, particularly those offered by established financial firms like BlackRock. For investors, the appeal lies in gaining exposure to bitcoin without the technical hurdles or security risks of holding the asset directly.



While IBIT's management fee is higher than more traditional ETFs, it reflects the added complexity, custody and regulatory requirements involved in offering exposure to a digital asset like bitcoin.

 Before its collapse, Silicon Valley Bank had deep ties to crypto companies and venture capital funds investing in the industry. 

A group of billionaires, including Peter Thiel, is reportedly planning to launch a new financial services firm to fill the gap left by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.

The new bank, to be called Erebor, will focus on serving startups and cryptocurrency companies, according to the Financial Times, which cited anonymous sources familiar with the plans. The project has applied for a US bank charter, which allows financial institutions to operate as a bank.

Thiel's venture fund, Founders Fund, is among the bank's early investors. In addition to Thiel, the group reportedly includes Palmer Luckey, co-founder of defense contractor Anduril, and Joe Lonsdale, founder of 8VC.

Thiel, who co-founded PayPal in the late 1990s, is well-known in the crypto space for his advocacy of Bitcoin (BTC) and digital assets. As Cointelegraph reported, Thiel backs crypto exchange Bullish, which recently submitted regulatory filings for an initial public offering in the United States. 

In addition to serving crypto companies, Erebor reportedly aims to become a major lender for early-stage startups and other “riskier” firms that may struggle to access capital amid tighter banking regulations.

California's financial watchdog shut down Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023 after rising interest rates eroded the value of its long-term bond investments, triggering a bank run and liquidity crisis when too many clients tried to withdraw funds at once. As Cointelegraph reported at the time, Silicon Valley Bank was the first FDIC-insured bank to fail that year.

Its collapse left a massive gap in the market, as the bank had served about half of all venture capital–backed tech and life sciences companies in the United States.

The failure set off a domino effect, contributing to a broader banking crisis that also took down Silvergate Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank.

The fallout dealt a heavy blow to the digital asset market, with crypto investment funds losing 10% of their assets under management in just one week.

As Harvard Business Review noted, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank specifically put significant pressure on lending within the venture capital ecosystem.

Despite its collapse, Silicon Valley Bank still operates today as a division of First Citizens Bank, which acquired the company in late March 2023. Its focus continues to be on private equity, technology and the life sciences industry.

Astronomers Found the Most Self-Destructive Planet in the Sky

This planet triggers flares on its star—spelling its ultimate doom

By Jacek Krywko edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

In this artist's impression, the planet HIP 67522 b sends a wave of energy along magnetic field lines toward the surface of its host star—triggering a massive flare when the energy reaches the star's surface.

Stars often whip their planets with solar winds and radiation, pull them ever closer with gravity and sear them with heat. But a newfound planet exerts an unexpectedly strong—and ultimately self-destructive—influence on its star in return.

The star HIP 67522 is slightly larger than our sun and shines roughly 408 light-years away in the Scorpius-Centaurus star cluster. It's 17 million years old, a youngster by stellar standards, and has two orbiting planets that are even younger. The innermost of these two planets, a Jupiter-size gas giant called HIP 67522 b, orbits HIP 67522 at a distance of less than 12 times the star's radius—almost seven times closer than Mercury's distance from the sun in our Solar System. This in-your-face proximity, combined with HIP 67522's volatile teenage nature, has created a spectacle astronomers have never seen before: a planet that triggers powerful flares on the surface of its host star, leading to the planet's own slow destruction.

“In a way, we got lucky,” says Ekaterina Ilin, an astrophysicist at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON), who led the study on the HIP 67522 system, published on Wednesday in Nature. “We took all the star-planet systems that we knew of and just went ahead looking for flares—sudden intense bursts of radiation coming from the star's surface.” Parsing through the data gathered by two space-based telescopes, NASA's TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) and the European Space Agency's CHEOPS (Characterizing Exoplanet Satellite), Ilin's team noticed that HIP 67522's flares seemed to be synchronized with its closest planet's orbital period. And those flares were gigantic—“thousands of times more energetic than anything the sun can produce,” Ilin says.

The planet HIP 67522 b suffers severe consequences from flares on its host star: the high-energy radiation blasts atmosphere off of the low-density planet, threatening to eventually bring it down from a Jupiter-size world to a Neptune-size one.

The orbiting gas giant likely sparks these powerful flares by perturbing the star's strong magnetic field lines as it passes by in its orbit. This sends waves of energy downward along the lines—and when those waves meet the star's surface, a flare bursts out. The star's magnetic loops are “almost like a spring waiting to be let go,” Ilin says. “The planet's just giving it this last push.” Based on the team's observations, HIP 67522 b triggers a flare once every Earth day or two.

And this action has severe consequences for the planet itself: Ilin estimates the unlucky gas giant gets six times more radiation than it would if it wasn't triggering flares and blasting away its own atmosphere. At this pace, Ilin's team says, HIP 67522 b will shrink from Jupiter's size to Neptune's in about 100 million years. “Flaring might cut the lifetime of the planet's atmosphere in half,” she says.

Researchers had suspected this type of star-planet interplay might occur, but they had never previously seen it, says Antoine Strugarek, an astrophysicist at the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission's (CEA's) center CEA Paris-Saclay, who was not involved in the new study. “This is the first time we see very convincing evidence such interaction has been actually detected,” he says.

Ilin says it's too early to draw far-reaching conclusions from this first example of the phenomenon. As a next step, she says, researchers can compare HIP 67522 b with the other planet in the system, which orbits a bit farther from the star, to calculate how much mass the more closely orbiting world is actually losing through this process compared with the more distant one, which is likely only hit with random flares.

Another unanswered question is exactly how the flare triggering works. “Is it a wave [of magnetic energy] that propagates from the planet?” Ilin wonders. She suggests that what happens could be similar to an effect that has been seen on the sun: smaller solar flares sometimes perturb nearby magnetic loops and tip them over the edge to snap and produce a larger flare.

But perhaps the most important question is how common the newly observed phenomenon is. For now, Ilin wants to focus on finding more systems where planets induce stellar flares that scientists can study. “Once we figure out how it works, we can turn it into a planet-detection technique,” she says. Instead of searching for the planets themselves, researchers could look for stars that flare following a certain pattern—suggesting they, too, might have planets with a self-destructive bent.

The North Eurasian forest and forest-steppe zones have sustained millennia of sociocultural connections among northern peoples, but much of their history is poorly understood. In particular, the genomic formation of populations that speak Uralic and Yeniseian languages today is unknown. Here, by generating genome-wide data for 180 ancient individuals spanning this region, we show that the Early-to-Mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers harboured a continuous gradient of ancestry from fully European-related in the Baltic, to fully East Asian-related in the Transbaikal. Contemporaneous groups in Northeast Siberia were off-gradient and descended from a population that was the primary source for Native Americans, which then mixed with populations of Inland East Asia and the Amur River Basin to produce two populations whose expansion coincided with the collapse of pre-Bronze Age population structure. Ancestry from the first population, Cis-Baikal Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Cisbaikal_LNBA), is associated with Yeniseian-speaking groups and those that admixed with them, and ancestry from the second, Yakutia Late Neolithic–Bronze Age (Yakutia_LNBA), is associated with migrations of prehistoric Uralic speakers. We show that Yakutia_LNBA first dispersed westwards from the Lena River Basin around 4,000 years ago into the Altai-Sayan region and into West Siberian communities associated with Seima-Turbino metallurgy—a suite of advanced bronze casting techniques that expanded explosively from the Altai1. The 16 Seima-Turbino period individuals were diverse in their ancestry, also harbouring DNA from Indo-Iranian-associated pastoralists and from a range of hunter-gatherer groups. Thus, both cultural transmission and migration were key to the Seima-Turbino phenomenon, which was involved in the initial spread of early Uralic-speaking communities.

This map displays all the sites which are the sources of the samples in the major populations that are the focus in this paper. These include all sites 1) whose samples fall on the NEAHG cline, 2) whose samples fall in the Cisbaikal_LNBA cluster or are admixed with it, 3) whose samples fall in the Yakutia_LNBA cluster or are admixed with it, 4) whose samples are a part of the ten-population East Siberian transect described in our qpAdm modelling, and 5) whose samples are from Seima-Turbino period individuals. Each site is represented by a pie chart, whose size is proportional to the number of individuals from that site; the white fraction represents previously-published samples, and the black newly-published samples. Our sampling fills geographic and temporal lacunae.

Temporal and geographic disposition of cultures from the Mesolithic to the Late Bronze and Iron Ages across Northern Eurasia. Sites whose samples are analyzed in our paper are highlighted in darker boxes, within containing boxes indicating archaeological cultures. Sites whose colors are darker are those that we believe are most securely dated (based on radiocarbon, isotopic, and archaeological evidence).

To illuminate the role that levels of ANE ancestry plays in generating variation among the populations we analyze, we use as a basis for another projection 71 shotgun-sequenced ancient individuals from across Eurasia, of which a large proportion are enriched in ANE ancestry and fall outside the range of present-day variation (e.g. individuals from populations like Tyumen_HG.SG or Kazakhstan_Botai.SG; for full list, see Supplementary Information section 4). The North Eurasian Hunter-Gatherer cline forms a curved arc stretching from EHG populations to present-day East Asians; the center of the arc dominated by populations rich in ANE ancestry is moved toward the positive direction in PC2. The individual furthest along the positive direction in PC2 is AG3. Clines formed by later Inner Asian populations, such as present-day Uralic, Turkic, and Mongolic speakers, as well as Late Bronze Age and Iron Age steppe populations such as Scythians and Sarmatians, are distinguished from the NEAHG cline by their much lower values along PC2, suggesting a much lower level of ANE ancestry. This PCA shows that populations along the NEAHG cline, remaining stable for many millennia, were substantially outside the range of present-day genetic variation in Northern Eurasia.

To further uncover possible structure among the East Asian ancestries within the populations that we analyze, we constructed a third PCA, using as a basis 37 East Asian present-day populations that have minimal West Eurasian admixture, and a single West Eurasian population (Norwegian), all genotyped on the Affymetrix Human Origins array (for a full list of populations analyzed, refer to Supplementary Information section 4). We projected all other shotgun-sequenced and hybridization-captured ancient and present-day individuals onto this basis. Once again, the North Eurasian Hunter-Gatherer cline forms a curved arc stretching from West Eurasian populations to present-day East Asians, with the center of the arc deflected toward the AG3 individual. East Asian populations are now differentiated along PC2, with Southeast Asians and East Asian agriculturalists taking on especially negative values along that dimension; populations from the Amur River Basin taking on intermediate values; then populations on the Mongolian Plateau and surrounding areas. A large gap separates these populations from Yakutia_LNBA and Russia_Tatarka_BA, which take on very positive values along PC2, close to present-day Nganasans and a genetically very similar Iron-Age individual from Yakutia who clusters with Nganasans in the previous two PCAs (Yakutia_IA.SG; also see Extended Data Fig. 9). As one moves East along the NEAHG cline, their positions along PC2 tend to converge to the values found among populations of the Mongolian Plateau. In contrast, the Dzhilinda1_M_N_8.4 kya and Kolyma_M_10.1 kya individuals, and the Syalakh_Belkachi, Yakutia_LNBA and Russia_Tatarka_BA populations do not fall on the NEAHG cline and are shifted in the positive direction on PC2, toward the positions occupied by Nganasans, Beringian populations, and Native Americans. Lastly, Uralic populations possess the most positive values among PC2 when compared to Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic populations.

To understand structure among NEAHG populations and non-NEAHG Siberians, we constructed two PCAs with ancient individuals including all individuals from the NEAHG cline, ancient non-NEAHG Siberians, and a selection of ancient Beringians and Native Americans. Notably, all these populations possess combinations of only WHG, EHG, ANE and East Asian ancestries. No individuals were projected in these PCAs. The first PCA (Extended Data Fig. 6a) includes all individuals in the set, and the second (Extended Data Fig. 6b) includes only individuals East of the Altai mountains. (A) In the first PCA we highlight several patterns. 1) the North Eurasian Hunter-Gatherer cline forms a curved arc stretching from West Eurasian populations to East Asian populations along PC1 and PC2. Populations rich in East Asian ancestry are differentiated along PC3, with individuals and populations within or closely related to the Cisbaikal_LNBA cluster having the most positive values, followed by those in the Transbaikal_EMN cluster and populations of the Mongolian Plateau, followed by individuals and populations in the Yakutia_LNBA cluster, followed by those from the Amur River Basin, followed by populations from the Bering Straits and the Americas. Notably, all individuals along the NEAHG cline, including individuals rich in East Asian ancestry (e.g. Cisbaikal_EN, Transbaikal_EMN, and all NEAHG individuals from the Krasnoyarsk region) form a straight line in PC3, suggesting a constant source of East Asian ancestry at the East Asian terminus of the NEAHG cline. 2) Khaiyrgas_16.7 kya occupies a central position among the other groups rich in East Asian ancestry in East Siberia, Beringia and the Americas, suggesting a lack of shared drift with later populations of the Bering region or the Americas. The situation is different for later populations: Kolyma_M_10.1 kya falls among ancient Beringian populations, while the more East Asian-admixed Ust-Kyakhta_14 kya and Dzhilinda1_M_N_8.4kya occupy a position in between Syalakh-Belkachi and ancient Bering Straits populations, with the even more East Asian-admixed Syalakh-Belkachi population showing even less of this displacement towards ancient Bering Straits populations. (B) We find a similar pattern in the second PCA, except with an opposite ordering of the clusters along PC3. Our results suggest that the distinctions we discover between groupings produced by the clustering analyses in Supplementary Information Section 6 can be recovered in PCA analyses aimed at recovering fine-scale structure, despite underlying similarities in deep ancestry in populations in East Siberia, Beringia, and the Americas—all the products of admixture between ANE and East Asian ancestry.

Panel A shows the widespread distribution of individuals with Ancient Paleosiberian (APS) ancestry in Siberia before the Holocene, >10 kya. Panel B shows the formation of the NEAHG cline by ~10 kya, and the formation of the population on its eastern terminus (Transbaikal_EMN) through admixture between Amur River and Inland East Asian ancestries. Panel C shows the emergence of Cisbaikal_LNBA and Yakutia_LNBA in genetic turnovers in the Cis-Baikal and Northeastern Siberian regions in the Mid-Holocene, and the genetic diversity of Seima-Turbino period individuals ~4.0 kya. Panel D shows the genetic gradient between West Eurasian ancestry and Yakutia_LNBA formed by present-day Uralic populations, along with all locations from which present-day populations with Cisbaikal_LNBA ancestry were sampled (grey dots ringed with black), alongside the geographic locations of two late Bronze Age/early Iron Age individuals (grey dots ringed with yellow) with >90% Cisbaikal_LNBA ancestry.

Details of populations created by the grouping procedure applied to individuals in Northeastern Siberia.

Central Siberian populations from the Yenisei Basin (including Kets and South Siberian Turks) are highlighted in brown, while Arctic North American and Asian populations on either side of the Bering Straits populations are highlighted in blue. Bering Straits populations that are heavily European-admixed (Aleut and Yukagir_forest) are colored dark blue, while Samoyedic populations (Enets, Selkup, and Nganasan) are colored violet. Despite the similarity of the APS-rich populations in this comparison (all being admixtures between APS ancestry and East Asian ancestry), present-day groups of the Bering Straits are always closer to groups with “Route 2” APS ancestry (i.e., Kolyma_M_10.1 kya → Dzhilinda1_8.4 kya → Syalakh-Belkachi → Yakutia_LNBA), while Central Siberian populations of the Yenisei Basin are always closer to Cisbaikal_LNBA.

China_Paleolithic includes the Tianyuan and Amur_River_33K genomes, “East Eurasian Population” is some population grouping in Siberia or Northeast Asia other than Yakutia_LNBA, and X are Admixed Inner Eurasian populations (AIEA populations) including ancient Central Asian nomads from the Late Bronze to Iron Age down to the Scytho-Sarmatian period, as well as modern or ancient populations that speak languages from the Yukaghiric, Yeniseian (Kets), Uralic, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and Nivkh language families. Modern Uralic-speaking populations, and ancient putatively Uralic-speaking populations uniformly prefer Yakutia_LNBA to other East Asian ancestries no matter the other population used in the comparison. Furthermore, at any level of admixture between East and West Eurasian ancestries, the population with the greatest affinity to Yakutia_LNBA is always a Uralic-speaking population. f4-statistics therefore highlight the connection between Uralic populations and Yakutia_LNBA ancestry over other sources of East Asian ancestry.

Acute inflammation is an essential response that our bodies use to combat infections1. However, in the absence of infections, chronic inflammation can have a pivotal role in the onset and progression of chronic diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, autoimmune disorders, metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), and most ageing-associated pathologies2,3. The underlying mechanisms that distinguish chronic inflammation from its acute counterpart remain unclear, posing challenges to the development of targeted therapies for these major diseases. Here we identify a mechanism that separates the two responses: during chronic but not acute inflammation, chromatin remodelling is influenced by nuclear autophagy, in which the WSTF protein of the ISWI chromatin-remodelling complex interacts with the ATG8 autophagy protein family in the nucleus. This interaction leads to WSTF nuclear export and subsequent degradation by autophagosomes and lysosomes in the cytoplasm. Loss of WSTF leads to chromatin opening over inflammatory genes, amplifying inflammation. Cell-penetrating peptides that block the WSTF–ATG8 interaction do not affect acute inflammation but suppress chronic inflammation in senescence as well as in MASH and osteoarthritis in mouse models and patient samples. The ability to specifically target chronic inflammation without blunting acute inflammation offers an approach for treating common chronic inflammatory diseases.

In the past decade, hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered in extremely short orbits below 10 days. Unlike in the Solar System, planets in these systems orbit their host stars close enough to disturb the stellar magnetic field lines1. The interaction can enhance the magnetic activity of the star, such as its chromospheric2 and radio3 emission or flaring4. So far, the search for magnetic star–planet interactions has remained inconclusive. Here we report the detection of planet-induced flares on HIP 67522, a 17 million-year-old G dwarf star with two known close-in planets5,6. Combining space-borne photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and dedicated Characterising Exoplanets Telescope observations over 5 years, we find that the 15 flares in HIP 67522 cluster near the transit phase of the innermost planet, indicating persistent magnetic star–planet interaction in the system. The stability of interaction implies that the innermost planet is continuously self-inflicting a six times higher flare rate than it would experience without interaction. The subsequent flux of energetic radiation and particles bombarding HIP 67522 b may explain the remarkably extended atmosphere of the planet, recently detected with the James Webb Space Telescope7. HIP 67522 is, therefore, an archetype to understand the impact of magnetic star–planet interaction on the atmospheres of nascent exoplanets.

Blue scatter shows the 2-min TESS PDC_SAP flux. Light blue shades show the batman36 transit models of HIP 67522 b. Orange vertical lines mark the detected flares, and grey hatched area mark the best-fit window of elevated flare rate.

Yellow lines show the polynomial fit including the batman36 transit model of HIP 67522 b, highlighted with a blue shade. Each bottom panel shows the residual light curve with the polynomial model and transit removed. The flare template was fit within the orange highlighted region.

Top panels show the PIPE reduced 10-s cadence imagette light curves as blue scatter. Yellow lines show the polynomial fit including the batman36 transit model of HIP 67522 b, highlighted with a blue shade. Each bottom panel highlights flares within the orange shaded regions, which are reintroduced into the residual light curve (blue scatter).

The values for both statistics converge above 75 orbital phase bins, indicating that the phases are sufficiently resolved.

Estimate of planet-induced power (overlapping blue solid lines) as a function of highest possible induced flare energy \({E}_{\max }\). Lower lines indicate a smaller lower limit for the energy of planet-induced flares in the range 1032 − 1033 erg. Below this limit, flares cannot be distinguished from X-ray quiescent emission28. The flares on HIP 67522 are distributed following a power law distribution with slope <2, so that the total power integrated over the distribution is determined by the high energy tail of the distribution, i.e., by \({E}_{\max }\). The measured power is incompatible with the power expected from the Alfvén wing star-planet interaction mechanism1 (blue shade), and must therefore tap into a different energy source, e.g., the energy stored in pre-flare coronal loops. The X-ray quiescent emission indicates an estimate of the energy budget available to the interaction (dotted line).

Estimate of mass loss rate from HIP 67522 b due to CMEs as a function of opening angle and efficiency η, assuming all CMEs intercept the planet's location. The shaded region marks the range of typical opening angles of solar CMEs34. The orange line highlights the assumed efficiency factor of η = 0.1, and the black dashed line indicates a 100% increase in mass loss rate compared to XUV-driven mass loss only.

Flare frequency distributions of G dwarf stars with rotation periods 0.27 − 5.41 d, and effective temperatures 5113 − 5916 K with at least three flares observed with TESS44, excluding known eclipsing binaries from52. We set the upper limit on the flare rates λ0 and λ1 conservatively to 2 d−1 (horizontal dashed line) above the minimum flare energy in the sample (vertical dashed line). Note that the44 sample still likely contains binary stars, such that the true flare rate of some stars is lower than shown.

Although most mammalian transcriptional enhancers regulate their cognate promoters over distances of tens of kilobases, some enhancers act over distances in the megabase range1. The sequence features that enable such long-distance enhancer–promoter interactions remain unclear. Here we used in vivo enhancer-replacement experiments at the mouse Shh locus to show that short- and medium-range limb enhancers cannot initiate gene expression at long-distance range. We identify a cis-acting element, range extender (REX), that confers long-distance regulatory activity and is located next to a long-range limb enhancer of Sall1. The REX element has no endogenous enhancer activity. However, addition of the REX to other short- and mid-range limb enhancers substantially increases their genomic interaction range. In the most extreme example observed, addition of REX increased the range of an enhancer by an order of magnitude from its native 73 kb to 848 kb. The REX element contains highly conserved [C/T]AATTA homeodomain motifs that are critical for its activity. These motifs are enriched in long-range limb enhancers genome-wide, including the ZRS (zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) regulatory sequence), a benchmark long-range limb enhancer of Shh2. The ZRS enhancer with mutated [C/T]AATTA motifs maintains limb activity at short range, but loses its long-range activity, resulting in severe limb reduction in knock-in mice. In summary, we identify a sequence signature associated with long-range enhancer–promoter interactions and describe a prototypical REX element that is necessary and sufficient to confer long-distance activation by remote enhancers.

Transcriptional enhancers are abundant cis-acting non-coding genomic elements that activate gene expression across different cell types of the organism in response to internal and external signals3,4,5,6,7. Enhancers often regulate their target promoters across long genomic distances1,2,8,9,10. Disruption of this long-range gene regulation often leads to diseases ranging from developmental anomalies to cancer8,11,12,13,14.

A central question in gene regulation is how remote enhancers precisely relay regulatory information to their target promoters located hundreds of thousands or even millions of base pairs away, often without affecting the expression of intervening genes. Enhancers come into physical proximity to activate target promoters, but the mechanisms that mediate these functionally important interactions are only partially understood1,15. Mounting evidence indicates that higher-order three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization and structural CTCF and cohesin proteins support enhancer–promoter (E–P) interactions by restricting E–P communication to topologically associating domains (TADs)16,17,18,19,20. However, the global disruption of higher-order 3D chromatin organization and loop extrusion in CTCF- and cohesin-depleted cells only partially impairs E–P communication and gene expression21,22,23,24,25. Furthermore, developmental gene expression is also surprisingly robust to CTCF-binding-site deletions and structural perturbations affecting TADs26,27,28,29,30,31. Thus, which additional genetic factors establish and maintain long-range E–P communication during mammalian development remains poorly understood1,13,15,32. Identifying such factors is crucial for achieving an in-depth understanding of developmental processes and delineating disease mechanisms linked to disruption of long-range gene regulation.

Here we identify a unique sequence signature comprising [C/T]AATTA homeodomain (HD) motifs that mediates long-range E–P communication in developing limb buds. Deletion of these motifs selectively abolishes distal enhancer activity but not its short-range ability. The [C/T]AATTA motifs are enriched at long-distance limb enhancer loci genome-wide and their presence correlates with E–P distance. We also characterize an extreme case in which the [C/T]AATTA motifs are located spatially separate from the enhancer within a genomic element, which we termed the REX element. The addition of the REX element can convert a short-range enhancer into a long-range enhancer that can act over 848 kb of genomic space. Our results indicate that short- or medium-range enhancers cannot function at long-distance range and establish that spatial specificity and long-distance activity are two separate and separable aspects of enhancer function.

To test the potential of short- and medium-range enhancers to act over long genomic distances, we performed a series of enhancer-replacement experiments at the Shh genomic locus. Limb-specific expression of Shh is controlled by the ZRS (also known as MFCS1), located at an extreme distance of about 848 kb from its target promoter in mice2. Mice deficient for the ZRS do not initiate any Shh expression in developing limb buds and display truncated limb phenotypes that are indistinguishable from those of mice with complete loss of SHH function in the limb33. Owing to the clear phenotypic readout and lack of redundancy, ZRS-Shh is an ideal locus for assessing the long-range enhancer activity of transplanted enhancers.

To perform enhancer-replacement experiments, we selected four previously characterized developmental limb enhancers from other genomic loci on the basis of their ability to drive robust LacZ reporter expression in the developing limb bud mesenchyme (MM1492 and MM1564 (from mouse) and HS1516 and HS72 (from human); Fig. 1a,b). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers also drive LacZ reporter expression in the ZPA, a posterior domain of the limb mesenchyme where ZRS activates Shh gene expression (Fig. 1b). All four enhancers are evolutionarily conserved and marked by acetylation at lysine 27 in histone H3 (H3K27ac) in limb buds, a histone modification that is associated with active enhancers (Fig. 1a). To determine the genomic distance at which these enhancers act on their native promoters and to ensure that they are accessible to transcription factors (TFs) in the same cell types as the ZRS, we performed single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing (snATAC–seq) and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) multiome profiling of 14,000 cells from a wild-type (WT) embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) hindlimb bud (Methods). After clustering all 14,000 cells on the basis of their chromatin and gene expression profiles, we annotated 16 clusters representing all major cell types in the developing limb bud (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). The HS72, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers display strong DNA accessibility in Shh positive ZPA cells, consistent with their ability to drive robust reporter expression in posterior limb mesenchyme in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 1a).

The number of embryos that exhibited the representative limb phenotype over the total number of embryos with the genotype is indicated. Further details, including hindlimb analysis, are provided in Extended Data Fig. 2. Scale bars, 1 mm (b (left) and e (right)), 250 μm (b, right) and 500 μm (e, left).

To link limb enhancers to their putative target genes, we used the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from multiome profiling and E–P physical interaction data based on tissue-resolved high-resolution enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Methods). We identified Prdm16 as the target for MM1492 (73 kb away), Ets2 as the target for mHS1516 (mouse homologue of HS1516) (147 kb away) and Sall1 as the target for mHS72 (mouse homologue of HS72) (411 kb away) (Fig. 1c). We then manually matched enhancer activity and the expression patterns of genes located within the same TADs in E11.5 mouse embryos. This analysis confirmed the above E–P links and additionally identified Rbms1 as a putative target for MM1564 (177 kb away; Fig. 1b,c).

We next used genome editing to create a series of knock-in (KI) mice in which the functionally critical 1.3-kb region of the ZRS (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) was replaced with selected limb bud enhancers from other genomic loci. Notably, replacing the mouse ZRS with HS72, MM1564, HS1516 or MM1492 limb enhancers resulted in a loss of detectable Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 1e). To assess the extent to which replacing the ZRS with a heterologous limb enhancer affects in vivo development, we examined the skeletal morphology in E18.5 KI mice. Consistent with the loss of limb-specific Shh expression, all four KI mouse strains displayed a truncated limb phenotype affecting both the forelimbs and hindlimbs. The limb phenotypes were indistinguishable from the phenotype caused by replacement of the ZRS with a nonfunctional control sequence of similar length (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2c). These results indicate that, despite the presence of bona fide enhancer features capable of driving strong limb gene expression in the context of a transgene, all four enhancers lack long-range activity and cannot support Shh-mediated limb development.

It is possible that silencing of the inserted region or failure of the insertions to create an open chromatin environment explains the inability of transplanted regions to act as long-range enhancers34,35. To test whether enhancers maintain their endogenous chromatin architecture at a remote ectopic location, we performed ATAC–seq experiments in ZPA region of forelimb and hindlimb buds of E11.5 mice heterozygous for the ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 KI alleles.

HS72 and HS1516 are human enhancers that are highly conserved in mice but contain substitutions that allow discrimination of ATAC–seq reads from transplanted human and orthologous endogenous mouse enhancers (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 3). ZRSHS72 and ZRSHS1516 heterozygous mice formed normal limbs (Extended Data Fig. 2d), which enabled us to directly compare chromatin accessibility at the transplanted enhancer allele and the WT ZRS enhancer allele in fully developed limb bud tissue of the same mouse. Allele-specific ATAC–seq profiles demonstrated that both transplanted enhancers and orthologous mouse enhancers had an accessible open chromatin architecture (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that the heterologous HS72 and HS1516 limb enhancers were accessible when transplanted, but were unable to activate gene expression remotely, further supporting the idea that their inability to activate the Shh promoter in ZRS-replacement experiments is due to limitations in their genomic interaction range.

Statistical analysis was performed using two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum tests with no adjustments for multiple comparisons; **P = 0.000311. Scale bars, 1 mm (b (left) and c) and 250 μm (b, right).

The inability of heterologous limb enhancers to activate Shh expression was surprising, given their robust enhancer features and ability to establish open chromatin at the transplanted location. Previously, all four limb enhancers were characterized in transgenic mice using a well-established hsp68 minimal promoter, but their compatibility with the Shh promoter is unclear. To test whether E–P incompatibility36,37 could have a role in the observed differences in gene activation, we placed the HS72 enhancer upstream of the mouse Shh promoter and the LacZ reporter gene and injected the resulting construct into fertilized mouse eggs. All transgenic mouse embryos (7 out of 7) displayed strong LacZ expression in the limb buds, which was identical to HS72's activity with the hsp68 promoter, indicating that the HS72 enhancer is fully capable of activating the Shh promoter (Figs. 1a and 2b). Moreover, we previously showed that 32 enhancers characterised with the hsp68 promoter maintained their in vivo activity when tested with the Shh promoter38,39,40.

To test whether the HS72 enhancer can activate gene expression at the endogenous Shh locus, we generated a KI line in which the HS72 enhancer sequence was inserted around 2 kb upstream of the endogenous Shh promoter (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). Preaxial polydactyly (formation of extra digits) provides a sensitive and readily accessible phenotypic readout of ectopic Shh misexpression beyond the ZPA of the developing limb2,41. As HS72 is active more broadly than the ZRS in limb mesenchyme, the presence of polydactyly would indicate that it can activate functional SHH signalling. Indeed, ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT mice had polydactylous forelimbs and hindlimbs and de novo Shh expression in anterior hindlimb buds consistent with the HS72 enhancer driving expanded Shh activity42 (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b). This result was similar to the polydactyly observed in transgenic mice in which the HS72::Shh transgene was integrated at a safe-harbour location in the mouse genome (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Importantly, ZRSHS72/WT mice had normal limbs, indicating the absence of broad HS72-mediated Shh activation from a remote position (Extended Data Fig. 2d). Together, these results show that the HS72 enhancer can activate the Shh promoter at short range in its native endogenous context and in the context of a transgene.

The HS72 enhancer is compatible with the Shh promoter and is accessible when transplanted in place of the ZRS (Fig. 2) suggesting that its failure to activate Shh remotely could be due to the extreme distance from the Shh promoter. Indeed, the HS72, MM1564, HS1516 and MM1492 enhancers lie closer to their putative target genes than the ZRS (Fig. 1c). We hypothesized that there may be additional functional sequences associated with distant-acting enhancers that support long-range activation. To explore possible missing factors in long-distance activation, we examined the genomic region proximal to the HS72 enhancer, which has the longest native activity range among four heterologous enhancers at 411 kb away from the Sall1 promoter (Fig. 1c). We identified a highly conserved block of sequence located adjacent to the HS72 enhancer (Fig. 3a). This sequence is not required to drive limb-specific activity in reporter assays (Figs. 1b and 2b and Extended Data Fig. 4), but, owing to its strong conservation and position, we hypothesized that this sequence might support enhancer activity, including the ability to activate gene expression over remote distances. To test this hypothesis, we generated KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer that included this highly conserved upstream sequence (Fig. 3b).

a, An evolutionary conserved element of unknown function is located adjacent to the human HS72 enhancer. The HS72 enhancer region is shown together with evolutionary conservation tracks. b, Replacement of the ZRS with an extended version of the HS72 enhancer (chromosome 16: 51623658–51625572; hg38) containing the REX element results in initiation of Shh expression in developing limb buds and full limb outgrowth in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX KI mice. Hindlimb and E11.5 Shh expression analysis is shown in Extended Data Fig. 5. c, The REX element lacks classical enhancer activity in E11.5 transgenic embryos when placed upstream of the Shh promoter and lacZ reporter gene. The number of transgenic embryos with no LacZ activity in the limb over the total number of transgenic embryos is indicated. d, Replacement of the ZRS with a chimeric cis-regulatory element consisting of the short-range MM1492 enhancer and the REX element from the HS72 enhancer region results in the initiation of Shh expression in developing limb buds full limb outgrowth in ZRSMM1492+REX/MM1492+REX KI mice. The stars indicate extra digits (polydactyly). Hindlimb Shh expression analysis is provided in Extended Data Fig. 5. Scale bars, 1 mm (c (left) and b and d (right)), 500 μm (b and d, middle) and 250 μm (c, right).

Consistent with our prediction, addition of this uncharacterized sequence, which we termed the REX element, to the transplanted HS72 enhancer was sufficient to initiate Shh expression in the limb and resulted in full limb outgrowth with formation of all distal limb elements including fully formed zeugopod and autopod in ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice (Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 5a). ZRSHS72+REX/HS72+REX mice also displayed polydactyly on both forelimbs and hindlimbs, consistent with ectopic Shh expression in limb buds driven by broader HS72 enhancer activity (Figs. 1b and 2b,c and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c).

Notably, the REX element alone does not act as a classical enhancer. When placed upstream of the minimal promoter in a transgene, it is unable to drive LacZ reporter expression in transgenic mouse embryos (Fig. 3c). Together, these results indicate that the REX element does not have enhancer activity on its own but is required for long-range heterologous enhancer activation at the Shh locus.

To test whether the REX element can extend the range of heterologous short-range enhancers, we generated a KI mouse line in which the ZRS was replaced with a chimeric element consisting of the shortest-range heterologous limb enhancer from our test set (MM1492, 73 kb native E—P range) appended by the REX element (MM1492 + REX; Extended Data Fig. 5d). KI of this chimeric element was sufficient to induce Shh expression in the limb bud and resulted in a fully developed zeugopod and autopod in the ZRSMM1492+REX/MM1492+REX mice (Fig. 3d and Extended Data Fig. 5e). These mice also displayed polydactyly, consistent with broad limb activity of MM1492. Taken together, these experiments show that combining a short-range enhancer with the REX element and placing them at an ectopic remote location is sufficient to induce long-range gene activation. These results also suggest that the REX element can act in a modular manner to facilitate long-range enhancer action.

To identify specific TFs that may be involved in REX-mediated long-range enhancer action, we examined potential TF-binding sites within the REX element. The REX element lacks CTCF and YY1 motifs and is not bound by CTCF in embryonic limb buds (Extended Data Fig. 6j). We scanned the REX element sequence for other candidate TF-binding sites and identified conserved motifs of which the sequences matched binding preferences for LHX2 and LHX9 homeodomain (HD) TFs as well as LEF1 (Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 6a).

Only the farthest target gene (within 2 Mb range) was considered for each enhancer. TF motifs are grouped by their similarity. [C/T]AATTA HD motifs are highlighted by red shading.

Further details are provided in the Methods and Extended Data Fig. 6, and a complete list of motifs is provided in Supplementary Table 2. e, The distribution of E–P distances for VISTA limb enhancers assigned target genes by either Hi-C or Multiome (n = 233) with 0–1 or ≥2 conserved [C/T]AATTA HD motifs.

The counts for each group are displayed in the outlined boxes at the base of the plot. The box plot shows the interquartile range (IQR; quartile 1 to quartile 3) (box limits), the median (centre line) and the minimum (Q1 − 1.5 × IQR) and maximum (Q3 + 1.5 × IQR) values (whiskers). Scale bars, 1 mm (b and c).

To determine the importance of LHX and LEF1 motifs for REX function, we generated two KI mice in which the ZRS was replaced with the extended HS72 sequence containing the REX element with either the single LEF1 motif or both LHX motifs mutagenized. Mice containing the REX element with mutated LEF1 motif showed fully developed limbs with polydactyly indicating that disruption of the LEF1 motif does not abolish long-range activity of the REX element (Fig. 4b). However, disrupting both LHX motifs resulted in mice with truncated limbs, indicative of a loss of Shh expression in the limb bud (Fig. 4c and Extended Data Fig. 6b). Together, these results demonstrate that the LHX motifs in the REX element are required for its ability to facilitate long-range enhancer activity at Shh locus.

To investigate whether the LHX or other TF motifs are present at long-range limb enhancers, we used a collection of experimentally validated limb enhancers from the VISTA Enhancer Browser, a unique resource of human and mouse enhancers with in vivo activities characterized in transgenic mice43. We linked these bona fide limb enhancers to their putative target genes using the correlation between gene expression and open chromatin peaks from our single-cell ATAC–seq (scATAC–seq) and scRNA-seq experiment or E–P physical interactions from enhancer-capture Hi-C experiments (Extended Data Fig. 1d). We next performed motif analysis of these limb enhancers. We found 33 motifs that match the binding preferences of limb-expressed TFs that are significantly enriched in long-range acting (173 regions; E–P distance, 400 kb to 2 Mb) compared to short-range acting (28 regions; E–P distance, 10–200 kb) enhancer regions (false-discovery-rate-adjusted P < 1 × 10−2 and target frequency > 30%), with LHX2 and LHX9 being among the most significantly enriched (Fig. 4d, Extended Data Fig. 6d,e and Supplementary Table 2). Overall, HD TFs with a similar [C/T]AATTA consensus binding preference, including DLX5, MSX2 and SHOX2, comprised 10 out of these 33 motifs. By contrast, short-range limb enhancers showed no enrichment for TF motifs over long-range enhancers.

We next examined all 19,276 limb mesenchyme E–P pairs predicted from our scATAC–seq/scRNA-seq experiment (Extended Data Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 2). Genome wide, the LHX2 motif was among the most significantly enriched in long-range versus short-range limb enhancers (CTAATTA, P < 6 × 10−32). Overall, [C/T]AATTA HD motifs, including both LHX2 and LHX9 motifs, comprised 15 out of the top 20 most significantly enriched motifs in long-range limb enhancers.

The REX element contains two conserved LHX [C/T]AATTA motifs located within 30 bp from each other that are required for long range enhancer activity (Fig. 4a,c). To test whether having more than one [C/T]AATTA motif could be characteristic of other long-range enhancers, we examined the number of [C/T]AATTA motifs in experimentally validated and multiome-predicted limb enhancers (Methods). Indeed, for limb enhancers containing more than one [C/T]AATTA motif the enhancer regions were on average 429 kb farther (median distance) from their target promoters than other limb enhancers (P < 0.01; Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 6f–i). Taken together, these results indicate that conserved [C/T]AATTA HD motifs are enriched in long-distance limb enhancers throughout the genome and are frequently located within the conserved core of enhancers themselves (Extended Data Fig. 6k).

We next examined whether [C/T]AATTA motifs located inside enhancers are specifically required for their long-range enhancer activity. The ZRS enhancer region contains four previously uncharacterized [C/T]AATTA motifs, three of which are located within the conserved core and are evolutionary conserved across all jawed vertebrates (Fig. 5a). To test their requirement for spatiotemporal limb-specific ZRS activity, we used dual-enSERT, our recently developed dual-fluorescence reporter system that enables comparison of enhancer allele activities in the same mouse44. We generated a construct in which a WT approximately 1.3 kb mouse ZRS drives mCherry and the same ZRS allele but with mutated [C/T]AATTA HD motifs (ZRSΔHD), drives eGFP. The transgenes were separated by a synthetic insulator to prevent reporter gene cross-activation. We left all other TF-binding sites that were previously shown to be important for ZRS enhancer activity intact, including ETS1, ETV, HOX and E-BOX motifs (Fig. 5a). We injected the resulting ZRS–mCherry/ZRSΔHD–eGFP bicistronic construct into mouse zygotes and collected transgenic embryos at E11.5. We detected mCherry and eGFP fluorescence in the ZPA, indicating that the ZRS enhancer lacking [C/T]AATTA motifs can act over short range and drive robust reporter expression (Fig. 5b,c and Extended Data Fig. 7c,d). We obtained a similar result when we swapped fluorescent reporter genes, ruling out the influence of fluorophores on our observations (Fig. 5c). While both the ZRS and ZRSΔHD directed expression in a spatially highly restricted manner to the ZPA, ZRSΔHD showed lower, albeit not statistically significant, quantitative activity than the ZRS regardless of the fluorescent reporter pairing. This may be due to the close proximity of [C/T]AATTA HD motifs to the ETS sites, which are critical for ZRS activity45. Importantly, we observed only mCherry expression and no detectable eGFP expression in transgenic mice lacking enhancer upstream of the eGFP, indicating that there is no reporter cross-activation (P < 0.0182; Fig. 5c and Extended Data Fig. 7b).

Scale bars, 250 μm (b) and 1 mm (d and e).

Having established that disruption of [C/T]AATTA motifs does not abolish limb enhancer activity in a reporter assay, we examined whether these motifs are required for long-distance E–P communication. We created a KI mouse line in which we disrupted the same three [C/T]AATTA motifs within the endogenous ZRS enhancer region. Notably, disrupting the [C/T]AATTA motifs alone resulted in a loss of limb outgrowth indistinguishable from complete loss of SHH function in the limb consistent with the specific requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long-range ZRS activity (Figs. 1d and 5d). The loss of limb outgrowth in ZRS∆HD/∆HD mice could be almost completely rescued by addition of the REX element; mice containing the ZRSΔHD allele fused to the REX element fully developed zeugopod and part of the autopod with four digits on both forelimbs and hindlimbs (Fig. 5e).

Taken together, our KI and transgenic results indicate that [C/T]AATTA HD motifs in the ZRS are dispensable for limb-specific activity at short range, but are critically required for long-range activity. These experiments uncouple the marked tissue specificity of the ZRS, directing highly restricted expression to the ZPA, from its ability to act over extremely long genomic distances. Our results also indicate that the loss of long-range enhancer activity after the removal of endogenous [C/T]AATTA HD motifs could be compensated by addition of a heterologous REX element, demonstrating that the [C/T]AATTA HD motifs found in the REX element and the ZRS are functionally equivalent.

Here we have identified an evolutionarily conserved signature that is specifically required to confer long-distance E–P communication at the Shh genomic locus. We also describe a prototypical element containing this signature, REX, that is sufficient to confer long-distance interactivity to heterologous short- and medium-range limb enhancers. This finding reveals a fundamental aspect of enhancer function that cannot be measured in traditional transgenic reporter experiments and provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for previous observations that linear distance can impact an enhancer's ability to activate gene expression46,47,48.

Cis-regulatory elements that facilitate enhancer activity continue to emerge as essential regulators of gene expression. This list includes Drosophila tethering49,50,51 and remote control elements52 along with mammalian CTCF sites28,53,54,55,56,57, CpG islands58 and facilitator elements59,60. The REX element adds to this list but it does not share sequence similarity with any of the previously described elements. Both the REX element and the ZRS enhancer contain highly conserved [C/T]AATTA-binding sites that are required for long-range activation. Our experiments showing the preferential requirement of [C/T]AATTA motifs for long- but not short-range enhancer activity suggest that their cognate TFs could specifically mediate long-range E–P activation but may not be critical for general transcriptional activation. The [C/T]AATTA motifs match the binding preferences of many HD TFs, notably the LIM-HD TFs LHX2 and LHX9 that are required for normal limb outgrowth61,62. Indeed, LIM-domain-associated TFs such as GATA1, ISL1 and LHX2 are known to facilitate E–P looping at the β-globin locus as well as the assembly of interchromosomal olfactory gene compartments through their cofactor LIM-domain-binding factor (LDB1)63,64,65,66. However, their general role in regulating long-range E–P interactions is currently an area of open investigation67,68. Global enrichment of [C/T]AATTA HD motifs in long-distance enhancers suggests that there are probably more REX elements across the genome, with many of them integrated into the enhancer itself, as we showed with the ZRS (Fig. 5f).

As our enhancer-substitution experiments were performed at the Shh locus, we cannot rule out the potential impact of locus-specific effects on our findings. Further investigation into long- versus short-range enhancer activity at other genomic loci and across different cell types will be necessary to understand how widespread REX elements are in mammalian genomes and to dissect the molecular mechanism of REX element function. Nevertheless, our results suggest that cell-type specificity and long-range activity are two distinct aspects of gene activation by enhancers, probably fulfilled by separate sets of TFs. This separation will have implications for interpretation of human genetics studies as some non-coding variants will probably affect only long-range enhancer ability while others will disrupt cell-type-specific gene activation.

The animal work conducted in this study was reviewed and approved by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Animal Welfare and Research Committee and University of California Irvine Laboratory Animal Resources (ULAR) under protocols AUP-20-001 and AUP-23-005. Mice were housed in the animal facility, where their conditions were electronically monitored continuously with daily visual checks by technicians.

The FVB/NCrl strain Mus musculus (Charles River) was used for all breeding experiments and mouse embryonic tissue collection. Mice were mated using a standard timed breeding strategy and E10.5, E11.5, E13.5 and E18.5 embryos along with postnatal day 0 (P0) neonates of both sexes were collected for staining or dissection using approved institutional protocols. Embryonic litters were kept on ice and processed one at a time to avoid degradation during collection. Embryos at unexpected developmental stages were excluded from the study. Breedings were set up and litters collected until a minimum threshold was met (two embryos for phenotyping experiments and three embryos for statistical analysis related experiments) for each genotype of interest with all embryos acquired above that threshold processed as well. No randomization was needed for the experiments presented. The authors were blinded to embryo genotypes during embryo collection, and genotyping was performed afterwards.

All KI and transgenic targeting constructs in this study were generated using Gibson Assembly cloning (New England Biolabs). Sequences of all targeting constructs are provided in supplementary data. Before microinjections all targeting vectors were validated using whole-plasmid sequencing (Plasmidsaurus). KI mouse strains carrying replaced enhancer alleles were generated using a modified CRISPR–Cas9 pronuclear microinjection protocol71,72. KI enhancers were chosen on the basis of evidence of strong limb bud activity in reporter constructs41,43,73,74.

The enhancers that were used for KI analysis were as follows: HS72 (chromosome 16: 51623899–51624805; hg38), MM1564 (chromosome 2: 60785660–60787563; mm10), HS1516 (chromosome 21: 38989433–38991200; hg38) and MM1492 (chromosome 4: 154707415–154711162; mm10). In brief, we used previously described sgRNA and donor vectors containing heterologous enhancers surrounded by homology arms, targeting the ZRS enhancer region (chromosome 5: 29314497–29315844; mm10) and new sgRNA and donor vector targeting the Shh promoter proximal region71,72 (Extended Data Figs. 2a, 4d and 7e,f). KI mice were generated by injecting a mix of Cas9 protein (IDT, final concentration of 25 ng μl−1), sgRNA (IDT, 50 ng μl−1) and donor plasmids (7.5–25 ng μl−1) in an injection buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 0.1 mM EDTA) into the cytoplasm of FVB embryos according to standard procedures. Female mice (strain CD-1) were used as foster mothers. F0 mice were genotyped using PCR and Sanger sequencing as previously described using primers outlined in Supplementary Table 4 (ref. 40). For the HS72 KI, the barcoded fragments were not included so primer pairs F1 + R8 and F6 + R7 were used instead of F1 + R1 and F2 + R2. Only founders carrying a single-copy KI at the ZRS locus were used for breeding40. A KI mouse strain carrying part of the lacZ sequence in place of the ZRS was previously generated71.

The HS72-Shh-promoter::lacZ construct was created by introducing the HS72 enhancer (chromosome 16: 51623899–51624805; hg38) into the hsp68-promoter-lacZ reporter vector72 followed by replacement of the hsp68 promoter with the mouse Shh promoter (chromosome 5: 28466764–28467284; mm10). The REX-Shh-promoter::lacZ construct was created by introducing the REX element into the PCR4-Shh-promoter::lacZ-H11 vector (Addgene, 139098)40. The sequence used for the REX element was extended to include the entire conserved block (Extended Data Fig. 5d) to more thoroughly test the enhancer activity of the fragment. The HS72-Shh-promoter::Shh construct was created by cloning the HS72 enhancer followed by the mouse Shh promoter and Shh ORF into the PCR4-Shh-promoter::lacZ-H11 vector in the opposite orientation relative to the lacZ reporter gene. ZRS–mCherry/Empty–eGFP, ZRS–mCherry/ZRS∆HD–eGFP and ZRS∆HD–mCherry/ZRS–eGFP were generated by inserting WT ZRS and ZRS∆HD sequences into the dual-enSERT-2.2 plasmid (Addgene, 211942)44.

Transgenic mice carrying enhancer-reporter transgenes were created using random transgenesis (HS72-Shh-promoter::lacZ construct) or site-directed enSERT or dual enSERT transgenesis (REX-Shh-promoter::lacZ, HS72-Shh-promoter::Shh, and ZRS–mCherry/ZRS∆HD–eGFP and ZRS∆HD–mCherry/ZRS–eGFP constructs) as previously described40,44,75,76. After pronuclear microinjections (below), F0 embryos were collected at E11.5 and processed for LacZ staining (HS72-Shh-promoter::lacZ and REX-Shh-promoter::lacZ), fluorescence imaging (ZRS–mCherry/ZRS∆HD–eGFP, ZRS–mCherry/Empty–eGFP and ZRS∆HD–mCherry/ZRS–eGFP) or at E13.5 to analyse limb morphology (HS72-Shh-promoter::Shh). Transgenic embryos were genotyped by PCR and Sanger sequencing as previously described40,44. The sequences of enhancer alleles and plasmids are provided in the Supplementary Information.

The Shh transcript distribution in E10.5 and E11.5 mouse embryonic limb buds was assessed by whole-mount in situ hybridization as previously described72. E10.5 or E11.5 embryos were collected and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), cleansed in PBT (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20) before being dehydrated through a methanol series to be preserved in 100% methanol. For in situ hybridization, the embryos were rehydrated, washed with PBT and then bleached with 6% H2O2/PBT for 15 min before being washed again with PBT. The samples were then permeabilized for 15 min with 10 μg ml−1 of proteinase K in PBT, inactivated for 5 min in 2 mg ml−1 glycine/PBT, rinsed twice with PBT and refixed for 20 min 0.2% glutaraldehyde/4% PFA in PBT. After fixation, the embryos were with PBT (×3, 15 min) and incubated in prehybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 5× SSC, pH 4.5, 2% Roche blocking reagent, 0.1% Tween-20, 0.5% CHAPS, 50 mg ml−1 yeast RNA, 5 mM EDTA and 50 mg ml−1 heparin) for 1 h at 70 °C, before overnight incubation in hybridization buffer containing 1 mg ml−1 digoxigenin-labelled antisense riboprobes at 70 °C with gentle rotation. Dig-labelled riboprobes recognizing Shh were in vitro synthesized using the RNA Labelling Mix (Roche) and T3 RNA polymerase (Roche). Next, the embryos were washed multiple times in hybridization buffer with increasing concentrations of 2× SCC pH 4.5 finished with two washes with 2× SCC, 0.1% CHAPS. The embryos were next incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in 20 μg ml−1 RNase A in 2× SSC, 0.1% CHAPS before being washed in maleic acid buffer (100 mM maleic acid disodium salt hydrate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) (twice for 10 min at room temperature and twice for 30 min at 70 °C). The embryos were then transitioned to TBST (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris-HCl, 1% Tween-20, pH 7.5) to prepare for an hour long blocking in 10% lamb serum/TBST and an overnight incubation at 4 °C in 1% lamb serum containing anti-Dig-AP antibody (Roche, 1:5,000). The next morning, the embryos were washed three times with TBST for 5 min to remove excess antibody and then further washed five times with TBST for 1 h before being equilibrated in NTMT (100 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM MgCl2, 1% Tween-20, pH 9.5). Alkaline phosphatase activity was detected by incubating in BM purple reagent (Roche) at room temperature in the dark with gentle agitation. The reaction was halted with five PBT washes for 10 min before transitioning to 4% PFA in PBS for long-term storage. The embryos were imaged on the Flexacam C1 camera mounted onto the Leica M125C stereomicroscope.

Skeletal preparations were performed as previously described72. Embryos were collected at E18.5 or P0 and euthanized before overnight incubation in water at room temperature. The samples were then incubated in 65 °C water for 1 min before the epidermis and organs were removed. The samples were fixed in 95% ethanol for storage before staining according to a standard Alcian Blue/Alizarin Red protocol77. The samples were incubated for at least 24 h in Alcian Blue stain (15% Alcian Blue, 20% acetic acid in ethanol) followed by three washes with ethanol and an overnight ethanol incubation. Next, the samples were cleared in 1% KOH for 20 min followed by counter-staining with Alizarin Red (5% Alizarin Red in 1% KOH) for 4 h. The embryos were then further cleared with 1% KOH for 15 min followed by incubation in decreasing concentrations of 1% KOH and glycerol. The stained embryos were dissected in 80% glycerol and limbs were imaged at 1× using the ZEISS Stemi 508 microscope and the Axiocam 208 digital camera.

LacZ staining was conducted as previously described40. The embryos were collected at E11.5 and fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min before washing three times for 30 min in embryo wash buffer (2 mM MgCl2, 0.01% deoxycholate, 0.02% NP-40, 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.3). The embryos were then stained overnight in X-gal staining solution (0.8 mg ml−1 X-gal, 4 mM potassium ferrocyanide, 4 mM potassium ferricyanide, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 in wash buffer) to visualize LacZ activity. The next morning, the embryos were rinsed with PBS three times for 10 min and fixed again in 4% PFA. Images were recorded on the ZEISS Stemi 508 microscope with the Axiocam 208 digital camera.

The anterior and posterior parts of hindlimbs from ShhHS72(+2kb)/WT E11.5 embryos were dissected from each individual embryo. The tissue was dissociated with collagenase for 10 min at 37 °C, followed by three washes with 500 μl 0.04% BSA in PBS, resuspended in RNAProtect (Qiagen, 76104) and frozen at −80 °C. To isolate RNA, the samples were pelleted at 4 °C, lysed and column-extracted using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen, 74104). The samples were DNA digested in-column using DNase I (NEB, M0303S). cDNA was generated using the ProtoScript First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (NEB, E6300S). qPCR reactions were performed using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, 1725121) using the C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, 1845096). Then, .zpcr files were processed using the CFX Maestro Software (Bio-Rad) to extract cycle threshold values. Shh expression levels were normalized to the Gapdh housekeeping gene. Data were analysed using the rstatix package in R, with a Wilcoxon test used to determine statistical significance.

Posterior limb bud tissue containing the ZPA region from E11.5 mouse embryos was dissected and manually dissociated, followed by snap-freezing. After embryo genotyping, heterozygous embryos were processed for ATAC–seq. Library construction was performed using the Omni-ATAC–seq protocol78,79, with an adjusted lysis step and transposition buffer based on the Omni-ATAC protocol80. For the transposition reaction, nuclei were treated with Illumina Nextera transposase. The reaction was cleaned up using the Zymo DNA Clean and Concentrator kit, followed by preamplification of the transposed DNA using Nextera indexed primers with 5 cycles of PCR. The number of additional PCR cycles was determined by qPCR using 5 μl of a partially amplified library. The resulting library was cleaned using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and quantified by qPCR using the Kapa Sybr Fast universal for Illumina Genome Analyzer kit. The library size was determined using the Bioanalyzer 2100 DNA High Sensitivity Chip (Agilent). The library was sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system using 100 cycles and paired-end dual-index read chemistry. The version of NovaSeq control software used was NVCS v.1.6.0 with real-time analysis software RTA v.3.4.4.

Fastq files were trimmed and clipped using trim_galore (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) using the following options: -q 20 --stringency 2 --clip_R1 16 --clip_R2 16. Reads were then aligned to the original mm10 genome assembly and a modified version of the genome containing the corresponding insertion using bedtools getfasta81. As the human HS72 enhancer inserted on chromosome 5 has an orthologous region on chromosome 8 of the mouse genome, we also mapped the reads only to chromosome 5 of the mm10 genome containing the insertion and only to chromosome 8 of the mm10 genome and could verify that no reads coming from the insertion were lost at the mouse orthologous region. Reads mapping to the positive strand were shifted by +4 bp and reads mapping to the negative strand were shifted by −5 bp to correct for the Tn5 insertion bias using the Unix command awk. Genomic tracks were generated using bedtools genomecov81 by normalizing the mapped read counts to 1 million and dividing the read counts by two, except at the insertion sites.

Single-cell multiome ATAC–seq/RNA-seq was performed using a modified 10x protocol (10x Genomics, protocol CG000169 Rev D). WT mouse embryos were collected at E11.5. A single hindlimb bud was dissected in ice-cold PBS and incubated with collagenase II (Gibco, 17101015, 0.2 μl at 100 U μl−1) for 10 min at 37 °C. Every 5 min, hindlimb tissue was triturated using a P200 pipette for mechanical dissociation into single cells. Immediately after collagenase treatment, 10% FBS (450 μl) was added and dissociated cells were centrifuged. The supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold 10× nuclear lysis buffer (10x Genomics, protocol CG000169 Rev D) and incubated for 5 min on ice. Ice-cold wash buffer was added to the cells, lysed cells were centrifuged and the supernatant was removed. Nuclei were resuspended in an ice-cold wash buffer, quantified and inspected for viability using the Trypan Blue assay (Bio-Rad, 1450013). Nuclei were loaded at a concentration that would enable recovery of 10,000 nuclei using the 10x Chromium Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression kit (10X Genomics, 1000285). Paired-end sequencing was performed on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 system for approximately 52,000 and 26,000 reads per cell for RNA-seq and ATAC–seq, respectively.

Fastq files were aligned to the mm10 genome assembly and barcodes were counted using CellRanger ARC (v.2.0.2)82. Expression counts and chromatin peak matrices generated from CellRanger were further processed using the Signac R package83. The snATAC–seq dataset included a median of 31,000 reads and 14,200 high-quality fragments per cell, while the snRNA-seq dataset comprised a median of 68,000 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and 4,300 genes detected per cell. Low-quality nuclei were filtered out using standard Signac parameters and MACS2 was used for peak calling84. Transcriptome data were normalized and dimensionality was reduced using PCA (Seurat). DNA accessibility data were normalized using latent semantic indexing (Seurat). From the combined Seurat object, UMAP and nearest-neighbour analyses were performed to identify clusters with a resolution of 1 across 20 dimensions, as indicated by the ElbowPlot function, and based on their chromatin and gene expression profiles. Cell identities for the resulting 16 clusters were assigned using well-known marker genes from the literature and past scRNA-seq datasets85 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).

To link limb enhancers to their putative target genes, gene expression and open chromatin peaks (distance of 10 kb to 2 Mb) were correlated using the LinkPeaks function from Signac83. This function accounts for bias in GC content (as Tn5 transposase is inherently biased towards cutting GC-rich regions), overall accessibility and peak size. For analysis in Figs. 1 and 4 and Extended Data Fig. 6, we used enhancers that were open (accessibility > 1) and genes that were expressed (normalized expression > 0.25) in mesenchymal cells.

To assign putative target genes to MM1492, mHS1516m mHS72 and MM1564 enhancers that were used in KI experiments, we additionally used enhancer capture Hi-C data71. We further validated these putative target genes by comparing enhancer activity patterns and gene expression patterns from previously published whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments for Prmd1686, ETS286, Rbms187 and Sall188 to ensure that expression of the target gene overlapped with the region of enhancer activity.

A list of functionally validated limb enhancers was obtained from the VISTA enhancer browser43. To assign putative target genes for these enhancers, we used the multiome E–P assignments or enhancer capture Hi-C data71. Putative target genes were restricted to limb-expressed genes (curated from the hindlimb scRNA-seq (this study) and whole-limb bulk RNA-seq (Limb-Enhancer Genie89). For enhancers with multiple target genes, we considered the longest (or shortest; Extended Data Fig. 6) distance interaction followed by separation into two groups based on the distance between the enhancer and target gene: short-range (10 kb to 200 kb) and long-range (400 kb to 2 Mb). We then performed differential motif enrichment analysis using the findMotifsGenome.pl command in HOMER with a given size90 comparing short- and long-range E–P sets for (1) predicted E–P pairs for bona fide enhancers (using VISTA enhancer coordinates) and (2) predicted E–P pairs for putative limb enhancers defined by scATAC–seq. HOMER and JASPAR202291 motifs were used in the motif search. Only motifs for limb-expressed TFs, from the same list used to filter target genes, were considered in the analysis.

To detect [C/T]AATTA HD motifs within enhancers (Figs. 4 and 5 and Extended Data Fig. 6), we used MA0700.2.LHX2 and LHX9(Homeobox)/Hct116-LHX9.V5-ChIP-Seq (Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE116822) position weight matrices (PWMs) and the findMotifsGenome.pl command from HOMER. This was followed by filtering conserved motifs using the Genomic Scores package92 and phastCons60way.UCSC.mm10 dataset to an average conservation score of greater than zero. For the motif occurrences in Extended Data Fig. 6k, the conservation of each motif occurrence was analysed using the Table Browser93 tool with 100 Vert. Cons (phyloP100wayAll) for human sequences or Vertebrate Cons (phyloP30wayAll) for mouse sequences. Overlapping motif occurrences were collapsed into one region for subsequent analysis. Statistical significance was calculated using a Wilcoxon test.

The [C/T]AATTA HD motif regions within the ZRS were replaced with random sequences. FIMO94 was used to ensure that the mutagenized sequence does not have any [C/T]AATTA motif matches. Changes were as follows: GGATAATTGGTC>CGACGTCTGTAG (first HD site), AACTAATTAAGA>TCGACGGACACT (second HD site) and GACAAATTAGCC>AGGGACTGCTCT (third HD site). The resulting approximately 1.3 kb ZRSΔHD sequence was used for dual-enSERT and KI analysis (Fig. 5 and Extended Data Fig. 7). The presence of motifs in KI mice was confirmed through PCR (Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Figs. 2a and 7e,f) and Sanger sequencing.

For the REX element mutagenesis, the [C/T]AATTA HD motif regions or the LEF1 motif were replaced with random sequences within the KI targeting vector (Supplementary Information). Changes were as follows: ATCCTAATTGAAG>CCGACGTCTGTAG (first HD site) and ATTTGATTAGC>TTACAGCCCAG (second HD site) or ACTTTCATC>CTGTCGTCG (LEF1 site). Sequence changes in KI mice were confirmed using sanger sequencing and PCR using the primers F1, R1, F2 and R2.

Imaging of dual-enSERT embryos was conducted as previously described44. Embryos were imaged using the Zeiss V20 stereoscope equipped with a monochromatic camera (Axiocam 202, Zeiss), fibre optic light source (Zeiss, CL1500) and LED fluorescent laser (X-Cite, Xylis) emitting at 488 nm (eGFP) and 555 nm (mCherry) wavelengths. Merged images were created using the Zeiss Biolite Software.

For quantification, .czi files were imported into Fiji95. The region of interest, the ZPA, was defined around the brightest region of mCherry signal and applied to the GFP channel. A control region in anterior limb bud was also delineated to determine the background fluorescence of the embryo in each channel. The mean intensity was measured within both regions for both channels. The measurement for the background was subtracted from the region of interest to generate the mean intensity. For statistical analysis comparing the strength of the ZRS versus ZRS∆HD, the embryos with ZRS–mCherry/ZRS∆HD–eGFP (n = 2) and ZRS∆HD–mCherry/ZRS–eGFP (n = 1) were combined into one dataset (n = 3).

No previous analyses were used to determine sample size before experimentation. Embryos that were not at the correct developmental stage were excluded from data collection. For LacZ and skeletal Alcian Blue/Alizarin Red staining, embryos were identified by number and the researchers were blinded to the genotype. Statistical analysis was performed using the rstatix package. To determine the statistical significance of [C/T]AATTA motif enrichment and to compare the significance of the expression of Shh by qPCR, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used. For comparison of fluorescence intensity, significance was assessed using a two-sided pairwise t-test.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Xbox Hit With Layoffs and Game Cancellations as Microsoft Cuts 9,000 Jobs","https://www.wired.com/story/layoffs-game-cancelations-hit-xbox-as-microsoft-cuts-9000-jobs/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:33:00 GMT","

Major layoffs are rolling across Microsoft today, impacting game developers within Xbox across several studios and the projects they're working on, even as an executive at the company told staff more gamers are playing Xbox than ever before.

According to The Seattle Times, 9,000 employees, or 4 percent of Microsoft's workforce, are affected by the cuts, which started Wednesday morning. The full scope of layoffs within Microsoft's gaming divisions are still unknown.

“We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” Microsoft spokesperson Emily Pirt told WIRED. The company says that although gaming is impacted, it does not make up the majority of layoffs, and these cuts will affect people in different regions, tenure, and teams.

In a message to staff seen by WIRED, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said Xbox is following “Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness … I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before.” Employees whose roles are being eliminated are being encouraged to apply for other positions across Microsoft gaming, “where their applications will be given priority review.”

Spencer added that the company will “protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business.” Gaming teams across Microsoft are still learning how their roles will be affected, with some sources saying they have staff meetings scheduled later today.

Windows Central reports that Perfect Dark developer The Initiative will close as part of the reductions sweeping the company, and its revival of the 2000 first-person shooter game has been canceled. VGC reports that Rare's Everwild, an action-adventure game that's been in development for over a decade, has been canceled, as employees continue to be informed of layoffs across other studios such as ZeniMax and King.

Everwild, which was expected to launch with Game Pass for Xbox Series X/S and PC, was a new, original title from Rare. Few details about the game were available, though development had been troubled; in 2021, the project was “restarted from scratch.” The game was officially announced in 2019 with a brief trailer. In February, during an interview with XboxEra, Spencer cited Everwild as a game release he was looking forward to. “It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making,” Spencer said at the time.

According to Bloomberg, The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios is canceling a new MMORPG project due to the cuts. The outlet also reports layoffs of roughly 200 people at Candy Crush maker King and that layoffs are also taking place at Call of Duty developer Raven Software.

Spencer's full message to employees is below:

Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today's notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.

I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.

Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.

HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.

Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.

Wooting was one of the first analog keyboard brands to break into the mainstream. When the original Wooting One TKL launched, it was a big deal—optical switch technology was still new to most people, and the idea of a keyboard with hyper-fast, adjustable key actuations was both novel and revolutionary at the time.

Later, when it debuted its Lekker Hall effect switch in the Wooting Two, it was one of the first companies to utilize the technology for gaming. Things ramped up in 2020 with the release of the Wooting 60HE: Wooting was taking preorders months in advance, the keyboard was reselling with massive markups, and Hall effect completely overshadowed optical switches as the next big thing.

Now, Hall effect keyboards are a dime a dozen. It kicked off an arms race, and Wooting's 60HE fell behind. But with the new Wooting 80HE, the company returned to the tenkeyless (TKL) layout of its first keyboard and made a keyboard that's not only competitive but impressive. The 80HE has every feature I want in a Hall effect keyboard, without any of the mistakes I commonly see. It's robust, reliable, and easy to repair.

The 80HE has two versions, one with a plastic case and the other with a zinc alloy. The plastic version retails for $200 and comes in opaque black or transparent gray. The zinc alloy model costs $290 and includes a carrying case. It comes in black or white. You can also get the keyboard in ANSI, ISO, and JIS layouts. I tested the zinc alloy case in black with a standard ANSI layout.

For nearly every Hall effect keyboard I've reviewed, software has been a sore spot. They've been buggy, awkward, poorly designed, filled with advertisements, or just plain unintuitive. Even the best software I've tested, from Keychron, has minor issues with connectivity and setting functions.

This is where Wooting stands out. Its in-house app, Wootility, is great. It's a simple, lightweight utility that provides extensive adjustments and customizations. It's available both in-browser and as a downloadable executable, meaning you can access it anywhere and use it offline. More than that, every part of its design makes sense: The application is organized, easy to use, intuitive, and explains every setting. Plus, during my entire time using the browser version, I never ran into connectivity issues—the minute I hit “enter” for the URL, it recognized the keyboard. This isn't the case for most in-browser keyboard utilities, which don't always want to connect.

Even niche features like gamepad emulation worked flawlessly. I replicated the analog inputs of an Xbox controller's stick and triggers without any hiccups or confusion, adjusting the settings on the fly and still maintaining keyboard inputs for unmapped keys. I even put down a half-decent lap time in Art of Rally after a bit of practice (and a few crashes).

The keyboard performs perfectly—it's snappy, responsive, and the factory switches return incredibly quickly after being pressed. It feels precise for movement, and I never encountered a situation where I outpaced it or had an input that didn't register, even in high-speed games like Splitgate 2.

You can store up to four presets and switch between them using Fn+[number]. I used this to have separate maps for rapid trigger, standard typing, controller emulation, and Wooting's high-speed “Tachyon Mode,” named after a hypothetical ultra-fast particle that travels faster than the speed of light. I found myself gaming almost exclusively with Tachyon Mode enabled, which disables animated RGB effects in exchange for an 8,000-Hz polling rate. The keyboard was still perfectly competent at the default 1,600 Hz with RGB fully functional, though, and the difference will ultimately be incredibly marginal for most users.

My largest gripe with this keyboard is a personal and pedantic one: I don't like the layout. I get it—it's better for most people. It cuts out some keys I've hardly used in my life while saving space. But I prefer the standard TKL layout. You get an extra Windows key in the bottom right corner, and the keyboard looks and feels more balanced. This certainly isn't a deal-breaker, and I recognize that this won't be an issue for most people, but I think it's worth noting that this layout might not be preferable to a standard TKL for some.

Cracking open this keyboard, it feels like Wooting listened to every complaint I've had about keyboards in the past. The 80HE is easy to take apart (although the tabs on the front of the case could stand to be easier to release), has a robust internal construction, and even has a diagram on the underside of the printed circuit board (PCB) that explains the components and what they do, a detail I appreciate.

Like many premium gaming keyboards, the 80HE uses a gasket-mount system to improve typing feel and sound. Most keyboards use foam or rubber gaskets that attach to either the plate or case using adhesive, but the 80HE's gaskets are part of a solid rubber piece fitted between the plate and PCB, with protruding tabs of rubber compressed by the two halves of the case on either side. This functions as both a gasket and an additional piece of sound dampening, with the rubber piece filling in the space between the switches.

For the case, there are two options: Plastic or metal. The plastic case raises a few small concerns, such as its use of snap-together clips, and the metal case uses an unusual hinge method to come apart. While neither of these are huge issues compared to other keyboards with screws under adhesive feet or convoluted disassembly processes, they can still make disassembly mildly inconvenient and pose a small risk of breaking tabs when taking the keyboard apart if you aren't careful.

The RGB lighting is bright and diffused well underneath all of the keys. Their coverage is extensive, with the spacebar even having multiple diodes underneath to fully spread the light across its underside. Customization is easy and intuitive, with the Wootility software allowing for multiple layers of RGB effects that can be stacked and organized on top of each other. While the animation options aren't as diverse as what you'll find on a Razer keyboard, the lighting is still extensive and bright enough to be seen even in daylight.

The RGB light bar can be easily customized to show different animations and details. The strip of 10 LED lights can display simple RGB animations, mode indicators, and indicators for keypress depth and typing speed that fill from left to right.

While I enjoy the typing feel of the 80HE, it's nothing revolutionary or groundbreaking, and that's perfectly fine. The design is robust, the gasket mount system feels good, and the switches are comfortable and simple. Overall, the typing experience is very utilitarian, neither lacking nor having any unnecessary flourishes.

All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.

The switches, Wooting's Lekker V2 switch, are a Gateron-manufactured switch with a medium-weight 60-gram spring and a single-rail design. This means the rails on either side of the stem that guide the switch's vertical movement are one large piece instead of two smaller ones. This theoretically makes keypresses less smooth, but the difference is hard to notice during regular use: These switches feel smooth even when pressed down slowly, and have a comfortable, yet fairly solid bottom-out at the end of the keypress. Their spring weight is comparable to a Cherry MX Red switch

The switches can be swapped out with first- and third-party Hall effect switches, including Wooting's lighter Lekker V2 L45 switches, Geonworks' multiple HE switches, and some Gateron HE switches like the Magnetic Jades. However, because there are differing standards for Hall effect switches, some models won't work with the 80HE, including Keychron's dual-rail Nebula switches (which, ironically, are also manufactured by Gateron).

The gasket mount used by Wooting is relatively stiff, but still dampens sounds and reduces vibrations in typing—it just won't have as strong of a “bouncing” sensation compared to gasket mounts from Keychron's Q line. While typing doesn't feel as “fun” on this keyboard, I can understand why Wooting opted for a stiffer gasket mount when every millimeter of keypress is important. Plus, the gasket mount system still accomplishes its other goal: creating a consistent typing feel across the entire keyboard without any unusually stiff or “dead” spots.

The stabilizers are some of the best I've seen in a keyboard from the factory. They're screw-in, PCB-mounted stabilizers that come tuned and lubed, and they can easily be swapped out for any of the aftermarket PCB-mount stabilizers available today. Most mechanical keyboards use plate-mount stabilizers from the factory, which tend to be less stable and more prone to rattling over time, so Wooting opting for the more premium option is great to see.

Unlike most keyboards with metal cases, the 80HE allows for adjustments to typing height. This is done through three sets of removable rubber feet that sit at 2.8, 6, and 10 degrees. I prefer this to the usual flip-out plastic feet on other keyboards, since it preserves the keyboard's typing sound and looks a lot cleaner.

The 80HE is one of the few keyboards I've used that's great for high-speed gaming while maintaining a solid typing feel and sound. On top of that, the software is simple and intuitive to use, and the design actively encourages customization and modification. It doesn't do anything wrong. While it does miss out on some comforts like wireless connectivity and a softer typing feel, the tradeoff of 8,000-Hz polling and more precise inputs makes those exclusions feel justified.

Lovable, one of the darlings of the vibe-coding world and one of Europe's fastest-growing AI startups, is working on raising a fresh round of over $150 million at a near $2 billion valuation, the Financial Times reports.

The raise and giant step up in valuation comes just months after the Swedish startup raised a $15 million round led by Creandum in February. The company described that round to TechCrunch as “pre-Series A,” but with numbers this large, it's safe to say that Lovable has jumped from seed rounds to priced growth rounds, whatever the serial alphabetic label should be. Accel is said to be leading this new raise, with Creandum and others like 20VC participating.

While the company is technically two years old, founded in 2023, it released its web app-building product in late November. In May, Lovable CEO Anton Osika tweeted that Lovable hit $50 million in ARR in six months.

Lovable, like competitors Replit and Bolt, builds entire web apps from an initial text prompt, including a user interface/front end (often via the popular UX coding tool React) and connected to a database like Supabase. Some users say it's affordable, starting at $25 a month for 250 “credits.” One Reddit user documented an app with 29,000+ lines of code and dozens of functions built for $250.

On Monday, Lovable announced that it was releasing a beta version of an AI agent that could automate more tasks like editing code after reading project files or debugging. Lovable will charge on a usage-based model for this: The more the agent is asked to do, the more credits it will charge.

While this may increase fees for users if they turn over their app management to the agent, this pricing model is shaping up to be the default business model for agents. This is because the AI startups themselves have to pay variable fees to model providers like OpenAI or Anthropic. All this to say, such business model strategies would make investors happy.

Accel, 20VC, and Lovable did not respond to a request for comment.

A former SpaceX security manager, who was privy to top secret information on U.S. government programs, is suing the company and one of its senior employees for alleged discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation. 

Jenna Shumway, who was promoted to senior contractor program security officer after being hired in 2022, also alleges the senior employee — Daniel Collins, a former Defense Department official hired to run security compliance for the company's government work — violated top secret protocols and then concealed this information from the government. 

Lawyers for Shumway, Collins, and SpaceX did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment. 

Collins made the news in December 2024 when The New York Times reported SpaceX was under federal review for sloppy security protocols. Collins discouraged reporting security clearance violations and allowed executives without proper clearances into classified meetings, according to the NYT. This and other allegations triggered at least three federal reviews of the company's security procedures, the NYT found. 

According to Shumway's complaint, she was passed over for the director position that Collins ultimately was hired for without being given the opportunity to apply for it. Her “work environment entirely changed” when Collins was hired as her superior in spring 2024, according to the complaint. Shumway claims Collins effectively waged a campaign of harassment against her, which included stripping her of her responsibilities over a period of months and ultimately leading to her termination in October 2024.

Collins' harassment extended to other female employees, too, the complaint alleges. The discrimination included preventing female staff from doing required security work, allegedly setting them up for noncompliance, staring at one employee's chest during a meeting, and asking a subordinate female employee if she wanted to “get s–tty together” over after-work drinks. 

Shumway and other female employees repeatedly reported Collins to SpaceX human resources, the lawsuit states. The company ignored these complaints, the suit alleges, and didn't take any action beyond suggesting the employees avoid being alone with Collins. Shumway is seeking unspecified damages.

This is not the first time SpaceX has been sued over claims that it enables sexual discrimination. Previous lawsuits have alleged similar stories of bias against female employees and a hostile work environment that enabled gender-based harassment. The company is also battling investigations from the California Civil Rights Department and the National Labor Relations Board over similar claims. 

The lawsuit was filed in late May in the Los Angeles County Superior Court; it was later moved to federal court on June 30 at SpaceX's request. It is filed in the federal Central District of California court under case number 2:22-cv-05959.

Even Tesla's energy storage business, which has been a small, yet notable bright spot, can't escape the cloud that's hanging over the company.

For the second consecutive quarter, deployments of its Powerwall and Megapack stationary storage products have declined, according to stats released by Tesla. In the second quarter of this year, the company installed 9.6 gigawatt-hours of storage, down 0.8 gigawatt-hours from the first quarter.

Tesla's energy storage division peaked in the fourth quarter of 2024, a three-month period that saw 11 gigawatt-hours deployed. In all, Tesla deployed 31.4 GWh of energy storage products in 2024.

Until this year, the sector has been a bright spot for Tesla, posting consistent year-over-year growth. Revenue from energy storage and solar installations grew from $2 billion in 2020 to $10.1 billion last year. Tesla's poor start to the year suggests that streak is about to come to an end.

By contrast, the broader market for energy storage has been growing recently. Analysts at Wood Mackenzie said new installations hit a record high in Q1, the most recent period for which data is available, growing by 57% year-over-year.

Such growth is unlikely to continue, though, as tariffs on Chinese-made goods coincide with the ill-effects of a Trump-backed reconciliation bill currently being hashed out in Congress. There, Republicans have been working to eliminate key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. 

While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim. The vast majority of minerals used in batteries are refined or processed in China.

On Tuesday, July 1, the Senate breathed new life into NASA's floundering Artemis program by passing President Trump's budget reconciliation bill. If signed into law, the legislation would allocate an additional $6 billion to Artemis' current mission architecture.

The new funds, which include support for additional Space Launch System (SLS) rockets, the Orion spacecraft, and a lunar space station called Gateway, represent a major win for legacy aerospace providers Boeing, Northrop Grumman, and L3 Harris Technologies' Aerojet Rocketdyne division. These companies have collectively received about $24 billion for SLS production to date. Critics of these technologies—including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman—have argued in favor of using newer, more cost-effective infrastructure instead. The Senate's decision rebukes such criticism and directly challenges the White House's own strategic vision for NASA.

Trump's “skinny” budget proposal, released in May, aims to slash $6 billion from NASA's budget for fiscal year 2026. Part of that reduction would come from overhauling the Artemis program's architecture. In addition to terminating the Gateway program, the proposal called for phasing out both the SLS and the Orion capsule—the spacecraft that would carry Artemis crews to the Moon—after the Artemis 3 mission and replacing them with commercial alternatives.

On June 5, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, unveiled legislative directives for the Senate Republicans' budget reconciliation bill. In an effort to prioritize beating China to the Moon and Mars, the proposal dedicates nearly $10 billion in additional funding to enable future Mars missions, maintain the International Space Station (ISS) through 2030, and support Artemis's existing infrastructure.

Of that $10 billion, $2.6 billion would go toward fully funding Gateway, $4.1 billion would support SLS, and $20 million would go to the development of Orion. The bill also dedicates $700 million to a new Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, underscoring Congress's focus on a Moon-to-Mars strategy. By passing this bill, the Senate effectively reversed course on the plan that Trump's 2026 budget proposal laid out for NASA.

If Trump signs the bill into law, it could escalate the ongoing conflict between him and Musk. Their falling out began after Trump withdrew Isaacman's NASA Administrator nomination at the end of May. Like Musk, Isaacman has criticized aspects of the Artemis program's key infrastructure. During his Senate confirmation hearings, he admitted that Orion and SLS were the fastest way to beat China to the Moon but stated that SLS's expendability and high per-launch cost made it unsustainable for frequent lunar operations or future Mars missions.

Musk has been particularly vocal in his criticism of SLS, arguing that reusable rockets—like those made by SpaceX—would be far more cost-effective over the long term. He has also taken aim at the Artemis missions themselves, claiming that they are a “distraction” from Mars objectives. Trump's 2026 budget proposal, drafted while Musk served as a senior advisor to the President, heavily reflected the SpaceX executive's position on NASA's Moon-to-Mars program—and served to benefit his company.

If signed, the budget reconciliation bill would upend this plan, giving Musk one more reason to hate it. He's been banging his fists on the table for weeks, calling the legislation a “disgusting abomination.” Musk's criticisms sparked an online feud with Trump that played out over the course of several days via their respective social media platforms, X and Truth Social.

The massive tax and spending budget bill is now returning to the House for a final vote. As Congress closes in on Trump's July 4 deadline to present him with a final version for signing, the future of NASA's lunar program hangs in the balance. The agency has faced unprecedented uncertainty since Trump took office in January. If he signs this bill into law, it could, at least, get one of NASA's flagship programs back on track.

GPU sales data often highlights interesting patterns such as customer preference, supply availability, variance between regions, and much more. It allows us to gauge not only the current status of the market at large, but also the specific models people are inclined toward. As such, new sales data from Mindfactory.de, spotted by TechPowerUp, tells us that customers are heavily favoring the 16GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti over its 8GB counterpart.

Mindfactory.de is one of Germany's largest retailers and the only one with public sales figures. You can see the number of units sold on each of their listings, which includes GPUs from various AIBs and manufacturers. Doing the math, the numbers reveal the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB has sold 1,675 units so far, as compared to only 105 units for the 8GB variant.



Customers are helping outsell the 8GB RTX 5060Ti by over 16 times — which means for every one RTX 5060 Ti 8GB sold, there are sixteen RTX 5060 Ti 16GB flying off the shelves. That chalks up to a 1600% difference across the board, all while both cards are in stock and keeping up with demand. So, there are no availability restraints enabling this purchasing behavior.

Despite the price difference, buyers are regularly choosing the more expensive RTX 5060 Ti simply due to the extra VRAM it has to offer. With new releases getting more demanding and visual additives like ray tracing becoming commonplace, 16GB of VRAM has started to look more lucrative regardless of the cost. It performs better today and will sell more easily tomorrow in the second-hand market.

GPUs with 8GB memory buffers often struggle with modern games these days, and our pursuit of photorealism in blockbuster titles will only worsen this over time. Features like Neural Texture Compression can help combat the increased VRAM usage, but it's up to the developers to implement these technologies, and even then, you can only fight physics so much.

Interestingly, though, opposing sales data from TechEpiphany on X shows us that it's AMD topping the charts as of late. The RX 9070 XT and RX 9060 XT are both the best-selling GPUs from the last week of June, with the aforementioned RTX 5060 Ti closely following in third place. That being said, these numbers are likely coalescing the sales of the 8GB and 16GB variants.

🔥 GPU Retail Sales Week 26 '25 (mf)ℹ️ UnitsAMD: 615 units sold, 53.95%, ASP: 533Nvidia: 515, 45.18%, ASP: 805Intel: 10, 0.88%, ASP: 108ℹ️ RevenueAMD: 327814, 44.1%Nvidia: 414427, 55.75%Intel: 1084, 0.15% pic.twitter.com/z4zxick6JfJuly 2, 2025

Moreover, a similar narrative clings to the red camp where AMD's 16GB cards are outselling their 8GB peers, only even more intensely. The Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB has more than 30 times the sales of the 8GB RX 9060 XT on Mindfactory.de, which just goes to show that the sentiment is shared across the community, regardless of whatever GPU brand you support.

 July 02, 2025  

When Brazilian scientist Letícia Soares contracted COVID-19 in April 2020, she was in the final stretch of her postdoctoral studies in disease ecology at a Canadian university. By August, she was bedbound.

What began as piercing migraines quickly escalated into a cascade of long COVID symptoms — gastrointestinal distress, sleeplessness, joint and muscle pain, and crushing fatigue. For Soares and many other women with long COVID, it also included sudden menstrual changes that exacerbated her other symptoms.

“It just baffled me,” said Soares, now 40. “It was debilitating.”

Before COVID, she had a stable, predictable cycle while using a hormonal IUD — light cramping, mild abdominal swelling, and consistent, manageable bleeding. Then, after her infection, her period disappeared entirely. A couple of years later, the pattern reversed: prolonged, heavy bleeding returned, compounding her long COVID symptoms and triggering severe crashes from post-exertional malaise — one of the hallmarks of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), a condition linked to post-viral illness.

Cases like Soares's are leading scientists to spend more time trying to understand the biologic sex disparity in chronic illnesses such as long COVID that initially had all but been ignored. New research from the National Institutes of Health RECOVER initiative, the largest observational study to date, confirms what many have long suspected: Women face a significantly higher risk of developing long COVID than men. While men are more likely to experience severe acute illness and higher mortality, growing evidence suggests women are more vulnerable to chronic symptoms.

Published in JAMA Network Open, the study analyzed data from over 12,200 participants who had been infected by COVID between 2021 and 2024. Even after adjusting for clinical and demographic factors, women had a 31%-44% higher likelihood of developing long COVID than men. The risk was especially pronounced among nonpregnant, nonmenopausal participants.

This study is the first to examine risk across different groups assigned women at birth, revealing that age, pregnancy, and menopause all play a role in long COVID likelihood, said lead author Dimpy Shah, MD, PhD, assistant professor of population health sciences at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. “That is a very novel finding.”

Five years into the pandemic, with hundreds of millions of people worldwide affected by lingering symptoms, this emerging research on biologic sex disparities highlights the complexity of long COVID and how it intersects with hormonal cycles and life stages.

The study found that when adjusting for variables like age, race, and underlying health conditions, women had a 31% higher risk for long COVID. When only age and race were accounted for, the risk jumped to 44%, suggesting that other factors, including autoimmune conditions and post-viral illnesses, may influence the link between sex and long COVID.

The RECOVER study revealed notable patterns: Pregnant women aged 18-39 years had a lower long COVID risk than their nonpregnant counterparts compared with men in the same age group. Similarly, menopausal women aged 40-54 years had a lower risk than nonmenopausal women in that age group.

“This could be due to hormonal changes and variations in inflammatory responses, which shift with age,” Shah explained.

By identifying how biologic sex, pregnancy, and menopause affect long COVID risk, this study moves the field closer to understanding why some individuals experience prolonged illness — and how treatment strategies might be tailored accordingly.

While the latest RECOVER study wasn't designed to analyze hormone levels, senior author Nora G. Singer, MD, director of Rheumatology at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, emphasized the need for future research in this area. “If we understood better the biologic mechanisms contributing to sex specificity, I think the question is, could we better stratify who we're worried about developing long COVID? Could we target drugs? Are there ways we could manipulate things to make people less likely to get long COVID, and are there different levels of immune response at these different ages?”

Expanding this research is critical as long COVID and similar chronic conditions remain largely overlooked in medical funding and study. “These illnesses are underfunded and understudied relative to their disease burdens,” said Beth Pollack, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, who studies complex chronic illnesses.

Addressing knowledge gaps, especially around sex differences, could significantly improve our understanding of complex chronic illnesses, said Pollack, who co-authored a 2023 literature review of female reproductive health impacts of long COVID.

For example, several previous studies and surveys of female patients with long COVID report an increase in symptoms related to menstruation, which further suggests a possible link between sex hormone fluctuations and immune dysfunction in the illness.

The pathologies of long COVID currently focus on four hypotheses: persistent viral infection, reactivation of dormant viruses (such as common herpes viruses), inflammation-related damage to tissues and organs, and autoimmunity (the body attacking itself).

It's this last reason that holds some of the most interesting clues on biologic sex differences, said Akiko Iwasaki, PhD, a Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, immunologist who has led numerous research breakthroughs on long COVID since the start of the pandemic. Women have two X chromosomes, for example, and although one is inactivated, the inactivation is incomplete.

Some cells still express genes from the “inactivated genes” on the X chromosome, Iwasaki said. Those include key immune genes, which trigger a more robust response to infections and vaccinations but also predispose them to autoimmune reactions. “It comes at the cost of triggering too much immune response,” Iwasaki said.

Sex hormones also factor in. Testosterone, which is higher in men, is immunosuppressive, so it can dampen immune responses, Iwasaki said. That may contribute to making men more likely to get severe acute infections of COVID but have fewer long-term effects.

Estrogen, on the other hand, is known to enhance the immune response. It can increase the production of antibodies and the activation of T cells, which are critical for fighting off infections. This heightened immune response, however, might also contribute to the persistent inflammation observed in long COVID, where the immune system continues to react even after the acute infection has resolved.

Of the more than 200 symptoms people with long COVID experience, Iwasaki said, several are also sex-specific. A draft study by Iwasaki and another leading COVID researcher, David Putrino, PhD, at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, shows hair loss as one of the most women-dominant symptoms and sexual dysfunction among men.

In examining sex differences, another question is why long COVID rates in the trans community are disproportionately high. One of the reasons Iwasaki's lab is looking at testosterone closely is because anecdotal evidence from female-to-male trans individuals indicates that testosterone therapy improved their long COVID symptoms significantly. It also raises the possibility that hormone therapy could help.

However, patients and advocates say it's also important to consider socioeconomic factors in the trans community. “We need to start at this population and social structure level to understand why trans people over and over are put in harm's way,” said J.D. Davids, a trans patient-researcher with long COVID and the co-founder and co-director of Strategies for High Impact and its Long COVID Justice project.

The possibility of diagnosing long COVID with a simple blood test could radically change some doctors' false perceptions that it is not a real condition, Iwasaki said, ensuring it is recognized and treated with the seriousness it deserves.

“I feel like we need to get there with long COVID. If we can order a blood test and say somebody has a long COVID because of these values, then suddenly the diseases become medically explainable,” Iwasaki added. This advancement is critical for propelling research forward, she said, refining treatment approaches — including those that target sex-specific hormone, immunity, and inflammation issues — and improving the well-being of those living with long COVID.

This hope resonates with scientists like Pollack, who led the first National Institutes of Health-sponsored research webinar on less studied pathologies in ME/CFS and long COVID, and with the experiences of individuals like Soares, who navigates through the unpredictable nature of both of these conditions with resilience.

“This illness never ceases to surprise me in how it changes my body. I feel like it's a constant adaptation,” said Soares. Now living in Salvador, Brazil, her daily life had dramatically shifted to the confines of her home. While her condition limits many aspects of her life, working remotely allows her to stay involved in disability advocacy as a co-lead and researcher at the international Patient-Led Research Collaborative.

Understanding sex differences in long COVID could also transform care for millions. From a public health perspective, new research could improve diagnosis in clinics, inform targeted therapies for high-risk groups, and encourage women to take their symptoms seriously.

“Because they are at potentially higher risk for long COVID, if they're not feeling well, they should definitely talk to their primary care or internal medicine physicians,” said Shah, reflecting on the latest RECOVER study's findings. “It's a call to action.”

DISCLOSURES |  July 02, 2025  

Hair loss due to androgenetic alopecia remains a widespread concern for patients across the globe, as it severely affects their quality of life and self-esteem. With deeper insights into the biological mechanisms behind hair loss, a broader range of interventions are becoming available. Innovative methods ranging from laser-based treatments to microneedling and regenerative techniques are now entering clinical practice. These novel strategies offer promising alternatives, particularly for individuals who have seen limited benefit from traditional options or seek treatments with fewer systemic effects.

How well do you understand the latest advances in managing hair loss? Test your knowledge with this quick quiz.

Spironolactone reduces the influence of androgens, which are hormones that contribute to follicular miniaturization and hair thinning. In managing female-pattern hair loss, oral spironolactone is emerging as a novel therapeutic approach. It is commonly used to treat acne and hirsutism in females, especially those diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Patients with PCOS are often diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia.

Topical spironolactone can be used for both men and women. Botulinum toxin is a treatment currently being studied for hair loss, although more research is needed before it can be recommended as a standard treatment. Low-level laser therapy can be used for both men and women. Low-dose oral finasteride (1 mg) has shown limited benefit in women but has not been as effective in postmenopausal women.

Learn more about low-level laser therapy.

Hair transplantation is a surgical procedure that harvests follicles from non-androgen-sensitive areas to areas affected by androgenetic alopecia. This procedure is best suited to individuals with nonscarring, patterned hair loss (typically androgenetic alopecia) who have a consistent and healthy donor area. Scarring conditions such as cicatricial alopecia damage the scalp and hair follicles permanently. For an effective surgery, the hair loss should be stable, and the patient should have a reliable zone from which follicles can be harvested.

Similarly, widespread thinning across the scalp (diffuse unpatterned alopecia) compromises donor-site quality. In alopecia areata, the immune system targets hair follicles unpredictably, making transplant outcomes unreliable.

Learn more about cicatricial alopecia.

For women with androgenic alopecia who wish to evade systemic hormonal effects, topical finasteride offers a practical alternative. Unlike oral formulations, which circulate throughout the body and might affect hormone levels (potentially causing adverse effects such as irregular periods or reduced libido), topical finasteride delivers its action more locally, with minimal absorption. Although not formally approved by the FDA for this use, it has shown promising results in reducing hair loss.

Oral dutasteride and high-dose oral finasteride are generally avoided in women of childbearing age due to their broad hormonal influence and risk for birth defects. Although topical minoxidil is a well-established treatment, it does not directly address the androgen-driven aspect of the condition.

Learn more about androgenetic alopecia.

Micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, probably play an important role in follicle function. According to a systematic review, zinc is supported by research as a possible nutritional intervention for hair loss.

The average dietary intake of vitamin A and biotin is adequate. Excess levels of vitamin A can cause hair loss, and neither biotin (vitamin B7) nor vitamin E supplementation are supported by the literature. In addition, biotin supplementation can cause potentially dangerous false troponin laboratory results.

Learn more about zinc supplementation.

Low-dose oral minoxidil (doses ranging from 0.25 mg to 2.5 mg daily) has been used off-label with good clinical efficacy and safety. Caution is advised when prescribing low-dose oral minoxidil to individuals with preexisting heart or vascular conditions. Although it is commonly used off-label to address hair loss in both female- and male-pattern hair loss due in part to its ability to enhance blood flow to the scalp, minoxidil was originally designed to lower blood pressure. Rare but potentially serious systemic effects such as increased heart rate or shifts in blood pressure could worsen underlying cardiovascular problems with its use. The magnitude of cardiovascular adverse effects is dose dependent, with 1 mg oral minoxidil being generally safe and well tolerated. (Oral minoxidil might also contribute to facial hypertrichosis, and it is not advised for use in pregnant women or in those who are breastfeeding.)

Minoxidil is not the treatment of choice for autoimmune-related hair loss, such as with lupus and alopecia areata, but it could be used as an adjunct therapy. Adolescents with alopecia areata can be treated with minoxidil, which had similar efficacy to that in adults.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Healthy lifestyle lowers risk of diverticulitis despite genetic susceptibility","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250702/Healthy-lifestyle-lowers-risk-of-diverticulitis-despite-genetic-susceptibility.aspx","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 13:15:00 GMT","

Maintaining a healthy lifestyle-specifically, a diet rich in fibre but light on red/processed meat, regular exercise, not smoking, and sticking to a normal weight-is linked to a significantly lower risk of diverticulitis, finds a large long term study, published online in the journal Gut.

What's more, these 5 components seem to offset the effects of inherited genes, the findings indicate.

Diverticulitis occurs when 'pouches' develop along the gut and become inflamed or infected in the wall of the large intestine (colon), explain the researchers. It's a common cause of hospital admissions and a major reason for emergency colon surgery, they add.

Genetic and environmental factors, including lifestyle, contribute to the development of the condition, but it's not clear exactly how these factors interact or the extent to which lifestyle might offset the genetic risk, they say.

To shed more light on this, the researchers derived an overall healthy lifestyle score (0-5) for diverticulitis from survey responses for 179,564 participants drawn from three prospective studies: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.

The score was based on 5 elements that have independently been associated with heightened risks of developing diverticulitis: smoking; weight (BMI); physical activity; fibre intake; and red/processed meat intake. 

The association between this score and incident diverticulitis was confirmed among 30,750 participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). 

Genetic risk was assessed using a polygenic risk score (PRS) in 36,077 people with available genotype information. 

During a monitoring period of 20 years, 10,299 new cases of diverticulitis were recorded. The 5 lifestyle factors were each significantly associated with the development of the condition. 

For example, compared with participants with a BMI below 25, those who were overweight were 32% more likely to develop diverticulitis, while those who were obese were 44% more likely to do so. 

Participants who had formerly or who were still smoking were, respectively, 17% and 13% more likely to be diagnosed with diverticulitis than those who had never smoked. And higher levels of physical activity were associated with a 16% reduced risk compared with lower levels. 

While higher fibre intake was associated with a 14% lower risk, higher red meat intake was associated with a 9% increased risk. 

And every 1-point increase in healthy lifestyle score was associated with a 12% lower risk of diverticulitis. Participants with a score of 5 were 50% less likely to be diagnosed with the condition than those with a score of 0.

The findings were consistently observed across all three studies and in different racial groups.

The association between healthy lifestyle score and incident diverticulitis was confirmed among 30,750 participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). 

Some 2183 new cases of diverticulitis were reported during an average monitoring period of nearly 12 years in this group. Those with a healthy lifestyle score of 3–5 had a substantially lower risk (31%) than those with a score of 0. 

Genetic risk was assessed using a polygenic (cumulative) risk score (PRS) in 36,077 people with available genotype information in the NHS, NHSII, and HPFS groups.

There were no notable differences in lifestyle factors across PRS categories, but PRS was significantly associated with incident diverticulitis. For each unit increase in PRS, the risk increased by 58%, and was particularly evident among those under the age of 60. 

And a healthy lifestyle seemed to offset genetic susceptibility to the condition. For example, those in the lowest PRS category and with a healthy lifestyle score of 4-5 were 37% less likely to develop diverticulitis compared to those with a score of 0.

Similarly, those with a medium PRS were 48% less likely to do so, while those in the highest PRS category were 50% less likely to do so. Further analysis showed that adopting a healthy lifestyle might prevent 23–42% of diverticulitis cases across PRS categories.

And when the effect of PRS and a healthy lifestyle score were combined, those in the highest PRS category with a healthy lifestyle score of 0 or 1 were 5 times more likely to develop diverticulitis than those in the lowest PRS category with a score of 4 or 5. 

The findings were further validated in the Mass General Brigham Biobank (MGBB).

This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause. And the researchers acknowledge that ascertainment of diverticulitis was based on different approaches across the different studies.

Nevertheless, they conclude: ""Our data provide consistent evidence from multiple data sets indicating that adherence to a healthy lifestyle is linked to a reduced risk of developing diverticulitis, irrespective of one's genetic predisposition.""

Three years ago, the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team reached a historic collective bargaining agreement with the U.S. Soccer Federation that guaranteed equal pay and better working conditions for both the women's team and the men's team. As the women's soccer players fought for equitable working conditions, they also found a profound way to give back by funding a program to support female entrepreneurs.

""That economic justice fight is something that's a bit of an extension of our pay equity fight,"" Tierna Davidson, USWNT center back and current president of the USWNT Players Association, told Newsweek. ""We wanted to partner with someone that was established in that space and could help us help small businesses get on their feet, whether it was starting or continuing to invest in their business.""

That partner was Kiva, the social venture firm that provides microloans to women and minority-owned businesses across the world. Through Kiva, the Players Association set up a revolving loan fund and a crowdfunding platform to allow women's soccer fans to support female entrepreneurs around the country.

To date, over 5,100 businesses have received loans through this program, totaling $400,000. The initiative won a Gold Halo Award in 2023 for its social impact success and has a goal to lend out $2.5 million as the revolving fund grows.

Davidson, who plays professionally for the National Women's Soccer League's Gotham FC, won a gold medal in the 2024 Olympic Games on Team USA and was also on the bargaining committee as the USWNT Players Association sought out its new contract in the wake of the 2019 lawsuit that kicked off the fight for equal pay. She was one of the youngest players on the 2019 squad that won Team USA's fourth World Cup as fans called attention to the players' cause with chants for equal pay.

""Every conversation with U.S. Soccer's legal team, we always had at least one player represented on it,"" Annie Reid, director of Strategic Partnerships and Business for the USWNT Players Association, told Newsweek. ""They were really, really involved.""

Stars like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan fought for equal pay, even though their careers would end before the majority of the improvements in pay and working conditions took place.

""With that win, that was a long time coming, players started to think about ... Where else do we want to have impact? There's a variety of ways that we at the Players Association, with our players, have worked to have that impact,"" Reid said.

Reid shared that the larger economic justice mission also includes improving access to youth sports, where pay-for-play can prevent people from earning opportunities in sports, and driving equal pay for female athletes around the world.

""Looking at the steps that other national teams have taken with their own women's teams to improve their working conditions [and] improve their pay to more model their men's side is so important,"" Davidson said. ""That was such a large part of the battle as well as understanding that it wasn't just for us, but it was for national teams globally. We've seen that drastically improve over the past couple of years. It's super evident, too, in how competitive the women's game is.""

They've also improved the moneymaking potential of the name, image, and likeness of their players by driving sales of merchandise. Despite ongoing pay inequality globally, women's teams around the world have also pushed for better pay and working conditions as a result of USWNT's success.

""These women are using their platform to talk about gender equity, economic justice, equal pay. These are all systemic problems, not just in sports, but throughout many different industries,"" Tess Murphy, director of corporate partnerships for Kiva, told Newsweek. ""They understood what economic justice and empowerment meant for them, and they wanted to extend that opportunity to other women around the country.""

Six months after the signing of this collective bargaining agreement, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Equal Pay for Team USA Act, guaranteeing equal pay for men and women across all Olympic sports. Senator Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., who co-sponsored the bill with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., a signal of the broader impact of the USWNT's battle.

""I ... want to thank heroes like Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, who brought that case against U.S. Soccer,"" Cantwell said. ""U.S. women's soccer led the charge after winning the World Cup and making it clear to everyone that women athletes deserve equal pay.""

Kiva's data suggests that female small-business owners have a high community impact but are underserved in access to funding. These loans help them make key investments in starting or growing their business.

One such business owner is Jimbi Mboob, who owns Smiling Coast Beauty Salon in Madison, Wisconsin. Through Kiva and its USWNT partnership, she secured a $14,500 loan to double the size of her store, make interior improvements and invest in social media for marketing.

""My credit wasn't that great, and I have four kids,"" Mboob said. ""Resources were limited. If I could get the resources to start up, getting my own chairs and booths, it will be better. So I used that to buy chairs and space that I rented for a few months just to get me on track.""

Mboob shared that she's hiring people to help them get into the field of braiding and has also hosted community events, including a Juneteenth youth function that centered around hair care. She said that she would have never had the opportunity to expand her presence or give back without this loan.

""It's a lot to deal with, but through these little resources ... I'm able to get more clients coming in through my door, and I'm able to extend that [work opportunity] to other women like me,"" Mboob said. ""I feel like I'm not only benefiting, those people benefit, too, and the community that I'm serving benefits.""

The USWNT-Kiva partnership focused on supporting small businesses in cities where they were playing. They've also set up a small business fund for businesses impacted by the wildfires in Southern California.

Many USWNT members, like Morgan, have their own business ventures. Their challenging personal experiences in the marketing and sponsorship world, despite being popular pro athletes, helped them realize the need to boost women-owned businesses, especially because they do not get as much funding or support from the financial services industry.

""Even with their name and the money that they have, they saw that there is a tougher time for a business to get off the ground, particularly for women and for BIPOC owners. They have experienced that themselves,"" Reid said, emphasizing that challenges earning branding and sponsorship deals for the USWNT Players Association and its members is another example of the business barriers that the players faced. ""Their thought is, If I'm experiencing this as the known name that I have, what is that like for your average person?""

The players embraced the larger impact they had the potential to make.

""We understood that the fight for pay equity was not just for us,"" Davidson said. ""It's not just for our own benefit, but it's also for the benefit of many women out there, of many individuals looking to us as an inspiration.""

For Davidson, the responsibilities of being on the bargaining committee and now president of the USWNTPA are certainly a lot to add to a professional athlete's loaded schedule, but she said she fell in love with learning about the work that goes on behind the scenes to operate a high-level sports team.

""It was really interesting to be able to look under the metaphorical hood of the PA and of the Federation and kind of see the inner workings that didn't have to do so much with soccer but a little bit more of the logistical side of things and understanding how much work goes into planning,"" Davidson said. ""I take it as a responsibility, but I also get a lot of joy from it.""

""They really wanted to use their platform of both their name ... but also their social media platform and their wide reach to tell this story of economic empowerment and of how hard it is to be a woman-owned small business,"" Murphy said.

The USWNT has a friendly matchup against Canada on July 2 in Washington, D.C., kicking off at 7:30 p.m.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Five Things to Know: USMNT vs. Guatemala in Gold Cup Semifinal","https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2025/07/five-things-to-know-usmnt-guatemala-concacaf-gold-cup-semifinal","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:51:58 GMT","

The U.S. Men's National Team's Concacaf Gold Cup run continues against Guatemala in the semifinals at Energizer Park in St. Louis (7 p.m. ET on FS1).

After both teams won their quarterfinal match in a dramatic penalty shootout, tonight they will battle for a spot in the final.

Here are five things you need to know before the USA vs. Guatemala semifinal:

This current USMNT roster has been together for just about a month since they began camp in early June. Overall, the 26-player roster entered the Gold Cup with little international experience, averaging just 16 caps.

Now, coming off an exciting victory over Costa Rica in the quarterfinal, they feel they're starting to gel.

“I watch, sit back and look at these guys in the game, in the changing room, at meals, and just the bonds that are being created in such a short amount of time, I don't think you can speak about it enough,” captain defender Tim Ream said.

In the last knockout match, the team rallied behind midfielder Malik Tillman after his penalty kick in regulation clanged off the post, and the Costa Rican players had choice words after Tillman's miss. Ream pointed to that moment where his teammates fought for Tillman as an example of how they've come together.

And head coach Mauricio Pochettino couldn't be more pleased with the team's bond.

“That is what we want, that is how we feel, how we want to represent our country,” Pochettino said. “We want to fight for our flag, for our share.”

The Guatemala side features a couple of familiar faces to U.S. Soccer.

Rubio Rubín and Aaron Herrera both played for the red, white and blue with dual nationality at different levels. Rubínrepresented the senior team, earning seven caps before switching to play for Guatemala in 2022. Herrera mostly played at the youth level for the U-20 Men's National Team. He competed in the U-20 FIFA World Cup with USMNT leader Tyler Adams. Adams was close with Herrera and said it'll be a “little bit strange” facing his former national teammate.

“It will be a really unique experience,” Adams said. “[But] we know how strong Guatemala is. There's a reason that they're in the semifinal, so we can't take that for granted.”

Rubín and Herrera have become leaders for Guatemala in their own right. In this tournament, Rubín has netted two of Guatemala's four goals.

Tim Ream, a St. Louis native, will play in his hometown for the first time in a Gold Cup setting. He's played friendlies and World Cup Qualifying matches in the Gateway City.

Ream, 37, still has a deep appreciation for getting a chance to play for his country at home.

“It's something as a kid you always dream of, never knowing that you'll get the opportunity,” Ream said. “And to be able to do it representing your country, representing your town, your family, your friends is always special.”

He's started every game in the tournament and will get a chance to help propel the USA to its 13th Gold Cup Final.

The USMNT has battled Guatemala 27 times in history, dating back to 1977. The USA has a 16-5-6 winning record over the Central American nation. They have met three times in the Gold Cup, including in 1996 when Guatemala last advanced to the semifinal. Both the United States and Guatemala fell in their semifinal game and met in the third-place match, where the USA won 3-0.

The two nations most recently matched up in 2016 in a World Cup Qualifying game that the USA won 4-0 in Columbus, Ohio. Seventeen of the 27 total matches have come in tournament competition, and the U.S. came out the victor 11 times.

The USMNT beat Costa Rica 2-2, 4-3 on PKs to punch its semifinal ticket. Diego Luna and Max Arfsten scored regulation goals for the Americans. Before that, they came out of the group stage at the top of Group D, winning every match.

Meanwhile, Guatemala had a similar quarterfinal outcome, toppling the highly-favored Canada 1-1, 6-5 on PKs. However, Guatemala's journey otherwise has been quite different. They came in as complete underdogs as the third-lowest FIFA-ranked team in the tournament. Yet, the team came out of its group after an upset win over Jamaica.

The semifinals of the 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup will see the United States Men's National Team facing Guatemala in on Wednesday night.

The USMNT secured its spot in the Gold Cup semifinals after a 2-2 draw with Costa Rica. The quarterfinal match went to a shootout that extended into the sixth round, where Damion Downs scored the decisive penalty, leading the U.S. to a 3-2 victory over Costa Rica.

The USMNT will face Guatemala, who eliminated Canada after a thrilling match that ended in a 1-1 draw. The game went into a penalty shootout that extended to the seventh round. Jose Morales scored the winning penalty, giving Guatemala the edge they needed to advance to the semifinals. This is Guatemala's first semifinal appearance at the Gold Cup since 1996.

The United States men's national team are only one win away from a spot in the Gold Cup final, where they'll face the winner of Mexico and Honduras. While this semifinal match is against Guatemala instead of the expected side in Canada, it goes to show how Concacaf has improved because any team can win on their day. The USMNT almost experienced that, facing Costa Rica, where Matt Freese had to save three penalties in order to avoid going out.

That win will help propel the USMNT in this clash with Guatemala. With Mexico winning the last edition of the Gold Cup, this could give the USMNT a chance to avenge that, while players on the roster are also looking to show why they should go to the World Cup in 2026. 

Here are storylines, how you can watch the match and more:

These teams haven't met since 2016, and Guatemala hasn't scored a goal on the USMNT since 2012. This defense has had its moments of poor performances, but when that 2016 match ended in a 4-0 USMNT victory, it's easy to see how this could go. Rubio Rubin has been in good form for Guatemala and will be someone that the USMNT defense has to watch out for, but this is a game where they should be able to get a few goals in the first half to cruise to victory.

USMNT: Matt Freese, John Tolkin, Tim Ream, Chris Richards, Alex Freeman, Tyler Adams, Luca De La Torre, Diego Luna, Malik Tillman, Jack McGlynn, Patrick Agyemang

Malik Tillman, PSV: Even with missing a penalty in the Costa Rica match, there may not be a player who has improved their stock more during this tournament. With three goals and an assist, Tillman has been a central figure to this run and could be rewarded for that with a move to Bayer Leverkusen. Tillman is someone who was already likely in the USMNT squad for the 2026 World Cup, but with performances like these, he's looking to break into the starting XI during the tournament. If others can follow his lead during this camp, the USMNT will be in a good place.

Can the USMNT operate as the favorites? Facing Costa Rica, the USMNT created issues for themselves in conceding penalties and having defensive lapses. It wasn't even a full-strength Costa Rica side either, which is why the result has a tinge of concern despite the good ending. It's something that this team has to work out of their systems under Pochettino and a strong performance here will go a long way. The USMNT must ensure that they aren't beating themselves as competition gets harder all around.

Luna will set the tone with an early goal, and it'll be all USMNT from there. Like their opening match to this tournament, it will be a time that things are out of reach by halftime en route to the USMNT putting up a crooked number to book their place in the final.  Pick: USMNT 5, Guatemala 0

We're inching ever closer to a victor.

After two cutthroat rounds — where favorites Manchester City and Inter Milan were eliminated — the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has whittled the 64-team field down to eight.

Their quarterfinal round gets underway on Friday, July 4.

To kick things off, Brazil's Fluminense takes on Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal at Orlando's Camping World Stadium at 3 p.m. EST. Both underdog clubs are surprises here; they upset the aforementioned Man City and Inter Milan.

Later that day, Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field hosts Brazil's Palmeiras and England's Chelsea in their round of eight match at 9 p.m. NBC Sports claims Chelsea is the favorite to win it all, and, to add insult to injury, Palmeiras star Estevao Willian is joining Chelsea after the CWC. This one's for pride.

The next day, Saturday, July 5 at noon, France's Paris Saint Germain will do battle with Germany's Bayern Munich at Atlanta, GA's Mercedes-Benz Stadium. PSG dismantled Lionel Messi's Inter Miami FC in their previous match while Harry Kane and Bayern held off Flamengo.

Finally, Spain's Real Madrid and Germany's Borussia Dortmund close the quarterfinals at East Rutherford, NJ's MetLife Stadium at 4 p.m. and features two exciting storylines. Kylian Mbappe, the biggest remaining star in the tourney, returns after missing a game due to a stomach issue. Also of note, Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham was set to face his younger brother Jobe, who recently joined Dortmund, but Jobe was suspended for this match due to yellow-card accumulation.

Sound like fun?

If so, shockingly inexpensive tickets are available for all four high-stakes contests.

At the time of publication, the lowest price we could find for any one match was $19 including fees on Vivid Seats.

Supporters at Monterrey's Club World Cup last-16 game against Borussia Dortmund were warned by FIFA that the game could be suspended after homophobic chants were heard repeatedly during the second half.

Dortmund won the game 2-1, having led 2-0 at half-time but late in the first half as Dortmund goalkeeper Gregor Kobel sent a goal kick downfield, one section of the Mercedes-Benz Stadium crowd yelled a discriminatory chant that has, unfortunately, become synonymous with Mexican football. The chant grew louder in the second half each time Kobel sent a dead ball downfield.

FIFA confirmed during the game that it was aware of the chant and in the closing stages of the game, after the chant was heard on multiple occasions, a message was displayed on the big screen at the arena which said the game could be suspended or even abandoned if it did not stop.

The message read: “Attention please! This is an important announcement. The referee has indicated that the match may have to be suspended because of discriminatory behaviour amongst spectators. Discrimination in football stadiums will not be tolerated. If this continues the game may be suspended or even abandoned.”

The match finished before any further action was taken.

According to a FIFA representative on site in Atlanta, there is a protocol in place to first address that type of crowd behaviour and then respond to it. The objective is to give the referee the ability “to take escalating action when such incidents occur among fans or participants”. Per FIFA, such measures are part of a new FIFA disciplinary code that has been implemented for the Club World Cup.

FIFA has been criticised by anti-discrimination campaigners after football's world governing body decided against regularly displaying messages challenging racism or discrimination at the Club World Cup in the U.S..

The Athletic reported on June 16 FIFA had decided not to show videos, signage or marketing assets in venues hosting the Club World Cup in the United States which explicitly mention challenging racism or discrimination during the opening days of the tournament.

This represented a significant rollback from previous FIFA competitions, such as the Women's World Cup in 2023 in Australia and New Zealand and the men's World Cup in 2022 in Qatar.

The federation faced criticism from human rights groups, who called for a reverse of the decision, and FIFA did not explain the reasoning behind the rollback.

FIFA then displayed anti-racism and discrimination messaging at the tournament for one day to mark International Day for Countering Hate Speech. This included a video explaining FIFA's anti-racism protocols and the “universal anti-racism gesture” being played on the screen before the fixture between Manchester City and Wydad AC at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. FIFA's Unite for Inclusion campaign has also been absent in this tournament

FIFA has declined to comment when asked if the current political climate in the U.S. played any part in its decision amid hostility towards companies who support diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

This is not a new issue and this is how The Athletic explained the situation earlier this year when the chant became prevalent at the 2025 Concacaf Nations League.

The chant, in which fans shout a slur at the opposing goalkeeper during his run-up to take a goal kick, has been a tradition in Mexican football for many years, with differing stories as to its origins. But what's certain is the negative connotations it carries and the detrimental effect that it has had on the Mexican national team and Liga MX clubs over the years.

Authorities have increased efforts to stamp it out, but sections of the Mexican fanbase continue to ignore those initiatives.

Then Mexican Football Federation (FMF), together with Soccer United Marketing (SUM), the federation's U.S.-based marketing partner, and CONCACAF, the FMF has invested time and money to produce public awareness campaigns — the results of which remain inconsistent.

CONCACAF's “What's Wrong is Wrong” anti-discrimination campaign launched in 2021, and was re-launched in 2023 to coincide with a U.S.—Mexico Nations League semifinal.

The FMF has been levied fines by FIFA, the game's world governing body, and has been issued stadium bans due to the homophobic slur in recent years.

The chant has also been used by fans of clubs in Liga MX and in MLS. 2025 expansion club San Diego FC saw its inaugural home match marred by the chant, with the club issuing multiple stadium addresses in both English and Spanish asking fans to stop the behaviour. Apple TV's broadcast picked up at least six clear instances of the chant being shouted. LAFC previously had success in eradicating the chant from their matches, with players and organised fan groups preaching messages of inclusion.

It's of course not fair or accurate to generalise every Mexican fan as a participant or homophobic. The acts of a loud minority should not taint the entirety of a fanbase. But until the chant subsides on a wholesale level, the stigma surrounding matches will remain – and with a World Cup partially taking place on Mexican soil in 2026, the world is watching.

It's pretty uncommon for a pair of brothers to make it at the highest level, and even more rare for the two to face off against one another. 

Gary and Phil Neville, who spent much of their careers together at Manchester United, memorably avoided eye contact in the Goodison Park tunnel ahead of a Premier League encounter as opponents in 2010, while Kolo and Yaya Toure went head-to-head in the 2016 EFL Cup final. 

There, of course, are other high-profile examples, like Kevin-Prince and Jérôme Boateng, André and Jordan Ayew, Beppe and Franco Baresi, as well as Fabio and Paolo Cannavaro. 

Jude and Jobe Bellingham looked poised to be the next brotherly tandem to meet on the big stage, as both Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund progressed into the Club World Cup quarterfinals. However, there will be no individual face-off between the pair. Here's why. 

Madrid are taking on Dortmund in a repeat of the 2024 UEFA Champions League final at MetLife Stadium this Saturday, with a spot in the semifinals at stake. 

And while Jude is expected to earn a fifth consecutive start at the tournament, his younger brother is ineligible to feature due to suspension. 

Jobe, who joined Dortmund from Sunderland before the Club World Cup got underway in a £31 million ($42.2 million) deal, has impressed this summer, as he attempts to emulate Jude's success in the Ruhr region. 

The 19-year-old scored his first goal for the club on his first start, against Mamelodi Sundowns, but then received a booking in Dortmund's final group game against Ulsan HD. As a result, the yellow card he received in the 2–1 victory over Monterrey on Tuesday was his second of the tournament, and he'll be forced to serve a one-match ban. Jobe will be eligible to return for the semifinals if BVB advance.

“I think we all saw that he was very disappointed,” said Dortmund manager Niko Kovač post-match.

“I think he did not exactly know that the second yellow card is a suspension at half-time. He was a little bit surprised.”

While there won't be a meeting between the two in East Rutherford this weekend, plenty more opportunities for a Bellingham face-off in a competitive setting are bound to arise, even as soon as 2025–26. Dortmund's strong conclusion to the Bundesliga season meant they qualified for the Champions League, and the two teams are in Pot 1 for the league phase draw. 

However, there's less than a one in four chance that Dortmund meet Madrid in the league phase next season.

Alexis Nunes and Frank Leboeuf react to Gonzalo García's performance for Real Madrid in their 1-0 win vs. Juventus. (1:25)

Brothers Jude and Jobe Bellingham will miss the chance to face each other at the Club World Cup after Jobe picked up a yellow card in Borussia Dortmund's win over Monterrey on Tuesday.

Jude's Real Madrid will face Dortmund in the quarterfinals of the competition on Saturday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, but Jobe will miss the match through suspension.

Jobe, the younger of the two, is following in the footsteps of his brother by joining German side Dortmund from Sunderland.

""I think we all saw that he was very disappointed,"" Dortmund manager Niko Kovac said. ""I think he did not exactly know that the second yellow card is a suspension at halftime. He was a little bit surprised.""

While one door has closed, Kovac said there will be more opportunities for the siblings to face each other.

""Okay, he's young. His brother is also young, so I'm convinced they will face each other, maybe next season in the Champions League, and then the future. The future is for them.

""And yeah, the Club World Cup would be nice, but now it isn't. Someone else must play for him, but it's also okay.""

Jobe, was substituted in the 55th minute to avoid any chance of a red card, said Kovac.

""I substituted him not because of his performance. I changed because he had a yellow card in this game, and you saw we had some very intensive duels, and I did not want that someone is maybe then booked twice,"" Kovac added.

Jude spent three seasons at Dortmund after signing from boyhood club Birmingham City in 2020, before he moved to Madrid in 2023.

Both Dortmund and Madrid are unbeaten at the Club World Cup, with one draw and three wins each.

World Cup

These next two weeks at MetLife Stadium, beginning with FIFA Club World Cup's last quarterfinal match on Saturday, will serve as a critical dry run for the New Jersey-based venue as it prepares to host eight matches at the men's World Cup next year – including the final.

As he has been throughout, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy will continue to be there to take it all in. He was there for the stadium's opening clash between Palmeiras and FC Porto two weeks ago, all the way through the fourth match, a chaotic 4-4 draw between Porto and Al Ahly. Like fans, Gov. Murphy withstood scorching temperatures during June's dangerous heat wave and waited through scattered thunderstorms that suspended the fixture between Al Ahly and Palmeiras for 30 minutes.

Concerns over playing through summer weather conditions have become a lightning rod of a topic during the Club World Cup, with start-time discourse and U.S. meteorology now an unavoidable part of the competition. Fans globally are growing familiar with just how catastrophic American summers can be. In New Jersey, specifically, that's come in the form of extreme heat and scattered thunderstorms.

The heat is least bearable during midday and early afternoon hours, which is when several matches for the Club World Cup were scheduled – including the quarterfinal, both semifinals and final at MetLife. Football's global players union FIFPRO has urged FIFA to abandon plans for midday and afternoon kickoffs to avoid the heat in three “extremely high risk” venues at the World Cup next year (Kansas City, Miami and Monterrey in Mexico). The union labeled MetLife as being a “high risk” location.

The union said it made presentations to FIFA about kickoff times, but the union's leadership fears “commercial interests,” driven by a pressure to satisfy a huge global TV audience – particularly in Europe and Asia – will hold sway in some cases, as The Athletic reported.

To that end, Murphy indicated that, as of now, the plan is for a 2026 World Cup final that begins with a 3 p.m. ET kickoff.

“I don't want to speak for FIFA, and obviously they call the shots, but I think they're circling in and around 3 p.m. New Jersey time for the World Cup final on July 19,” Murphy told The Athletic by phone on Tuesday.

The Athletic understands that the time for next year's final is not yet set in stone, and a review of lessons learned from the Club World Cup is still pending. A 3 p.m. start time, however, falls in line with the last four games of the Club World Cup at MetLife. Saturday's quarterfinal between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund features a 4 p.m. kickoff. The semifinals and final are slated for 3 p.m. starts.

To adapt to the extreme heat, FIFA has implemented some rules, including hydration breaks during games. Some teams have directed their bench players to watch games from inside locker rooms. Players have also regularly been seen with cooling or ice towels draped over their heads.

Murphy said he “feels like a meteorologist,” constantly checking the weather over the course of this tournament. As of Tuesday evening, the local forecast for Saturday calls for a high of 85 degrees, with temperatures peaking between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m.

“Heat has been a concern across the tournament, no question about it,” Murphy said. “I think we've managed it very well in New Jersey. … It goes with the territory if you're in North America in early to mid-summer, playing a lot of late afternoon (and) early evening matches. It's a factor, but I'm highly confident we'll find our way through this.”

These final games, as Murphy told The Athletic, will likely mirror what's in store for next year. Larger crowds are expected, compared to the relatively sparse turnout for the first four games there, another crucial test for the city's infrastructure as organizers finalize their transportation plan with FIFA for 2026.

Crowds at MetLife for the first half of this tournament have floated around half-capacity. It's expected that these final games in New Jersey will draw more fans, so long as fans are not deterred by ticket pricing. As of Tuesday evening, tickets for Saturday's quarterfinal – before Real Madrid's opponent was known – were starting at $128.25, before taxes and fees. (Once Dortmund punched its ticket to the next round, that price point dipped slightly to $107.05.)

While weather discourse remains ongoing, for the “final four” matches at MetLife, as Murphy calls them, he will be focusing on transportation, safety and security and the fan experience. The latter, he says, has been better than he's ever witnessed at the venue – which is saying a lot, even if an exaggeration. It speaks to the fans that have been fueling this tournament, and why FIFA has been such a staunch advocate of the expanded club competition.

“I go to games of one sort or another at MetLife year-round practically,” Murphy said. “And I've never heard such noise. The spirit has been extraordinary.”

“We always wanted to play a major role in this Club World Cup,” he added. “We let that be known to (FIFA) president (Gianni) Infantino and all the FIFA folks, right from the get-go.”

Began working for Murphy as an intern in 2019

By David Wildstein, July 02 2025
1:00 pm

A top aide to Gov. Phil Murphy has left the governor's office to take a key post at the FIFA World Cup New York/New Jersey Host Committee.

Natalie Hamilton, who joined Murphy's staff as an intern in 2019, joined the governor's office in 2021 and became press secretary in 2024.  She will serve as the director of communications of the host committee.

“Natalie's deep knowledge of the region—its people, its diversity, and its energy—makes her uniquely positioned to help share our story with the world,” said Alex Lasry, the host committee CEO.  “We're excited to have someone with her regional insight, strategic vision, and commitment to community and public service help lead our efforts as we prepare to welcome the world in 2026.”

Murphy praised Hamilton's service.

“Natalie Hamilton has been an invaluable member of my team. Her sharp judgment, tireless work ethic, and strong, respectful relationship with the press corps made her an outstanding Press Secretary,” Murphy said.  “While we're saddened to see her depart for the NYNJ Host Committee, I'm confident she'll excel as the committee's director of communications.”

After graduating from the University of Delaware, Hamilton worked on Murphy's re-election campaign in 2021 and joined the governor's office that year.

In 2023, she took a short leave of absence to serve as a communications advisor to Brandon Presley, the Democratic candidate for governor of Mississippi.","{'href': 'https://newjerseyglobe.com', 'title': 'New Jersey Globe'}","soccer"

Nearly 100 civil rights groups have signed a letter sent to FIFA expressing concern over United States immigration policies ahead of the men's soccer World Cup next year, which will feature several matches hosted in New Jersey.

The July 1 letter, first reported by The Athletic, urged soccer's top governing body to ""use its influence to encourage the U.S. government to guarantee the fundamental rights of the millions of foreign visitors and fans."" The message cited recent policies enforced by President Donald Trump, including a full travel ban for citizens of 12 countries and nationwide raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.

""If FIFA continues to stay silent, not only will millions be placed at risk, but the FIFA brand will also be used as a public relations tool to whitewash the reputation of an increasingly authoritarian government,"" the civil rights organizations stated.

Groups that signed the letter include Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP. The message was also signed by unions based in eight states scheduled to host World Cup matches: New York, Pennsylvania, California, Massachusetts, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Missouri.

MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford will be the site of eight fixtures during the 2026 World Cup, including the final on July 19. The United States is co-hosting the tournament along with Mexico and Canada.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino supported the efforts of the U.S. to host the World Cup at the annual FIFA Congress in Paraguay May 15, where he said foreigners will have no issues entering the country next summer.

""The world is welcome in America,"" Infantino said. ""Of course, the players, of course, everyone involved, all of us, but definitely also all the fans.""

Vice President JD Vance, in a May 6 White House event touting the upcoming tournament, shared the same sentiment but warned travelers not to overstay their visas.

""We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the game,"" he said. ""But when the time is up, they'll have to go home. Otherwise, they will have to talk to (U.S. Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem.""

Never one to shy away from the spotlight, Nick Kyrgios continues to make headlines with his comments on and off the tour.

Ahead of Wimbledon, Kyrgios reacted as the BBC decided against hiring him as a commentator, as they had done in 2024.

The Aussie claimed it was ‘very strange' they wouldn't want someone of his calibre sharing insight, as he argued he was a better choice than former Wimbledon quarterfinalist Chris Eubanks.

As it turns out, the BBC hadn't hired Eubanks either, as the American explained on social media in reaction to Kyrgios' comments.

Snubbed by the BBC, Kyrgios is working for another British media outlet, TalkSport, at Wimbledon, as he now gives his verdict on his fellow ATP star's controversial comments.

Looking to make his presence felt at Wimbledon, world number eight Holger Rune suffered a shock defeat in his opening match.

Struggling with a knee injury, the Dane lost to Chile's Nicolas Jarry in five sets, 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 4-6.

Causing controversy after the match, Rune claimed he would've beaten Jarry if his knee had been 100%.

“In normal conditions, I'd beat him nine times out of ten, with all due respect to Nicolas Jarry. Obviously, I didn't have it easy today with my knee, but yes, it wasn't a great match,” he said during his press conference.

Sharing his thoughts on Rune's comments, Kyrgios named the 22-year-old as his ‘villain of the week'.

“My villain of the week is Holger [Rune]. I just love that comment, straight away saying that he would beat [Nicolas] Jarry nine times out of ten,” he said.

“That is like the cockiest comment ever but I like it. That is something I would have said in my press conferences.

“That is why I do like Holger. I do like that, and that has stirred up the media a little bit.”

Rune will now set his sights on the US Open in September as he looks to get back on track at the Grand Slams.

In Rune's first eight Grand Slam tournaments, he qualified for three quarterfinals, but has remarkably failed to return to the quarterfinals since.

Since Rune last made the quarterfinals, he's lost his round of 16 match on four occasions, narrowly missing out.

Unfortunately for the Dane, he now faces a trip to New York for the US Open in September, statistically his worst Grand Slam event.

On his previous four visits to Flushing Meadows, Rune won just one match, heading into this year's tournament with a dismal 1-4 (20%) record.

In 2024, Rune was well beaten in straight sets by home-favorite Brandon Nakashima 2-6, 1-6, 4-6, as his US Open woes continued.

He'll be hoping for a better showing this time around, as he looks to improve his record at the year's final major tournament.

To do so, he'll need to be fully fit, as the 22-year-old has struggled with various injuries over the years, which have cost him on the biggest of stages.

Sending a message on social media after his Wimbledon exit, Rune updated fans on his injury status, as he now prepares for the North American hard-court swing.

Not a happy ending for me on the grass this year . Will have my knee checked and keep you updated 😢 good luck Jarry for the rest of Wimbledon 🍀

“Not a happy ending for me on the grass this year. Will have my knee checked and keep you updated,” he said on X.

Rune is currently scheduled to return to action at the Canadian Open, where he lost in the third round 12 months ago.

A trip to Cincinnati will follow, before Rune returns to the US Open, which begins on August 24.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The International Tennis HOF will pay equal prize money to the men's and women's draws of its new ATP Challenger/WTA 125 tournament this month through a sponsorship agreement with The MARGARET Fund, a more-than-three-decade-old Title IX advocacy organization created by ITHF Executive Board Member and former Women's Sports Foundation CEO Deborah Larkin. 

With The MARGARET Fund's support, the Hall of Fame Open will offer $200,000 in total prize money to both its ATP and WTA draws, representing a 60% increase on the women's side and making the tournament's total purse the highest among 125 events on both tours. The deal, which was negotiated without agency involvement, will designate The MARGARET Fund a supporting sponsor of the tournament and see its branding attached to the Hall of Fame Open's logo in promotional materials. While the financial terms of The MARGARET Fund's investment were not disclosed, ITHF CEO Dan Faber told SBJ their contribution is at the level of a title sponsor.

“It's a great story, that a [ITHF] board member is using their financial means and their passion to help us excite and engage others out there to support the mission of the organization,” Faber said. “And more importantly, to help the Hall of Fame make a statement.”

Larkin added that the deal “was born out of passion for women's leadership and gender equity.”

“It's very important that the tournament gets sponsored and shows the public and the players and the WTA and the ATP that this tournament has strong support,” she said. “We're a worldwide organization and we need to show the world that we want equality for all people, and in this case we're able to show that it extends to equal pay.”

Larkin and The MARGARET Fund have pledged to invest across the ITHF's business -- including initiatives like its ”Be Legendary"" youth engagement program -- for the next four years, but Faber added the ITHF will continue to seek a corporate supporting sponsor to address level prize money at the Hall of Fame Open (with The MARGARET Fund retaining right of first refusal on the tournament sponsorship).

The ATP and WTA set the prize pools for each of their events, so Faber said the ITHF secured necessary approvals before bringing on a partner to help elevate the women's side.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","‘Hell yeah, I'm here!': Holmgren's journey from theatre student to Wimbledon winner","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/holmgren-wimbledon-2025-feature","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 19:44:12 GMT","

 Milestones in tennis are sometimes like London buses. You wait a long time for one, and then two come along at once. 

 That has been the case for August Holmgren at 2025 Wimbledon. Last Thursday, the No. 192 player in the PIF ATP Rankings defeated Yosuke Watanuki in the final round of Wimbledon qualifying to seal his spot in the main draw at a major for the first time. On Tuesday, the Dane backed up that win by racing past Quentin Halys to earn his maiden Grand Slam match win. 

 At 27 years old, Holmgren had to be patient for his first taste of major action. When it arrived, he made winning on one of tennis' biggest stages appear straightforward, defeating Halys 7-6(4), 6-3, 6-4. 

 “I was happily surprised. I'm very happy that I didn't really have a dip in level in all three sets, which is uncommon for a five-set match,” Holmgren told ATPTour.com at Wimbledon. “On the one hand, I'm not surprised, because I have so much faith in my serve and my game. On the other hand, I'm really happy and ecstatic to be like, ‘Hell, yeah, I'm here!'”

 Hailing from Espergaerde in Denmark, Holmgren played college tennis from 2017 to 2022 at the University of San Diego, where he earned a bachelor's degree in theatre arts and performance studies. In California, the Dane's coaches and teammates quickly came to know him as an open-minded student-athlete with multiple interests, and someone who was not afraid to take on new challenges. 

 “[August] did everything,” recalled Ryan Keckley, men's tennis head coach at USD, who has been at Wimbledon this week watching both Holmgren and current USD star Oliver Tarvet. “He just loved USD. This is a guy who on a Tuesday would go like salsa dancing because it was in the room next to his dorm or something like that. 

 “On Saturdays in his junior year, he took a surfing class. He loved everything that was USD, [joined] every club he could. He filled his time from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed.”

 For Holmgren, keeping up pursuits outside of tennis was, and still remains, an essential aspect of what made him a better tennis player. 

“I think the most valuable thing I got from college was understanding that I need to have a balance with tennis and life off the court,” he said. “To make sure I was happy off the court, because I needed that in order to be happy on the court. 

 “Often in my life when I have some disruption, in my personal life, it reflects on my tennis. If I don't do my hobbies and only focus on tennis, it has a negative impact on me. So I need to have those other things in life to balance it out.” 

 Holmgren's desire to try new things should not be mistaken as lack of commitment to his tennis. The Dane, who is now coached by former Wimbledon doubles champion Frederik Nielsen, has competed relentlessly on the ATP Challenger Tour and ITF World Tennis Tour since leaving San Diego. 

 “His work ethic was insatiable,” remembers Keckley. “August is a guy who, any time he steps on a court, he's going to make you a better tennis player just because of his attitude and his work ethic, and just his overall demeanour. He's just a wonderful human being. A wonderful, kind, genuine human being. 

 “It doesn't surprise me that this has unlocked for him this week. He's got an incredible serve. He's worked really hard on his game, and he's got a great supporting cast with Freddie Nielsen, who obviously has experience at the highest level of the Tour, helping him along the way and navigating not only his tennis, but his mind, which is probably one of the most important things for the young men.” 



 Holmgren was willing to throw himself into new experiences and situations at college. While he is not sure that has had a direct impact on his ability to navigate the trials and tribulations of the pro circuit, he does think that his willingness to embrace ‘the moment' is one of his strengths. 

 “I talk a lot with Freddie about who I want to be in big moments,” said Holmgren. “Am I going to be scared and hope my opponent is going to give me the match or am I going to go out and take it? How do I react to uncomfortable moments? 

 “Do I resign and let my ego tell the world that, ‘This is so unfair, I am usually much better. The world is mistreating me'? Or do I take responsibility and say that everything that happens here is something that I just need to deal with?” 

 Already up 39 spots to No. 153 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings after his win against World No. 46 Halys, Holmgren will hope to forge a third milestone moment in the space of a week on Wednesday. If he can upset 21st seed Tomas Machac on the All England Club's No. 12 Court, it will be the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking.

Canadian wins on Wimbledon debut to book Fritz second round

He's competing in his first Wimbledon main draw and got lost trying to find the practice courts at Aorangi Park the other day; yet judging by his dominant opening-round victory on Monday, you could never tell that Gabriel Diallo was in unfamiliar territory.

The Canadian kicked off his campaign at the All England Club with a 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 performance against Germany's Daniel Altmaier to book a highly-anticipated second round with fifth-seeded American Taylor Fritz.

This time last year, Diallo was ranked 166 in the world and had just lost in the second round of Wimbledon qualifying.

He arrived at SW19 for this fortnight's Championships in a completely different position – enjoying a career-high ranking of No.40 and fresh off of a maiden ATP title captured on the lawns of ‘s-Hertogenbosch.

Unlike last season when he could only see the courts at Roehampton, where the Wimbledon qualifying rounds are played, this time around, Diallo got to set foot inside the All England Club for the first time and he extended his stay by notching an impressive victory on Monday.

“I've been able to play some good grass-court tennis the last three weeks, so I'm looking forward to carry the momentum here,” said Diallo, whose big serve and powerful groundstrokes are perfectly suited for the grass.

“It's my first time ever on the grounds, so it's a surreal moment for sure.

“You can feel the prestige from the event. It's in these moments that you try to be grateful to be here and compete your butt off.”

This all still relatively new for Diallo.

The Montreal-native played college tennis at the University of Kentucky, where he studied finance and helped the team reach the NCAA finals for the first time in program history, before turning pro at the end of 2022.

By his own description, Diallo wasn't a highly-rated junior and he says going to college was a “no-brainer” for him.

It was in Kentucky where he truly developed both his game and character, under the tutelage of Wildcats head coach Cedric Kauffmann.

“I think I just became a little bit more obviously mature, learning to manage the school aspect and tennis,” he explained.

“And another aspect that I think is pretty underrated, but the social aspect. Most of us, a lot of us in juniors, we go to home-school quite quickly. So, at 14, 15, you're not going to class anymore. You're not interacting with other people. You kind of see the same people at tournaments.

“So to go back to class and meeting new people and all that stuff mixed up with the pressure of performing in tennis in school, I think it just enabled me to become better at just managing situations in general.

“And I think it just gave me much more structure in my game. I think going into college, I was very flashy, could produce a lot of good things. And then do some things that were not so good.

“So I think my college coach did a really good job, just kind of introducing me to the fundamentals and then the rest. Yeah, I managed to have a very nice progression throughout the years.”

Diallo qualified for his first Grand Slam at Roland-Garros last season and he claimed his first major main draw victory at the US Open, where he reached the third round as a qualifier.

In New York, he knocked out a 24th-ranked Arthur Fils before falling to 14th-seeded Tommy Paul in four close sets in round three.

That run caught the attention of many, including NBA legend Steve Nash, who sent Diallo a follow request on Instagram, and Canadian comedian Sammy Sugar, who attended one of his matches in New York.

By October, Diallo had cracked the top 100 and this season, and the 203cm big-hitter has continued to gather momentum ever since, with standout performances at the Masters 1000 in Madrid – where he reached the quarter-finals as a lucky loser – and more recently on grass in ‘s-Hertogenbosch, where he was crowned champion.

Diallo says his ability to manage matches has been the biggest improvement he has made since turning pro.

“In college, every match is a huge deal because you only play twice a week. And if you lose, your ranking as a team goes down, even individually,” he said.

“So there's so much expectation and pressure every match to bring it, regardless against who you play. So I think I tried maybe to bring that to the tour, which can be good, but realistically more often than not, you finish the week by losing.

“So I guess I learned to manage that and navigate that a little bit better, not putting too much emphasis on one particular match. Kind of try to approach every match the same, just like in practice. But it was definitely a transition for me.”

Diallo can cut a serious figure on court during matches, but off the court, he doesn't like to take life too seriously. He recently spontaneously bleached his hair, and even though the colour is not exactly how he liked it, he says he enjoys “messing around” with his look every once in a while.

He was born in Montreal to a Guinean father and Ukrainian mother, who met in Moscow while studying there in the late 1970s before getting married and moving to Canada in the mid-‘90s in the wake of the dismantlement of the Soviet Union.

Diallo's mother was a professional handball player and he says he carries traits from both his parents to balance out his personality.

He wears a necklace that has a ring hanging from it, which is a family heirloom passed down from generation to another from his mother's side. He hopes to pass it on to his own children one day.

“I think the character and competitiveness, I get it from my mother because she played sports at a very high level. And she's just a fiery person in general,” he said.

“Maybe a little bit too much character outside of sports. So I think that's where my dad stepped in. So I think I can part ways a little bit. But yeah, for sure, you feel like you have a little bit of both.

“But I found myself also sometimes when I was younger, you kind of feel not lost, but maybe confused. Because you're not quite 100 percent one or you're not quite 100 percent the other.

“And I remember growing up, it would confuse me a little bit. But I just learned to embrace my heritage and my origins. And I'm just as proud to be Ukrainian as Guinean and represent the Canadian flag.”

Diallo is a big movie buff and names ‘Requiem for a Dream' as one of the films he particularly enjoys.

He also liked watching Michael Jordan's docu-series ‘The Last Dance' and tries to draw inspiration from it.

“Just seeing how he's a very fiery competitor and just brings it every day, every match, in practice. I thought that was pretty cool and something that I try to bring myself,” said Diallo of the NBA great.

“Maybe not at this level. And it's quite different because we're an individual sport, but just bring it every day. Regardless of how you feel, try to bring your 100 percent. There's people that wish that they were in your position. And you've got goals that you aspire to. So you've got to be hard on yourself, I would say.”

Diallo was proud of his opening-round form, which he described as “really sharp”.

“I was so fired up and amped up to be here and to play my first Wimbledon. So I try to come out the gates and just try to take it to him as much as I can. And luckily today was very successful,” Diallo said on Monday.

His next opponent, Fritz, is well aware of the challenge Diallo poses.

“We say 'bot' as a compliment. He's a bot, but he's good,” said Fritz, referring to Diallo's excellent serve, which would classify him as a ‘servebot'.

“Obviously he can play. He can play from the back of the court. I practiced with him. He honestly has a very well-rounded game and can do a bit of everything.”","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland Garros'}","tennis"

COCO Gauff was left emotional after an early Wimbledon exit on Tuesday.

Gauff entered Wimbledon coming off a Grand Slam win at Roland Garros, but ended up losing in the first round.

Gauff was the No. 2 seed at Wimbledon, but was taken out in a stunning defeat to unranked Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska.

In her presser after the match, Gauff shared that she was feeling mentally ""overwhelmed"" while wiping away tears.

""I feel like mentally I was little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards, so I didn't feel like I had enough time to do, I guess celebrate and then also get back into it,"" she said.

""But it's the first time, in this experience, like coming off a win and having to play at Wimbledon, and I definitely learned about what I would and would not do again.""

Gauff lost to Yastremska in straight sets, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1.

""I have faith that if I can make these adjustments, I can do well here, I really do want to do well here, I'm not someone who wants to write myself off grass this early in my career, but I definitely need to make some changes if I want to be successful,"" she said.

Gauff has gone as far as the fourth round at Wimbledon, including last year's tournament.

With the US Open approaching soon, Gauff is trying to keep her chin up for the home tournament.

""I'm trying to be positive,"" Gauff said.

""After the match I was definitely struggling in the locker room.

""I don't like losing, and I think for me the main thing I'm sure my team and everyone is going to tell me is 'you did well at Roland Garros don't be so upset' and things like that.""

Despite a positive mindset, Gauff was still incredibly upset about the first-round exit and wiped away tears throughout her presser.

""I just feel a little disappointed in how I showed up today,"" she said.

""I feel like I could have been a little bit better in those tough tiebreaker moments.

""Especially after Roland Garros when I felt like I learned a lot in those tiebreakers.

""So yea obviously I'm not going to dwell on this too long because I want to do well at US Open and maybe losing here in the first round isn't the worst thing because of that.

""But yea, it definitely sucks.""

Wimbledon runs through July 13 and the US Open begins on August 24.

American tennis pros were bounced early from Wimbledon this year, with several top-ranked players dropping in the first and second rounds of the tournament at the historic All England Club this week.

Frances Tiafoe, the 12th-seeded men's player, exited the Grand Slam after losing a tough battle to Cam Norrie in the second round on Wednesday. The British tennis player, who entered the tournament unseeded, advanced to the third round after a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5 victory.

Follow live updates and scores from day three of the Wimbledon Championships at the All England Club

It's day three at Wimbledon 2025 and a packed day is almost done, with a raft of British players in action including Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter, as well as Carlos Alcaraz, Naomi Osaka and a host of other big names.

The first Brit on court today was Sonay Kartal, sweeping aside Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova in straight sets, though Billy Harris was beaten by Portuguese No 1 Nuno Borges. British qualifier Oliver Tarvet also exited, showing heart in a loss to defending champion Alcaraz in the match of his life, but Cameron Norrie advanced with an epic win over Frances Tiafoe on Court One. Raducanu, meanwhile, passed a huge test against former champion Marketa Vondrousova, downing the Czech in straight sets.

Yesterday Jack Draper cruised through to the second round, but Heather Watson and Jodie Burrage were early casualties among the home prospects. There were more dramatic exits in the women's draw, however, when third seed Jessica Pegula and fifth seed Zheng Qinwen were eliminated, before French Open champion Coco Gauff lost to Dayana Yastremska in the final match on Court One.

The men's No 3 seed Alexander Zverev suffered a shock defeat to France's Arthur Rinderknech but top seed Jannik Sinner swept past Italian Luca Nardi. Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic saw off the stout challenge of Alexandre Muller to make his way into the next round, crediting “miracle pills” for his turnaround.

Follow all of the latest from Wimbledon with The Independent's live blog below:

The last four years have been strange for Emma Raducanu. On one hand, she has long been trying to recapture the form of her breakthrough season, when she reached the fourth round at Wimbledon before sealing a stunning victory at the US Open. On the other hand, she has been trying to distance herself from that 2021 campaign, and the consensus among many in the tennis world is that the 22-year-old should not be held to those standards.

Yet it was difficult to put that captivating first appearance in SW19 out of the mind when, on Wednesday, the Briton stood across from Marketa Vondrousova in the second round – the same player she beat at the same stage, four years ago.

It was even harder to cast aside memories of that dizzying summer when Raducanu achieved the same result.

Alex Pattle reports from Wimbledon:

Cameron Norrie is enjoying tennis more than ever after reaching the third round of Wimbledon with a tenacious victory against 12th seed Frances Tiafoe.

In doing so he booked a likely clash with Queen's finalist Jiri Lehecka in the third round, and looks set to enter that tie full of confidence.

""I played an unreal match,"" he said. ""I think it was a very good performance from me.

""Mentally, as well - I was very stable throughout the whole match. I think if you spoke to Frances he would probably say the same.

""It was a very high-level match. He was playing so well but I never really flinched. I just kept doing what I was doing and made the match on my terms. I can take a lot of confidence from that.""

Ollie Tarvet insists he will not be quitting university in San Diego to go professional before he's finished his course.

“Nothing's changed based on the last 10 days. I still want to go back to University of San Diego, it's been incredible. I think I have a few things, a few creases in my game I need to iron out. I think if you give me a year, especially with the coaches that we have at USD, I think I'll be in a much better spot.”

Report from Centre Court:

Another women's top seed bites the dust!

We've had the likes of Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Zheng Qinwen all crash out in the early stages of Wimbledon this year.

And now, World No 4 and last year's Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini has herself suffered an early exit, losing to Kamilla Rakhimova 6-4 4-6 4-6 to leave things wide open in the women's singles.

Three days and we've already had bucket-loads of drama. Long may it continue!

“I've played against really good players before but not quite the level of Alcaraz,” Tarvet said. “As soon as I dropped to 95% focus, I lost the game. When I missed the first serve, the guy's on the baseline and it's intimidating, he's ready to make you run.”

Emma Raducanu jokes that there will be “no pressure” now that she's playing the World No 1 in Aryna Sabalenka in her next match.

She said: “When you play an opponent like her you know you have to play well so I guess there is no pressure on me at all in the next round!""

Underdog she may be, but the likes of Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Zheng Qinwen - and just now, Jasmine Paolini - are among the top seeds to have already crashed out of Wimbledon. Who says Sabalenka can't be next?

""I think today I played really, really well,” she said. “There were some points that I have no idea how I turned around. 

“I knew playing Marketa was going to be an incredibly difficult match. She has won this tournament which is a huge achievement. I'm really pleased with how I played my game the whole way through.

“I knew today I had to be aggressive because if I pushed the ball around Vondrousova would beat me. Mark [Petchey] has helped me a lot, everyone in that box. The support was incredible and I felt it today. The atmosphere was electric.”

Dayana Yastremska made headlines Tuesday by completing one of the biggest upsets at Wimbledon with her first-round victory in straight sets over No. 2 seed Coco Gauff. 

But the unseeded Ukrainian tennis player isn't a complete unknown. 

The 25-year-old is ranked No. 42 in the world and has three WTA singles titles to her name, while having her best finish in a major at the 2024 Australian Open when she reached the semifinals.

But Tuesday's victory was by far the biggest of her career and is sure to add an extra buzz around Yastremska.

Yastremska already has an interesting backstory due to her apparent allergy to grass — the same surface she's playing on at Wimbledon.

Yastremska, who celebrated her 25th birthday in May, detailed her allergy after she reached the final at the Nottingham Open earlier this month, saying at the time that “I really love playing on grass, even though I think I have a bit of an allergy to grass!” 

She already had quite the following on social media with 217,000 followers on Instagram, where she's posted content around her tennis career and stylish shots from parties and modeling.

“I like modeling, I like fashion, I like philosophy, and I like many things to do,” she's quoted as saying in a 2024 Tennis.com article. “But I don't have much time for it.”

And her talents extend beyond the court as Yastremska showed off her singing chops during the COVID-19 pandemic and released two singles during the summer of 2020 titled “Thousands of Me” and “Favourite Track.”

“I do not strive to become a cool artist,” she wrote in a post on Instagram in 2020. “I just like to sing, I like this whole atmosphere. It's much easier for me on the tennis court, than being in the studio, standing near the microphone, and singing, it's such a stress for me!”

Yastremska paused her musical ambitions in 2021 during a provisional doping ban following a positive test for a prohibited substance, but she was cleared six months later after an independent tribunal ruled that the positive result was due to contamination of the test sample.

She was also forced to flee her home in February 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine, revealing in a social media post that after two nights in an underground parking garage, her parents decided to send her and her sister out of the country. 

In February 2024, Yastremska released a new single, “Hearts,” which she described as a “song for Ukraine.” 

Yastremska will face Anastasia Zakharova in the second round of Wimbledon.

Coco Gauff has suffered a shock first round defeat at Wimbledon this year.

Gauff was beaten by Dayana Yastremska in her first Grand Slam match since winning Roland Garros last month.

The world number two is the highest seeded casualty from Wimbledon so far, with Gauff's defeat receiving a huge reaction.

While this is an unusual position for Gauff to be in, it is not the first time that she has suffered an opening round loss at Wimbledon.

The only other time that Gauff has lost in the first round of Wimbledon is in 2023, when she was beaten by compatriot Sofia Kenin.

Gauff had reached the latter stages of Roland Garros again that year, but was unable to transition to the grass courts of Wimbledon.

However, what Gauff was able to do after that was truly remarkable, as she went on to win 18 of her next 19 matches.

Gauff would hire coach Brad Gilbert after her disappointment, and he would help her win titles in Washington D.C and Cincinnati ahead of her home Grand Slam at the US Open.

Despite not always playing her best tennis in New York, Gauff would win the Grand Slam at the US Open.

This would make her first round defeat at Wimbledon in 2023 worth it, as she became the first American to win the women's singles title at her home major in six years.

Although it was unclear as to what would be next for Gauff when she lost in the first round of the US Open in 2023, she had already hinted that better things were coming.

When speaking in her post-match press conference at Wimbledon that year, Gauff revealed that her defeat had only motivated her to get better.

“I mean, it really wants me to work harder,” said Gauff. “Right now I'm very frustrated and disappointed. So, yeah, I think it makes me want to work even harder. I feel like I have been working hard, but clearly it's not enough.

“I have to go back to the drawing board and see where I need to improve and how to do the right drills to do that.”

This should reassure Gauff after her most recent loss to Yastremska, as she looks to bounce back ahead of the North American hard court swing.

Gauff has struggled on grass compared to the other surfaces, and should be much more comfortable on the hard courts closer to home.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The Brief

Coco Gauff, the world No. 2 and former Atlanta resident, was eliminated in the first round of Wimbledon by Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska.

The upset comes just three weeks after Gauff won the French Open, making her the third woman in the Open era to suffer this turnaround.

Gauff said the quick transition from clay to grass was a challenge and contributed to the early loss.

ATLANTA - Coco Gauff's Wimbledon run ended almost as quickly as it began. The 21-year-old former Atlanta resident, currently ranked No. 2 in the world, was eliminated in the first round Tuesday in a stunning upset by Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska.

What we know

Gauff, who entered the tournament as a top contender following her recent victory at the French Open, lost in straight sets. She acknowledged the short turnaround between clay and grass courts contributed to her early exit.

The loss makes Gauff only the third woman in the Open era to win the French Open and then lose her opening match at Wimbledon. The quick transition between the two Grand Slams has long been considered one of the most challenging in tennis.

The backstory

Gauff currently lives in Delray Beach, Florida, her family's hometown and her birthplace. Although she spent her early years in Atlanta, her family returned to Florida when Coco was 7 years old.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","tennis"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","Vukic hopes the touch of grass will be Sinner's undoing","https://au.news.yahoo.com/vukic-hopes-touch-grass-sinners-190000519.html","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 19:00:00 GMT","

On paper it is a mismatch, fortunately for Aleksandar Vukic he will be meeting Jannik Sinner, in the pick of Australia's quartet of Wimbledon day four second-round ties, on grass.

An old cliché perhaps, but in this case it has relevance because of all the surfaces tennis is played on, grass is the one the Australian believes gives him the best chance of dethroning the world No.1.

Vukic came into the grasscourt grand slam off the back of a terrible run of form.

Since beating then 22-ranked Sebastian Korda in the second round of the Australian Open in January he played 14 tour-level matches losing all but one of them - a victory over 149-ranked Nicolas Moreno De Alboran in Rome in May. And in the following game Korda avenged that Melbourne loss.

During this period the 29-year-old slipped from 67 to 93 in the rankings.

By contrast, since the start of January 2024, Sinner has played 101 matches losing nine. Five of those defeats have come against Carlos Alcaraz, three of the others have been against Andrey Rublev, Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas, all ranked in the top 12 at the time.

It is the outlier that gives Vukic hope, at Halle last month when the Italian lost to Alexander Bublik, ranked 45, at Halle on grass.

""If there's a surface and a time to do it, it's probably now,"" he said ahead of Thursday's match (local time).

""He's world No.1 for a reason. He didn't lose too many matches last year or this. If there's a surface to play him on it's probably this one, just because it's a bit more random, so more upsets can happen - hopefully I can be one of those.""

Vukic played Sinner in 2021 and 2022, losing in straight sets on both occasions, but they were on hard courts.

""I think a hard court, when everything's in the perfect slot for him, that's where he feels at his most comfortable and you can't really get it out of his zone,"" added the Sydneysider.

""Grass, you move so different on it. That's why I might actually have a good chance to expose him, just because it is grass and no one moves amazingly yet.

""That's probably where I'll have more of an advantage than the previous times. Hopefully I can recognise that, but I'm going to have to play very well.""

Vukic has been here before. He's faced a world No.1, losing to Novak Djokovic at Indian Wells last year, and played a Wimbledon show court when he faced Carlos Alcaraz in the same round on Court No.1 last year.

Vukic lost in straight sets, but took the first to a tie-break and feels that experience could be invaluable.

""That definitely helps. I remember last year going onto the court for the first time. It's a little bit surreal, but it's also a little bit more peaceful, less distracting, because the outside courts are quite chaotic with a lot going on around.

""The fans are very close, there's a lot going on from other matches as well. You hear kind of all the voices around.""

""Maybe,"" he joked, ""I'll ask to play him on Court 18, see how he gets on out there."" 

In reality the All England Club have scheduled the tie for prime time on Centre Court. Quite the stage for an upset.

""Things will have to go my way. I'm going to have to serve very well for sure. I'll have to take my chances but I've got nothing to lose. The pressure's on him.""

The same applies to Ben Shelton, the US No.10 seed who Rinky Hijikata takes on, but also to Australia's No.1 man and woman, Alex de Minaur and Daria Kasatkina.

They will each be expected to progress against Arthur Cazaux and Irina-Camelia Begu respectively, who are both, co-incidentally, ranked 115th in the world.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's fierce battle in Austria

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Bortoleto challenges Alonso in Spielberg

Previous

Next

Upcoming

Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer analyses what's going wrong for Yuki Tsunoda, why Max Verstappen is seemingly the only driver capable of driving the Red Bull – and the conundrum this has created for team boss Christian Horner.

Max Verstappen's early retirement from the Austrian Grand Prix put the focus on Yuki Tsunoda's poor form in the second Red Bull. With Max out, the rest of the Red Bull team's sole focus was the car struggling at the opposite end of the grid. Winding up last at the end of a combative 70 laps, it was another day to forget for the Japanese racer.

The stark reality for Red Bull is that without Verstappen's considerable haul of points, they would be last in the Teams' championship.

After Liam Lawson's disappointing two-race stint for the senior team, things looked temporarily better for Tsunoda at Red Bull, but he is now slumping back to a form worse than Sergio Perez and no better than Lawson's couple of races. The truth is, without Verstappen, Red Bull aren't even midfielders, they are tail-enders in Formula 1 and even a long way adrift of Racing Bulls.

It's been well documented that the car is hard to drive, but you sensed the frustration from Christian Horner in his post Grand Prix comments – “it isn't an easy car to drive, but it's not that difficult either”.

It must have been a tough reality check for the pit wall who didn't have their star driver in play, and who seems the only man capable of driving Red Bull's cars over the last seven years.

So why is the Dutchman the only driver seemingly able to extract decent pace from the Red Bull?

Max has a very specific style and an incredible feel for the car. He likes a positive front end and a car that can be sharp on entry. He can also deal with the usual compromise of oversteer better than anyone in the field. The problem then seems to be finding someone else who can handle similar characteristics to Verstappen.

In the first races of 2025, it was clear that Lawson couldn't drive the car consistently near the limit even around a single lap. He could do an occasional quick corner, but would then lose a heap by making a mistake at the next.

Trying to drive this car on the limit for an entire lap isn't easy, unless you make changes to settle it down. But if you settle it down and find a more drivable balance, you take away the natural strength of the design philosophy and pick up too much understeer, which makes you plain slow. This seems to be where Tsunoda is at now.

Looking at Yuki's Qualifying laps recently, there aren't any obvious errors in there. He's not hanging on to the car, or losing chunks of time in any particular corner.

If anything, as a driver it's nicer to come back from a disappointing session and see that a mistake here or there cost you, because it's something tangible. You can put your finger on it, see what you did wrong and work out how much it cost. You can also figure out changes to your driving style to correct it.

In Yuki's case at the moment, there aren't any obvious errors to point at, which is why both he and the team are left bamboozled at his lack of pace. His crash at the start of Imola Qualifying (see the clip below) looked like a case of a driver trying to reset heading into a crucial session after a difficult run of practices. He'd looked through the data and was determined to attack from the first lap.

Unfortunately in attacking he tried to do the impossible, lumped over the kerbs at high speed and was pitched into his dramatic crash. The car is so difficult to drive that in desperation for performance, it's easy to over-drive and crash. But the alternative is then what happened in Barcelona and Austria – to under-drive, or have the car be too sedate and be slow.

Tsunoda has said he'll delve into the data with his engineers and try to understand what is going on, but history says it's not going to be easy to fix. After all, this is an issue that has impacted multiple drivers in multiple Red Bull cars over multiple sets of regulations.

When asked if he was confident about his chances at Red Bull, Yuki was bullish at the start of the season, but now nine races into his tenure in the sport's toughest seat, I think the understanding of the fates of many before him has hit.

He hoped that because his driving style was closer to that of Max he would be better off, but it turns out that nobody can drive a car similar to how Max can operate at his peak.

I've never known one driver to drive so differently to so many others, but it is the only explanation and it is a complete head scratcher for Red Bull – and anyone else who might want to hire the most formidable talent in the field.

It is that same incredible natural style and feel that makes Max the talent he is, but in developing a car in a way that optimises their star driver, will that make any team with Max in it naturally a one-car team?

And what about Red Bull? Logic would say they should focus their development on making the car more drivable for the ‘average' F1 driver, rather than their superstar, but is that just shackling their greatest asset?

Yuki finds himself in a tough spot. The only thing he can do is dust himself off and go again, trying another reset at Silverstone this weekend. Unlike Lawson, he has the benefit of a few years' worth of CV to fall back on, so we know what he is capable of in the right machinery.

The question is, can he extract anything more out of the second half of the season in Red Bull colours and finally find a flow, or will he end up heading the way of his increasingly long line of predecessors – Alex Albon, Pierre Gasly and so on – and perhaps needing to rebuild a life outside of Red Bull at the end of the year.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's fierce battle in Austria

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Bortoleto challenges Alonso in Spielberg

Research shows Gen Z, women, and US audiences are leading new era of modern F1 fandom.

Formula 1 and Motorsport Network – the world's largest motorsport media company – have released the 2025 Global F1 Fan Survey, a study conducted every four years to track how fan engagement is evolving across the sport globally.

The survey was launched earlier this year and, based on more than 100,000 responses from self-identified, highly engaged fans in 186 countries, the findings offer a detailed snapshot of the modern fan mindset and show that Formula 1 is increasingly attracting a new, younger and more female audience, with growth in markets such as the United States.

The research shows that fans are increasingly drawn to Formula 1 by the breadth of stories and the variety of ways to engage with the sport – and they're staying for the speed, strategy, and spectacle. Digital highlights and the full white paper are available to download and view.

“This study shows that fans are increasingly following Formula 1 for the stories and the many opportunities to engage with the sport, and then they're becoming hooked on the fantastic racing,” said Stefano Domenicali, President & CEO of Formula 1.

“The sport is embedded in culture now, via streaming, storytelling, and social media, and that's helping more people connect. With Motorsport Network, we've been able to take a deeper look at what modern fandom really looks like in 2025 and ensure our strategy to bring in new fans remains on track.”

Werner Brell, CEO of Motorsport Network, added: “This survey isn't just a snapshot – it's a signal to the marketplace. Gen Z, women, and US fans are driving an always-on, connected, and culturally powerful era for F1. It points to how we can better serve fans, connect them with partners, and seize the biggest commercial opportunities for the sport's future.”

The full study spans eight chapters, covering emotional motivators and content engagement to live experiences, lifestyle signals, and sponsorship impact. It offers insights to help better understand and serve F1's most engaged fans – and a view into the future of sports fandom more broadly.

Gen Z is helping shape the rhythm of modern fandom, engaging with the sport more frequently and on a deeper emotional level. Two-thirds of survey respondents say they feel personally inspired by F1 drivers or teams, and in the US 70% of the study's Gen Z respondents engage with F1 content daily – especially through streaming video and social media.

Female fans now account for three in four new fans. Most are newer to the sport and skew younger, with nearly half of all Gen Z respondents being women.

With the largest country share of survey respondents, fans in the US continue to stand out for their growth, youth, and digital fluency. They over-index on content engagement, sponsor responsiveness, and daily touchpoints, signalling a market where fandom is evolving rapidly and is commercially primed.

Among respondents:

Modern F1 fandom is emotional, participatory, and always-on

Formula 1 fans aren't just watching, they're investing, interacting, and engaging with the sport frequently. Among surveyed fans, 90% say they're emotionally invested in race outcomes and 61% engage with F1 content daily. Across platforms and time zones, surveyed fans are shaping a continuous connection to the sport – one that reflects a more dynamic, always-on relationship with Formula 1.

The thrill unites

Across all audience segments, speed and performance remain the most powerful motivators, with 90% of respondents saying they're emotionally invested in race outcomes.

Fans are committed and intend to stay

Among surveyed fans, commitment runs deep. 94% say they intend to follow Formula 1 five years from now, and 86% watch 16 or more races per season.

Content is the new entry point and emotional driver for engagement

Many newer and younger fans are discovering Formula 1 through social media, streaming series, and shared content – entry points that now shape how they connect with the sport. They are more likely to form identity-based connections with Formula 1, citing driver personalities and narrative drama as key drivers of engagement. 70% of Gen Z respondents feel that Formula 1 represents a status or image that appeals to them.

Sponsorship drives consideration

76% of respondents believe sponsors enhance the F1 experience. One in three are more likely to purchase from F1 partners, with favourability rising to 40% among Gen Z respondents.

Live experiences deepen connection

Intent to attend Formula 1 events is rising. 41% of surveyed fans who haven't attended an F1 fan experience plan to do so in the future. From Grands Prix to pop-ups, brand activations, exhibitions, and arcade-style venues, fans are increasingly seeking immersive ways to engage with the sport live and in-person.

F1 ACADEMY signals a new kind of growth

23% of surveyed fans say they follow F1 ACADEMY, and among women that rises to 42%, making it the second-most-followed series after Formula 1 itself. The all-female racing platform is gaining momentum among newer audiences too, with 37% of Gen Z and 36% of newer respondents engaging – underscoring the demand for inclusive storytelling and representation on the grid.

United States: a growth market to watch

The United States accounted for the largest country share of survey respondents, offering a lens into one of Formula 1's most dynamic national markets. While Europe remains the largest region overall, the US stands out for accelerating fan growth, especially among younger, digital-first audiences.

Among US-based participants:

Months on from his last F1 race at the 2024 Singapore Grand Prix, Daniel Ricciardo has given his take on how he is feeling about his current situation.

Daniel Ricciardo has given an update on his situation following his exit from the F1 grid in 2024, with the Australian admitting that he is “enjoying some life in the slow lane” several months on from his last race.

Ricciardo faced a tumultuous few years in the sport in recent times, having been left without a seat entering into 2023 when a difficult spell at McLaren resulted in the mutual decision to terminate his contract early at the end of 2022.

He then returned to the Red Bull stable as a reserve driver before being drafted in to replace Nyck de Vries at the then-named AlphaTauri squad – now known as Racing Bulls – midway through 2023.

While he remained with the outfit into 2024, the driver from Perth struggled to return to his form of old and was replaced by Liam Lawson for the remainder of the campaign following the Singapore Grand Prix.

Ricciardo – who turns 36 today – has not raced since then but has continued to be involved in supporting youngsters in motorsport through the Daniel Ricciardo Series, in which young drivers compete at the wheel of a DRS Ricciardo Kart across events held in the United Kingdom.

The eight-time race winner was in attendance during the latest round at Buckmore Park over the weekend and, when quizzed on how he is getting on at the moment, gave a positive response as he reflected on how his current venture reminds him of his early racing days.

“All good!” said Ricciardo. “I'm just enjoying some life in the slow lane. I mean, it sounds weird saying like retirement when I'm 35 years old, but retirement from at least the world I was living in. It's cool.

“To be at the kart track… it's my first time at a race track since I guess Singapore, so quite a few months now. But it's cool to see the kids… this is why I started karting…

“I've had photos with groups of the kids and I can tell the friendships they have, and these friendships will last a lifetime a lot of them. My best friend to this day was a friend that I raced karts with. It's nice to be back at like the grassroots of it and the most pure form of racing.”

With young karters at the track keen to meet Ricciardo, the former Red Bull driver admitted that he has been able to appreciate what it felt like as a youngster in the sport since taking some time away.

“I think now that I'm a bit removed from it and life is not as chaotic, it's nice to remember what it was like to be at the start of the career,” he explained. “We all have idols and heroes…

“I would be very nervous meeting someone who I admired, so I understand sometimes it's a bit overwhelming. But everyone seems pretty cool. I guess maybe I'm not the only driver they've met before – there's a lot of F1 fans here!

“I think just to have someone that you want to try and obviously look up to and someone that can inspire you… if I'm able to sprinkle a tiny bit of inspiration or motivation today by being here and having a chat to a few kids, that's awesome. That's something I know I appreciated when I was eight, nine, 10 years old.”

Ricciardo also took a moment to reflect on the one piece of advice that he wished he had received when he was the age of those now in karting.

“I mean, I think I was quite lucky with the advice,” the Australian conceded. ""It was always just, ‘Go and have fun'. It wasn't about trying to impress someone or be someone you're not. ‘If you do this you'll be on TV and make money'. It wasn't about that, it was just, ‘Go and have fun'.

“It kind of helped me also… like racing is scary, you know? I think it helped me at school have a bit more confidence. Everyone's shy, we all go through things growing up, so I think it kind of gave me confidence in myself as a person, also away from the track. So, that's something I took from it.

“But as far as the driving goes, honestly it was just about me having fun. I was playing with my friends [at the track], we were riding scooters and stuff, and my dad was always dragging me like, ‘The kart's on the grid, put your helmet on!' The karting was kind of secondary a lot of the time. It was just to be in this environment with friends.”

We've got all the information you need on how to follow the British Grand Prix live on F1 TV.

Formula 1 heads to Silverstone this weekend as the British Grand Prix hosts the second leg of a double header sequence – and here's all the information you need to follow the action live on F1 TV.

Oscar Piastri continues to lead team mate Lando Norris in the Drivers' Championship, but it was Norris who took victory last time out in Austria, the Briton winning out in a thrilling race-long battle between the McLaren pair.

""The response to 'Prens' just shows how strong the demand for high-quality, locally produced originals is and highlights Max as the home of this type of content,"" says top executive Deniz Şaşmaz Oflaz.

	And the best-performing local original production, or LOP, for Warner Bros. Discovery‘s Max, soon-to-be-rebranded as HBO Max, globally is … drum roll, please … Turkish satire series The Prince (Prens).


	On Friday, the final episode of the third season of the hit series became available and seems to have helped seal the deal, according to company data. 




	Starring Giray Altınok as the Prince, the show is “set in the imaginary kingdom of Bongomia and follows the comedic adventures of the prince, a very unpopular member of the kingdom whose own family didn't even bother to give him a name,” according to a synopsis.

	Over the past month, the Turkish Max original achieved “the highest level of engagement of any Max local original production globally,” with 74 percent of subscribers in the country tuning in to it, according to WBD.


	Over the same period, The Prince proved to be a key driver for new subscribers, becoming “the first show that almost three in four (73 percent) of new Max users watched — the highest nominal acquisition volume for a local original production” in a country in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, company data shows.


	During its finale week, season three of The Prince accounted for 72 percent of all viewing on Max in Türkiye, WBD said, adding: “The final episode (season three episode eight), released just three days ago, became the most viewed episode of the week with 54 percent of total viewers already having watched the finale.”


WBD's transition of its streaming service BluTV to Max in Turkey became official in mid-April as the Hollywood giant underlined its “commitment to increasing its investment in local content” and “bringing a compelling slate of new local stories” to its streamer in the country.

	











	“The response to Prens just shows how strong the demand for high-quality, locally produced originals is and highlights Max as the home of this type of content,” Deniz Şaşmaz Oflaz, vp of local original productions, local channels and streaming operations lead for Türkiye, tells THR. “As one of our first original series since launching the platform direct-to-consumer in Türkiye earlier this year, it's exciting to see Prens playing a key role in attracting new viewers to the platform.”


	In a recent THR interview, she described the series this way: “It looks like a comedy, but it's more of a dramedy. … The lead character is the prince, who doesn't want to be on the throne and is not really that smart. And then we see all these typical things happening in this kingdom that we've been seeing in such series as Game of Thrones. So it's a satire.”

Sean ""Diddy"" Combs will face a monthslong process to determine his sentence, which could have been much more severe if he'd been convicted on all charges.

	Rachel Scharf



Sean “Diddy” Combs has been convicted of illegal prostitution but acquitted of meatier sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, a significant legal victory for the disgraced rap mogul who faced up to life in prison if found guilty on all counts.


	What's next for Combs? Following the verdict on Wednesday (July 2), there will be a lengthy process before Judge Arun Subramanian decides the rapper's sentence. He'll be interviewed by the U.S. Probation Department, which will calculate suggested sentencing guidelines based on various factors like Combs' criminal history and the seriousness of his offense.


	After this process, which can take months, Judge Subramanian will hold a sentencing hearing. The charges that Combs was found guilty of – transporting escorts across state lines for marathon sex parties called “freak-offs” – carry no mandatory minimum and a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Combs faced a far lengthier prison term if he'd been convicted on the other charges he faced: forcing women to have sex with escorts during the freak-offs, and operating a criminal syndicate under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.


	If Combs had been convicted under RICO in addition to the prostitution charge, he'd face a maximum of 40 years behind bars. If he had been found guilty of sex-trafficking, he faced a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison and maximum of life behind bars.


	As it stands, Combs defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said Wednesday that the rapper should be immediately released from the pretrial jail where he's been in custody since his arrest last year.


	Agnifilo said Combs has “been given his life by this jury” and should be allowed to await sentencing from his home in Miami, according to CNN. Prosecutor Maureen Comey opposed the request, saying her office intends to seek prison time and noting that Combs “continued to commit a litany of crimes” after he knew he was under investigation last year.


	Judge Subramanian asked both sides to submit letters on the matter by this afternoon and said he'll make a decision afterwards about whether Combs will be released.

Swaggart had two cousins who made it big in music: rock 'n' roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis & country star Mickey Gilley.

	Paul Grein



Jimmy Swaggart, who was among the most successful televangelists in the U.S. in the 1980s, died Tuesday (July 1) at the age of 90. He died at Baton Rouge (Louisiana) General Medical Center two weeks after suffering a cardiac event on June 15, according to a statement from Megan Kelly, a family spokesperson.

	











	Over the course of his career, Swaggart wrote nearly 50 books and dozens of study guides and commentaries on the Bible.


	He also recorded numerous albums. His 1980 album Worship received a Grammy nomination for best gospel performance, traditional. Swaggart placed four albums on Billboard's Top Christian Albums chart in the mid-1980s: Living Waters (No. 12 in 1984), Jesus Just the Mention of Your Name (No. 32 in 1984), Sweet Anointing (No. 22 in 1985) and It's Beginning to Rain (No. 13 in 1986).




			Trending on Billboard		







	But Swaggart was not a fan of Christian rock music. In 1987, he co-authored Religious Rock n Roll: A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing with Robert Paul Lamb, in which he argued that the rise of the Contemporary Christian Music is as an extension of “worldly” entertainment interests.


	Jimmy Lee Swaggart was born on March 15, 1935, in Ferriday, a small town in northeastern Louisiana. Swaggart had two cousins who made it big in music: rock 'n' roll legend Jerry Lee Lewis (who was also born in Ferriday) and country music star Mickey Gilley. They were known locally as The Ferriday Three. Lewis, who was in the first class of artists inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, and Gilley, who amassed 17 No. 1 hits on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, both died in 2022 – Gilley in May at age 86; Lewis in October at age 87.

	











	A fire-and-brimstone Pentecostal preacher, Swaggart began full-time evangelistic work in 1955. In 1960, he began recording gospel music albums and transmitting on Christian radio stations. In 1961, he was ordained by the Assemblies of God. A year later, he began his radio ministry.


	In 1971, Swaggart began transmitting a weekly, 30-minute telecast over local TV stations in Baton Rouge. Two years later, he proposed to television producers in Nashville a program including a music segment, a short sermon and time for talking about current ministry projects. Within weeks, The Jimmy Swaggart Telecast was being broadcast around the U.S.


	By 1984, Swaggart had overtaken Robert Schuller and Oral Roberts as America's top televangelist. The Jimmy Swaggart Telecast reached nearly 2 million viewers a week on 500 stations. Swaggart's monthly magazine, The Evangelist, was distributed to more than 800,000 households.


	By 1985, his ministry was reportedly bringing in approximately $120 million a year from collections, magazine sales and merchandise sales.


	A bitter rivalry among the top televangelists of the era led to ruin. Swaggart took the first swing when he accused Jim Bakker of having an affair with church secretary Jessica Hahn. On April 6, 1987, Swaggart and Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker appeared on the cover of TIME magazine with the cover line “Unholy Row: TV Preacher Jimmy Swaggart and the Besieged Bakkers.” Swaggart acknowledged that he had passed along rumors of Jim Bakker's illicit behavior to officials of the Assemblies of God, the Pentecostal denomination in which both were clergy.


	Swaggart also went after New Orleans preacher Marvin Gorman, accusing him of having multiple affairs. Gorman fought back, suing Swaggart for defamation and ultimately settling out of court for $1.8 million. Suspicious that Swaggart was an adulterer, Gorman asked his son to tail Swaggart one night. The son found Swaggart at a motel in New Orleans and took photos of the preacher checking into a room with a prostitute. On Feb. 16, 1988, Gorman handed the photos over to the Assemblies of God, which ordered Swaggart suspended for three months.

	











	Five days later, Swaggart tearfully delivered what came to be known as “I have sinned” speech on live television, an image that has become iconic.


	The national presbytery of the Assemblies of God defrocked Swaggart, removing his credentials and ministerial license. Swaggart countered by becoming an independent and non-denominational Pentecostal minister, establishing Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, based at the Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge.


	A second scandal involving another prostitute three years later further diminished Swaggart's popularity. Even so, Swaggart was senior pastor of Family Worship Center until his death.


	Swaggart is survived by his wife of 73 years, Francis (whom he married when he was 17 and she was 15); a son, Donnie; three grandchildren and nine great grandchildren.

	Dan Rys



Chart-topping R&B/soul singer Tems is launching a new program called The Leading Vibe Initiative in an effort to support young women who want to learn and get involved with the music business, Billboard can announce Wednesday (July 2). 


	The singer, songwriter and entrepreneur from Lagos, Nigeria, is planning a two-day seminar for between 15 and 20 women in Lagos “to provide opportunities for participants to hone their craft, sharpen industry knowledge, and build community,” according to a press release.


	The program, which will be held Aug. 8 and 9, will bring together participants with industry executives and creatives for meet and greets, training sessions on songwriting and music production, studio sessions, panel discussions, and tutorials on different aspects of the music business; participants will also receive production software and other resources, the release states. The mentors and speakers who will be part of the program will be announced at a later date. The program is intended to expand beyond Lagos to additional cities in Africa in the future.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Applicants can apply here by the July 13 deadline.


	“My goal with the Leading Vibe Initiative is to help discover and support talented young women who have the potential to redefine the industry,” Tems said in a statement. “By providing access, tools and opportunity, we're creating space for them to find their voices, step into their power and shape the future of music across the continent and globally.”


	Tems is one of the most successful artists of her generation, with her mix of R&B, soul, Afrobeats, alté and more producing a singular sound that is distinct from many others in the crossover wave of African artists in the past half-decade. She's racked up two Grammys — the first Nigerian artist with two — as well as two top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including one No. 1, and 10 top 10 Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs top 10s, including two No. 1s. She also has an ownership stake in the MLS franchise San Diego FC.


	As part of this initiative, Tems has also partnered with Native Instruments, which will be providing technology and support for the program, according to a rep for the company. Tems has also joined the Native Instruments artist board, a collective that also includes Alicia Keys, Noah “40” Shebib, Jacob Collier and Ludwig Goransson, among others.

""Absolutely rocked the stage yet again,"" the athlete raved about his superstar girlfriend.

	Hannah Dailey



Taylor Swift‘s surprise performance at Travis Kelce‘s Tight End University event was truly that: a surprise.


	According to the Kansas City Chiefs star, the 14-time Grammy winner's live showcase of Billboard Hot 100-topper “Shake It Off” with Kane Brown's band June 24 in Nashville was so last minute, she didn't even practice beforehand. Speaking to brother and co-host Jason Kelce on their New Heights podcast episode posted Wednesday (July 2), Travis shed some light on how the performance came about, raving, “Tay Tay showed up!”


	“We're in Nashville, she grew up in Nashville — she moved there when she was younger,” the Grotesquerie star explained. “We had this plan for a while that we were going to have some fun with the tight ends.”

	











	“I won't say when the idea came up, but when we were there at Tight End and Friends, and we knew there was a professional like Kane Brown, who can just, he can figure it out,” Travis continued. “He's a pro. Tay just kind of went up to him and the band and went, ‘Hey, if you guys are down, I'll go up there, play a song and see if we can pop the roof off this place.'”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The athlete went on to share that moments before the viral performance, Swift jotted down accompaniment notes for Brown's band members so that they could perform with her without missing a beat. “She was like in the back doing musical notes,” Travis said with awe. “Sheets of music, she was writing out — I think the high hats, maybe? I don't know, I'm not a musician. But she was, like, making sure the band and everybody knew.”


	“And then just went out there without practicing, and it was pitch-perfect,” Travis added. “[She] just killed it.”

	











	The knockout performance in question happened at the Tight Ends and Friends concert at Music City's Brooklyn Bowl, with Swift getting the crowd hyped up as she took the stage in a black dress and matching heeled boots. As she strummed her guitar, Brown danced along on stage and added extra percussion by shaking a stick of bells.


	The pop star was also present throughout the three-day Tight End University summit, appearing alongside Travis on the red carpet during opening ceremonies and later attending the welcome party with him that night. The Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity? host founded TEU in 2021 with George Kittle and Greg Olsen to foster community among the NFL's tight ends and help them prepare for the football season ahead.


	“She's so good with just everybody — people and making people feel comfortable,” Travis praised Swift. “Absolutely rocked the stage yet again. It was awesome.”

			By Jill Goldsmith, Ted Johnson 


Dr. Phil's Fort Worth-based JV Merit Street Media filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday, simultaneously suing business partner Trinity Broadcasting for breach of contract that it claims destroyed its new television network and pushed it into bankruptcy.


	The TV personality's high-rated daytime Dr. Phil show ended a 21-year run after the 2022-23 season although it lived on in syndication. The suit centers around his latest venture, Merit Street Media, a JV of McGraw's Peteski Productions and Trinity Broadcasting Group. The latter was founded by American televangelist Paul Crouch and his wife Jan in 1973 and is currently overseen by president and CEO Matthew Crouch. The network has had carriage on over the air broadcast television as well as multichannel platforms and streaming.

	A Merit Street spokesperson said, “Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) is being sued by Merit Street Media (MSM) for failing to provide clearly agreed-upon national distribution and other significant foundational commitments critical to the network's continuing success and viability. The suit is part of a restructuring proceeding also initiated by MSM.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	A spokesperson for TBN did not immediately return a request for comment.


	The JV called for Peteski to provide Merit Street with certain new original episodes of the Dr. Phil show, as well as primetime specials to air on the new TV network. For its part, TBN agreed to provide, at no cost to Merit Street, carriage to distribute Dr. Phil's shows and specials to a nationwide audience … in exchange for which TBN would have a controlling equity interest in the network,” according to the lawsuit. 

	











	TBN also agreed to provide all “first class quality” services necessary to produce Dr. Phil's shows and primetime specials, the suit said.


	“In short, the deal was simple and straightforward” — McGraw/Peteski contributed content, while TBN contributed access to a distribution network to air Dr. Phil's content along with the production services to support the creation of that content,” according to the lawsuit.


	Shortly after Merit Street was formed, however, TBN reneged, Merit claimed. It “began to abuse its power as a controlling shareholder to advance its own interests and those of its CEO Matthew Crouch, while causing Merit Street to assume responsibility of TBN's obligations under the Joint Venture Agreement, and to otherwise enrich itself at Merit Street's expense. The suit accuses TBN of “a conscious, intentional pattern of choices made with full awareness that the consequence of which was to sabotage and seal the fate of a new but already nationally acclaimed network which has, since its launch in April of 2024, delivered its viewers with cutting edge reports, interviews, and in-depth analysis of national importance. This fresh voice on the national stage is inexorably going dark, going off the air because TBN has refused to honor its commitment to transfer its must carry rights and thereby provide national distribution for the network—Merit Street.”


	Simply put, as a result of TBN's conduct, “Merit Street has nowhere to send its broadcast signal and nowhere to air its programming no matter how great it may be.”


	Since its launch last year, Merit Street has featured McGraw's interview with Donald Trump following his conviction on New York state charges, as well as the host's embed with federal immigration agents back in January.


	Merit Street says that it will continue to broadcast shows as long as it can, but it will be library programming.


	The filing in United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas estimated Merit Street's assets at $100-$500 million and liabilities in the same range. Creditors, from 200-999, included distributors like DirecTV and Nexstar and rating agency Nielsen.


	Merit Street is seeking damages, recoupment of legal costs, and other remedies.

					By Dominic Patten 

Executive Editor, Legal, Labor & Politics


UPDATED with more details: Sean “Diddy” Combs has been found guilty on two counts in his sex-trafficking trial, the jury said today.


	After a total of just 13 hours in the jury room, the panel of eight men and four women found the Bad Boy Records founder guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. However, the jury found Combs not guilty of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. The mixed verdict, just read out by the foreman, can only be viewed as a big defeat for the Maurene Comey-led prosecution


	The two counts under the engaging in prostitution charge each carry a maximum sentence of a decade behind bars. Surely stinging from being defeated on the major RICO charge, prosecutors do not think Combs should be allowed out on bond, which is what the defense is arguing for with a million dollars on the table. The defense also wants its client to be able to travel to homes in Florida, L.A. and the Empire State.

	











	Judge Arun Subramanian has asked both sides to submit their POVs to him and the court will gather this afternoon on the bond matter. 


	Certain to face an appeal no matter if the bond is granted or not, today's decision comes after two tense days filled with notes from the jury and an admission late on July 1 that there were “unpersuadable opinions on both sides” when it came to the pivotal racketeering charge. With verdicts on counts 2, 3,4, and 5 — a.k.a.  the two sex-trafficking charges and the two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution – it looked like the month and a half long trial may stumble into a partial verdict at best or worse yet, a mistrial.

	After the verdict was read out, the judge in the case praised the jury, which had a rocky ride at times: “I want you to know that it is inspiring to all of us. You listened, you worked together, you were here every day, rain or shine.” Even before the trial started last month, Judge Subramanian had promised the proceedings would be over by the July 4 holiday — a promise kept. 

	











	For Combs, freedom might also come before Independence Day if the judge rules he can be released on bail – a move that looks likely if for no other reason than the charges the defendant, who has had previous offenses over the years, was found guilty on were of a non-violent nature


	Following nearly a year of abuse and assault allegations, started for the most part by a very quickly settled ($20 million) suit from former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, Combs was arrested in New York City in September on criminal charges of racketeering, sex trafficking, transportation to engage in prostitution and more. Failing repeatedly to regain his freedom with a $50 million bail pitch, Combs has been in custody at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center ever since.


	Filled with often harrowing testimony from a then very pregnant Ventura (who got snared in a defense fastball revealing a $10 million payout from an L.A. hotel over a violent 2016 incident by Combs), as well as other rape and abuse accusers' “Jane” and “Mia,” the trial began at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse in lower Manhattan on May 12. As well as the three victims (and minus a Victim 2 who simply disappeared mere days before the trial), the jury heard from various male escorts hired for the drug-drenched and often filmed “freak-off” sex sessions, rap star Kid Cudi, former Combs employees, law enforcement officials and an expert or two in the prosecution's dense case.


	In a tactic straight out of Harvey Weinstein's last rape retrial, the defense decided not to put their client on the stand and wrapped up their case in around 30 minutes last week with no witnesses at all. In the midnight hour just before closing arguments, the feds trimmed and culled some of the initial charges against Combs claims in what they called an effort to “streamline” the case.


	Attracting a lot of last-minute attention, the largely procedural move changed nothing when it came to a possible outcome of the 55-year-old Combs spending the rest of his life in a federal prison if found guilty on all the charges.


	However, for about an hour on Tuesday it looked as if the case against Combs could at least partially collapse under the weight of the jury's deadlock.


	Buoyed by a rare scenario of agreement between the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York and Combs' 10-lawyer defense bench that the jury should keep deliberating, Judge Arun Subramanian eventually asked the panel to keep at it a bit longer in hopes of reaching a unified verdict. The irony of sorts is that the judge's borderline pleading came right at the end of the day on Tuesday and the non-sequestered jurors went home soon afterwards anyway.


	The New York dozen were back in the courthouse Wednesday at around 9 a.m. ET and back behind closed doors deliberating.


	Surrounded by members of his family like his mother (a near constant presence during the trial) and children, plus lawyers Marc Agnifilo, Alexandra Shapiro, Brian Steel, and others, the now white-haired and sweater wearing Combs was in Judge Subramanian's courtroom first thing this morning too. At one point, Combs took to prayer with members of his family joining in. “Let us pray, please watch over my family,” the “All About the Benjamins” performer said, getting an “Amen” in reply from those assembled.

	











	After the verdict was delivered, Cassie Ventura's lawyer Doug Wigdor put out a statement praising his client. “Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution,” the attorney said in part. “By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.”

Diddie gonna continue to diddle…moneyband politics always above the law and human morals

He and many other artists create a bad boy/girl image that is at least a partial reality and they are awarded for it with accolades from the press, awards from their industry and so much money from the public. Why should they regulate their behavior when everything out there, including the many who cozy up to them looking for a piece of the action, tells them that being bad is good?

Diddy do it or Diddy not.

Apparently, he diddy'nt do it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","A supersized The Bear forces Richie, Carmy, and Natalie to face their ghosts","https://www.avclub.com/the-bear-recap-season-4-episode-7-bears","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The recap of episode eight publishes July 3. This recap contains spoilers.]    

The Berzattos are a lot. That's just a fact. But despite all their faults, their messiness, and the ways they project their trauma outward, people are drawn into their event horizon like flies to mānuka honey. There's Richie, Jimmy, and the Faks, of course, all whirlwinds in their own right. But there are also the calm, composed folks—Tiff, Claire, Sydney, Stevie, Lee—who can't help but be drawn in. As Stevie tells Frank, “It's really fun. Genuinely.”

This extra-long episode sees the whole Bear clan come together. Despite their reservations, Richie, Carmy, and Natalie have all turned out for Tiff and Frank's wedding, forcing themselves to face their various ghosts. Sydney is also there in her capacity as Richie's emotional support plus one (plus Marcus and Chester, who apparently slept with Frank's mom?! Man, is Chicago a small town.) 

This season, the show seems determined to prove that it still deserves a place in the comedy category at the Emmys, and “Bears” makes a solid argument. It's a classic entry into the wedding-episode canon, complete with reunited exes, estranged relatives, and dishy revelations. It also represents a pivotal moment for our big three characters: Carmy exorcising his demons, Sydney's priorities coming into focus, and Richie realizing he's not as alone as he thinks.

Carm is even more on edge than usual, because he's about to see his mom for the first time since she drove through her own wall. Nat has strapped on her armor for her dreaded reunion with Francie Fak. And Richie is determined to make nice with Frank. 

Sugar and Francie—played by Oscar winner Brie Larson!—start shouting over each other within seconds, stomping their heels on the floor like angry horses. We've been waiting for literal years to find out what caused the rift between these two ex-BFFs, and the answer is juicy as hell: They hooked up! Pete is just as surprised as we are, if significantly less delighted.

Michelle (Sarah Paulson) is the first to run into Donna, and you can instantly see her hackles rise. She shelters with Tiff in the bedroom, getting her ready for the mess downstairs. It's a quiet, intimate scene between two excellent actors as Tiff talks about her complicated feelings about her mom not coming to the wedding. 

Downstairs, Michelle's partner, Stevie (John Mulaney), is giving Frank the lowdown on what to expect from the Bears. He and fellow honorary Berzatto Claire try their best not to scare Frank too much: “It's a lot of people with very specific and unique personalities that feel things very strongly.” Best of luck to the groom!

Carmy's spidey sense kicks in before he's even laid eyes on Donna, snapping him into a signature trauma-flashback montage. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance is achingly specific as always. From the way Deedee looks at her son, you can see how hard she's working to hold herself back. They're both as nervous as two teens on a first date, stuttering half-sentences and inanities about Tiff and Sophie and how many people are here. 

As far as I'm concerned, Richie coming to Carmy's rescue is proof positive that he's finally forgiven his cousin for the refrigerator incident. He and Sydney give Bear an out with a fake story about how he's needed in the kitchen and take over the conversation with Donna. But when Frank pulls Richie away, Syd is left all alone with the monster in Carm's closet. 

Sweet, innocent Frank needs help coaxing Evie out from under a table, where she's hiding out in protest of their planned stepfather-stepdaughter dance. It costs Richie more than Frank knows to bargain on his behalf, but he does it anyway because he's a really decent guy. He's also encouraged by the golden-boy groom's insecurity about being a good dad—an issue that's never been in question for Richie.

Carmy is hiding out in the kitchen chomping on Nicorette when he runs into the last person he expected—or wanted—to see: Uncle Lee (Bob Odenkirk), who is probably Donna's boyfriend even though he swears their relationship is purely platonic. Carm opens up to him in ways we've never seen before. It's a lot easier to confess your darkest secrets to someone you don't give a shit about. 

Lee has mellowed since we last saw him in “Fishes,” approaching Carm like a fellow adult whose choices he respects. Bear is shocked when Lee says he clocked his brief appearance at Mikey's funeral—and even more shocked that he didn't tell anyone. Carmy didn't stay because he didn't think he deserved to—not after skipping town even though he knew how bad things were. “That's stupid,” Lee says.

While Carm was off rising up through the fine-dining ranks, Lee became close with Mikey. And he talked about his little bro a lot—how proud he was of Bear, out there working at the best restaurants in the world, wrapping fish in potatoes. It's a truth that's harder for Carmy to hear than if Mikey had hated him for leaving. Lee also says Bear is more like his sensitive, intense mother than he knows. And like him, she's starting to open herself to the world and identify the ways she needs to change.

Back in the reception room, Sydney is genuinely enjoying Donna's company. They bond over how much they both were drawn to the frenzy of The Beef. It's loud, sure, but Syd likes the noise. Deedee asks what it's like to work with Carm, and Sydney remembers why she was so drawn to her talented, hardworking partner in the first place. She talks about the time visited Chef David's restaurant in New York so she could taste a Carmy Berzatto masterpiece. “You guys are very close,” Deedee says, and Sydney realizes that, despite the tension between them, it's true. He's family. With the same grace she showed when she left Natalie and Pete to gush over their newborn, Donna makes her exit so her son can stop cowering in fear. 

Meanwhile, Frank, Richie, and Claire join Evie under the table for a mini-summit—followed by a curious Carmy. A wonderful farce unfolds as more Bears join. To make Evie feel better about being scared of dancing, each member of the extended fam shares their biggest fears, ranging from heights and big dogs to the singularity and the gradual collapse of the planet. (Chester, hilariously, hates spiders but also loves them?) Carm has trouble formulating his answer. “What's the opposite of chaos?” he asks. “Peace,” Claire tells him. He chickens out and says math instead, but that bell can't be unrung.

Evie lights up as she watches her family grow bigger and bigger. She's getting the loving, supportive childhood the damaged adults around her never got to experience. It's the exact inverse of Christmas at Donna's and not just because they're gathered under a table instead of around one. This is a brood that becomes a little kinder with every person they invite into their ranks.

The Bears return to the party with hearts and souls refreshed, ready to become their better selves—or at least to try. Sug and Francie, no longer able to deny how much they've missed each other, finally bury the hatchet, with the provision that neither can fuck the other over. (Nat tells Pete there aren't any romantic vibes between them anymore, but I'm not convinced.) 

Meanwhile, Richie realizes that his jealousy toward Frank has been misplaced. Helping Evie to trust her stepdad doesn't mean he's replacing Richie; it just means he's made his daughter's support system even stronger. Lately, he's been feeling isolated, thinking of himself as a lone boulder in that Zen garden in Kyoto. But he's finally figured it out: He's not one of the rocks; he's the sand dividing the gulfs between them.

Sydney gets a text from Shapiro because she's been ghosting him yet again. We don't see her response, but we know what side she came down on when Richie asks what decision she's been nervous about. “You make the right one?” “I think there was only one. Y'know?”

At the edge of the party, Claire is seeing Carmy with fresh eyes. He's trying to participate in the project of being human, ready to submit to the mortifying ordeal of being known. As she asked him to recently, he opens up to her about the big stuff: When he got the call about Mikey's suicide, he didn't accidentally scorch his hand on a pot; he pressed it to a burner. “I'm trying to tell people things,” he says, which Claire knows is terrifying for him. He counters that it's not scary when the person he's telling is her. When they step out onto the dancefloor, turning slowly to Emmylou Harris' “Tougher Than The Rest,” they press their foreheads together like they've finally come home.

Tiff offers Jimmy her own painful truth: He and the rest of the Berzattos mean everything to her. They took her in with open arms when her own family left her in the dust, and she was so afraid she'd lose them when she divorced Richie. Jimmy holds her close and promises that, for better or worse, she's a Bear forever.

After he gets home from the wedding, Richie pops open a solitary beer like he does every night. But then Teddy texts him a picture of their whole crazy family, sardined together under the table and grinning like idiots, and remembers that he has plenty of rocks to lean on.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Sean ""Diddy"" Combs gets mixed verdict, acquitted of most serious charges","https://www.avclub.com/sean-combs-diddy-mixed-verdict-acquitted","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:23:00 GMT","

Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has been found guilty on two out of five counts against him in federal court. The jury found Combs guilty of the Mann Act (a federal law that criminalizes the transportation of “any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose”) in connection to his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and an ex-girlfriend known under the pseudonym “Jane.” He was found not guilty of charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion in connection with Ventura and “Jane,” per ABC News. 

Abuse allegations against the famed hip-hop producer first surfaced in 2023 from Ventura, who would go on to testify in the federal trial. In addition to the federal case, dozens of civil suits have since been filed against Combs, who has admitted to domestic abuse but denied the more grievous charges against him. Accusations leveled against Combs include rape, sexual assault, physical and psychological abuse, violence, and intimidation. He was arrested in September 2024 and remained in custody since then, having been denied bail due to the judge's concerns of “the danger of obstruction of justice and the danger of witness tampering.”

The jury initially announced it had reached a verdict on only four of the five counts, indicating to the judge that the group was deadlocked over the matter of racketeering conspiracy. They were instructed to continue deliberating and ultimately returned with a not guilty verdict. The prosecution is now seeking a 20-year maximum sentence against Combs, and asked the judge that he remain in custody until sentencing. The defense has requested he “be released on conditions to his home in Miami and offered a $1 million bond,” per NBC News. Both sides were granted several hours to submit letters arguing for or against release before the court reconvenes on Wednesday afternoon; Combs will remain in the courthouse until that time, ABC News reports. 

In a statement (via CNN), Ventura's lawyer said, “This entire criminal process started when our client Cassie Ventura had the courage to file her civil complaint in November 2023. Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. By coming forward with her experience, Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry and the fight for justice.” The attorney praised her courage and said she “brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussion,” adding, “This case proved that change is long overdue, and we will continue to fight on behalf of survivors.”

[Editor's note: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel‘s “Ironheart” finale.]

Where were you when you first learned about Mephisto?

I was at my parents' house during COVID, when Marvel began its erratic foray into television with the powerful “WandaVision.” In Marvel Comics, Mephisto is literally the devil; he crops up with various heroes and villains across the comics under thin aliases (Beelzebub? who could that be?), leaving his mark on the lives of everyone from Spider-Man to Doctor Strange, and more. He's connected to Scarlet Witch through her sons, who were introduced in Jac Schaeffer's Emmy-winning series.

And as the world Wanda (Elisabeth Olsen) built around herself started to fracture, fans thought the devil was in the details — but he never broke through. Eager theorists tabled their disappointment (easy to do when Kathryn Hahn is the one guiding you into the unknown) with the hope that Mephisto would pop up in the upcoming slate of films and shows.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






But he didn't. 

There were whispers around “Loki” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” Surely he'd appear in “The Multiverse of Madness,” which brought Scarlet Witch face-to-face with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). By then, however, the villain of the phase had been introduced as Kang (Jonathan Majors), with pieces falling into place for an epic battle against him, leaving little room for a second big bad.

As someone who was scrambling for Mephisto crumbs during “WandaVision,” I've been saddened by my growing distance from the MCU since then. But between “Thunderbolts” and “Ironheart,” I feel something stirring that has been dormant since the days of lockdown.

For one thing, I was removed enough to miss the whispers that Mephisto would debut in “Ironheart,” and if I did catch this news item blowing the entire reveal over two years ago, I simply forgot! Watching the screeners all at once meant no week-to-week theorizing, so by the time Sacha Baron Cohen arrived on screen I was too absorbed in stunt casting to even consider who he was playing. It wasn't until a few lines before the character identifies himself that I remembered a name I had long forgotten — and realized that not only could this be him, but it had to be.

“You can call me Mephisto,” he said. To my own surprise, I shrieked. Mephisto is the one who gave Parker (Anthony Ramos) his hood as part of a sinister “deal,” and he's the devil who will offer Riri (Dominique Thorne) what she most desires in exchange for what's sure to be a deadly price. The shriek was less of shock than disbelief — or maybe I've been holding it in for years? Finally, we got there — so where do we go next?

 










This character and “Ironheart” took a long time to reach our screens (that 2022 leak was from the set), but seeing Baron Cohen eat up the role was immensely satisfying, regardless of the wait. Not only is it a departure from the actor's usual repertoire (I couldn't ID him with full confidence with the American accent), but it instantly stood out from the slew of gratuitous and garish MCU cameos in the past few years. (Harry Styles and Brett Goldstein come to mind.)

Mephisto has presence and purpose, and his powers remain a mystery to the audience because they're a mystery to our protagonist. Their deal slightly betrays Riri's journey with grief throughout the season, but that's the kind of character heel turn that indicates a larger plan within the franchise.

The MCU has struggled with memorable villains (remember Malekith? of course you don't) enough to approach them more thoughtfully over time; crafting a good one is hard enough, and more than one at a time would dilute their overall impression. With Kang out of the picture, there was a brief an opening for HBIC (Head Beelzebub in Charge, if you will), but that role got reworked into Doctor Doom (Robert Downey Jr.), whos scheduled to be the central villain of 2026's “Avengers: Doomsday.”

 










“Ironheart” was originally filmed before Marvel cut ties with Majors, so there was at least a plan for Mephisto to coexist with Kang, if not others upon his introduction. There's always the chance that this is a long game and Mephisto will work in the shadows throughout the events leading up to and following “Doomsday,” stepping into the spotlight during Phase… 7?? Admittedly, that's not as enticing as imagining him in “Fantastic Four: The First Steps” later this month, given his overlap with those characters, and it's also entirely possible that this character missed his window and joined the party too late.

But one way or another, Mephisto has finally entered the MCU, and the timing is such that I'm less concerned about the path forward than the road it took to get here. Through two Phases, 16 shows, and 13 movies, I finally got to release that scream, and I might just dare to get excited about what the future might bring.

All episodes of “Ironheart” are now streaming on Disney+.

Brad Pitt is putting his football differences with Bradley Cooper aside to praise the writer/director/producer/star's sophomore directorial effort, “Maestro.” Pitt, who is good pals with Cooper, joked that their friendship is still intact despite their differing NFL fandoms (Pitt roots for the Kansas City Chiefs, while Cooper is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles lover.)

During the “New Heights” with Jason and Travis Kelce podcast (in the below video), Pitt admitted that he couldn't help but throw some shade at Cooper when celebrating “Maestro” in 2024. Pitt also praised the Leonard Bernstein biopic for being one of the best films of the 2020s; Pitt implied that an Academy Award for Cooper is even long overdue. “Maestro” was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Actress for Carey Mulligan, and Best Actor for Cooper.

“I have a confession: I'm friends with Bradley Cooper,” Pitt said. “He was getting an award for ‘Maestro,' [which] is still probably one of the best movies of this decade. And I was giving him this award and he's been nominated like 18 times for the Oscars. And I closed with, at the Santa Barbara Film Awards, ‘Listen, he's been nominated the 19,000th time. You know, if he doesn't get it, it's OK. He's used to it. He's a Philadelphia Eagles fan.'” To be clear, Cooper has actually received 12 Oscar nominations in his career.

As for the Eagles winning the Super Bowl against the Chiefs earlier in 2025, Pitt said, “I think he was happy this year. He gracefully let me hurt.” 

Cooper infamously said that he would prefer the Eagles taking home the Super Bowl trophy to getting an Oscar, anyway. Cooper will next appear in, direct, produce, and serve as B camera operator for meta Hollywood comedy “Is This Thing On?” He said during ESPN's “The Pat McAfee Show” that filmmaking itself is “very similar to team sports,” saying, “It's all about creating a culture. It's all about just the shot you're in and not thinking about just the end of the movie. It's very, very similar to football in particular, you know, if one of the 11 messes up, the whole thing's screwing up and people don't see that from the outside, but if you're in it, you know that very well. Same thing in a movie set.”

During the “New Heights” podcast, Pitt echoed Cooper's sentiments. Pitt, who is promoting his racing film “F1,” deemed sports films to be the “greatest” genre. 

“I look back at Gene Hackman and ‘Hoosiers' and Redford and ‘The Natural,'” he said. “It's an amazing metaphor for a lifetime. […] I feel like we really got it right in ‘Moneyball' in a lovely, beautiful way to add to that lexicon, and I think this one [‘F1'] does that too on a really big level.” Pitt added that “F1” also has a “spiritual ending” which he is “really proud of.” Check out the full interview here.

							By 

	Andy Greene



	“I haven't played this in like 100 years,” Neil Young told the crowd Tuesday evening at the very beginning of his show at Drafbaan Stadspark in Groningen, The Netherlands. “We'll see what happens.”


	He was talking about “Ambulance Blues,” the stunning, nine-minute On The Beach classic that many Young aficionados consider one of his finest achievements. (Rolling Stone placed it #2 on our 2021 list of Young's 100 best songs, topped only by “Powderfinger.”)


	To be fair, it hadn't quite been 100 years since the song surfaced in concert. He last played it January 26, 2019, at the Pantages Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota. But like the vast majority of live renditions of “Ambulance Blues” in history, going all the way back to the Bottom Line in 1974, that one was solo acoustic. He didn't do it with a band until R.E.M convinced him to play it with them at the 1998 Bridge School Benefit.


	“I don't know how we did that,” R.E.M. bassist Mike Mills told Rolling Stone in 2023. “Neil was just into it. I think he was glad to have an outlet where he felt like he could play it and do it justice, which is of course a really nice thing to credit our band with, if I dare go that far…It was a super fun thing and really great for [guitarist] Peter [Buck] and [touring guitarist] Scott McCaughey, who are Neil Young fans to the bone, even more so than myself and Michael [Stipe]. It was a real thrill.”

	“Ambulance Blues” was regularly played at solo acoustic shows in 1999 and 2007/08, but Young didn't perform it with a band again until January 25, 2016, at a private show in Paris for Carmignac CEO Édouard Carmignac. That means this newest one in the Netherlands is just the third time in history he's done it with a band. (And it was a different group every time: R.E.M., Promise of the Real, and now the Chrome Hearts.)

	Young largely stuck to his standard summer setlist for the rest of the Groningen show, which completely ignores his new LP Talkin' To The Trees, and instead centers around hits like “Old Man,” “Like a Hurricane,” and “Cinnamon Girl” in addition to a smattering of rarities like “Name of Love,” “Sun Green,” and “Looking Forward.”

The Velvet Sundown, an obviously fictional “band” that's gone viral after somehow racking up more than 500,000 monthly listeners on Spotify out of nowhere, used the generative-AI platform Suno in the creation of their songs, and consider themselves an “art hoax,” a band spokesperson reveals to Rolling Stone.  On their X account, the “band” fervently and repeatedly denied any AI usage after multiple media outlets reported on their mysterious popularity — but pseudonymous band spokesperson and “adjunct” member Andrew Frelon now admits, “It's marketing. It's trolling. People before, they didn't care about what we did, and now suddenly, we're talking to Rolling Stone, so it's like, ‘Is that wrong?'”  


	“Personally, I'm interested in art hoaxes,” Frelon continues. “The Leeds 13, a group of art students in the U.K., made, like, fake photos of themselves spending scholarship money at a beach or something like that, and it became a huge scandal. I think that stuff's really interesting.… We live in a world now where things that are fake have sometimes even more impact than things that are real. And that's messed up, but that's the reality that we face now. So it's like, ‘Should we ignore that reality? Should we ignore these things that kind of exist on a continuum of real versus fake or kind of a blend between the two? Or should we dive into it and just let it be the emerging native language of the internet?'”In the phone conversation Tuesday morning, Frelon originally maintained that AI was used only in brainstorming for the music, then admitted to the use of Suno but “not in the final product,” and finally came to acknowledge that at least some songs (“I don't want to say which ones”) are Suno-generated. “I haven't admitted that to anyone else,” Frelon says. He also acknowledged employing Suno's “Persona” feature — the same one Timbaland is using with his controversial AI artist TaTa — to maintain a consistent singer's voice across songs, although he continues to claim that's not the case on every track.

	











	Some observers have wondered whether some kind of playlist manipulation was used to build Velvet Sundown's Spotify listenership, but Frelon dodged that question. “ I'm not running the Spotify backend stuff, so I can't super speak to exactly how that happened,” he says. “I know we got on some playlists that just have like tons of followers, and it seems to have spiraled from there.” Did Frelon and his associates use playlists of their own to boost the process? “I don't have an answer that I can give to you for that because I'm not involved,” he says. “And I don't want to say something that's not true.”

The Velvet Sundown enigma began in June, when two of the band's albums suddenly appeared on Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and other streaming services. A band that no one had ever heard of, and didn't seem to have any sort of digital footprint, suddenly had hundreds of thousands of listeners for music that the band described as “fusing Seventies psychedelic textures with cinematic alt-pop and dreamy analog soul.” 


	But how real was it? The songs, like “Dust on the Wind,” felt like generic reproductions of Seventies rock, and “photographs” of the group obviously had the amber-encased glow of AI-generated content. On Reddit, two posters called out what one poster called “a completely fake band”; musician and writer Chris Dalla Riva questioned their existence on TikTok; and the streaming service Deezer noted that “some tracks on this album may have been created using artificial intelligence.” The site Music Ally determined that most of the Spotify playlists which featured the band came from just four Spotify accounts — and no one could explain how the band's catalog ended up on a playlist of songs evoking the Vietnam War. 


	Early this week, the “band” pushed back on its X account, claiming it was “absolutely crazy that so-called ‘journalists' keep pushing the lazy, baseless theory that the Velvet Sundown is ‘AI-generated' with zero evidence.… This is not a joke. This is our music, written in long, sweaty nights in a cramped bungalow in California with real instruments, real minds and real soul.” (“Then make an appearance on live TV,” responded one person on X. “Proof [sic] it make a real video,” replied another.)

	Spotify, for one, has no rules against AI music. In the past, says Glenn McDonald, a former data alchemist at Spotify, “fake listeners were a larger problem than fake music. It might have flipped.” McDonald feels the Velvet Sundown's prominence on that platform is the result of several factors: Artists and content creators are able to pay for more exposure on playlists, he says, and the company's recommendations systems have moved “away from understandable algorithms with strong grounding in actual human listening and communities” and toward AI-driven systems that “can pick songs for recommendations based on characteristics of their audio.” 


	Added together, McDonald says, these factors “increase the lottery-like dynamics of the system so that there are fewer reasons why a fake band couldn't be successful. Most fake bands still won't be successful, and of course nobody notices when an AI band gets no listeners, but there are no protections against it happening, and probably from Spotify's business point of view it's not even clear that this is a bad thing to be ‘protected' against.” (A spokesperson for Spotify declined to comment.)

	As for the viral attention Velvet Sundown has garnered, “it's because they're AI, not because the music's great,” says one veteran A&R executive, who asked for anonymity. “It doesn't feel authentic. That said, it's clearly just a matter of time before AI creates a genuine hit song. Not convinced yet it will create a sustainable hit artist. My prediction is that a hit song will appear that the public loves. At that point, someone will reveal it to be AI. No one will care because they love the song.”


	The Velvet Sundown's Frelon, meanwhile, says that music fans need to learn to accept AI tools, calling the fear of them “super overwrought.” “I respect that people have really strong emotions about this,” he says. “But I think it's important that we allow artists to experiment with new technologies and new tools,  try things out, and not freak out at people just because they're using a program or not using a program. People have this idea that you have to please everybody and you have to follow the rules. And that's not how music and culture progress. Music and culture progressed by people doing weird experiments and sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. And that's kind of the spirit that we're [embracing].”

							By 

	Maura Johnston



	It's easy to root for Kesha, which makes listening to (Period.) — her first album as an independent artist, hence its July 4 release date — such a blast. Bookended by pensive moments, (Period.) is a frisky pop record that delights in throwing things at the wall and seeing what sticks — while also getting a kick out of any mess that might result from a less-than-successful toss. 


	(Period.) picks up sort of where 2023's Gag Order — her final release on her former label, Kemosabe — left off: The music is shapeless, the wailing wordless. Eventually, the blur begins to clear. “Freedom,” Kesha ­bellows, her voice opening wide on the vowels as the instrumentation narrows around her. Finally — after a pitchman-sounding voice trills, “Narcissism! It makes you happy!” — a beat drops in, and “Freedom” goes from amorphous to pointed, whirling through post-punk dance-floor raging and gospel-choir riffing while Kesha coolly yet saucily purrs carefree raps like “Crazy girls are better in bed/Well, I can do one better instead.”

	Kesha's taste for pop experimentation is in full flower on (Period.), her indie debut well-timed to the long-brewing mainstream break of the hedonistic, neon-hued, kitchen-­sink genre known as hyperpop. “Joyride,” the album's thumping first single, blends norteña accordion blasts, huge backing vocals, and mouth-­stretching enunciation; on “Yippie-Ki-Yay,” Kesha takes over the DJ booth at a honky-tonk, lending her mighty voice to lyrics about “double-­cupping straight gasoline” and adding foundation-rattling beats.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Things mellow out a bit as (Period.) draws to a close. “Glow” is serenely self-satisfied, Kesha's glitched-out voice darting through eight-bit synths. The album ends with “Cathedral,” a clear-eyed look at survival that's also a reminder of Kesha's gravity-defying vocal prowess. “Every second is a new beginning/I died in the hell so I could start living again,” she shouts amid droning strings and resolute piano, then declares: “I'm the cathedral.” (Period.) shows that Kesha is ready to take in all who have believed in her.

If humans are ever going to live beyond Earth, they'll need to construct habitats. But transporting enough industrial material to create livable spaces would be incredibly challenging and expensive. Researchers at the  Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences  (SEAS) think there's a better way, through biology.

An international team of researchers led by  Robin Wordsworth , the Gordon McKay Professor of Environmental Science and Engineering and Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences, have demonstrated that they can grow green algae inside shelters made out of bioplastics in Mars-like conditions. The experiments are a first step toward designing sustainable habitats in space that won't require bringing materials from Earth.

""If you have a habitat that is composed of bioplastic, and it grows algae within it, that algae could produce more bioplastic,"" explained Wordsworth. ""So you start to have a closed-loop system that can sustain itself and even grow through time.""

The research is published in Science Advances.

In lab experiments that recreated the thin atmosphere of Mars, Wordsworth's team grew a common type of green algae called Dunaliella tertiolecta. The algae thrived inside a 3D-printed growth chamber made from a bioplastic called polylactic acid, which was able to block UV radiation while transmitting enough light to allow the algae to photosynthesize.

The algae was kept under a Mars-like 600 Pascals of atmospheric pressure – over 100 times lower than Earth's -- and in a carbon dioxide-rich environment, as opposed to mostly nitrogen and oxygen like on Earth. Liquid water cannot exist at such low pressures, but the bioplastic chamber created a pressure gradient that stabilized water within it. The experiments point to bioplastics as potentially key to creating renewable systems for maintaining life in a lifeless environment.

The concept the researchers demonstrated is closer to how organisms grow naturally on Earth, and it contrasts with an industrial approach using materials that are costly to manufacture and recycle.

Wordsworth's team previously demonstrated a type of local Martian terraforming using  sheets of silica aerogels  that mimic the Earth's greenhouse warming effect to allow for biological growth. A combination of the algae experiments with the aerogels would solve both temperature and pressure issues for supporting plant and algae growth, Wordsworth said, and could open a clearer path toward extraterrestrial existence.

Next, Wordsworth said the researchers want to demonstrate that their habitats also work in vacuum conditions, which would be relevant for lunar or deep-space applications. His team also has plans to design a working closed-loop system for habitat production.

""The concept of biomaterial habitats is fundamentally interesting and can support humans living in space,"" Wordsworth said. ""As this type of technology develops, it's going to have spinoff benefits for sustainability technology here on Earth as well.""

The research was supported by the Leverhulme Center for Life in the University grant, the Harvard Origins of Life Grant, and the National Science Foundation (NSF-2100509). Co-authors were Rafid Quayum, Elida Kocharian, Ann Pearson, Xavier Portillo, Madeleine Yang, Charles S.

Some good news for devoted fans of Tyler Henry. 

The “Hollywood Medium” star revealed that he's “doing much better” these days. 

The fortunate news comes one month after Henry underwent surgery, where doctors successfully removed a non-cancerous, fluid filled cyst near the center of his brain. 

E! News caught up with the star for an exclusive interview, where he spoke about his major health scare. 

“I'm very lucky,” Henry said. “I was dealing with something called hydrocephalus, which is basically fluid being stuck around the brain and causing inflammation.”

Though he acknowledged that his tumor had an “incidence rate of one in 3 million,” the famed medium then figured, “I should play the lottery.” 

Furthermore, Henry said he is marveled by his swift recovery as weeks after his surgery, he went back to performing readings for his “An Evening of Hope and Healing” series of live shows. 

The cross-country tour continues into December. 

“I was worried with anything related to the brain that it might affect my ability,” the medium explained. “But I found that not having brain inflammation actually made things a lot clearer.”

Recalling his health journey up until now, the clairvoyant said that he was “dealing with a lot of confusing symptoms, just kind of hard to orient physically.” 

“I would sometimes feel kind of slow in responses and deal with aphasia, where I couldn't really find my words,” he remembered. 

Fortunately for Henry, he's been through this sort of thing before, as he dealt with an arachnoid cyst – a benign mass situated on the arachnoid membrane, a protective layer surrounding the brain and spinal cord – while he was a teenager. 

“I had been diagnosed previously with some form of a mass in the back of my brain,” he said. “When I was 18, I underwent brain surgery — then endoscopically — and it took about 10 years for it come back after it resealed. So, it was nothing new necessarily.”

But during his latest health ordeal, Henry had his husband Clint Goodwin as a source of support. 

“We got married just before my brain surgery, just in case anything went wrong,” he said. “We went to the Beverly Hills courthouse. As we signed the papers, Clint looked up and saw 2:22 on the clock — his sign from his late grandfather.”

“It was such a meaningful moment,” he said.

A man who killed his wife and two children in 1994 after his wife sought a divorce has been scheduled for execution in Florida

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A man who killed his wife and two children in 1994 after she sought a divorce is scheduled for execution in Florida under a death warrant signed Tuesday by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Edward J. Zakrzewski, II, is set to die July 31 in the ninth execution scheduled for this year in the state. He pleaded guilty in 1996 to three counts of first-degree murder and received three death sentences in the killings of wife Sylvia Zakrzewski, son Edward Zakrzewski, 7, and Anna Zakrzewski, 5. 

The man beat his wife with a crowbar and machete and strangled her to death and killed the children with a machete June 9, 1994, in Okaloosa County. 

He eventually turned himself into law enforcement after the case was profiled on the television show “Unsolved Mysteries,” according to court documents.

Another man on death row, Michael Bernard Bell, 54, is set to die by lethal injection July 15 at Florida State Prison. He's convicted of killing two people outside a bar.

Thomas Lee Gudinas, 51, who was convicted of raping and killing a woman in Florida, was executed following a lethal injection at the same prison last week.

The state also executed six people in 2023 but only carried out one execution last year.

 A US judge has allowed Celsius's lawsuit over Tether's $4 billion Bitcoin liquidation to move forward, rejecting key parts of Tether's dismissal bid. 

A US bankruptcy judge ruled that Celsius Network's multibillion-dollar lawsuit against Tether can proceed, denying in part Tether's attempt to dismiss claims that it “improperly” liquidated Celsius's Bitcoin collateral during the crypto lender's collapse.

According to court documents filed in New York on Monday, Celsius alleges that Tether (USDT) executed a “fire sale” of over 39,500 Bitcoin (BTC) in June 2022, applying the proceeds against Celsius's $812 million debt without following agreed-upon procedures.

Celsius claims Tether's actions breached their lending agreement, violated “good faith and fair dealing” under British Virgin Islands law, and constituted fraudulent and preferential transfers avoidable under the US Bankruptcy Code.

The complaint centers on a margin call Tether issued as Bitcoin prices plunged. Celsius argues that Tether sold its collateral before a 10-hour waiting period, liquidating the BTC at an average price of $20,656 (below market levels) and later transferring the assets to its own Bitfinex accounts.

Related: Celsius creditors allege 30% less compensation than promised during bankruptcy

The filing alleges that Tether's liquidation cost Celsius over $4 billion worth of BTC at current prices.

Celsius further claims Tether's actions involved US-based communications, personnel and financial accounts, establishing sufficient ties for US jurisdiction despite Tether's incorporation in the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong.

The judge agreed Celsius made a plausible case that the transfers and alleged misconduct were “domestic” in nature, rejecting Tether's argument that the claims represent an impermissible extraterritorial application of US bankruptcy law.

In August 2024, Tether sought to dismiss the lawsuit entirely, claiming that the US court lacked jurisdiction and that Celsius's allegations fail to state valid claims. While the court dismissed some counts, it allowed Celsius's key breach of contract, fraudulent transfer and preference claims to proceed.

Celsius, once among crypto's largest lenders, officially exited bankruptcy on Jan. 31, 2024, after an 18-month restructuring process. The company is now repaying creditors.

In June, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the company has no plans to go public. Ardoino responded to speculation about a potential Tether IPO, dismissing the idea even as observers suggested a public offering could value the stablecoin giant at over $500 billion, larger than corporations like Costco or Coca-Cola.

While calling a $515 billion valuation a “beautiful number,” Ardoino suggested it might even undervalue Tether, considering its sizable Bitcoin and gold reserves.

Meanwhile, Tether continues to expand its Bitcoin footprint, becoming the majority owner of Jack Mallers' Twenty One Capital, now the world's third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Tether recently transferred nearly 37,230 BTC, worth about $3.9 billion, to addresses tied to the platform.

Despite all of the ads you're getting for collagen supplements and electric scrub brushes, TikTok Shop US is apparently not doing so hot. Per a report from Bloomberg, TikTok has conducted its third round of layoffs for this team since April, but has not disclosed how many jobs were impacted.

TikTok Shop US, the company's e-commerce retailer, launched less than two years ago, selling a variety of products and offering creators commissions for their videos that trigger sales. While Shop remains TikTok's fastest-growing business, TikTok's fate in the U.S. remains uncertain.

President Trump has continued to delay the deadline for ByteDance to sell the app to an American entity, following TikTok's official ban. This weekend, however, Trump announced that he has a potential buyer for the app, which is rumored to include some familiar faces in VC.

Chelsea have signed Joao Pedro from Brighton in a deal worth up to £60m.

The 23-year-old has signed an eight-year deal and is already in the USA with his new Chelsea team-mates for the Club World Cup.

Pedro will be able to play for Chelsea at the tournament as clubs are allowed to register players between June 27 and July 3.

It means the Brazil international could make his Chelsea debut in the Club World Cup quarter-finals against Palmeiras in Philadelphia on Saturday and has the chance to win a trophy within his first month at the club.

""I grew up watching the Premier League, and Chelsea were a club that won trophies. So, when you join Chelsea, you can only think one thing: to win trophies,"" he said.

""Every competition, you have to think, 'I play for Chelsea and that is my ambition'.""

Newcastle had also been interested in Pedro and had a bid of around £50m rejected, but it is understood Pedro only wanted to play for Chelsea.

Watford, who sold Pedro to Brighton for £35m in 2023, will be due 20 per cent of the profit from this deal. Chelsea have good relations with Brighton, who have a sell-on clause in the deal.

The Blues view Pedro as a versatile forward who can play as a No 9 or across the front line. He scored 30 goals in 70 appearances

Pedro's transfer takes Chelsea's spend on Brighton players to £260m since 2022. He has followed Marc Cucurella (£63m), Robert Sanchez (£25m) and Moises Caicedo (£115m) in making the move to west London.

Brighton head coach Fabian Hurzeler says selling Pedro to Chelsea is an ""excellent deal"" for the club

Hurzeler said: ""This is a good move for all parties. It's an excellent deal for the club, and a good return on a significant investment in an area of the pitch where we have a lot of competition and are already well served in terms of our attacking talent.

""It's also an exciting move for Joao: it gives him the opportunity to play Champions League football this coming season, and he will of course be keen to cement his position in the Brazil team ahead of the World Cup next summer.

""Joao has given us some wonderful moments - during my time and before I came to the club - so on behalf of everyone I would like to thank him for his service over the past two seasons and wish him the best for the future.""

Sky Sports News' James Savundra and Elliot Cook:

Brighton had no intention of selling Pedro in this window but were aware of mounting Premier League interest.

The 23-year-old's ambition to play at the top level of European football has been no secret and he's also keen to put himself firmly in the picture for next summer's World Cup.

Brighton will continue to sell players when they consider it the right time for both themselves and the player - as long as the value is matched. They will not stand in a player's way if their value is met.

After Pedro was sent off against Brentford and was involved in an altercation during training with Jan Paul van Hecke, it seemed an exit this summer could happen.

While he is not regarded as a troublemaker, the incidents did not go down well internally. Pedro moved to Brighton from Watford in May 2023 and had 40 goal contributions in all competitions across 70 games.

He was the top scorer in the Europa League group stage during the 2023/24 season, including a late winner against Marseille.

The fee from Chelsea represents a significant profit on a player who helped the club achieve a top-10 finish last season and who was their top scorer in their first campaign in Europe.

The club will bide their time when it comes to assessing their attacking plans. Their existing options include record signing Georginio Rutter, Danny Welbeck, Evan Ferguson and new signing Charalampos Kostoulas - whom the club have extremely high hopes for.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","Does U.S. weather have FIFA concerned about 2026 World Cup? Here's what we know","https://ftw.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2025/07/02/us-weather-fifa-concerned-2026-world-cup-kickoff-times/84446153007/","Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:41:48 GMT","

When FIFA dubiously awarded the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, it gave a country with no sporting history or infrastructure the right to host soccer's biggest event in an extreme summer climate. But Qatar's brutal heat became such a concern that FIFA ultimately shook up the calendar and moved the tournament to winter.

Looking ahead to the 2026 World Cup in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, weather is once again becoming a concern. And we're seeing those challenges play out at the 2025 Club World Cup.

But is FIFA going to consider a massive upheaval to the scheduling for 2026's tournament? Here's what we know so far.

While early kickoffs and high prices in NFL stadiums have contributed to lackluster attendance for many Club World Cup matches, the weather hasn't helped either.

Out of the 12 Club World Cup venues, Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium is the only one with a roof. This has largely forced players to play in summer heat that they aren't accustomed to — particularly those from the major European leagues. It also hasn't helped that the Northeast U.S. experienced a significant heat wave during the tournament.

Chelsea's match against Flamengo in Philadelphia was 97°F at kickoff with a heat index in the 100s. Borussia Dortmund players described Cincinnati's weather like playing in a sauna. And while midday summer thunderstorms are common in the Southeast and Florida, they can be disruptive. The Club World Cup has already seen several long weather delays due to lightning.

Now, it's important to note that seven Club World Cup venues won't be utilized in the World Cup. There will also be five stadiums with roofs in 2026 as opposed to just one in Atlanta. But players are still concerned.

Soccer's global players union, FIFPRO, is asking FIFA to abandon the afternoon kickoffs in the 2026 World Cup due to heat concerns.

And though the five indoor stadiums will offer relief, FIFPRO did classify the open-air stadiums in Miami, Kansas City and Monterrey as ""extremely high risk."" Boston, Philadelphia and Guadalajara were listed as ""very high risk.""

The union said via The Athletic:

Professor Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, FIFPRO's medical director, told reporters on a Zoom call on Monday: “From our research, a couple of cities and some matches on the ongoing Club World Cup can be labelled as having a higher risk for heat-related illness, or, in the worst case, extreme high risk for heat related illness.

“There are certain areas in a country that will be more at risk. So think about match destinations such as Orlando or Miami, for example, where you can see over a period of years that there's a higher risk attached to these venues and destinations.

“The question is, if we look at match scheduling and match planning ahead of the tournament, if we actually need midday kick-off times in these locations or in these high-risk areas — if we should probably move towards late kick-off times as a preferences for these venues.”

The World Cup final is slated to be played at New Jersey's MetLife Stadium, which FIFPRO calls ""high risk.""

Though discussions are ongoing between FIFA and FIFPRO, there does not seem to be any immediate plans to shift kickoff times or venues.

And as right now, New Jersey expects the 2026 World Cup final to kick off at 3 p.m. Eastern Time, which is the traditional local time kickoff for the final match.

New Jersey governor Phil Murphy said:

“I don't want to speak for FIFA, and obviously they call the shots, but I think they're circling in and around 3 p.m. New Jersey time for the World Cup final on July 19,” Murphy told The Athletic by phone on Tuesday.

FIFA also commented about the weather via USA TODAY:

“FIFA's top priority is the health of everyone involved in football,” a spokesman said. “FIFA will continue to monitor the weather conditions to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for everyone involved.”

This late in the process, it would be almost unheard of for FIFA to shake up the hosting cities or change venues. But there are seven indoor stadiums (Arizona, Detroit, Minneapolis, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Indianapolis and San Antonio) that were not chosen to host World Cup matches.

FIFA has plenty of options when it comes to the tournament in U.S. weather. We'll have to see what FIFA chooses to do about it.","{'href': 'https://ftw.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Alexander Zverev will hope to “solve myself” during the North American hard-court swing after suffering his earliest Grand Slam exit in six years on Tuesday.In an upset-filled first round that saw four Top 10 stars in both Wimbledon singles draws tumble out, the world No. 3 dropped a five-setter carried over from Monday to Arthur Rinderknech on Centre Court.Speaking with press following the defeat, Zverev shared a sense of loneliness has proven insurmountable to brush aside since losing January's Australian Open final to Jannik Sinner.“I'm trying to find ways, trying to find ways to kind of get out of this hole. I keep kind of finding myself back in it in a way,” he said. “I feel, generally speaking, quite alone in life at the moment, which is a feeling that is not very nice.”

I've never felt this empty before. Just lacking joy, just lacking joy in everything that I do.

Asked in a follow-up if making tweaks to his team was on the table, Zverev responded “possibly.” But at the end of the day, the change that's needed starts within him.“It's not a feeling on a tennis court, it's just a life feeling in general. As I said, I never felt this way before. I don't know. It's difficult to find joy outside the tennis court for me at the moment,” the 28-year-old stated.“It's not an excuse or anything. I think Arthur deserved to win today. It's something I've felt for the past few months. Again, I just feel generally very, very alone and very lonely. I don't know. Just never felt that way before.“I don't have the answers right now.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: McLaren's fierce battle in Austria

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Bortoleto challenges Alonso in Spielberg

Previous

Upcoming

Fernando Alonso was quick to praise rookie Gabriel Bortoleto after finishing just ahead of the Brazilian in the Austrian Grand Prix.

Fernando Alonso was full of praise for Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto after the Brazilian rookie collected his first F1 points in Austria, with the duo engaging in an entertaining duel late on in Spielberg.

With Alonso on his way to a strong seventh-placed finish in the race, Bortoleto – who belongs to the Aston Martin man's Driver Management programme – charged up behind and came incredibly close to picking off Alonso on the very last lap.

With the pair the only drivers to go for the one-stop in Austria, and with Bortoleto's tyres 16 laps fresher, the Spanish two-time World Champion defended hard against his mentee.

However, luck was also on Alonso's side as race winner Lando Norris closed in to take the chequered flag, meaning both had to cede to the McLaren.

Not only did that hand Alonso DRS, but it also ensured that the battling cars took the chequered flag behind Norris and thus had one lap less to complete.

Alonso certainly used all his experience to hang onto P7 – but afterwards, he was as overjoyed for his young charge as he was about his own result, going straight to the Brazilian for a heartwarming hug as they climbed out of their cars in parc ferme.

“Incredible, happy for him,” Alonso said about Bortoleto's first points in F1.

“Gabi was outstanding the whole season, for one reason or another [Nico] Hulkenberg was then scoring the points on Sunday. But I think [Bortoleto] deserved maybe before this one to score already but I hope for him it is the first of many.

“The first points in Formula 1, they taste always very special.“

As for how his race unfolded, Alonso was full of praise for his team, who succesfully tried the one-stop, even with track temperatures hitting 50C and tyre degradation extremely high as a result.

“It was intense,"" Alonso explained. ""Look, the first thing was the strategy. The team was right, the one-stop strategy was the one to go for today, it was the fastest as I was not as fast as the Kick Sauber or the Haas and I still finished in front of them.

“The one-stop was the right choice, good pit stop, good timing as well. And then at the end I got lucky as when Gabi came with a lot better pace, I had Norris with the blue flags so Gabi could not attack me on the last laps. And it meant the race was one lap shorter as, by letting Norris go, we saw the chequered flag so all in all, it was a perfect combo for us.”

Lance Stroll was unable to score on Sunday, coming home 14th for Aston Martin, who remain eighth in the Championship. Thanks to Alonso's points though, they have closed up to Haas and are just one point behind the American outfit heading into Silverstone.
