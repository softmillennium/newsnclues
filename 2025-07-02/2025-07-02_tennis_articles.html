                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>COCO Gauff was left emotional after an early Wimbledon exit on Tuesday. Gauff entered Wimbledon coming off a Grand Slam win at Roland Garros, but ended up losing in the first round. 2 seed at Wimbledon, but was taken out in a stunning defeat to unranked Ukrainian Dayana Yastremska. In her presser after the match, Gauff shared that she was feeling mentally "overwhelmed" while wiping away tears. "But it's the first time, in this experience, like coming off a win and having to play at Wimbledon, and I definitely learned about what I would and would not do again." Gauff lost to Yastremska in straight sets, 7-6 (7-3), 6-1. With the US Open approaching soon, Gauff is trying to keep her chin up for the home tournament. "I'm trying to be positive," Gauff said. "I don't like losing, and I think for me the main thing I'm sure my team and everyone is going to tell me is 'you did well at Roland Garros don't be so upset' and things like that." Despite a positive mindset, Gauff was still incredibly upset about the first-round exit and wiped away tears throughout her presser. "I feel like I could have been a little bit better in those tough tiebreaker moments. "So yea obviously I'm not going to dwell on this too long because I want to do well at US Open and maybe losing here in the first round isn't the worst thing because of that. Wimbledon runs through July 13 and the US Open begins on August 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Milestones in tennis are sometimes like London buses. You wait a long time for one, and then two come along at once. That has been the case for August Holmgren at 2025 Wimbledon. On Tuesday, the Dane backed up that win by racing past Quentin Halys to earn his maiden Grand Slam match win. At 27 years old, Holmgren had to be patient for his first taste of major action. When it arrived, he made winning on one of tennis' biggest stages appear straightforward, defeating Halys 7-6(4), 6-3, 6-4. I'm very happy that I didn't really have a dip in level in all three sets, which is uncommon for a five-set match,” Holmgren told ATPTour.com at Wimbledon. “On the one hand, I'm not surprised, because I have so much faith in my serve and my game. August Holmgren in action against Quentin Halys at Wimbledon. Hailing from Espergaerde in Denmark, Holmgren played college tennis from 2017 to 2022 at the University of San Diego, where he earned a bachelor's degree in theatre arts and performance studies. In California, the Dane's coaches and teammates quickly came to know him as an open-minded student-athlete with multiple interests, and someone who was not afraid to take on new challenges. “[August] did everything,” recalled Ryan Keckley, men's tennis head coach at USD, who has been at Wimbledon this week watching both Holmgren and current USD star Oliver Tarvet. This is a guy who on a Tuesday would go like salsa dancing because it was in the room next to his dorm or something like that. “On Saturdays in his junior year, he took a surfing class. 733 Tarvet's incredible journey to a showdown with Alcaraz at Wimbledon For Holmgren, keeping up pursuits outside of tennis was, and still remains, an essential aspect of what made him a better tennis player. “To make sure I was happy off the court, because I needed that in order to be happy on the court. If I don't do my hobbies and only focus on tennis, it has a negative impact on me. The Dane, who is now coached by former Wimbledon doubles champion Frederik Nielsen, has competed relentlessly on the ATP Challenger Tour and ITF World Tennis Tour since leaving San Diego. “August is a guy who, any time he steps on a court, he's going to make you a better tennis player just because of his attitude and his work ethic, and just his overall demeanour. He's worked really hard on his game, and he's got a great supporting cast with Freddie Nielsen, who obviously has experience at the highest level of the Tour, helping him along the way and navigating not only his tennis, but his mind, which is probably one of the most important things for the young men.” Holmgren was willing to throw himself into new experiences and situations at college. While he is not sure that has had a direct impact on his ability to navigate the trials and tribulations of the pro circuit, he does think that his willingness to embrace ‘the moment' is one of his strengths. “Do I resign and let my ego tell the world that, ‘This is so unfair, I am usually much better. 153 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings after his win against World No. 46 Halys, Holmgren will hope to forge a third milestone moment in the space of a week on Wednesday. If he can upset 21st seed Tomas Machac on the All England Club's No. 12 Court, it will be the biggest win of his career by PIF ATP Ranking.

American tennis pros were bounced early from Wimbledon this year, with several top-ranked players dropping in the first and second rounds of the tournament at the historic All England Club this week. Frances Tiafoe of the U.S. reacts after missing a point as he plays Cameron Norrie of Britain during their second round men's singles match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Wednesday, July 2, 2025. But Tiafoe wasn't the only American to suffer a stunning defeat. Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula — the top-seeded American women's players — were both out after suffering upsets in the first round on Tuesday. "I definitely was struggling in the locker room. I don't like losing," Gauff, the reigning French Open champion, said after losing her match in straight sets to an unseeded Dayana Yastremska on Tuesday. "The main thing I'm sure my team and everyone is going to tell me (is): 'You did well at Roland-Garros. Coco Gauff (USA) waves to the crowd while leaving the court after her match against Dayana Yastremska (UKR)(not pictured) on day 2 of The Championships, Wimbledon 2025 at All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club onJuly 1, 2025 in Wimbledon, United Kingdom. It followed just days after victory over five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek on grass courts at the Bad Homburg Open in Germany. Jessica Pegula of the U.S. leaves the court after losing to Elisabetta Cocciaretto of Italy during their women's first round singles match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London, Tuesday, July 1, 2025. 3 seed, Alexander Zverev, lost his first round match to 72nd-ranked Arthur Rinderknech in five sets. 7 seed Lorenzo Musetti was sent packing by 126th-ranked Nikoloz Basilashvili in the first round, and major finalists Zheng Qinwen, the No. 15 seed, were also gone after their first round matches.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff has suffered a shock first round defeat at Wimbledon this year. Gauff was beaten by Dayana Yastremska in her first Grand Slam match since winning Roland Garros last month. While this is an unusual position for Gauff to be in, it is not the first time that she has suffered an opening round loss at Wimbledon. The only other time that Gauff has lost in the first round of Wimbledon is in 2023, when she was beaten by compatriot Sofia Kenin. Gauff had reached the latter stages of Roland Garros again that year, but was unable to transition to the grass courts of Wimbledon. This would make her first round defeat at Wimbledon in 2023 worth it, as she became the first American to win the women's singles title at her home major in six years. Although it was unclear as to what would be next for Gauff when she lost in the first round of the US Open in 2023, she had already hinted that better things were coming. “I mean, it really wants me to work harder,” said Gauff. So, yeah, I think it makes me want to work even harder. This should reassure Gauff after her most recent loss to Yastremska, as she looks to bounce back ahead of the North American hard court swing. Gauff has struggled on grass compared to the other surfaces, and should be much more comfortable on the hard courts closer to home.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's day three at Wimbledon 2025 and a packed day is almost done, with a raft of British players in action including Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter, as well as Carlos Alcaraz, Naomi Osaka and a host of other big names. The first Brit on court today was Sonay Kartal, sweeping aside Bulgaria's Viktoriya Tomova in straight sets, though Billy Harris was beaten by Portuguese No 1 Nuno Borges. British qualifier Oliver Tarvet also exited, showing heart in a loss to defending champion Alcaraz in the match of his life, but Cameron Norrie advanced with an epic win over Frances Tiafoe on Court One. Raducanu, meanwhile, passed a huge test against former champion Marketa Vondrousova, downing the Czech in straight sets. Yesterday Jack Draper cruised through to the second round, but Heather Watson and Jodie Burrage were early casualties among the home prospects. There were more dramatic exits in the women's draw, however, when third seed Jessica Pegula and fifth seed Zheng Qinwen were eliminated, before French Open champion Coco Gauff lost to Dayana Yastremska in the final match on Court One. The men's No 3 seed Alexander Zverev suffered a shock defeat to France's Arthur Rinderknech but top seed Jannik Sinner swept past Italian Luca Nardi. Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic saw off the stout challenge of Alexandre Muller to make his way into the next round, crediting “miracle pills” for his turnaround. The last four years have been strange for Emma Raducanu. On one hand, she has long been trying to recapture the form of her breakthrough season, when she reached the fourth round at Wimbledon before sealing a stunning victory at the US Open. It was even harder to cast aside memories of that dizzying summer when Raducanu achieved the same result. Cameron Norrie is enjoying tennis more than ever after reaching the third round of Wimbledon with a tenacious victory against 12th seed Frances Tiafoe. In doing so he booked a likely clash with Queen's finalist Jiri Lehecka in the third round, and looks set to enter that tie full of confidence. "I think it was a very good performance from me. "Mentally, as well - I was very stable throughout the whole match. I think if you spoke to Frances he would probably say the same. He was playing so well but I never really flinched. I can take a lot of confidence from that." We've had the likes of Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Zheng Qinwen all crash out in the early stages of Wimbledon this year. And now, World No 4 and last year's Wimbledon runner-up Jasmine Paolini has herself suffered an early exit, losing to Kamilla Rakhimova 6-4 4-6 4-6 to leave things wide open in the women's singles. Three days and we've already had bucket-loads of drama. “I've played against really good players before but not quite the level of Alcaraz,” Tarvet said. Emma Raducanu jokes that there will be “no pressure” now that she's playing the World No 1 in Aryna Sabalenka in her next match. Underdog she may be, but the likes of Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Zheng Qinwen - and just now, Jasmine Paolini - are among the top seeds to have already crashed out of Wimbledon. “I knew playing Marketa was going to be an incredibly difficult match. She has won this tournament which is a huge achievement. Mark [Petchey] has helped me a lot, everyone in that box. The support was incredible and I felt it today.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gauff said she felt "a little bit overwhelmed" after winning the French Open last month The biggest win of Coco Gauff's year might have led to her biggest loss, the American tennis star surmised after getting knocked out of Wimbledon in the first round on Tuesday. Gauff said after her shocking loss on Tuesday that she was “a little bit overwhelmed” with “everything” that came with winning her second major tournament last month. "I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards," Gauff said, according to ESPN. "So, I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it." Gauff made 29 unforced errors in the match, including nine double-faults. "Dayana started off playing strong," Gauff said afterwards. "I couldn't find my footing out there today."

"Playing against Coco, it is something special,” the world No. A record-breaking four women ranked in the top 10, as well as four men, were all upset – the most ever at a major tournament in the Open Era (since 1968), according to ESPN.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Legendary tennis coach Darren Cahill has revealed what Jannik Sinner did moments after his French Open final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz that surprised onlookers. Sinner lost a five-hour epic 6-4, 7-6, 4-6, 6-7, 6-7 to Alcaraz at Roland-Garros last month. It was his first defeat in four Grand Slam finals, with the Italian dropping just two sets in his previous three finals. According to Cahill, who has coached Sinner to all three of his Grand Slam final victories and previously mentored Simona Halep and Andre Agassi, the Italian walked past a candy jar as he was leaving the arena. While tradition indicates that each player takes a small number of candies with them, Sinner instead decided to take the whole jar. Speaking on ESPN, Cahill explained: "About a half an hour afterwards, he went and did the press, he was walking to the transport, we had this big bus where we all sit in. "And for the players, they have this candy jar, that you can take a couple of candies as you're walking out. "He'd been on a strict diet for two weeks, and that was it - the diet was out of the window. "He moved on pretty quickly [from the defeat]. It'll be interesting to see how he moves on here [at Wimbledon], because this will be the big test." Sinner and Alcaraz are on opposite sides of the draw so, should they face each other at this year's Wimbledon, the pair will have reached yet another Grand Slam final. Live in constant hope of the top flight as a Preston North End fan. Written in the past for SPORF, GiveMeSport and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BBC co-commentator John Lloyd took aim at Frances Tiafoe's antics during his second round Wimbledon with Cameron Norrie as he labelled the American "absolutely ridiculous". Tiafoe claimed the opening set on Court 1 on Wednesday afternoon before Norris, who is a former semi-finalist at SW19, fired back to win the next three sets. But it was the American's antics after the third set that caused controversy as he decided to take a moment to compose himself, but took his time in doing so. Before the fourth set could begin, Tiafoe took a prolonged period of time to collect his belongings from his side of the court before heading for a toilet break. He appeared to grab a towel, t-shirt, shorts and fresh trainers from his bag before requesting a toilet break from the umpire. It took seven minutes for him to return with Lloyd claiming he was deliberately trying to halt Norrie's momentum. Not that it worked as the Brith would claim the fourth set to progress with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 victory. He said ahead of the fourth set: "This is ridiculous, I'm sorry but it's absolutely ridiculous. And you had the French Open final and they didn't go for one bathroom break in five hours. Andrew Castle, who was also on commentary duty, joked about the amount of stuff that Tiafoe was taking as he joked: "It looks like he is moving in." The French umpire Damian Dumusois allowed Tiafoe to then slowly walk off the court with Castle letting rip as he claimed it was unfair on the home player. He said: "Damian Dumusois in the chair here. I'm not sure what he can do. You've got the court official waiting to lead him off and the loo is just back there. Lloyd then added: "I think if you have to have a bathroom break, you get your stuff immediately. You can't just wait three minutes deciding which shirt and shorts you want to wear. This for me, I don't agree with it at all. It was so nice to play Frances at such a big match. I served really well in that last game and you guys we were amazing in that last game so thank you. I'm really happy with my level today."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Aryna Sabalenka was just two points from dropping the opening set of her second-round Wimbledon match three times on Wednesday before asserting herself for a 7-6 (4), 6-4 victory over Marie Bouzkova to avoid the sort of surprise that has sent a group of seeded players home. Four of the top 10 women's seeds failed to make it out of the first round: No. In all, a record-tying 23 seeded players — 10 women, 13 men — were gone by the end of Day 2, equaling the most at any Grand Slam event in the past 25 years. “Of course you're going to know the overall picture. She is a three-time Grand Slam champion, with all of those titles coming on hard courts at the Australian Open or U.S. Open. She also was the runner-up to Gauff at the clay-court French Open last month — drawing criticism from some over her post-match comments, a flap she and Gauff set aside via social media videos last week — but hasn't been past the semifinals on the grass of the All England Club. A year ago, Sabalenka was forced to miss Wimbledon because of an injured shoulder. On Wednesday, the record-breaking heat of the first two days gave way to rain that delayed the start of play on smaller courts for about two hours, along with temperatures that dropped from above 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) to below 68 F (20 C). But on the last such occasion, Sabalenka came through with a forehand volley winner she punctuated with a yell, followed by a down-the-line backhand winner that was accompanied by another shout. “That was a tough moment," said Sabalenka, who will face 2021 U.S. Open champion Emma Raducanu or 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova next. “Until that point, (my) return wasn't great enough to break her serve. I kind of like felt a little bit better.” That sent them to a tiebreaker, and from 4-all there, Sabalenka took the next three points, ending the set with a powerful forehand return winner off a 67 mph second serve. In the second set, the only break arrived for a 3-2 lead for Sabalenka, and that was basically that. Australian Open champion Madison Keys, who is seeded sixth, joined Sabalenka in the third round, beating Olga Danilovic 6-4, 6-2. Other players in action later included 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini among the women and two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, Taylor Fritz, Frances Tiafoe among the men. Who plays Thursday at the All England Club? Novak Djokovic, who has won seven of his 24 major championships at Wimbledon will lead off the Centre Court schedule on Day 4 against Britain's Dan Evans at 1:30 p.m. local time (8:30 a.m. ET), followed by Iga Swiatek vs. Caty McNally, and No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She has mastered the courts at the Australian Open, but grass has never been her best surface. In the second round of Wimbledon 2025, Sabalenka faced Marie Bouzkova, a player who can hit with power that almost matches Sabalenka. To make matters tougher for the WTA No. 1, Bouzkova is Czech, and any and all women's players from that nation should have confidence in London. Sabalenka wasn't trying to defeat Bouzkova, but the entire culture of Czech women's tennis, which appears to be set on dominating at Wimbledon. Several have real chances to make a run at the title, including 2023 Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova and rising player Linda Noskova. But Sabalenka isn't going to be afraid of any player. The Belarusian was tested by good shot-making from Bouzkova, but the Czech could not match Sabalenka's immense power. Few players can, and if Sabalenka learns to volley a bit more, she could be unbeatable in London as long as her serve holds up. The Belarusian also did what all great players do. In a tight first set, she took control in the tie-break and moved to the lead by winning it 7-4. This happened after Sabalenka was broken late in the set, but she came back to break Bouzkova in the next game. 1 showed no nerves in her final service game, winning at love with smart shots deep in the corners that Bouzkova had no answer for. Overall, Sabalenka played an exceedingly efficient match. She finished with 41 winners against just 18 unforced errors, and 28 of her 35 net chances.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Navarro has joked that Jannik Sinner had been desperate to play alongside her at the US Open, quipping that the world No.1 'begged her' to play as his partner. A number of big names have already agreed to play in the mixed doubles, with Carlos Alcaraz set to team up with British star Emma Raducanu, as well as Novak Djokovic playing with fellow Serbian Olga Danilovic and Stefanos Tsitsipas pairing with his girlfriend Paula Badosa. Navarro said: "He was begging me to play. You're not the best player but I'll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year!'" After the news broke that the two would be entering as partners, Sinner was asked about how this came about prior to his first round matchup at Wimbledon. He told reporters: "It was very unexpected, to be honest. Look, I just met her yesterday for the first time. "The tournament, they wanted us to kind of play together because certain teams were already set up. The choice was not big, but I'm very happy to play with Emma." The new-look competition will see games be played in a different format, being much quicker and less strenuous in order for more than one game to be played per day. The format up to the final will be best-of-three-set matches with sets played to four games and a sudden-death deciding point at deuce. Sinner explained why he was "very excited" to be apart of the new look competition in Queens, New York City. I think it's very exciting for the fans to see something different. "The best singles player playing doubles is always something fun to watch. We have something similar - obviously not mixed - in Indian Wells and Miami. "This time, I think the teams are very, very high level, the best players to play.

Coco Gauff wasn't herself during Tuesday's shocking opening-round loss at Wimbledon to Dayana Yastremska, failing to flex her usual strengths as a defensive player and top-rated American. Coming off her second Grand Slam with a French Open title over Aryna Sabalenka last month, Gauff admitted her focus wasn't there against the unseeded Ukrainian after her straight sets loss. Gauff managed just six winners in the match, suffered nine double faults and whiffed her way to 29 unforced errors. "I feel like mentally I was a little bit overwhelmed with everything that came afterwards," Gauff said, "so I didn't feel like I had enough time to celebrate and also get back into it." 1 after failing to find a rhythm once she lost the tiebreak in the first set. 3 and fellow American Jessica Pegula was upset in the first round as well, leaving the women's draw at Wimbledon without America's two top threats early in Week 1. Gauff's serve was an issue early and lingered throughout the match. Gauff played from behind early in the second set after losing her serve in the first game with Yastremska not being fooled by consistency issues. Whether serves went wide or into the net, it was obvious Gauff was not going to be on the offensive on grass. "When I can serve well, and some games I did, it's definitely an added threat," Gauff said. Gauff mentioned Yastremska's strong play after the loss and said she "couldn't find my footing" on a hot day in London. "I definitely was struggling in the locker room. I don't like losing," Gauff said. "The main thing I'm sure my team and everyone is going to tell me (is): 'You did well at Roland-Garros. Gauff said she won't dwell on her first-round upset and her focus has already turned to the U.S. Open later this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner have won the last six Grand Slam titles and in the ongoing Wimbledon too, they are the heavy favorites to win. Last month, they locked horns in the final of the French Open-the first time they faced off in a Grand Slam summit clash and it did not disappoint at all. It was what perhaps everyone expected it to be: nothing short of a thrilling clash that kept everyone on the edge of their seats for five hours and 29 minutes. Tommy Paul, after his first-round match at Wimbledon against Johannus Monday, was asked in the press conference what went through his mind while watching the final between the two young rivals. Paul, who will square off against Sebastian Ofner, is projected to lock horns with Sinner in the fourth round and could only face Alcaraz if he reaches the final. The Spaniard holds a 5-2 head-to-head record over the 28-year-old and had knocked him out in this year's Roland Garros quarterfinal. Against the three-time Grand Slam champion, Paul trails 1-4 in the head-to-head record and had also lost their clash in this year's Rome Open semifinal. You're not gonna put together two weeks against these guys [to win a Slam]. We've got some catching up to do. Paul has never played the final of a Grand Slam tournament and at Wimbledon, he produced his best when he reached the quarterfinals last year. Alcaraz had knocked him out of the tournament then. It was 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic, whom he defeated in the last two finals. Djokovic is the last player other than Alcaraz and Sinner to win a Major since the 2023 US Open. The 22-year-old Spaniard survived a scare in the first round as it took him more than four hours to knock out Italy's Fabio Fognini in five sets. He will next face Britain's Oliver Tarvet on July 2. He was up against Luca Nardi, whom he defeated 6-4, 6-3, 6-0 to schedule his second-round clash with Aleksandar Vukic. The Italian thinks people have forgotten a bit about the case which is a “good and bad thing about today's society.” At first, everything was a bit different; people saw me in different ways, but I think everyone has seen that I'm a clean player, that I never intended to do anything wrong. I always try to be my best version and have a good team around me, and that's what I'll try to achieve in the future. Sinner has faced his second-round opponent Vukic twice, winning both matches. But they will be facing each other for the first time on grass. This article first appeared on FirstSportz and was syndicated with permission.</p>

But those same fans could not rally Gauff into a comeback as the second set slipped away in double quick time. Gauff will now turn her attention to the hard-court swing on home soil, culminating in a bid for a second US Open title at Flushing Meadows later this summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Novak Djokovic has credited a doctor's 'miracle pills' for helping him to battle through an illness during his first round match at Wimbledon on Tuesday night. Djokovic had appeared visibly unwell and after discussions during a medical time out, was given a tablet by the doctor to ease his symptoms. Djokovic won 10 of the final 12 games following his medical time out, ultimately wrapped up a 6-1, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-2 victory. When asked in his on court interview about the illness, Djokovic suggested he may have been suffering from a stomach bug. 'I went from feeling my absolutely best for a set and a half to my absolute worst for about 45 minutes,' Djokovic said. 'Whether it was a stomach bug - I don't know what it is, but just struggled with that. 'The energy kind of kicked back after some doctor's miracle pills and I managed to finish the match on a good note.' 'Textbook Djokovic "I'm not playing great so I'll take a medical timeout even though there's no signs of me being remotely injured" move to make sure he gets the crowd back on side and acting like he's playing on against all the odds,' one fan wrote. 'Every time I watch a Djokovic match that he's losing, or is tight, he calls on the on court doctor,' another added. Medical time outs to halt opponents momentum.' How many times does he do that?' Djokovic's use of 'miracle pills' also generated discussion from fans on social media. '"I think a lot of people would like to know what these doctors miracle pills are" is quite a line to Novak,' one fan wrote, referencing a question by the on court interviewer. 'Djokovic references “miracle pills from the doctor”, which generally happens when things aren't going his way. Staggering this has been accepted without question for so long,' another fan added. It is not the first time in his long career Djokovic has created debate, after previously claiming he had been drinking a 'magical potion' when asked by journalists in 2022. While some also queried Djokovic's description of 'miracle pills', others defended the Serbian by claiming it was merely a phrase to highlight how it had helped to ease his symptoms. 'He always calls that miracle pills in this case Novak was sick and those pills calmed his stomach pain fast that's why he called it miracle pills,' one fan wrote. The discussion took place while Muller had his own medical timeout due to an apparent calf issue. Djokovic's eventual four set victory saw the 38-year-old, who is targeting a record 25th Grand Slam title, set up a second round encounter with Britain's Dan Evans. Djokovic admitted post-match that Wimbledon represents his best chance of adding to his haul, with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner having established themselves as the leading duo in recent Grand Slams. 'I always felt like grass, particularly in the second part of my career, was really the surface where I played my best tennis.</p>

It was admittedly a tough draw for Gauff against the world No 42 from Ukraine, but one she will have still expected to navigate. "I think it's just changing my playing style a little bit, which is difficult," she said. In all across the opening two days of Wimbledon, a grand total of 23 seeds - 13 men and 10 women - are already out, tying the most at any Grand Slam tournament since they began seeding 32 players in each singles bracket in 2001. #3 Zverev #7 Musetti #8 Rune #9 Medvedev #16 Cerundolo #18 Humbert #20 Popyrin #24 Tsitsipas #27 Shapovalov #28 Bublik #30 Michelsen #31 Griekspor #32 Berrettini Novak Djokovic somewhat limped to a late-evening victory over Alexandre Muller on Centre Court to set up a second-round meeting with Great Britain's Dan Evans on Thursday. It would be special in England to play the greatest of all time." Elsewhere in the men's draw, world No 1 Jannik Sinner eased into the second round, needing just an hour and 48 minutes to dispose of his Italian compatriot Luca Nardi 6-4 6-3 6-0. American fifth seed Taylor Fritz defeated France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (8-10) 6-4 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 in a match suspended on Monday evening with the pair level at two sets each. Georgia's Nikoloz Basilashvili beat Italian seventh seed and last year's semi-finalist Lorenzo Musetti 6-2 4-6 7-5 6-1 Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Along with Gauff, two of the biggest seed casualties on Tuesday at Wimbledon were men's and women's world No 3s, Alexander Zverev and Jessica Pegula. Zverev and Arthur Rinderknech were locked at one set apiece on Monday when play was stopped but, after resuming on Centre Court the following afternoon, it was the Frenchman who ground out a 7-6 (7-3) 6-7 (8-10) 6-3 6-7 (7-5) 6-4 victory. It was Zverev's first opening-round defeat at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon in 2019 and leaves the 28-year-old still searching for a first major after 38 attempts. Pegula struggled to explain away her shock Wimbledon exit as she praised the "insane" performance of opponent Elisabetta Cocciaretto. Last year's US Open runner-up crashed out following a 6-2 6-3 defeat to the Italian world No 116 in just 58 minutes. Asked what went wrong, the 31-year-old American replied: "I don't know. Cocciaretto, who had only once before defeated a top-10 player, spectacularly turned the tables on Pegula, having suffered a 6-4 6-0 round-three loss to her at the All England Club in 2023. Defending women's singles champion Barbora Krejcikova was tested by promising 20-year-old Alexandra Eala, losing the first set before finding her form late in a 3-6 6-2 6-1 win. She's going to be really good in a couple of years." Five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek, seeded eighth, is yet to conquer Wimbledon but showed positive signs as she beat Polina Kudermetova 7-5 6-1, while Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva advanced after a 6-3 6-3 victory over Mayar Sherif. The women's draw is now without three of its top five seeds after No 5 Qinwen Zheng of China, the Olympic champion, suffered a third successive Wimbledon first-round defeat, beaten 7-5 4-6 6-1 by Czech doubles specialist Katerina Siniakova. It marked Kvitova's final appearance at Wimbledon before heading into retirement. Queen's champion Tatjana Maria, who reached the semi-finals in 2022, also made an early exit as she lost in three sets to American Katie Volynets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dayana Yastremska made headlines Tuesday by completing one of the biggest upsets at Wimbledon with her first-round victory in straight sets over No. But the unseeded Ukrainian tennis player isn't a complete unknown. But Tuesday's victory was by far the biggest of her career and is sure to add an extra buzz around Yastremska. Yastremska already has an interesting backstory due to her apparent allergy to grass — the same surface she's playing on at Wimbledon. Yastremska, who celebrated her 25th birthday in May, detailed her allergy after she reached the final at the Nottingham Open earlier this month, saying at the time that “I really love playing on grass, even though I think I have a bit of an allergy to grass!” She already had quite the following on social media with 217,000 followers on Instagram, where she's posted content around her tennis career and stylish shots from parties and modeling. “But I don't have much time for it.” And her talents extend beyond the court as Yastremska showed off her singing chops during the COVID-19 pandemic and released two singles during the summer of 2020 titled “Thousands of Me” and “Favourite Track.” Yastremska paused her musical ambitions in 2021 during a provisional doping ban following a positive test for a prohibited substance, but she was cleared six months later after an independent tribunal ruled that the positive result was due to contamination of the test sample. Yastremska will face Anastasia Zakharova in the second round of Wimbledon.</p>
