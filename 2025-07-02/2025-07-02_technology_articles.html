                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the second consecutive quarter, deployments of its Powerwall and Megapack stationary storage products have declined, according to stats released by Tesla. Tesla's energy storage division peaked in the fourth quarter of 2024, a three-month period that saw 11 gigawatt-hours deployed. Until this year, the sector has been a bright spot for Tesla, posting consistent year-over-year growth. By contrast, the broader market for energy storage has been growing recently. Analysts at Wood Mackenzie said new installations hit a record high in Q1, the most recent period for which data is available, growing by 57% year-over-year. Such growth is unlikely to continue, though, as tariffs on Chinese-made goods coincide with the ill-effects of a Trump-backed reconciliation bill currently being hashed out in Congress. There, Republicans have been working to eliminate key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act. While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim.

In that exact meeting, a dev flipped out and expressed exasperation that they weren't asked to comment on the proposal. I've routinely seen people attending a meeting from the office on Zoom camera, all gathered in a single big conference room, all looking and typing on their laptops for the entirety of the meeting, saying something maybe once or twice. I suppose they were simply working on their assigned tasks, listening to others in the background. I got written up for it, no joke. I've been using this mentality for the last three years. Some responds with hostility and some see the benefits, but most are just indifferent to it sadly.I've also been observing people just throw in a short sentence or some AI generated shit list which is then not followed during the meeting.But those who take this seriously usually have pretty darn good meetings (e.g not book the full hour, force people to stay on topic, shares notes after the meeting etc) I've also been observing people just throw in a short sentence or some AI generated shit list which is then not followed during the meeting.But those who take this seriously usually have pretty darn good meetings (e.g not book the full hour, force people to stay on topic, shares notes after the meeting etc) But those who take this seriously usually have pretty darn good meetings (e.g not book the full hour, force people to stay on topic, shares notes after the meeting etc) Then I'll have to either live with the decision or at least give feedback on it.Nothing is final until you build it (from a developer point of view).

I agree with all the criticism about poorly organized meetings, but I think the non prima Donna thing to do is push back on their existence or format, not just skip them. Social pressure is still a thing for some unfortunately. Or maybe memories from school creep in. I love this phrasing of the principle. Often attending meetings is seen as part of the job, either formally or in the managers' eyes, so ignoring them without good reason isn't allowed without repercussions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Major layoffs are rolling across Microsoft today, impacting game developers within Xbox across several studios and the projects they're working on, even as an executive at the company told staff more gamers are playing Xbox than ever before. The full scope of layoffs within Microsoft's gaming divisions are still unknown. “We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” Microsoft spokesperson Emily Pirt told WIRED. The company says that although gaming is impacted, it does not make up the majority of layoffs, and these cuts will affect people in different regions, tenure, and teams. In a message to staff seen by WIRED, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said Xbox is following “Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness … I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before.” Employees whose roles are being eliminated are being encouraged to apply for other positions across Microsoft gaming, “where their applications will be given priority review.” Spencer added that the company will “protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business.” Gaming teams across Microsoft are still learning how their roles will be affected, with some sources saying they have staff meetings scheduled later today. VGC reports that Rare's Everwild, an action-adventure game that's been in development for over a decade, has been canceled, as employees continue to be informed of layoffs across other studios such as ZeniMax and King. In February, during an interview with XboxEra, Spencer cited Everwild as a game release he was looking forward to. The outlet also reports layoffs of roughly 200 people at Candy Crush maker King and that layoffs are also taking place at Call of Duty developer Raven Software. Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft's lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today's notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days. I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A former SpaceX security manager, who was privy to top secret information on U.S. government programs, is suing the company and one of its senior employees for alleged discrimination, sexual harassment, and retaliation. Jenna Shumway, who was promoted to senior contractor program security officer after being hired in 2022, also alleges the senior employee — Daniel Collins, a former Defense Department official hired to run security compliance for the company's government work — violated top secret protocols and then concealed this information from the government. Collins made the news in December 2024 when The New York Times reported SpaceX was under federal review for sloppy security protocols. Collins discouraged reporting security clearance violations and allowed executives without proper clearances into classified meetings, according to the NYT. Collins' harassment extended to other female employees, too, the complaint alleges. The discrimination included preventing female staff from doing required security work, allegedly setting them up for noncompliance, staring at one employee's chest during a meeting, and asking a subordinate female employee if she wanted to “get s–tty together” over after-work drinks. Shumway and other female employees repeatedly reported Collins to SpaceX human resources, the lawsuit states. This is not the first time SpaceX has been sued over claims that it enables sexual discrimination. Previous lawsuits have alleged similar stories of bias against female employees and a hostile work environment that enabled gender-based harassment. The lawsuit was filed in late May in the Los Angeles County Superior Court; it was later moved to federal court on June 30 at SpaceX's request. It is filed in the federal Central District of California court under case number 2:22-cv-05959. Aria Alamalhodaei covers the space and defense industries at TechCrunch.

Using the European Space Agency's (ESA) Cheops mission, a team of astronomers from the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy gathered evidence for the first known exoplanet with an apparent death wish. Although astronomers have theorized about this type of interaction before, the flares recorded in this star system are around 100 times more energetic than expected, according to the study. The planet, named HIP 67522 b, is one of the wispiest exoplanets ever found, with density similar to candy floss. It takes just seven days to orbit its star, which is slightly larger and cooler than the Sun. “We hadn't seen any systems like HIP 67522 before,” Ekaterina Ilin, lead author of the study, said in a statement. “When the planet was found it was the youngest planet known to be orbiting its host star in less than 10 days.” To be sure of their findings, the team of astronomers wanted a closer look using ESA's sensitive CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). “With Cheops we saw more flares, taking the total count to 15, almost all coming in our direction as the planet transited in front of the star as seen from Earth,” Ilin said. Our own Sun releases solar flares, intense bursts of energy that explode from its atmosphere when a build-up of magnetic energy is suddenly released. Solar flares are sometimes directed toward Earth through no fault of our own. Since HIP 67522 b orbits so close to its star, it may be exerting its own magnetic influence on the host star. The planet may be gathering energy as it orbits, then redirecting that energy as waves along the star's magnetic field line. “The planet seems to be triggering particularly energetic flares,” Ilin said. In the next 100 million years, HIP 67522 b could go from a Jupiter-sized planet to a much smaller Neptune-sized planet, according to the study. “I have a million questions because this is a completely new phenomenon, so the details are still not clear,” Ilin said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the wake of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) announcing plans to revisit its recommended schedule for childhood vaccinations—a move that has drawn widespread criticism from experts—major insurers have not confirmed whether they'll continue to cover the full cost of routine shots for children. For 60 years ACIP has provided vaccine guidance to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including on the timing and dosage of childhood immunizations. On Wednesday, June 25, ACIP announced it would review the schedule, just weeks after health secretary and longtime anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. replaced the entire committee with his own appointees. When WIRED then asked 21 of the country's largest health insurance groups whether they would stop providing cost-free coverage of current routine immunizations in the event ACIP stops recommending them, only Blue Shield of California—a company in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association—confirmed it would continue coverage. The decision on whether to receive a vaccine is between our member and their provider.” Other large insurers, including UnitedHealthcare (which provides coverage for 50 million people), Cigna, Kaiser Permanente, Anthem, Humana, and Centene Corporation, did not respond to requests for comment. Most insurers that did respond said they were keeping an eye on developments in Washington, without indicating whether they would or would not cover vaccines dropped from the recommended schedule. “Vaccines play an important role in the prevention of more serious illnesses,” says Phil Blando, a spokesperson at CVS Health, which owns the insurer Aetna. Highmark Inc., part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, operating in Pennsylvania, Delaware, West Virginia, and New York, is also waiting to see what decision ACIP reaches. “We are closely monitoring the evolving vaccine discussions occurring in Washington, DC. Various vaccines and immunizations are covered under Highmark's member benefits, with any future coverage considerations to be evaluated as more information becomes available,” says spokesperson Aaron Billger. Bryan Campen, of Health Care Service Corporation—the licensee of Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas—notes that no changes have yet been made to the vaccines ACIP recommends or the company's vaccine coverage, but says that the company will “continue to monitor any activity that may impact preventive care recommendations and will communicate any changes to recommendations that may impact standard coverage of preventive services.” “As we navigate an evolving health care landscape, maintaining robust immunization coverage continues to be a top priority for protecting both individual and community health,” the industry's trade association, AHIP, said in a June 24 statement, the day before ACIP's announcement. ACIP made headlines in early June when RFK Jr. fired all 17 of its members and replaced them with eight new appointees. These new appointees include Retsef Levi, who has stated—in the face of scientific consensus—that mRNA vaccines are deadly, and Robert Malone, who routinely shares articles about supposed links between cancer and the Covid vaccine, which no credible research has found to exist. Neither Levi nor Malone replied to a request for comment. Michael A. Ross, another recently appointed committee member, resigned from ACIP during a review of his financial holdings, The New York Times reported on June 24. When introducing his new ACIP appointees in a post on X earlier in June, RFK Jr. had described Ross as a faculty member at George Washington and Virginia Commonwealth universities—but spokespeople for the universities told NBC News4 that Ross had not taught at either in years. “The number of vaccines that our children and adolescents receive today exceed what children in most other developed nations receive, and what most of us in this room received when we [were] children,” ACIP chair Martin Kulldorff said during the meeting. Today, children are exposed to fewer viral or bacterial proteins in the first few years of the vaccine schedule than those in earlier generations. When Offit's parents received the smallpox vaccine, they were exposed to 200 proteins in a single shot. During the meeting, Kulldorff repeated claims he made in 2024 that he was fired from Harvard because he refused to get the Covid vaccine; he and Malone have also each served as paid expert witnesses in two separate suits against Merck over the safety of the company's HPV vaccine and its mumps vaccine, respectively. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) did not send representatives to last week's ACIP meeting, as it typically does. According to Academy president Susan Kressly, this was because the AAP believes the vaccine recommendation process lost credibility when its original membership was gutted by Kennedy. “We won't lend our name or our expertise to a system that is being politicized at the expense of children's health,” Kressly said in a video posted online before the meeting was set to begin. A newer one, posted on the CDC site, has already changed recommendations. It no longer lists as “routine” Covid vaccines for children under 18 who are not immunocompromised but instead lists them under vaccines recommended for “shared clinical decision-making,” informed by “personal preference and circumstances.” The change should not affect insurance coverage.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A security vulnerability in a stealthy Android spyware operation called Catwatchful has exposed thousands of its customers, including its administrator. Spyware apps like Catwatchful are banned from the app stores and rely on being downloaded and planted by someone with physical access to a person's phone. As such, these apps are commonly referred to as “stalkerware” (or spouseware) for their propensity to facilitate non-consensual surveillance of spouses and romantic partners, which is illegal. Catwatchful is the latest example in a growing list of stalkerware operations that have been hacked, breached, or otherwise exposed the data they obtain, and is at least the fifth spyware operation this year to have experienced a data spill. According to a copy of the database from early June, which TechCrunch has seen, Catwatchful had email addresses and passwords on more than 62,000 customers and the phone data from 26,000 victims' devices. TechCrunch asked if he was aware of the Catwatchful data breach, and if he plans to disclose the incident to its customers. Without any clear indication that Charcov will disclose the incident, TechCrunch provided a copy of the Catwatchful database to data breach notification service Have I Been Pwned. A spokesperson for HostGator, Kristen Andrews, did not respond to requests for comment regarding the company hosting the spyware's operations. TechCrunch confirmed that Catwatchful uses Firebase by downloading and installing the Catwatchful spyware on a virtualized Android device, which allows us to run the spyware in an isolated sandbox without giving it any real-world data, like our location. Now, Google Play Protect will alert users when it detects the Catwatchful spyware or its installer on a user's phone. Asked whether the stalkerware operation violates Firebase's terms of service, Google told TechCrunch on June 25 that it was investigating but would not immediately commit to taking down the operation. “All apps using Firebase products must abide by our terms of service and policies. We are investigating this particular issue, and if we find that an app is in violation, appropriate action will be taken. Android users that attempt to install these apps are protected by Google Play Protect,” said Ed Fernandez, a spokesperson for Google. Like many spyware operations, Catwatchful does not publicly list its owner or disclose who runs the operation. It's not uncommon for stalkerware and spyware operators to hide their real identities, given the legal and reputational risks associated with facilitating illegal surveillance. Charcov's personal email address, found in the dataset, is the same email that he lists on his LinkedIn page, which has since been set to private. Charcov also configured his Catwatchful administrator's email address as the password recovery address on his personal email account in the event he gets locked out, which directly links Charcov to the Catwatchful operation. While Catwatchful claims it “cannot be uninstalled,” there are ways to detect and remove the app from an affected device. Before you start, it's important to have a safety plan in place, as disabling spyware can alert the person who planted it. Android users can detect Catwatchful, even if it is hidden from view, by dialing 543210 into your Android phone app's keypad and then hitting the call button. If Catwatchful is installed, the app should appear on your screen. This code can also be used by anyone to see if the app is installed. As for removing the app, TechCrunch has a general how-to guide for removing Android spyware that can help you identify and remove common types of phone stalkerware, and then enable the various settings you need to secure your Android device.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is planning to lay off 9,000 employees, impacting less than 4% of its global workforce, according to a report by CNBC. Microsoft continues to beat expectations in its quarterly earnings; in its most recent report, the company grew its net income by 18% year over year, amounting to a total of $25.8 billion. However, the company has continued to reduce its headcount — this is one of many rounds of layoffs to have already occurred this year. Microsoft has said that these cuts are an attempt to cut down on its layers of management, following the lead of competitors like Amazon and Meta.

The good folks at Amazon must be getting warmed up for the annual Prime Day blowout, or maybe somebody lit their 4th of July fireworks a little early, because for the second day in a row there is a truly insane Dell laptop deal that's just dropped out of nowhere. Now it's the Dell 15 Vostro 3530's turn in an even bigger deal taking a $2,400 price down to just $650. The Dell description of the Vostro 3530 laptop says it's aimed at small businesses and entrepreneurs, but when you look at the specifics and the features of this machine, it's hard to think of anyone who wouldn't want it as their everyday laptop for work, play, or general use. Start with the very most basic laptop needs — a fast processor and big-capacity storage. The Dell Vostro 3530 is powered by a 10-core 13th Gen Intel Core i5 processor that can hit speeds up to 4.66GHz, much more than enough for any streaming, surfing, or heavy-duty multitasking you ask of it. It has 32GB of RAM, which you can expand to 64GBm and the built-in storage is a huge 1TB SSD. The display on the Dell Vostro 3530 is a 15.6-inch full-HD beauty with 1920 x 1080 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and driven by an Intel iRIS Xe graphics card. The big 4th of July sales are already under way and Prime Day will be following fast on their heels, but we can't envision any huge event that will match the deals Amazon's been dropping on these powerhouse Dell laptops like the Vostro 3530. It's 73% off, which translates into a $1,750 price cut down to just $650. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

The PNY GeForce RTX 5070 OC 12GB $549 @Best Buy also still remains at an excellent price point. A selection of graphics cards across Nvidia's RTX 50-series have fallen to their MSRPs on Newegg, thanks to instant rebates in the form of gift cards. These Blackwell graphics cards, including higher-end versions of the RTX 5070, 5060, and 5060 Ti, are likely falling in price as online retailers gear up for Amazon's upcoming Prime Day 2025. PNY GeForce RTX 5070 OC 12GB: now $549 at Best Buy This is currently the best value RTX 5070 graphics card available for sale without any deal gimmicks. It's the OC version with a 2.2 GHz base clock and 2.5GHz boost. Nvidia's RTX 5070 can be had for as low as $549 after rebates from a number of different board partners, including Gigabyte, Asus, and MSI. This Fourth of July-linked promotion ensures that if customers purchase items with the price protection until July 6th, and the same model is discounted for cheaper as part of Independence Day sales, customers will be retroactively refunded the discount amount. GIGABYTE WindForce GeForce RTX 5070: $549.99 ($609.99 with $60 promotional gift card) at NeweggThe cheapest RTX 5070 today, if you take into account the Newegg $60 gift card. ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070: $609.99 on NeweggThe cheapest RTX 5070 with "FantasTech Price Protection" means you're safe from buyer's remorse in case of further 4th of July deals. The 16GB 5060 Ti, the most attractive card of this group, has fallen to $449 from Gigabyte and other board partners, taking it within $20 of its $429 MSRP. The 8GB models of the 5060 and 5060 Ti are staying steady at their MSRPs of $299 and $379, though these 8GB models have proven much less attractive to buyers in 2025. Newegg may be attempting to squeeze in early to snag some of Amazon's business during Prime Day, but the why of these deals matters much less than the fact that they are here, possibly getting GPUs into the hands of those who have been waiting for a price drop this severe. The RTX 5070 deals on Newegg have already started selling out, so those interested may need to act fast to not miss out on these hot buys. Be sure to keep your eyes on Tom's Hardware's deals coverage as Prime Day 2025 approaches, running this year from July 8-11. Even though Newegg is leading the charge currently in GPU discounts, there are still deals to be had at competing retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The company plans to introduce its Endpoint Security Controller-enabled service in 2026. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. One company's trash can be another company's treasure—or at least that's what HP is hoping to convince its customers with a new "PCFax" service that uses telemetry, support requests, and "AI" to generate reports about a laptop's history. And if your first thought was "gee, that sounds a lot like CarFax," you're on the same wavelength as the folks at HP who designed this service. "When buying a used car, dealerships and individual buyers can access each car's particular CarFax report, detailing the vehicle's usage and maintenance history," a quartet of HP employees said in a piece for IEEE Spectrum. And individuals can decide whether to trust that vehicle's performance. We at HP realized that, to prevent unnecessary e-waste, we need to collect and make available usage and maintenance data for each laptop, like a CarFax for used PCs." Some of the data used to generate these reports will be sourced from the Endpoint Security Controller built into some of HP's enterprise products to collect information from "thermal sensors that monitor CPU temperature, power-consumption monitors that track energy efficiency, storage health indicators that assess solid state drive (SSD) wear levels, performance counters that measure system utilization, fan-rotation-speed sensors that detect cooling efficiency, and more." A brief aside: HP introduced the Endpoint Security Controller in 2019. But I do find it somewhat telling that several pages of search results for "Endpoint Security Controller" are filled almost entirely with complaints on HP and Microsoft's support forums related to unexpected boot failures caused by an obscure issue with the controller itself, the host BIOS, or something else. HP said the PCFax reports would also include "information from HP's factory and supply-chain records, digital-services platforms, customer-support service records, [and] diagnostic logs" as well as "data from external sources including partner sales and service records, refurbishment partner databases, third-party component manufacturers like Intel, and other original equipment manufacturers." All of that data will then be combined to help prospective buyers tell if a given system is junk or not. (Presumably so those customers would then return to HP for more systems later.) That would require some amount of critical thinking, however, so HP also plans to pipe all this data into some kind of AI model that will "analyze historical telemetry data and predict failures before they happen, such as detecting increasing SSD write cycles to forecast impending failure and alert IT teams for proactive replacement, or predicting battery degradation and automatically generating a service ticket to ensure a replacement battery is ready before failure, minimizing downtime." Either way, there's no denying that companies are finally responding to the absurd amounts of e-waste their product cycles generate, whether that's by reclaiming minerals from used products, finding ways to safely recycle them, or designing them to be upgraded without requiring someone to throw out the proverbial baby with the contaminated bathwater. There's a chance PCFax (or something like it) will complement those efforts by convincing HP's customers that a three-year-old laptop doesn't need to be thrown away for no reason.

GPU sales data often highlights interesting patterns such as customer preference, supply availability, variance between regions, and much more. As such, new sales data from Mindfactory.de, spotted by TechPowerUp, tells us that customers are heavily favoring the 16GB variant of the RTX 5060 Ti over its 8GB counterpart. You can see the number of units sold on each of their listings, which includes GPUs from various AIBs and manufacturers. That chalks up to a 1600% difference across the board, all while both cards are in stock and keeping up with demand. So, there are no availability restraints enabling this purchasing behavior. With new releases getting more demanding and visual additives like ray tracing becoming commonplace, 16GB of VRAM has started to look more lucrative regardless of the cost. It performs better today and will sell more easily tomorrow in the second-hand market. GPUs with 8GB memory buffers often struggle with modern games these days, and our pursuit of photorealism in blockbuster titles will only worsen this over time. Features like Neural Texture Compression can help combat the increased VRAM usage, but it's up to the developers to implement these technologies, and even then, you can only fight physics so much. Interestingly, though, opposing sales data from TechEpiphany on X shows us that it's AMD topping the charts as of late. Moreover, a similar narrative clings to the red camp where AMD's 16GB cards are outselling their 8GB peers, only even more intensely.
