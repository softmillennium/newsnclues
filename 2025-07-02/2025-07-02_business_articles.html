                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is cutting more workers in another major round of layoffs at the company this year. The company said it is making cuts affecting less than 4% of its total workforce. Multiple employees confirmed to Business Insider that the layoffs have begun. The spokesperson said the company is focused on reducing layers with fewer managers and streamlining processes, products, procedures, and roles to become more efficient. A current employee told BI that cuts to the sales organization were expected after the company said it would consolidate sales "solutions areas." BI previously reported on the internal slides that detail those changes. The latest cuts come months after Microsoft in May announced layoffs affecting about 6,000 workers. Executives previously told BI that those layoffs were intended to reduce the number of middle managers and increase the ratio of coders to non-coders on projects as Microsoft aimed to grow its "span of control," or the number of employees who report to each manager. But those cuts also ended up including many individual-contributor-level engineers. A spokesperson told BI at the time that those cuts were not performance-driven. Many of its Big Tech peers are making similar cuts to flatten management levels and become leaner in the name of efficiency. Google recently cut vice president and manager roles by 10%. Amazon has been working on increasing the ratio of individual contributors to managers. Besides managers, Microsoft and Meta have also recently cracked down on workers they deemed "low performers."</p>

Microsoft:

Hundreds of people were laid off as the company canceled upcoming games such as Everwild

An Xbox games controller

Microsoft Corp.'s gaming division began cutting hundreds of employees on Wednesday, part of a broader culling at the software company as it seeks to control costs. 

Subsidiaries across the gaming organization were told that they would be affected by the layoffs. Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division, which makes Candy Crush, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs, according to people familiar with the plans. Other European offices, such as ZeniMax, also began cutting employees early Wednesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the press.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is leaning harder on its "Leadership Principles" to rate employee performance, as CEO Andy Jassy continues to create a more disciplined workforce at the tech company. Starting this quarter's mid-year review cycle, Amazon managers will use a three-tiered system to evaluate how effectively corporate employees demonstrate the company's core values in their work, according to an internal document obtained by Business Insider. Amazon relies on its 16 LPs, which stress things like customer focus and cost discipline, to guide nearly all business decisions. As part of this shift, Amazon is streamlining the rating scales for the other two evaluation criteria ("performance" and "potential"). Together with how employees use LPs, these factors determine an Overall Value (OV) score for each corporate employee, which influences future raises and whether they may be placed on a performance improvement plan. It added that only 5% of the employees will be eligible for the top "role model" grade when measuring their LP behavior. The move is part of a wider wave among tech giants to rethink how they manage performance and reward employees. Microsoft has a new 2-year rehire ban on ousted underperforming employees. Both Google and Meta have also made policy changes that better reward high performers this year. In the past year, Jassy has enforced a full return-to-office policy, reduced management layers, and updated its pay model to better reward top talent. Last year, he also shared a video series explaining each LP, and recently warned that AI will reduce Amazon's workforce because of efficiency gains. Amazon's spokesperson Sam Stephenson told BI that the company regularly reviews its performance review process to "ensure it best supports the growth and development of our employees." "Our unique culture, which is rooted in our Leadership Principles, drives the innovation we deliver for customers each day," Stephenson said. "These changes streamline the process for managers and help to ensure greater consistency." Amazon's performance review policy has long been controversial. Some employees have cited concerns over limited oversight and the potential for misuse, with one former employee describing the system as "predatory and opaque." Some people have also criticized Amazon's cutthroat "stack-ranking" culture, in which a fixed percentage of the workforce is replaced every year. Amazon seems to recognize the nuanced nature of performance evaluations. "Evaluating employees is a high-judgment decision," the guideline said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At U.S. department store chains including Macy's, Nordstrom, and Dillard's, the evidence of more sticker price inflation is starting to show up across more items. Recent price increases in apparel, footwear, and bags across major U.S. department-store websites tracked by DataWeave indicate a turning point in May, when prices started their ascent. DataWeave analyzes nearly 15,000 SKUs (stock keeping units), a scannable code retailers use to identify and track a product, and has been collecting that data from January to June for signs of price hikes in footwear, apparel, and bags. "Footwear is now as much as 4% above January levels at some banners, while apparel is roughly half that pace," said Karthik Bettadapura, co-founder & CEO of DataWeave. According to the data, Macy's 1589 SKUs of footwear reported a 4.2% increase in price, followed by Nordstrom (3.1%), and Dillard's (2%.) Type of product and its sourcing can influence how fast the price hikes arrive. Private-label lines, many of which are made in China, refresh every few months, so retailers like Macy's and Nordstrom feel higher landed costs sooner, according to Bettadapura. Footwear reacts fastest because it carries some of the steepest baseline duties and relies heavily on China for finished pairs. "Even a modest levy can ripple through quickly once fresh stock lands in distribution centers," Bettadapura said. Macy's, Nordstrom and Dillard's did not respond to requests for comment. The SKU data supports findings from a recent survey conducted by the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, where 55% of respondents said they expect their average retail price to rise between 6%-10% in 2025 as a result of tariffs. "With all back-to-school styles now facing tariffs of between 10-30 percent, higher prices should not be a surprise this summer," said Stephen Lamar, CEO of the American Apparel and Footwear Association. "While each company makes their own decisions, these tariff costs are now being felt across the board," he said. "If these tariffs persist or increase after July 9, we can expect more of the same in the seasons to come," Lamar said. Trump has been non-committal recently on sticking to the July 9 deadline his White House set for tariff deals with many trading partners or implement additional tariffs. The White House announced on Wednesday morning it has a trade deal with one key retail manufacturing partner, Vietnam. Apparel companies that rely on Vietnam's manufacturing capacity could face higher import costs under the new tariff rate. Nike, Lululemon, Patagonia, Puma, and H&M are among retail industry companies with manufacturing operations in Vietnam. "We'll be watching the back-to-school intake closely to gauge whether this pricing momentum accelerates or levels off," Bettadapura said. "Retailers have long warned that tariffs will impact pricing, and some consumers may be starting to see those reflected in key consumer products," said Jonathan Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation. "Tariffs continue to be a significant challenge for retailers, especially with the ongoing uncertainty and unknowns regarding the final tariff rates." He said retailers have tried to mitigate price increases, but the merchandise subject to the tariffs is working its way through the supply chain and is now being placed on store shelves. "Consumers, who are the final arbiter of tariffs, then come into play. Will they buy the item that has gone up in price, or will they switch to another item in the same category that has less (or no) tariff? Simon gave an example from the grocery aisle, saying if the price of bananas goes up because of a tariff, customers can decide to either buy them or exit the category and buy oranges from California or Florida instead. Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group, says inflation is underway, "and has been for the last few months," citing a recent rise in core import prices, ex food and energy, in April and May. "The only question is how this will now flow through the supply chain and who gets to eat it," Boockvar said. "[Fed Chair Jerome] Powell has made it clear that he is going to wait as long as possible until the tariffs fully work their way through the supply chain so he can see where they end up in terms of absorption."

Apple:

Foxconn Technology Group has asked hundreds of Chinese engineers and technicians to return home from its iPhone factories in India, dealing a blow to Apple Inc.'s manufacturing push in the South Asian country.

The bulk of Foxconn's Chinese staff at iPhone plants in southern India have been told to fly back in a move that began about two months ago, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named as the information is private. More than 300 Chinese workers have left, and mostly support staff from Taiwan remain in India, one of the people said.</p>

Crypto ETFs:

Blackrock iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) signage at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York.

At the world's biggest asset manager, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund now generates more revenue than its signature tracker of the S&P 500 Index.

The roughly $75 billion iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (ticker IBIT) has seen a torrent of cash from institutional and retail investors alike, drawing inflows in all but one of the last 18 months. With an expense ratio of 0.25%, the fund brings in an estimated $187.2 million in annual fees, based on back-of-the-envelope math calculated by Bloomberg as of July 1. That slightly edges out the $187.1 million made by BlackRock's iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), which is nearly nine times larger at around $624 billion in assets, and charges just 0.03%.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vietnam also agreed that goods would be hit with a 40% tariff rate if they originated in another country and were transferred to Vietnam for final shipment to the United States. The process, known as transshipping, is used to circumvent trade barriers. The agreement was unveiled less than a week before a 90-day pause on many of Trump's so-called reciprocal tariffs was set to expire, sending U.S. duties on imports from dozens of countries soaring. That rate was lowered to 10% during the 90-day interim. Raising the tariff on Vietnamese goods to 20% will hike costs for U.S. importers, which could be passed on to consumers or suppliers. "It is my Great Honor to announce that I have just made a Trade Deal with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam after speaking with To Lam, the Highly Respected General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam. It will be a Great Deal of Cooperation between our two Countries. The Terms are that Vietnam will pay the United States a 20% Tariff on any and all goods sent into our Territory, and a 40% Tariff on any Transshipping. In return, Vietnam will do something that they have never done before, give the United States of America TOTAL ACCESS to their Markets for Trade. In other words, they will "OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES," meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff. It is my opinion that the SUV or, as it is sometimes referred to, Large Engine Vehicle, which does so well in the United States, will be a wonderful addition to the various product lines within Vietnam. Dealing with General Secretary To Lam, which I did personally, was an absolute pleasure. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" It was unclear from Trump's post when the deal will take effect, or if it has been officially signed by both parties. Trump has signaled that he may ignore or revise the upcoming deadline for his reciprocal tariffs to snap back higher. The 90-day pause, which lowered tariffs on nearly all other countries to a blanket 10% rate, was imposed in early April to give countries breathing room while they negotiate deals with the U.S. Vietnam, whose exports to the U.S. reportedly comprised 30% of its gross domestic product last year, is especially vulnerable to Trump's tariffs. Critics of Trump's unpredictable tariff policies warn that the duties create economic uncertainty and will result in higher prices for U.S. consumers. The Trump administration and its defenders counter that tariffs do not cause inflation and note that the president's duties have brought in billions of dollars to the U.S. government. A pricing model created for CNBC this month by retail consulting group AlixPartners found that a 10% U.S. tariff on Vietnamese goods would cause the price of an imported men's sweater to rise by about 8%. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Tuesday that officials expect the impacts of Trump's tariffs will start to show up more during the summer months. Prices on certain items, including apparel and footwear, are already ticking higher as a result of the tariffs, CNBC has reported.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sean "Diddy" Combs was found guilty on Wednesday of prostitution-related offenses but cleared of more serious charges, in a blow to prosecutors who had urged a jury to find him guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. Combs was convicted of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking, a partial win for the former billionaire known for elevating hip-hop in American culture. After the judge dismissed the jury and lawyers for both sides, Combs knelt before his chair and appeared to pray. Combs then rose and faced the courtroom gallery. "I'm gonna be home soon," he said, smiling and clasping his hands. The verdict followed a criminal trial in which two of the music mogul's former girlfriends testified that he physically and sexually abused them. Combs faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence on each of the two prostitution counts. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian will determine Combs' sentence at a later date. After the jury read its verdict, defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo asked Subramanian to release Combs on bail, which prosecutors opposed. Subramanian asked lawyers for both sides to submit written arguments on whether he should release Combs by 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT). During his career, Combs' stage monikers included Love, Puff Daddy and P. Diddy. The trial focused on prosecutors' allegations that Combs for two decades used his business empire to force two of his romantic partners to take part in drug-fueled, days-long sexual performances sometimes known as "Freak Offs" with male sex workers in hotel rooms while Combs watched, masturbated and occasionally filmed. During the seven-week trial in Manhattan federal court, jurors saw some of the 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant authorities found during searches of his homes, which prosecutors said he would use in the performances. They also heard testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends, the rhythm and blues singer Casandra "Cassie" Ventura and a woman known in court by the pseudonym Jane, who said Combs beat them and pressured them to take part in the performances. Combs, 55, had pleaded not guilty to all five counts. His lawyers acknowledged that the Bad Boy Records founder, once famed for hosting lavish parties for the cultural elite in luxurious locales like the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez, was at times violent in his domestic relationships. But they said the sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual, and accused prosecutors of trying to criminalize Combs' private sex life. They argued that Ventura and Jane were strong, independent women who voluntarily took part in the sexual performances because they wanted to please Combs. Both women testified they spent time with Combs and took part in sexual performances after he beat them. Defense lawyers argued that Ventura and Jane were retrospectively accusing Combs of forcing their participation in the performances because they were jealous he was seeing other women. "If he was charged with domestic violence, we wouldn't all be here," Combs' defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in his closing argument on June 27. Those charges required prosecutors to prove that Combs paid the male escorts for sex, and arranged for their travel across state lines. "The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted," prosecutor Christy Slavik said in her closing argument on June 26. "He doesn't take no for an answer." At the trial, jurors saw surveillance footage from 2016 showing Combs kicking and dragging Ventura in the hallway of an InterContinental hotel in Los Angeles, where she said she was trying to leave a "Freak Off." Jane later testified that Combs in June 2024 attacked her and directed her to perform oral sex on a male entertainer, even though she told him she did not want to. That alleged attack took place a month after Combs apologized on social media for his 2016 attack of Ventura, footage of which had been broadcast on CNN. The defense argued Combs was a successful entrepreneur who used drugs recreationally, but kept his professional and personal lives separate. Combs, once feted for turning artists like Notorious B.I.G. and Usher into stars, settled with Ventura for $20 million. "Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution," Ventura's lawyer Douglas Wigdor said in a statement after the verdict.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the wake of high-profile layoffs, many workers are feeling anxious about job security. U.S. employers reported nearly 700,000 job cuts in the first five months of 2025, according to outplacement services firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, an 80% increase compared to job cuts in the first five months of 2024. It's little wonder, then, that 46% of Americans report feeling "concerned" about layoffs in the next year, according to a recent Indeed survey. According to executive coach and licensed social worker Melody Wilding, layoff anxiety can create a "vicious cycle" of overwork for employees. Concern for their jobs is "causing people to work much more, maybe in areas that are not productive, and burn out faster," she says. Layoff anxiety can make it difficult to stay focused, even on tasks you usually handle with ease, Wilding says. "It's always in the back of your head, so you're not really bringing your best to anything you're doing," she says. "There's just a hum of anxiety in the background." According to career and leadership coach Phoebe Gavin, constantly thinking or talking about your job is another red flag. According to Wilding, when people are on edge, they're more likely to be "reactive and maybe even defensive or snippy" with their co-workers, which creates an atmosphere of "tension and fear." For many of Gavin's clients, the hardest part of layoff anxiety is "feeling like you have absolutely no control over the situation." While anxiety may feel "paralyzing," coming up with a clear action plan can give you a greater sense of stability, she says. "When my clients are catastrophizing about this sort of thing, I always ask them, 'what would you do? If you have a good relationship with your supervisor, Gavin recommends having an honest conversation about the prospect of layoffs, as well as doing some industry research on your own time. Even if you do get laid off, Wilding says, "it usually isn't as catastrophic as we make it" in our minds. You may have to tighten your budget and put more energy into job searching, but being laid off doesn't mean that your career is over. Wilding suggests sprucing up your resume and reconnecting with your professional network so that you're ready to hit the job market if necessary. "It can give you a feeling of agency and control that should something bad happen, at least I'm ready to go," she says. Take Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course How to Buy Your First Home.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But every so often, there are small signs of rebirth, from a property owner cleaning up their lot, or workers repairing a home that was merely damaged. Occasionally, one can even see homes being rebuilt — the owner having navigated the complicated permitting process, and, crucially, having managed to obtain insurance. "The situation in insurance has actually been remarkably stable, considering everything that happened," said Scott Wilk, an independent insurance agent and owner of the Santa Clarita, California, branch of TWFG Insurance. The online marketplace Insurify projects California premiums will rise 21% this year, even in areas that are far from Los Angeles, in what experts had predicted would be a year of only modest increases in the state. "An event like that in California just has a really significant impact on how much we project premiums to go up," said Chase Gardner, data insights manager at Insurify. California's increase is not even the largest. Nor is the phenomenon limited to coastal states. Iowa and Minnesota are also looking at double-digit increases. "It's not just a story for areas like coastal Florida or the wildfire prone parts of California. It's really a much more national story," said Benjamin Keys, a professor of real estate and finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. "We're seeing states like Vermont with rising costs related to recent floods. We're seeing states like Colorado, which historically was a middle of the pack state when it came to the cost of insurance, seeing rapidly increasing insurance costs due to recent wildfires, and increased hail storms in many parts of the Midwest." Insurance premiums are regulated state by state, so in theory, a company can't use a disaster in one state to justify a rate increase in another. But in practice, experts say, there is a ripple effect as companies try to balance their risk by more aggressively seeking premium increases in some states, and by reducing their exposure in others by not renewing policies. "These insurance companies are national companies, and this could affect things like their overall book of business," Gardner said. The lowest average premium is in Vermont at $1,248, despite its recent increases. Even with this year's 21% increase, California's projected average premium of $2,930 is less than Insurify's national projected median premium of $3,520. That disparity among the states can be a factor in competitiveness. Companies deciding where to locate or expand frequently consider the cost of living for prospective employees. So, CNBC is using Insurify data on premiums and projected increases as components of the Cost of Living category in this year's America's Top States for Business study. "I think it's kind of really eating into the idea of homeownership being a really stable, cost-capped long term bet, especially if you live in a state like Florida or California, or even Texas." Wilk said that while the worst of the crisis in California may be over, there is more sticker shock to come. Sometimes it can take between 12 to 36 months," he said. But the company had sought a 30% increase, and it has already petitioned state regulators to approve the remaining 13%. Wilk said that there are still affordable options, relatively speaking, from smaller carriers in California, or from so-called "non-admitted" firms that can sell policies to California homeowners independent of the state regulators. "Early on in my career, pre-insurance crisis, if I had a customer's rate go up by five bucks a month, I could be hearing about it and hearing complaints about it," he said. "Now, people are just excited when their policy renews and it's still in force." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wall Street had prepared for disaster, with analysts on average expecting 389,400 vehicles delivered in the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The latest report follows a bruising first quarter for Tesla. The challenging quarter came after Tesla experienced its first year-over-year delivery decline in 2024 as the company grappled with an industry-wide EV slowdown, increasing competition, and backlash from some against Elon Musk's political actions. In the company's first quarter earnings call, CFO Vaibhav Taneja attributed lower delivery numbers to assembly line changeover for the refreshed Model Y and anti-Tesla hostility that had an impact in some markets. The refreshed Model Y — Tesla's best-selling vehicle — has since launched, fueling an increase in new vehicle sales in April for the automaker as other manufacturers saw a monthly decrease, according to Cox Automotive data. Although Musk stepped down from his political stint at the White House, the full extent of any brand damage to Tesla is not clear. The company's stock got a boost after Musk stepped away from his work with DOGE, though the Tesla CEO later ignited a highly public feud with Trump. Tesla's stock has seen volatile swings in recent weeks as the two trade insults. Data from Shanghai-based consultancy ThinkerCar indicated that Tesla's EV sales in China decreased 18% year-over-year between January and May as its rival BYD surged. The company did get some good news in its second-largest market on Wednesday. According to data from China's Passenger Car Association, the number of cars shipped from Tesla's Shanghai factory rose slightly in June compared to last year, halting an eight-month run of year-over-year sales declines. Tesla's EU market share dropped year over year from 1.6% to 0.9% in May, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. When previously asked about declining Tesla sales in Europe, Musk has said that Europe is not a key market for the EV maker and that demand remains strong in other regions. "Europe is our weakest market," Musk said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May. May data from Cox Automotive suggests that the US EV industry is also facing challenges. New EV sales are down 10.7% year over year despite a 4.2% uptick from the month prior, according to the data. Musk has said that Tesla's bet on solving full vehicle autonomy is key to the company's future growth.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Summer internships: where ambition and imposter syndrome so often collide. At KPMG, the tiny fraction of applicants who landed a coveted place on its program are now working to secure a full-time job post-graduation. For most interns, the two-month KPMG internship comes after more than 18 months of applications, networking, and building up their resumé. Just 2,200 of more than 42,000 applicants made the cut this year. "You are in a job interview for the whole internship," Wendy Lewis, managing partner of KPMG's Richmond, Virginia office, told BI at the company's purpose-built Lakehouse in Florida, where around 225 interns gathered in June for four days of inductions and training. Interns often have a misconception that they only need to be technically impressive, but soft skills are equally important, Lewis said. Leaders aren't expecting interns to conduct audits themselves, Lewis added — attitude makes them stand out. Jason LaRue, KPMG's national talent & culture lead, also emphasized the importance of attitude. LaRue told BI that an intern should be "a great learner." He said that requires transitioning from classroom learning to an environment where you learn on the job with colleagues. KPMG interns start that transition at the firm's Lakehouse, where they attend training sessions and can unwind with mini-golf and karaoke alongside partners and their peers, before returning to work in KPMG offices around the country. Becky Sproul, the talent and culture leader for KPMG's audit division, said interns should show curiosity, especially amid rapid change in the industry. The Big Four are restructuring as they try to recover from a recent slowdown in demand for consulting, while also trying to anticipate how AI will change the world of work and their business models. In that kind of environment, continuous learning and agility are important traits, she said. Rema Serafi, KPMG's vice chair of tax, said interns should show curiosity about the firm's business model and take advantage of its tech tools. Show that you're "interested in what we do as a business," she said. She said some Gen Zers now entering the workforce are already knowledgeable about generative AI and automation. "Ideas are welcome," Serafi said, adding that she wanted to know how interns thought KPMG could enhance its use of generative AI. BI spoke to two KPMG interns at the Lakehouse who said they were worried about impostor syndrome. "I've talked to interns about this too, not just at KPMG but also my friends interning at other companies, and impostor syndrome comes up a lot," said Andre Gaviola, a 21-year-old audit intern, adding it could feel intimidating to be around so many older, more experienced people. Evelyn Nunez-Alfaro, a 22-year-old tax intern, told BI that, though she loved stepping outside her comfort zone, she has wondered, "Am I really supposed to be here?" LaRue told BI he advised interns to find support figures in their workplace who can coach them through moments of imposter syndrome and sponsor them as they progress in their careers. Lewis told the interns to build up their self-confidence and realize that they can be themselves and still be successful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukraine's intelligence directorate (GUR) has released footage of Kyiv's UJ-26 "Bober" drone being launched via catapult to attack Russian air defenses. GUR said its special forces launched the drones to attack targets in Russian-occupied Crimea. The new launch method allows the fixed-wing Bober to enter combat without landing gear, which would likely improve its range or maneuverability. Traditionally, the Bobers take off from airstrips like traditional aircraft. Given that the ramp would likely have to be set up in Ukrainian-held territory west of the Dnieper River, the drone would have to travel a minimum of roughly 60 miles to reach Russian targets in Crimea. It uploaded several first-person view clips of drones approaching these systems with thermal cameras, though many of them can only be seen flying close to their target. Business Insider could not independently verify the damage caused. Ukrainian media regularly describe the Niobium-SV as a $100 million system. However, these may have since been fitted with more expensive upgrades. The propeller drone is meant for long-range attacks and is known to carry the KZ-6 charge, a 6.6-pound demolition explosive designed to break through concrete or armor. It's yet another example of how the war has increasingly featured cheaper systems being used to attack and, at times, destroy expensive high-end equipment, posing difficult questions for the traditional defense procurement model that heavily prioritized advanced technology. For example, one of Ukraine's biggest community drone funds, run by activist Serhii Sternenko, reported to donors that its crowdfunded drones have damaged at least 11 Buk surface-to-air missile systems in 2025. Depending on whether they have the latest upgrades, these defenses can cost Russia between $10 and $100 million each. By comparison, Sternenko's fund said it receives roughly $6 million in donations a month for its entire budget.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok and ByteDance employees are bracing for possible layoffs after the company informed staff it would announce "organizational and personnel changes" early Wednesday morning, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider. These changes come from "careful analysis of how to create more efficient operating models for the team's long-term growth," the company wrote. TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. TikTok's US e-commerce team has been under scrutiny from leadership at its parent company, ByteDance, this year. The division has faced new obstacles in 2025 after Trump hiked tariffs on China, where many of TikTok's global sellers are based. Weekly US order volume fell in mid-May compared to mid-April after tariffs went into effect, BI previously reported. The company has trimmed staff this year through a mix of layoffs and performance reviews, during which TikTok has offered some people a choice between performance-improvement plans or exits with severance. As US team members have left the company, leaders from China and Singapore with experience on TikTok's Chinese sister app, Douyin, have taken their place, staffers previously told BI. The organizational changes come amid broader uncertainty for TikTok's US team members. The company is negotiating with the Trump administration over a 2024 law that required ByteDance to divest from TikTok's US assets or face a potential ban. Trump has repeatedly delayed enforcement of the law through executive orders amid discussions.
