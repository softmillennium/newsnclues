                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A decision by Elon Musk's X social media platform to enlist artificial intelligence chatbots to draft factchecks risks increasing the promotion of “lies and conspiracy theories”, a former UK technology minister has warned. Keith Coleman, the vice-president of product at X, said humans would review AI-generated notes and the note would appear only if people with a variety of viewpoints found it useful. It is the latest pushback against human factcheckers by US tech firms. Last month Google said user-created factchecks, including by professional factchecking organisations, would be deprioritised in its search results. It said such checks were “no longer providing significant additional value for users”. In January, Meta announced it was getting rid of human factcheckers in the US and would adopt its own community notes system on Instagram, Facebook and Threads. X's research paper outlining its new factchecking system criticised professional factchecking as often slow and limited in scale and said it “lacks trust by large sections of the public”. AI would draft “a neutral well-evidenced summary”, the research paper said. AI chatbots often struggle with nuance and context, but are good at confidently providing answers that sound persuasive even when untrue. That could be a dangerous combination if not effectively addressed by the platform.” Researchers have found that people perceive human-authored community notes as significantly more trustworthy than simple misinformation flags. An analysis of several hundred misleading posts on X in the run-up to last year's presidential election found that in three-quarters of cases, accurate community notes were not being displayed, indicating they were not being upvoted by users. These misleading posts, including claims that Democrats were importing illegal voters and the 2020 presidential election was stolen, amassed more than 2bn views, according to the Center for Countering Digital Hate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The viral 2019 Facebook event is revisited in 'Trainwreck: Storm Area 51', premiering July 29 on Netflix On June 27, 2019, 21-year-old Matty Roberts created a satirical Facebook event titled "Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us." Intended as a joke, the post invited users to band together and raid Area 51 — a highly classified United States Air Force facility in Nevada — to uncover extraterrestrial life, long rumored to be hidden there. “I had no idea what I'd started,” Roberts, now 26, says in the trailer for Trainwreck: Storm Area 51, which will premiere on July 29 as part of Netflix's six-episode Trainwreck documentary series. “It just seemed like a hilarious idea to me.” To coincide with the event, organizers planned a music festival — Alienstock — in Rachel, Nev., the tiny town nearest to Area 51. As the date approached, law enforcement prepared for a potentially dangerous situation. The trailer includes ominous government warnings: “Anyone breaching Area 51 will be shot.” One official remarks, “It'd gotten out of hand, and it had gotten out of hand in a hurry.” As the event gained momentum, Roberts grew concerned. “This whole time I'm sitting here with less than a thousand dollars in my bank account,” he says, alongside videos of him being interviewed on television. “We are going to dress as sexy aliens,” a woman says in the trailer.</p>

To these people, something profound has happened to them, but can we really say it is the result of extraterrestrials, or is something else going on? For years, Steven Kilburn had felt uneasy when driving a particular stretch of road between Pikesville, Baltimore, and Frederick, Maryland. It was an uncanny feeling, not based in any solid memory; just an overwhelming sense of wrongness, like he was being watched. Whatever was going on, Steven was sure of one thing: “Every time I passed that approximate area, I felt for some reason something right there had happened.” This sense of unease persisted for years until May 1978, when Steven was introduced to Dr Girard Franklin, a psychologist who was training in hypnosis at the time. Curious to know whether Steven's strange feelings were in fact the result of some sort of suppressed memory, Dr Franklin subjected him to hypnosis, which was increasingly used by people to access details their minds had supposedly “repressed”. At first, the details of his drive home seemed normal, but suddenly, Steven paused, becoming hesitant. According to the events he was reliving, his car had inexplicably stopped working and he was forced to get out and investigate it on that lonely stretch of road. Over the course of the next hour and a half, Steven relayed an incredible account of how, on that night years ago, he had been abducted by some unknown entities he described as being near human size, but with white skin and no hair on their heads. This account was recorded in Budd Hopkins' 1981 bestselling book Missing Time, which detailed various first-hand experiences from people who believed they had been abducted by aliens with no or little memory of their ordeals. So many people came forward, each with memories that appeared to have been wiped by alien influence, that Hopkins became convinced there was effectively a secret abduction plague going on. “An inescapable conclusion to be drawn from all these cases is that anyone could have been abducted, with no memory of it, no conscious recall even of a preliminary event like the sighting of a UFO.” Unbeknownst to Hopkins, as well as many other unidentified flying object (UFO) researchers at the time, this collective work came to show how many so-called alien abduction stories were in fact the result of created memories produced by the hypnotist/subject interaction. Or, to put it differently, rather than revealing the extent to which aliens were nabbing everyday people, Hopkins' work revealed how flexible memory can be and how false ones can be constructed. Given the above account, you may be thinking one of three things. Firstly, that these people are mentally unwell and delusional. Or thirdly, that it all must be true, and therefore aliens are routinely abducting people. Of course, the final possibility is a little hard to support as doing so would also require substantial evidence in other scientific fields related to physics, biology, and so on. There is also no doubt that many people who claim to have encountered aliens, seen UFOs, or even been abducted have deliberately lied, either for attention, boredom, or sheer mischief. But what about those accounts made by people who are completely sincere and, more importantly, do not exhibit signs of any other psychological issues that might produce hallucinations or delusions? Anyone who reads Missing Time or abduction claims made since the 1980s will be struck by how earnest many speakers are. In fact, I have received incredibly frank emails from IFLScience readers who wish to state plainly how they are not looking for attention or notoriety, but they are convinced that they have been abducted, and it was real. One individual even told me he had not believed in aliens or UFOs until his own experience. It's hard not to take someone at their word when they come across so earnest. This is something that struck Hopkins and many other avid alien encounter investigators over the years; people who underwent hypnosis to retrieve “lost” memories not only believed they were genuine encounters but were deeply traumatized by them. The whole phenomenon baffled Hopkins to such an extent that he became convinced he had stumbled on some sort of secret untold reality whereby countless unknowing people had no conscious memory of being abducted by aliens he believed were ultimately non-malevolent but nevertheless terrifying. In some cases, women who had supposedly become pregnant after an abduction – despite having no memory of the event or having had sex with anyone since then – would suddenly find they were no longer pregnant. Such strangeness was explained away as the person having been impregnated by an alien and then re-abducted before their due date, all so the visitors from outer space could collect their hybrid infants. It was this genuine sincerity that helped Hopkins' work become so popular. In fact, his approach even convinced Professor John E. Mack, who, during the early 1990s, was a Pulitzer Prize winner and eminent head of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. This led Mack to publish his own lengthy book on the subject of alien abduction accounts retrieved by hypnosis, which the author utterly believed were real. For Mack, alien abductions were even positive things, ultimately leading to spiritual enlightenment, and were akin to religious experiences scattered throughout history. Anyone who's been reading to this point has likely noticed a repeated part of these stories – hypnotic regression. This tricky, sneaky technique is now largely recognized as highly controversial at best, or otherwise completely untrustworthy by mainstream scientific communities. In short, under the influence of “memory recovery” techniques like hypnosis, some people became convinced they had been abused as children but had subsequently suppressed the memory. That is, until the hypnosis allowed them to “re-” discover them, often resulting in trauma and significant upset for the individuals and their families. In some cases, the recovered memories involved satanic rituals, cannibalism, and human sacrifice. And, as you can now probably guess, many such claims turned out to be the result of the hypnosis that assisted in creating and structuring these terrifying but untrue memories. To be clear, these were not lies; many people who had their memories “recovered”, like their alien-abduction counterparts, believed they were real. Aside from these perspectives, there are other psychological factors that can lead some people to believe they've experienced an alien encounter more than others. Past research has demonstrated that people who measure higher for fantasy-proneness (a tendency to engage in vivid and elaborate mental worlds inside your own head), dissociativity (one's susceptibility to a sense of separation from the world around them), and absorption (the trait of becoming lost in an activity), all correlate with paranormal beliefs, experiences, and even false memories. For more detail on this, especially in relation to alien abduction claims, I would thoroughly recommend reading anomalistic psychologist Chris French's new book: The Science of Weird Shit. They're modern myths in the making,” he told IFLScience. Bartholomew, a medical sociologist and Honorary Senior Lecturer at the University of Auckland's Department of Psychological Medicine, is not alone in linking modern alien encounters with folklore traditions. For example, in 1989, the folklorist Thomas E. Bullard wrote that “UFOs defy physical laws by making right-angle turns at high speed or disappearing in mid-flight. Short beings reminiscent of fairies appear from inside the craft. Men in Black haunt witnesses and share significant properties of traditional devils.” Bullard went on to note that “for all the science fiction trappings, abduction reports sound like rewrites of older supernatural encounter traditions with aliens serving the functional roles of divine beings or nature spirits.” The person may experience lost time, which is also a phenomenon present in many folklore traditions when someone stumbles back into the real world several days later, believing they had only been gone a few hours. In many instances, the entities are ambiguous creatures, sometimes cold and distant, while other times providing wisdom or a warning. In many cases, these encounters serve as personal ordeals, causing some sort of transformation for the abductee (such as offering spiritual enlightenment or literally allowing them to develop psychic powers). These are just a few examples of crossovers between folk traditions and modern abduction stories. To be sure, the literature on this topic is rich. Instead, it is likely that such narratives speak to a deeper part of human consciousness and experience, especially in today's secular society. In addition, he added, they offer people a chance to be part of something bigger. We want to think that there's something greater than us.” They serve as a kind of folkloric bridge between the secular modern world and old psychological or cultural needs for something more. In fact, ideas about aliens within wider alien-believer communities has reached a point where they have essentially become vehicles for, as Bartholomew explained, “transcendence” in a similar way to some religions. The same is true for stories about ghosts because, as Bartholomew said, “if ghosts are real, then they offer proof of life after death”. They offer a sliver of hope that there is something beyond our everyday mortal experience. To put it another way, if someone local, say a farmer who lives down the road, claims to see Big Foot, even though science says Big Foot is not real, then they have secret knowledge that limits the knowing gaze of science more generally. This opens up the possibility for more things “science” does not know, meaning it ultimately has less power. In this sense, some people arm themselves with these types of beliefs not just because they enrich their world and themselves with something meaningful, but because they also undermine the established order. In many ways, the near-contemporaneous Satanic Panic of the 1980s and early 1990s serves the same purpose: it represented an example of mass hysteria that reacted to perceived societal changes related to family structures and shifting values concerning sexuality, feminism, and secular education in America. As such, it is probably not worth looking to the sky for evidence of extraterrestrial beings, but rather within our minds, and at, as Bartholomew explained, “what deep-seated psychological needs are being fulfilled?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ever since we have known what to look for, it has been clear that Connecticut gets better than its fair share of visitors from strange planets. The National UFO Reporting Center takes thousands of reports a year from people who can't explain what they're seeing, whether a bright light, a peculiarly shaped object, or an aircraft that rapidly accelerates and decelerates just as quickly, seemingly exceeding current understanding of propulsion. This year alone, 13 reports have been made about unusual sightings in the skies over Connecticut. Just last week in Hamden, a skywatcher reported "at least 6 craft" bathed in the "whitest light … changing directions and formations/colors flashing at times." The sky show lasted for 25 minutes, ending just after 4 a.m. Two weeks ago, a couple driving northward just past the National Guard Armory "looked up and saw what I would describe as a large automobile front-end. It had red and blue lights where the headlights would be and spanning between them was an array of 4 to 6 very bright white lights. The red and blue lights were not pulsating … It was so big, I compare it to standing a few feet away from the front of a semi-truck's cab." Shortly after 9 p.m. on May 1, Trumbull residents caught on video "something flying towards us that wasn't normal" in their backyard.

In January, a Norwalk resident of 57 years extended an open invitation to like-minded skywatchers to visit Couch Street any evening and see the alien parade for themselves: Another concerned citizen reported to NUFORC in January that they had "been seeing star like flying things" every clear night for a month, over a pond in the middle of some woods in Killingly. On June 24, 1947, civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, when he saw nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at about 10,000 feet at about a nearly impossible speed for the times of 1,200 to 1,700 mph. It wasn't the first sighting of a UFO, but the public quickly became fascinated — and slightly terrified — after Arnold's sighting was reported worldwide. The Roswell Army Air Field announced in a July 8, 1947, news release that it had recovered the wreckage of a “flying disc” from W.W. “Mac” Brazel's ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell. “The flying object landed on a ranch near Roswell sometime last week. It was inspected at the Roswell Army Air Field and subsequently loaned by Major Marcel to higher headquarters.” The Roswell Army Air Field mentioned nothing in its press release about alien life, but people were already growing uneasy about what might be circling overhead. The story was widely accepted, and the Roswell incident might have become a forgotten chapter in history if not for a 1978 conversation between physicist and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman and Marcel, by then retired, according to an account in BBC's Sky At Night Magazine. The story was corroborated by a number of other retired military personnel who had been at Roswell at the time. Some skeptics dismissed it as a tall tale, saying Marcel and others were seeking attention or writing themselves into the story. Regardless, Roswell became embedded in pop culture books, documentaries and movies. One story that captured the attention of conspiracy theorists was that the wreckage had been seized by the military to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial flight at Area 51 — a highly classified Air Force military installation in the Nevada desert primarily known for its role in developing and testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The world is such that strolling through a park, lingering outside a theatre, or hanging out at Marine Drive comes with a subtle fear, not out of anxiety, but out of the nagging worry that someone might appear with a microphone, asking you questions. We have multiple YouTube channels and Instagram pages that thrive on this street-style content, interacting with and receiving reactions from people of all walks of life. The content style is so addictive that even our regular friends' meetup sees someone whipping out an imaginary mic and channelling their inner walkspop host! While we have come to terms with strangers putting us on the spot, can you imagine an alien trying to do the same? As a generation that has grown up watching an alien like Jaddoo dancing and E.T. phone home, the idea of them living among us isn't just sci-fi but prime social media material. Thanks to AI and a generous dose of internet imagination, we can see these outworldly beings in our very regular, fun settings, with social media content being one of them. One such gem is the Instagram page ‘Alien Interviews' which shows us a very fictional world where we are co-existing with Aliens, with some taking content creation as a full-time job. Be it as random as 'if humans will date aliens' or 'one habit they learned from humans on Earth', we see the extraterrestrial host asking Earthlings chaotic questions, fitting perfectly with the society, one Reel at a time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>THE first ever bombshell footage of the infamous "Mosul orb" UFO captured by a US spy plane in Iraq has now been released. The declassified video, filmed in 2016 by a US MC-12 surveillance aircraft, shows a mysterious metallic spherical object flying over the city of Mosul. The clip was obtained by Dustin Slaughter, a leading UFO investigator, through a Freedom of Information (FOI) request - and was shown to the public by UFO podcaster Jeremy Corbell. Corbell said at the time: "For the first time, we are releasing a military filmed image of a UAP over an active conflict zone,” he said. “Origin, capability, operator and intent have not been determined in relation to this intelligently controlled UFO over Mosul, Iraq. Meanwhile, another declassified UFO footage showed a similar mystery metal orb soaring above the ground - leaving US officials puzzled. The footage showed a mystery "metal orb" as it hovered and flew across open airspace. Corbell has been behind a string of high-profile leaks featuring encounters between UFOs and the US military one which was played at a landmark hearing held by Congress. FOR decades, UFOs and aliens were considered to be make belief things created by people in tinfoil hats but they are now considered a threat to national security. The 2010s saw decades of stigmas around extraterrestrial life start to break down as politicians made UFO sightings a matter of national security. Across the world, governments have also unveiled some spooky truths with some even showcasing "dead alien corpses" on display for Congress. A line-up of doctors confirmed at Mexico's Congress on Tuesday that the bodies, purportedly not of this Earth, were in fact real, once-living organisms. The Pentagon also released a blockbuster 1,574 pages of real-life X-Files in 2022, related to its secretive UFO programme. The haul includes reports into research on the biological effects of UFO sightings on humans, sets out categorisations for paranormal experiences, and studies into sci-fi-style tech. Top UFO chief Sean Kirkpatrick told the world last year that he is set to step down from his job following his stern warning of concerning activity "in our backyard." He urged the Pentagon's All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office to dedicate resources to “this enduring mystery on behalf of the American and global public”. Corbell had previously directed 2018 documentary film Bob Lazar: Area 51 and the Flying Saucers. It tells the story of Lazar, who claims to be a former US government physicist who worked with tech from UFOs. It comes after a picture claiming to show a 1,000ft wide silver UFO flying over the US was released by an infamous Pentagon whistleblower. The picture was allegedly snapped by an airline pilot in 2021 while flying 21,000ft above the Four Corners Monument - spanning New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado. The UAP Disclosure Fund shared the image on X, and wrote: “Captured near Four Corners at FL20 — estimated 600 – 1,000 ft in diameter, silver-hued, disc-shaped.” “It's time for full declassification and open scientific analysis.” But sceptics were quick to challenge the discovery - claiming the photo merely showed irrigation circles that are common in desert climates.</p>

Edward J. Zakrzewski, II, is set to die July 31 in the ninth execution scheduled for this year in the state. He pleaded guilty in 1996 to three counts of first-degree murder and received three death sentences in the killings of wife Sylvia Zakrzewski, son Edward Zakrzewski, 7, and Anna Zakrzewski, 5. He eventually turned himself into law enforcement after the case was profiled on the television show “Unsolved Mysteries,” according to court documents. Another man on death row, Michael Bernard Bell, 54, is set to die by lethal injection July 15 at Florida State Prison. He's convicted of killing two people outside a bar. Thomas Lee Gudinas, 51, who was convicted of raping and killing a woman in Florida, was executed following a lethal injection at the same prison last week. The state also executed six people in 2023 but only carried out one execution last year. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural season 15 brought the long-running CW series to a somewhat divisive end; while some viewers appreciated the larger story beats, others felt they could've been executed more seamlessly. But overall, there are enough highlights in its 15 seasons that this stance doesn't hold up. And in a way, Supernatural's true ending resembles that of season 5's "Swan Song." The penultimate episode of Supernatural, "Inherit the Earth," also features a high-stakes confrontation on par with Sam and Dean's stand-off with Lucifer. However, it's the Winchesters' fates at the end of Supernatural season 15 that are most notable, as they're reminiscent of their circumstances after "Swan Song." The only difference is that "Carry On" reverses their roles, and it does so in a way that feels more in line with their stories. Supernatural is still immensely popular, years after its ending, and Jensen Ackles had the perfect response to a potential revival of The CW show. This doesn't last very long, as Supernatural season 6 sees Sam returning to the world of the living and Dean resuming his usual lifestyle. And season 15 turns their original endings on their heads, with Dean losing his life on the job and Sam giving up hunting for good. Although many find "Swan Song" more satisfying, "Carry On" makes the right call by reversing its outcome. There's been some debate about how this outcome was handled, but it does make more sense given the brothers' previous character arcs. Although many find "Swan Song" more satisfying, "Carry On" makes the right call by flipping its outcome. Supernatural opens with Sam Winchester getting pulled back into hunting, despite his desire to lead an ordinary life, so season 15's finale feels like the natural conclusion to his journey. It's only his father's disappearance and Jessica's death that get him wrapped up in the family business again. Meanwhile, Dean is the type of character that will always get drawn back to hunting, as it's been his purpose since childhood. He's a fighter through and through, and it makes sense that he'd go out that way in the series finale. Although Supernatural season 15's ending is the logical conclusion for both of the Winchester brothers, I do wish that Dean's send-off was a little bit stronger. Dean doesn't perish during some high-stakes, world-altering confrontation. This is one of the reasons Supernatural's series finale has gotten so much backlash. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. And it speaks to the fact that since God wasn't wasn't writing their story and pulling their strings that all the randomness of life, whether it was good, bad or ugly, would define their future lives just like everyone else. No, the show should have ended 10 seasons after Crowley was introduced. Thing and when the 10 years was up, it's time to go. That season finale should have cut to black at the end. And you should have heard hellhounds howling as it fades out. Deans death was always going to happen but I think what disappointed me most was the way Dean died, I was late to supernatural so read online what happened so I've never watched that episode and never will. Why can't it be a long running show? Supernatural season 16 is discussed by cast and crew a whole lot with no sign of starting, and Jensen Ackles has revealed why that may be. In a recent appearance on Amy Poehler's podcast, Idris Elba opened up about the iconic Stringer Bell scene from The Wire that he wasn't sure about. After The Wheel of Time's surprise cancellation, this news about one of Prime Video's most anticipated fantasy adaptations is even more disappointing. Mark Hamill's Joker casting was so groundbreaking that not even his fellow actors believed he was voicing the villain in Batman: The Animated Series. Although this Fourth Wing character may appear cruel at first, Iron Flame and Onyx Storm reveal she was right to push Violet outside her comfort zone. Although I'm excited for The Lincoln Lawyer season 4, which isn't here yet, I'm already eager for Netflix to adapt Michael Connelly's new book.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Like almost every MCU movie and TV show, there is a post-credits scene, but figuring out what it means for the future is easier said than done. After having his Hood taken from him by Riri Williams, Parker Robbins heads to the store run by Zelma Stanton's mom and seeks out the teenager's help. Well, some "supreme" help that he hopes she can assist him in tracking down (earlier in the series, Zelma mentions that she trained at Kamar-Taj for a time, so he's likely hoping to be connected with the Sorcerer Supreme, Wong). Riri Williams may have even factored into the show, but as things stand, this is a pretty confusing stinger that only really confirms there are plans for Parker and Zelma's stories to continue...somewhere. Midnight Sons, Blade, and perhaps even a Ghost Rider movie are thought to be in production, but the likelihood of the stories of these streaming characters continuing in any of those movies surely can't be any better than 50/50. Set after the events of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, Marvel Television's Ironheart pits technology against magic when Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne) - a young, genius inventor determined to make her mark on the world - returns to her hometown of Chicago. Her unique take on building iron suits is brilliant, but in pursuit of her ambitions, she finds herself wrapped up with the mysterious yet charming Parker Robbins aka "The Hood" (Anthony Ramos). The series also stars Lyric Ross, Alden Ehrenreich, Regan Aliyah, Manny Montana, Matthew Elam and Anji White. "Ironheart soars when Dominique Thorne, Anthony Ramos, Alden Ehrenreich, and Lyric Ross are on screen," we wrote in our 3* review, "but a by-the-numbers story means the series falls short of reaching the same heights as Iron Man.
