A federal judge on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump's executive order that sought to prevent migrants crossing the border from seeking asylum or applying for withholding of removal in the U.S., a major blow to Trump as he looks to further enforce his broad immigration crackdown. U.S. District Judge Randolph Daniel Moss, an Obama appointee, said Wednesday that Trump's Jan. 20 proclamation, which sought to block all migrants "engaged in the invasion across the southern border" from claiming asylum or seeking withholding of removal, exceeds his authority — siding with a group of 13 asylum-seekers and immigrants rights groups who sued over the proclamation earlier this year. The group urged the court in February to block Trump's proclamation from taking force, arguing that the action was "as unlawful as it is unprecedented." Trump, he said in his order, "lacks the inherent constitutional authority" to supplant federal statutes governing removals. President Donald Trump holds up an executive order after signing it during an indoor inauguration parade at Capital One Arena on Jan. 20, 2025 in Washington, DC. "To hold otherwise would render much, if not most, of the INA simply optional," the judge said. Moss stayed the order for a 14-day period to allow the Trump administration to seek emergency relief and appeal the case to a higher court. The judge also granted plaintiffs' request to certify a class of migrants who would were either subject to the proclamation or would be in the future, which he said would not be affected by last week's Supreme Court ruling in Trump v. Casa, which limited the scope of injunctive relief courts can provide. The decision was blasted by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who described Moss as a "marxist" judge in a post on X. "To try to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling on nationwide injunctions a marxist judge has declared that all potential FUTURE illegal aliens on foreign soil (eg a large portion of planet earth) are part of a protected global "class" entitled to admission into the United States," Miller said. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller speaks during a press briefing at the White House, Thursday, May 1, 2025, in Washington. The news comes as Trump has sought to prioritize hard-line immigration policies in his second presidential term. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments earlier this year over another order Trump signed, which seeks to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. The administration has also cracked down on deportations, invoking a 1798 wartime immigration law to more quickly send hundreds of migrants to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador earlier this year.

It also crystallized the impact of the state's Supreme Court election earlier this year that raked in millions of dollars in donations, the highest amount in U.S. history for a judicial race. It included involvement from then-Trump ally Elon Musk, former President Barack Obama and others. "We conclude that comprehensive legislation enacted over the last 50 years regulating in detail the 'who, what, where, when, and how' of abortion so thoroughly covers the entire subject of abortion that it was meant as a substitute for the 19th century near-total ban on abortion," Dallet wrote. "Accordingly, we hold that the legislature impliedly repealed [the 1849 ban] to abortion, and that [that law] therefore does not ban abortion in the State of Wisconsin." Conservative Justice Annette Ziegler, in a dissent, described the ruling as "a jaw-dropping exercise of judicial will" and charged that the liberal justices ruled on the matter based on their personal preferences. The 1849 law, and efforts to revive it, came to the fore in Wisconsin in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade — effectively snapping back into place the state law that had been dormant for decades. Demonstrators protest outside an event hosted by Circuit Court Judge Brad Schimel, candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court, March 25, 2025, in Jefferson, Wis. (Getty Images) The Wisconsin law made it a felony for individuals in Wisconsin to perform abortions, including when the health of the woman was at risk, and without exceptions in cases of rape or incest. Though the law was not enforced by the state in recent years, at least some Republicans had urged the state Supreme Court to keep it in place, prompting opponents to push more urgently for it to be struck down. The closely watched state Supreme Court race in Wisconsin was the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, attracting more than $100 million in donations and far eclipsing the $56 million spent on the state Supreme Court race just two years earlier, according to figures compiled by the Brennan Center for Justice. Susan Crawford ultimately beat out conservative candidate Brad Schimel, who was backed by President Donald Trump and Musk. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc., wears a cheesehead hat during an America PAC town hall ahead of the Wisconsin Supreme Court election at the KI Convention Center in Green Bay, Wis., March 30, 2025. Musk personally donated $3 million to the Wisconsin Republican Party earlier this year, while his two super PACs spent more than $17 million on Schimel's behalf. Tony Evers praised the state Supreme Court decision Wednesday, describing it as a win "for women and families" and healthcare professionals in the state. "Three years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court upended five decades of precedent and threw reproductive freedom in Wisconsin and across our country into chaos," Evers said in a statement. "I promised then to fight like hell to ensure every Wisconsinite has the freedom to consult their family, their faith and their doctor and make the reproductive healthcare decision that is right for them, and I've never stopped. "Today, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld that basic freedom."

The Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court for legal permission to fire three Democratic-appointed members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission after the move was blocked by a lower court.

U.S. District Judge Matthew Maddox previously ruled that Trump's termination of Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr. was unlawful. He argued that the firings went against the provision that a president could only fire commissioners for neglect of duty or malfeasance. Solicitor General D. John Sauer is now taking the matter to the nation's highest court.

In the filing, Maddox alleged that the three members immediately worked to sabotage the work of the CPSC, and were effective in doing so due to their making up a majority on the five-member board. He also pointed out that they were undermining the work of the CPSC's acting chairman, to whom “Congress has vested the agency's ‘executive and administrative functions.'”

Maddox further alleged that the members were threatening staff, throwing the agency into chaos.

“The Acting Chairman views respondents' actions as procedurally improper and thus invalid, but one of the respondents has threatened agency staff: ‘If you chose to ignore the directive of the Commission, I suggest you read the [district court's] order and decide whether you want to personally violate it,'” Maddox wrote.

THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO COULD DEFECT TO SINK TRUMP'S ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

“Respondents' actions have thus thrown the agency into chaos and have put agency staff in the untenable position of deciding which Commissioners' directives to follow,” he added.

The episode represents the latest of many legal struggles faced by the Trump administration, which has been hounded by legal barriers every step of the way in carrying out its agenda.</p>

The US has a long history of taking the lead in clean energy, and a long history of losing it. And President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill,” which passed the Senate on Tuesday, would again leave the US on the margins of a global clean energy revolution that it could have dominated. Solar, batteries, and wind are on track to make up more than 90 percent of new electricity capacity on the US power grid this year. Wind and solar now produce more electricity on the US power grid than coal. Almost twice as many Americans work in clean energy compared to fossil fuels, and the sector is still growing. Some of the more extreme provisions in earlier drafts of the bill have been removed, like an excise tax targeting renewable energy. It calls for more rapid phaseouts of tax credits for wind and solar power and eliminates a $7,500 tax credit for the purchase of a new electric vehicle. The spending bill working its way through Congress doesn't just undo incentives for clean energy — it also creates a new tax credit for coal. These provisions are in line with Trump's longstanding antipathy toward renewable energy and disbelief in climate change. But they stand to hobble the US economy more broadly. Energy demand is rising and the cheapest, most readily deployable supplies of energy are being throttled. Fossil fuels take longer to ramp up. Since these are internationally traded commodities, their prices can fluctuate based on factors beyond the US's control. Right now, oil prices are at four-year lows and natural gas prices are falling, and when prices are low, it's much harder to make the business case for more mining, drilling, and power plants, even with incentives. Trump may have some levers to pull — he can, for example, open up more federally managed lands for energy production — but many of those leases sit unused because energy companies don't want to create a supply glut. Meanwhile, employment in the oil and gas industry remains volatile, while coal jobs are continuing their decades-long decline. “We're in this moment of surging demand and you can't build another gas turbine for at least five years beyond what's already been booked,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director for modeling and analysis at the think tank Energy Innovation. The Senate bill does extend tax credits and loan programs for nuclear energy and geothermal power. However, the cuts in the bill would also slow efforts to build up the domestic energy supply chain needed to bolster other zero-emissions technologies, from raw materials like lithium and rare earth minerals to battery factories. On top of all this, Trump's tariffs are raising operating costs not just for renewables, but also for the fossil fuels he loves so much. The net result is a policy suite that will not only hamper clean electricity, but energy overall, making it more expensive for everyone across the country. According to Energy Innovation, the Senate bill would reduce how much energy the US adds to the grid in the years to come compared to the current trajectory, thereby increasing household electricity prices on average by $130 per year, eroding almost a trillion dollars in economic productivity, and costing 760,000 jobs by 2030. While the US is putting clean energy in reverse, other countries are racing ahead. Renewables are on track to overtake coal as the biggest power source in the world this year. Wind, solar, and batteries are still getting cheaper. Effectively, the US is ceding one of the biggest growth industries in the world to China, particularly as developing countries industrialize and other wealthy countries look to decarbonize their economies. The case for more clean energy — lower costs, faster deployment, fewer greenhouse gas emissions — remains robust. Even with all the deliberate obstacles the Trump administration is placing ahead, there are some wind, solar, and battery projects still poised to come online in the US as they work their way through the pipeline, albeit at a much slower pace than before. But without continued investment, the US will lose ground to the rest of the world and condemn itself to dirtier, more expensive energy while worsening a problem that will extract a dear toll from the economy. The president's “big, beautiful bill” just got worse. The Endangered Species Act has a major problem. This unlikely move could help save it.</p>

President Trump said he wants the portrait of himself that was recently unveiled in the Colorado state Capitol to be removed immediately, describing it as "distorted" and "truly the worst." After facing several months of backlash, the Colorado state Capitol has replaced a controversial portrait of President Donald Trump, which he claimed was "purposely distorted" by the artist. A new presidential portrait, recently donated by the White House, was installed last week at the Denver Capitol, the Colorado Capitol Building Advisory Committee told Fox News Digital on Wednesday. It replaces Colorado artist Sarah Boardman's painting, which had hung since 2019. Despite the previous portrait's six-year run on display, Trump took to social media last spring to criticize the artwork, saying Boardman "must have lost her talent as she got older" and had "purposely distorted" his image. While Boardman's painting depicted a much younger Trump, the latest display by Arizona artist Vanessa Horabuena mirrors Trump's intense official presidential photo. A new portrait of President Donald Trump has been installed at the Colorado State Capitol, replacing previous artwork he criticized as deliberately unflattering. "Thank you to the Highly Talented Artist, Vanessa Horabuena, and the incredible people of Colorado," Trump said Tuesday on Truth Social. Horabuena is a "Christian worship artist" who has done several other depictions of Trump as well as Abraham Lincoln, Mount Rushmore and Jesus Christ, according to her website. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. Boardman told Fox News Digital she had no comment on the new painting. A new portrait of President Donald Trump has been installed at the Colorado state Capitol. The Horabuena portrait was installed as a temporary display following a Thursday decision by the advisory committee, which oversees art displays at the Capitol. "There was a blank on the wall," Court said. We knew that the White House had sent us this replacement and it simply made sense to put it up." A visitor photographs a portrait of President Donald Trump in the Colorado state Capitol in Denver on July 1, 2025. Boardman's portrait was removed from the Capitol's presidential gallery wall in April, according to the committee, after Colorado Democrats – who control the legislature – agreed to take it down at the request of local Republican leaders. "Nobody likes a bad picture or painting of themselves, but the one in Colorado, in the State Capitol, put up by the Governor, along with all other Presidents, was purposefully distorted to a level that even I, perhaps, have never seen before," Trump said in March on Truth Social.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several centrist House Republicans could defect to sink President Donald Trump‘s “big, beautiful bill.” The bill can only survive three GOP defectors if all members are present and voting, and numerous Republicans have expressed hesitation to support it. With Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Warren Davidson (R-OH) signaling immovable “no” votes — they voted “no” for the version approved by the House in May — two more holdouts would sink the megabill. The bill narrowly passed in May after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) included some sweeteners to win over reluctant Republicans. House Republicans are less enthused with the new version of the bill despite Trump's threats and his July 4 deadline to pass it. Centrists expressed dismay with welfare cuts, while fiscal hawks were uneasy with its potential to raise the deficit, which was the main problem that triggered Elon Musk's fallout with Trump. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) appeared to be the firmest “no” outside of Massie and Davidson, responding in the negative twice when reporters asked if he would vote for the bill as he did in May. “What we ought to do is take exactly the House bill that we sent over and go home and say ‘when you're serious, come back,'” Norman said, according to the New York Times. Rep. Marlin Stutzman (R-IN) heavily implied that he would not vote in favor of the bill unless significant changes were made, which would require it to be sent back to the Senate. “We cannot in good faith pass a bill through our chamber that hinges on cut corners and earmarks. The American people won't stand for it.” Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) took issue with the bill's treatment of green energy subsidies, saying the Senate's changes in favor of them are “a deal-killer of an already bad deal.” Roy was careful to portray his opposition as out of support for Trump. “The President's team has worked hard with us. … I love the president and what he's doing. I didn't come to Washington to continue the Great New Scam,” Roy said, asking why they couldn't just repeal the green subsidies. Rep. Roy: "The President's team has worked hard with us… I want to deliver. Stand with President Trump and end the Green New Scam now.” The House Freedom Caucus says it's time for Congress to STAND with President Trump in opposing the Green New Deal Scam! House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris (R-MD) said the Senate's version of the bill “is not ready for prime time.” “I've been clear from the start that I will not support a final reconciliation bill that makes harmful cuts to Medicaid, puts critical funding at risk, or threatens the stability of healthcare providers across CA-22,” he said in a statement on X released before the Senate's version of the bill passed. “President Trump was clear when he said to root out waste, fraud, and abuse without cutting Medicaid, and I wholeheartedly agree. 1 — otherwise, I will vote no,” Valadao added. He cleared his Wednesday schedule in order to meet with holdouts. “Our Country will make a fortune this year, more than any of our competitors, but only if the Big, Beautiful Bill is PASSED!” Trump said Wednesday morning on Truth Social. “As they say, Trump's been right about everything, and this is the easiest of them all to predict. Republicans, don't let the Radical Left Democrats push you around. We got there, and we got pretty much what we wanted,” he said when asked if he thought it would be a struggle to wrestle House Republicans to vote in favor.</p>

Olbermann posted a message on X on Tuesday calling Gaines "whiny" in response to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announcement that it had reached an agreement with UPenn following its investigation into Title IX violations that centered on Thomas' participation on the women's swimming team during the 2021-22 season. Gaines, the host of OutKick's "Gaines for Girls" podcast and a 12-time NCAA All-American swimmer, tied with Thomas at the 2022 NCAA Division I swimming championships. "Wanted to congratulate Whiny Gaines on now being able to say she finished tied for FOURTH not tied for FIFTH in the Lia Thomas race," Olbermann wrote in his post, referencing the 2022 NCAA Division I swimming championships when Gaines tied with Thomas for fifth place in the 200 free. And while you're keeping track, make sure to congratulate Emma Weyant, the right National Champ in the 500 freestyle, too," Gaines said, referring to Thomas' title in the 2022 championships.

Thomas became the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title. During competition, Thomas set multiple individual program records. On Tuesday, UPenn announced that a trio of records set by Thomas that season would be updated to reflect the female competitor's records.

In UPenn's statement on Tuesday, Penn President J. Larry Jameson said the university plans to "fully comply" with Title IX and the NCAA's current policies. "The University will not – on the basis of sex – exclude female students from participation in, deny female students the benefits of, or subject female students to discrimination under, any athletics programs. In addition, in providing to female student-athletes intimate facilities such as locker rooms and bathrooms in connection with Penn Athletics, such facilities shall be strictly separated on the basis of sex and comparably provided to each sex," the school wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CBS News parent Paramount Global has agreed to pay $16 million to resolve an extraordinary lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” news report last fall. The long-gestating and highly controversial settlement payment was announced by Paramount late Tuesday night. Paramount said the $16 million sum “includes plaintiffs' fees and costs,” and will not be paid to Trump directly, but instead will be allocated to Trump's future presidential library — mirroring a settlement agreement that Disney's ABC struck with Trump last December. “The settlement does not include a statement of apology or regret,” Paramount specified. But it is still an embarrassing episode for CBS, because legal experts maintained that Trump's suit was frivolous and that CBS was on solid ground to fight and win the case in court. “This is a very sad moment for '60 Minutes,' CBS News and journalism,” a CBS News staffer told CNN on condition of anonymity. Other employees also described widespread outrage and disgust about the payment to Trump. But there is also “a slight sense of relief that we can start to put this behind us,” the staffer added. A spokesman for Trump's legal team, meanwhile, celebrated the deal as a victory, even though Trump had claimed billions of dollars in damages, and wound up settling for a tiny fraction as much. Outside analysts have framed it very differently – as an instance of corporate priorities trumping journalistic principles. Paramount has been trying for months to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media, and the deal requires approval from the Trump administration, in part because CBS owns local stations that are licensed by the government. This gave Trump a form of leverage over Paramount — and may have put more pressure on the company to pay up. Paramount said Tuesday night that “this lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process. We will abide by the legal process to defend our case.” FCC chair Brendan Carr has also repeatedly said that his merger review process is separate. Press advocacy groups, meanwhile, blasted Paramount for deciding to settle. The settlement deal included a promise from CBS that “in the future, ‘60 Minutes' will release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after such interviews have aired, subject to redactions as required for legal or national security concerns.” Conservative media watchdogs had noticed that CBS aired two different soundbites from Harris in response to correspondent Bill Whitaker's question about the Biden administration's relationship with Israel amid the war in Gaza. As criticism mounted and Trump threatened to sue, CBS said it merely edited the vice president's answer for time, in accordance with television news standards, and it declined to release the full transcript. Trump went on the warpath, claiming “election interference” and calling it “the biggest scandal in broadcast history.” He accused CBS News of violating a Texas consumer protection law and demanded $10 billion in damages. Nevertheless, the lawsuit posed a serious problem for Paramount, especially its controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, who stands to make hundreds of millions of dollars through the Skydance deal. So once Trump took office for a second term, Paramount executives sought to make the lawsuit disappear. Critics of the settlement effort, inside and outside CBS, used words like payoff and bribe to describe the proposed settlement. Several Democratic lawmakers even raised concerns that a settlement might run afoul of anti-bribery laws. Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks, speaking at an annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, observed that companies settle litigation all the time for all sorts of reasons. “Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial, as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction.” Trump's CBS lawsuit was part of his larger and ongoing effort to attack major media organizations he deemed unfavorable to him. He sued The Des Moines Register and pollster J. Ann Selzer last December over a pre-election survey that showed Harris leading Trump in Iowa, which he ultimately won by double digits. He also sued ABC News, alleging that anchor George Stephanopoulos defamed him, and the network ultimately settled that case, creating a blueprint of sorts for the Paramount agreement. Related article CBS News in distress amid Trump's pressure campaign: ‘There's a lot of fear' That internal strife spilled out into the public view in late April when “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens resigned, citing a loss of editorial independence. Days later, “60 Minutes” correspondent Scott Pelley called out Paramount on-air, revealing that executives “began to supervise our content in new ways” amid the pending merger. “No one here is happy about it,” he said. A month later, Wendy McMahon, the executive in charge of CBS News, also resigned. She alluded to a “challenging” past few months in her farewell memo to employees, adding that “It's become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.” All the while, “60 Minutes” kept producing substantive investigations about Trump and other subjects, including a probe of his efforts to punish law firms he dislikes.

An adult New World screwworm fly sits at rest in this undated photo. TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) — The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot. That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. “It's an exceptionally good technology,” said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies — sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out. It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year. The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary. Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers — and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus. “A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,” said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association. Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant — and cripple an animal with pain. The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating. One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives. Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September. But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies. In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University. In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping. Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people. Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Education Secretary Linda McMahon attends a House Committee on Education and Workforce hearing, Wednesday, June 4, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — The University of Pennsylvania on Tuesday modified a trio of school records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and said it would apologize to female athletes “disadvantaged” by her participation on the women's swimming team, part of a resolution of a federal civil rights case. “While Penn's policies during the 2021-2022 swim season were in accordance with NCAA eligibility rules at the time, we acknowledge that some student-athletes were disadvantaged by these rules,” Penn President J. Larry Jameson said. “We recognize this and will apologize to those who experienced a competitive disadvantage or experienced anxiety because of the policies in effect at the time.” As part of the settlement, the university must also announce that it “will not allow males to compete in female athletic programs” and it must adopt “biology-based” definitions of male and female, the department said. In his statement, Jameson said Penn has always been in compliance with NCAA and Title IX rules as they were interpreted at the time, and that the university has never had its own policies around transgender athlete participation. The school has followed changes to eligibility guidelines as they were issued earlier this year, he said. The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes in February, limiting competition in women's sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth. “Our commitment to ensuring a respectful and welcoming environment for all of our students is unwavering,” Jameson said. “At the same time, we must comply with federal requirements, including executive orders, and NCAA eligibility rules, so our teams and student-athletes may engage in competitive intercollegiate sports.” Education Secretary Linda McMahon called it a victory for women and girls. “The Department commends UPenn for rectifying its past harms against women and girls, and we will continue to fight relentlessly to restore Title IX's proper application and enforce it to the fullest extent of the law,” McMahon said in a statement. Former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines thanked President Donald Trump on social media and wrote of the settlement, “ Are pigs flying?” Gaines has said she started her activism against transgender athletes competing in women's sports after sharing a locker room with Thomas at the 2022 NCAA championships. Such findings have almost always been resolved through voluntary agreements. In February, the Education Department asked the NCAA and the National Federation of State High School Associations, or NFSHSA, to restore titles, awards and records it says have been “misappropriated by biological males competing in female categories.” The NCAA has updated its record books when recruiting and other violations have stripped titles from certain schools, but the organization, like the NFSHSA, has not responded to the federal government's request and did not respond to emails seeking comment Tuesday. It was not clear how either would determine which events had a transgender athlete participating years later. Associated Press writers Annie Ma and Dan Gelston contributed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Civil and voting rights activists gather in Jackson, Mississippi to honor what would have been the 100th birthday of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, had he not been assassinated by a white supremacist in 1963. Two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams, right, sits next to Arekia Bennett-Scott, the executive director of Mississippi Votes, at the 2025 Democracy in Action Convening in Jackson, Miss., Saturday, June 28, 2025. (AP) — More than 60 years after a white supremacist assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers, his daughter still sees the same strain of political violence at work in American society. Evers-Everette was 8 years old when her father, a field secretary for the NAACP, was shot to death in the driveway of his home in Jackson, Mississippi. A few months after Evers' killing in 1963, President John F. Kennedy was gunned down. The deaths of civil rights leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy followed later that decade. The past year alone has seen the assassination of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, the killing of two Israeli Embassy staffers, and two assassination attempts on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. At a four-day conference celebrating Evers' life just before what would have been his 100th birthday on July 2, his daughter was joined by the daughters of slain civil rights leaders: Kerry Kennedy, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, and Bettie Dahmer, the daughter of civil and voting rights activist Vernon Dahmer. The 2025 Democracy in Action Convening, “Medgar Evers at 100: a Legacy of Justice, a Future of Change,” was held in Jackson. “I just was feeling so much pain, and I didn't want anyone else to have to go through that,” Kennedy said, recalling that after her father died, she prayed for the man who killed him. Two-time Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams spoke at the event, denouncing efforts by the Trump administration to strip the names of activists from Navy vessels, including possibly Evers. “They want to take his name off a boat because they don't want us to have a reminder of how far he sailed us forward,” Abrams told the conference crowd. U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has undertaken an effort to change the names of ships and military bases that were given by President Joe Biden's Democratic administration, which often honored service members who were women, people of color, or from the LGBTQ+ community. Abrams drew parallels between acts of radical political violence and the Trump administration's use of military resources against protesters in Los Angeles who were demonstrating against immigration enforcement actions. “Unfortunately, we cannot decry political violence and then sanction the sending of the Marines and the National Guard to stop protesters and not believe that that conflicting message doesn't communicate itself,” Abrams told The Associated Press. “What I want us to remember is that whether it is Medgar Evers or Melissa Hortman, no one who is willing to speak for the people should have their lives cut short because of what they say.” “So we don't repeat the crazy, nasty, racist mess.”</p>

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — On St. John the Baptist's feast day in late June, an extended Tohono O'odham family attends Mass out at their desert camp, where they gather to harvest saguaro fruit in a process sacred in their Native spirituality. “When you're raised as being a Catholic and raised as being an O'odham, you have both of those within your home, you have both of those within your family,” said Maria Francisco. With her cousin, Tanisha Tucker Lohse, and about three dozen other family members and friends, Francisco worshipped at the early morning Mass in a ramada — a canopy topped with saguaro ribs to provide shade, this one decorated with paper flowers. A priest visited from Tucson to celebrate the Mass. There also were photographs of Tucker's late mom and their great-great-aunt, known as “Grandma Juanita,” whose advocacy preserved the camp. Juana is Spanish for Jane, so she celebrated her name day on St. John's and the family is continuing the tradition. A dozen cross-shaped saguaro fruit-picking poles leaned behind the table. Made from saguaro ribs, they're used to hook the fruits and push or pull them down from the towering plants. But many members of the Tohono O'odham Nation hold onto both faith traditions as they were passed down since the late 17th century, when an Italian-born Jesuit missionary, the Rev. Eusebio Kino, introduced Christianity to these remote deserts in what now are the U.S.-Mexico borderlands. “To me, it's the lived consequence of trying to do Catholicism on their own,” said Seth Schermerhorn, a Hamilton College professor who studies Indigenous adoption of Christian practices. Aro Varnabas came from his parish, Saint Kateri, to celebrate this service. “Making people feel connected to God through the things they're familiar with, that's what I see,” he said. Michael Enis, who works for the O'odham's San Xavier's district — home to one of the most beautifully decorated colonial Catholic churches in the Southwest, San Xavier del Bac — brought his three young children. He sees a special kinship between his nation and Jesus' cousin, who lived off the desert, calling for repentance at the risk of his life, and baptized Christ himself in the Jordan River.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Trying to keep track of all the chaos is overwhelming. So here's a one-stop guide to the turmoil this Court caused. There are two big winners in the Supreme Court's most recent term. In the last two days of its term, the Court imposed heavy new burdens on public schools at the request of religious conservatives, and it rendered much of federal Medicaid law unenforceable in a case lashing out at Planned Parenthood. It heard its first major pornography case in over two decades, upholding a Texas law that seeks to limit youth access to porn. And the Republican justices handed a historic defeat to transgender Americans, permitting states to block at least some trans people from receiving gender-affirming medical care. Four justices also voted that the Constitution requires most states to fund religious public charter schools. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was recused from this case, is likely to provide the fifth vote for religious public schools in the future. Indeed, as I'll explain in more detail below, the Court's Republican majority is willing to tear down major American institutions in order to advance the cultural right's political goals. The Court's most high-profile Trump-related decision, Trump v. CASA, placed vague new restrictions on lower courts' power to block Trump administration policies. This decision is defensible — the Biden administration sought a similar ruling while it was in power — but it is notable that the justices waited until a Republican was president before weakening lower courts' power to rein in the executive. When lower courts block Trump's policies, the Republican justices routinely reinstate those policies on the Supreme Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices consider on an expedited basis. At least two cases this term did serious harm to institutions that millions of Americans depend upon, both in decisions that benefited cultural conservatives. In Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Court's Republican majority ruled that public schools must inform parents before their children are taught a lesson those parents might object to on religious grounds, and that those parents must be given an opportunity to opt their child out of that lesson. The Supreme Court used to treat public schools with more respect. Mahmoud arose out of a dispute over queer-themed books — Montgomery County, Maryland, approved several books with LGBTQ characters that could be used in classroom instruction. But the First Amendment prohibits discrimination among people with different religious beliefs. So, if parents with anti-LGBTQ religious views have a right to notification and an opt-out, so too does every parent who might object to any lesson on any religious ground. This rule, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor warns in a dissenting opinion, is likely to cause “chaos for this Nation's public schools.” Requiring every public school teacher to anticipate which lessons might implicate a parent's religious beliefs “will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,” especially in a nation as diverse as the United States. In the past, courts have rejected similar lawsuits brought by parents who object to books or lessons that feature magic, women who have achievements outside the home, and include topics as diverse as divorce, interfaith couples, “immodest dress,” and “false views of death.” After Mahmoud, however, all of these parents now have a right to advance notice. So lawyers can hunt for parents with idiosyncratic religious views, file a lawsuit against a school, and demand payment to avoid litigation that will be even more expensive for the school district. The Supreme Court used to treat public schools with more respect, out of concern that the Constitution should not be read to prevent such an important institution from functioning. That is why the Court held in Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) that public school students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” But Tinker recognized that free speech should not be used as a weapon that can shut down classroom instruction altogether — if any student could get up in the middle of class and start yelling, for example, their right to free speech would destroy every one of their classmates' right to an education. And so Tinker also held that public school students may not engage in speech that “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.” The Court struck an appropriate balance between protecting free expression by young people, and making sure that public schools continue to produce an educated workforce that ultimately benefits every single American. That decision stands in stark contrast to Mahmoud, which establishes that the rights of religious objectors must be advanced at all costs, even if it would mean imposing such enormous burdens on public schools that every child receives an inferior education. A similar dynamic was in play in Medina, which pitted the GOP's disdain for abortion providers against a federal law permitting Medicaid patients to choose their own doctors. Just as in Mahmoud, the Republican justices handed a sweeping victory to social conservatives — seemingly without any regard for how their decision would damage Medicaid. South Carolina illegally forbade Medicaid patients from choosing Planned Parenthood as their health care provider. The question of which Medicaid laws can be enforced through federal lawsuits, and which provisions are essentially worthless, is one of the most important questions in American poverty and elder law and has been litigated for decades. But two years ago, in Talevski, the Supreme Court finally settled on a clear rule that judges could apply to identify which provisions are enforceable. But the most important thing to know about Talevski is that it established that Medicaid laws which are “phrased in terms of the persons benefitted” and that “focus on the benefitted class” are enforceable. So, if a specific provision of Medicaid law mentions Medicaid patients, or otherwise names the individuals who are supposed to benefit from that law, it is enforceable. The choice-of-provider provision at issue in Medina refers to “any individual eligible for medical assistance.” So it was enforceable under Talevski. Medina should have been an open and shut case. Yet, instead of following Talevski, the Republican justices produced an incoherent opinion that does not even announce a new legal rule, beyond a vague statement that Medicaid laws are “especially unlikely” to be enforceable. Much of Justice Neil Gorsuch's opinion in Medina fixates on seemingly random facts about the choice-of-provider provision, such as the fact that it “appears in a subsection titled ‘Contents,'” as if that's somehow relevant to the question of whether this provision is a meaningless husk. It is impossible to come up with a principled explanation for why, two years after Talevski, the Republican justices decided to abandon that decision and replace it with a new legal standard that renders much of federal law completely useless. But it's certainly possible to come up with a political explanation. Unlike Medina, Talevski did not involve an abortion provider. Several of the Court's Republicans appear to have flipped their votes between Talevski and Medina in order to lash out at Planned Parenthood. The worst thing about the Medina decision is that the Republican justices could have come up with some good-for-this-ride-only legal reasoning that denied Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood, but that otherwise left Talevski intact. Instead, they appear to have overruled Talevski and replaced it with a vague new rule that does little more than tell lower court judges that Medicaid plaintiffs should nearly always lose. Many of the Court's most consequential decisions were handed down on its shadow docket, a process that allows a party that lost in a lower court to seek an immediate Supreme Court order blocking that decision. (In an unusual liberal victory on the shadow docket, the justices also ruled that Trump must give certain immigrants due process before he ships them off to a notorious Salvadorian prison.) Traditionally, the Supreme Court takes months or even longer before it decides a case. With rare exceptions, a case must be heard by a trial court and at least one appeals court before the justices will even consider taking it up. Lawyers hoping the Court will review their case file over 8,000 petitions seeking such review in any given year, but the justices only grant about 60–70 of these petitions. Then, once a case is granted, that's only the beginning of a months-long process where lawyers submit briefs, the justices review them and hold oral arguments, and then they spend months working on the final decision. Contentious suits can wait an entire year for a decision, even after the justices announce that they will hear the case. So if it gets a case wrong, that mistake can linger uncorrected for decades. Beginning in Trump's first term, however, the Court started relying heavily on a separate, much less cautious process to decide cases involving Trump and his government. Litigants in non-death penalty cases could seek expedited review on the shadow docket, but it was so discouraged, and shadow docket petitions were so rarely granted, that smart lawyers typically decided not to annoy the justices with them. Now, however, whenever the Trump administration claims that it must have a Supreme Court order blocking a lower court's decision, the Court treats that claim as an emergency that must be tended to immediately. In Nken v. Holder (2009), the Supreme Court held that a party seeking shadow docket relief must do more than simply show they are likely to prevail if the Court hears their case on the merits. Among other things, they must also show that they “will be irreparably injured” if the justices do not immediately block the lower court's decision. But, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pointed out in a pair of opinions dissenting from two shadow docket orders, the Republican justices seem to have decided that the Trump administration is exempt from Nken, as they often grant shadow docket relief to Trump even when he cannot show irreparable injury. In Social Security Administration v. AFSCME, a case about whether DOGE may access highly sensitive Social Security data, Trump's lawyers didn't even make an argument that his administration would experience irreparable harm without Supreme Court intervention. In one dissenting opinion, Jackson pointed to several Biden-era cases where the Justice Department sought shadow docket relief from lower court orders. When ordinary litigants — or a Democratic administration — seek shadow docket relief, the justices often apply the traditional rules and norms that prevent them from granting those requests. On the final decision day of the term, the Court handed down a ruling upholding provisions of Obamacare that require health insurers to cover certain treatments, as well as a decision rejecting an aggressive attempt to limit federal agencies' power to regulate business. Eight years later, the party has a more modest health care agenda, at least when compared to their ideas from 2017. In recent years, the Fifth Circuit has done everything from declaring entire federal agencies unconstitutional to attempting to pull a popular abortion drug from the market. It once ruled that Texas Republicans may seize control over content moderation at all of the major social media platforms. Many of the Fifth Circuit's judges have taken positions that, if they were embraced by the Supreme Court, risk triggering a second Great Depression. Just last week, for example, in Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton, the Court upheld a Texas law requiring pornographic websites to verify that their users are over age 18, despite a 21-year-old Supreme Court decision that struck down a nearly identical law. These voices will even sometimes succeed, as they did in the Free Speech Coalition case. No matter how bad the Supreme Court gets, it can always get worse. The Republican justices' decision fundamentally altered how public schools must operate. The Republican justices just nuked much of federal Medicaid law, in order to spite Planned Parenthood.﻿ The decision nullifies a treaty designed to protect immigrants from torture.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's Note: Design for Impact is a series spotlighting innovative solutions for communities affected by the climate crisis, natural disasters and other humanitarian emergencies. In the multibillion-dollar global fight against wildfires, early detection is critical. Satellites, drones, thermal cameras and manned lookout towers are just some of the tools currently used to alert authorities and first responders to imminent threats. In under-resourced areas, however, these defenses can be prohibitively expensive. That's why a group of recent design graduates has developed a smaller, simpler and, they say, cheaper solution: A pinecone-sized fire detector that can give vulnerable communities an invaluable head start in the race to escape or contain major blazes. The device can be deployed in fire-prone areas and left for years without maintenance, according to its creators. “It can help people evacuate sooner, and it can stop fires from growing before they're uncontrollable — before they're really devastating,” Pyri co-founder Karina Gunadi told CNN in a video interview. Pyri started in London as a college assignment between four design engineering students, three of whom decided to pursue it as a commercial venture beyond their graduation last year. As an example of a “fire-dependent species,” Gunadi pointed to various types of pine tree that not only thrive in fire-prone areas — they need blazes to reproduce, as their seeds are only released when the resin sealing their pinecones melts in high heat. “What if we can be inspired by how nature already responds to fire, take that, use nature-based materials and create the simplest form of wildfire detection we can?” she said, recalling the genesis of the group's design. Pyri's pinecone-like appearance is also functional: The lightweight sensors' shape and ribbed structure helps protect them against impact, especially if deployed from the air when covering large or hard-to reach areas. So, in terms of camouflage, we're doing maybe a little too well!” Gunadi joked. Although Pyri is not publicly detailing its trigger technology or disclosing its precise material composition (a patent application is pending), the designers looked to organic electronics and are avoiding rare earth metals and lithium-ion batteries. Extreme wildfires are becoming more frequent globally, with fire seasons now longer, hotter and drier than before. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), wildfires were responsible for an estimated 6,687 megatons of carbon dioxide pollution in 2023 — seven times more than was emitted by global aviation that year. Related article What if your house changed color with the seasons? Major blazes are also occurring in places that have not, historically, been considered fire-prone, from America's eastern seaboard to Siberia, Russia. The impact of wildfires is, for Pyri's creators, personal. Wildfires spread at speeds of up to 14 miles per hour, so every minute counts. A 2020 study into early bushfire detection by the Australian National University found that a one-hour reduction in response time could reduce the frequency of large fires by 16%. Earlier this year, the outgoing Biden-Harris administration earmarked $15 million in funding to construct and deploy a “new suite of fire weather observing systems” in high-risk US locations (though it is unclear what impact, if any, President Donald Trump's attempts to block funds associated with the bipartisan infrastructure law will have on these programs). Google, meanwhile, recently announced $13 million in funding for its FireSat initiative, which will use a “constellation of satellites” to track fires as small as 5 square meters (54 square feet) using realtime images that refresh every 20 minutes. Pyri is by no means the only company developing simpler, on-the-ground sensor technology. Since 2019, the US Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) has been researching and trialing new wildfire detectors in collaboration with small businesses including Maryland-based N5 Sensors, which says it can detect ignition within five minutes, even if a fire is “only a few square meters in size.” Traditionally, sensors have relied on optical cameras or thermal imaging that could “see” the flames, but S&T says it hopes its new devices can “sniff” gases or solid particles in the air. It is also using data from earlier trials to inform artificial intelligence algorithms used in its latest sensors. Pyri's designers are also looking to artificial intelligence: When one of their devices is triggered, AI can analyze available weather and satellite data to assess the likelihood that the signal was indeed the result of a wildfire. The number of devices required in any given area will depend greatly on the geography of the site, including topography and vegetation, Gunadi said, adding that “fire dynamics are very complicated.” Pyri is hoping to sell a per-kilometer subscription package that bundle together sensors with installation and monitoring software. Declining to reveal the startup's future pricing, Gunadi said it is aiming for fees that are “half the cost of our nearest competitor.” Since graduating, Pyri's co-founders have been carrying out research and development and raising funds — including a £5,000 ($6,677) prize from winning a James Dyson Award, an international student design competition founded by the titular British inventor and Dyson founder. The company hopes to run small-scale tests and demonstrations later this year, with a view to operating larger pilots next year and launching commercially in 2027.</p>
