                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dr. Phil's Fort Worth-based JV Merit Street Media filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday, simultaneously suing business partner Trinity Broadcasting for breach of contract that it claims destroyed its new television network and pushed it into bankruptcy. The TV personality's high-rated daytime Dr. Phil show ended a 21-year run after the 2022-23 season although it lived on in syndication. The suit centers around his latest venture, Merit Street Media, a JV of McGraw's Peteski Productions and Trinity Broadcasting Group. The network has had carriage on over the air broadcast television as well as multichannel platforms and streaming. Dr. Phil Says He's Embedded With ICE For Immigration Operation In Chicago A Merit Street spokesperson said, “Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) is being sued by Merit Street Media (MSM) for failing to provide clearly agreed-upon national distribution and other significant foundational commitments critical to the network's continuing success and viability. The suit is part of a restructuring proceeding also initiated by MSM.” The JV called for Peteski to provide Merit Street with certain new original episodes of the Dr. Phil show, as well as primetime specials to air on the new TV network. TBN also agreed to provide all “first class quality” services necessary to produce Dr. Phil's shows and primetime specials, the suit said. “In short, the deal was simple and straightforward” — McGraw/Peteski contributed content, while TBN contributed access to a distribution network to air Dr. Phil's content along with the production services to support the creation of that content,” according to the lawsuit. It “began to abuse its power as a controlling shareholder to advance its own interests and those of its CEO Matthew Crouch, while causing Merit Street to assume responsibility of TBN's obligations under the Joint Venture Agreement, and to otherwise enrich itself at Merit Street's expense. This fresh voice on the national stage is inexorably going dark, going off the air because TBN has refused to honor its commitment to transfer its must carry rights and thereby provide national distribution for the network—Merit Street.” Simply put, as a result of TBN's conduct, “Merit Street has nowhere to send its broadcast signal and nowhere to air its programming no matter how great it may be.” Since its launch last year, Merit Street has featured McGraw's interview with Donald Trump following his conviction on New York state charges, as well as the host's embed with federal immigration agents back in January. Merit Street is seeking damages, recoupment of legal costs, and other remedies. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Velvet Sundown, an obviously fictional “band” that's gone viral after somehow racking up more than 500,000 monthly listeners on Spotify out of nowhere, used the generative-AI platform Suno in the creation of their songs, and consider themselves an “art hoax,” a band spokesperson reveals to Rolling Stone. On their X account, the “band” fervently and repeatedly denied any AI usage after multiple media outlets reported on their mysterious popularity — but pseudonymous band spokesperson and “adjunct” member Andrew Frelon now admits, “It's marketing. People before, they didn't care about what we did, and now suddenly, we're talking to Rolling Stone, so it's like, ‘Is that wrong? '”In the phone conversation Tuesday morning, Frelon originally maintained that AI was used only in brainstorming for the music, then admitted to the use of Suno but “not in the final product,” and finally came to acknowledge that at least some songs (“I don't want to say which ones”) are Suno-generated. “I haven't admitted that to anyone else,” Frelon says. He also acknowledged employing Suno's “Persona” feature — the same one Timbaland is using with his controversial AI artist TaTa — to maintain a consistent singer's voice across songs, although he continues to claim that's not the case on every track. Some observers have wondered whether some kind of playlist manipulation was used to build Velvet Sundown's Spotify listenership, but Frelon dodged that question. “I know we got on some playlists that just have like tons of followers, and it seems to have spiraled from there.” Did Frelon and his associates use playlists of their own to boost the process? “And I don't want to say something that's not true.” The Velvet Sundown enigma began in June, when two of the band's albums suddenly appeared on Spotify, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and other streaming services. On Reddit, two posters called out what one poster called “a completely fake band”; musician and writer Chris Dalla Riva questioned their existence on TikTok; and the streaming service Deezer noted that “some tracks on this album may have been created using artificial intelligence.” The site Music Ally determined that most of the Spotify playlists which featured the band came from just four Spotify accounts — and no one could explain how the band's catalog ended up on a playlist of songs evoking the Vietnam War. Early this week, the “band” pushed back on its X account, claiming it was “absolutely crazy that so-called ‘journalists' keep pushing the lazy, baseless theory that the Velvet Sundown is ‘AI-generated' with zero evidence.… This is not a joke. This is our music, written in long, sweaty nights in a cramped bungalow in California with real instruments, real minds and real soul.” (“Then make an appearance on live TV,” responded one person on X. “Proof [sic] it make a real video,” replied another.) Timbaland's New Artist Is Young, Photogenic — and Not Human People Are Losing Loved Ones to AI-Fueled Spiritual Fantasies Spotify, for one, has no rules against AI music. It might have flipped.” McDonald feels the Velvet Sundown's prominence on that platform is the result of several factors: Artists and content creators are able to pay for more exposure on playlists, he says, and the company's recommendations systems have moved “away from understandable algorithms with strong grounding in actual human listening and communities” and toward AI-driven systems that “can pick songs for recommendations based on characteristics of their audio.” Added together, McDonald says, these factors “increase the lottery-like dynamics of the system so that there are fewer reasons why a fake band couldn't be successful. Most fake bands still won't be successful, and of course nobody notices when an AI band gets no listeners, but there are no protections against it happening, and probably from Spotify's business point of view it's not even clear that this is a bad thing to be ‘protected' against.” (A spokesperson for Spotify declined to comment.)

As for the viral attention Velvet Sundown has garnered, “it's because they're AI, not because the music's great,” says one veteran A&R executive, who asked for anonymity. Not convinced yet it will create a sustainable hit artist. At that point, someone will reveal it to be AI. No one will care because they love the song.” The Velvet Sundown's Frelon, meanwhile, says that music fans need to learn to accept AI tools, calling the fear of them “super overwrought.” “I respect that people have really strong emotions about this,” he says. “But I think it's important that we allow artists to experiment with new technologies and new tools,  try things out, and not freak out at people just because they're using a program or not using a program.

[Editor's note: The following article contains spoilers for Marvel‘s “Ironheart” finale.] I was at my parents' house during COVID, when Marvel began its erratic foray into television with the powerful “WandaVision.” In Marvel Comics, Mephisto is literally the devil; he crops up with various heroes and villains across the comics under thin aliases (Beelzebub? ), leaving his mark on the lives of everyone from Spider-Man to Doctor Strange, and more. He's connected to Scarlet Witch through her sons, who were introduced in Jac Schaeffer's Emmy-winning series. Related Stories ‘The Last of Us' Creator Neil Druckmann Exits HBO Series Ahead of Season 3 Trey Parker and Matt Stone Allege Paramount Global and Skydance Media Merger Is ‘F**king Up' ‘South Park': It's a ‘Sh**show' There were whispers around “Loki” and “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” Surely he'd appear in “The Multiverse of Madness,” which brought Scarlet Witch face-to-face with Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). By then, however, the villain of the phase had been introduced as Kang (Jonathan Majors), with pieces falling into place for an epic battle against him, leaving little room for a second big bad. As someone who was scrambling for Mephisto crumbs during “WandaVision,” I've been saddened by my growing distance from the MCU since then. But between “Thunderbolts” and “Ironheart,” I feel something stirring that has been dormant since the days of lockdown. For one thing, I was removed enough to miss the whispers that Mephisto would debut in “Ironheart,” and if I did catch this news item blowing the entire reveal over two years ago, I simply forgot! Watching the screeners all at once meant no week-to-week theorizing, so by the time Sacha Baron Cohen arrived on screen I was too absorbed in stunt casting to even consider who he was playing. It wasn't until a few lines before the character identifies himself that I remembered a name I had long forgotten — and realized that not only could this be him, but it had to be. Mephisto is the one who gave Parker (Anthony Ramos) his hood as part of a sinister “deal,” and he's the devil who will offer Riri (Dominique Thorne) what she most desires in exchange for what's sure to be a deadly price. The shriek was less of shock than disbelief — or maybe I've been holding it in for years? This character and “Ironheart” took a long time to reach our screens (that 2022 leak was from the set), but seeing Baron Cohen eat up the role was immensely satisfying, regardless of the wait. Mephisto has presence and purpose, and his powers remain a mystery to the audience because they're a mystery to our protagonist. The MCU has struggled with memorable villains (remember Malekith? of course you don't) enough to approach them more thoughtfully over time; crafting a good one is hard enough, and more than one at a time would dilute their overall impression. With Kang out of the picture, there was a brief an opening for HBIC (Head Beelzebub in Charge, if you will), but that role got reworked into Doctor Doom (Robert Downey Jr.), whos scheduled to be the central villain of 2026's “Avengers: Doomsday.” “Ironheart” was originally filmed before Marvel cut ties with Majors, so there was at least a plan for Mephisto to coexist with Kang, if not others upon his introduction. Admittedly, that's not as enticing as imagining him in “Fantastic Four: The First Steps” later this month, given his overlap with those characters, and it's also entirely possible that this character missed his window and joined the party too late. Through two Phases, 16 shows, and 13 movies, I finally got to release that scream, and I might just dare to get excited about what the future might bring.

Brad Pitt is putting his football differences with Bradley Cooper aside to praise the writer/director/producer/star's sophomore directorial effort, “Maestro.” Pitt, who is good pals with Cooper, joked that their friendship is still intact despite their differing NFL fandoms (Pitt roots for the Kansas City Chiefs, while Cooper is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles lover.) During the “New Heights” with Jason and Travis Kelce podcast (in the below video), Pitt admitted that he couldn't help but throw some shade at Cooper when celebrating “Maestro” in 2024. Pitt also praised the Leonard Bernstein biopic for being one of the best films of the 2020s; Pitt implied that an Academy Award for Cooper is even long overdue. “He was getting an award for ‘Maestro,' [which] is still probably one of the best movies of this decade. And I was giving him this award and he's been nominated like 18 times for the Oscars. '” To be clear, Cooper has actually received 12 Oscar nominations in his career. Cooper infamously said that he would prefer the Eagles taking home the Super Bowl trophy to getting an Oscar, anyway. Cooper will next appear in, direct, produce, and serve as B camera operator for meta Hollywood comedy “Is This Thing On?” He said during ESPN's “The Pat McAfee Show” that filmmaking itself is “very similar to team sports,” saying, “It's all about creating a culture. It's very, very similar to football in particular, you know, if one of the 11 messes up, the whole thing's screwing up and people don't see that from the outside, but if you're in it, you know that very well. During the “New Heights” podcast, Pitt echoed Cooper's sentiments. Pitt, who is promoting his racing film “F1,” deemed sports films to be the “greatest” genre. “It's an amazing metaphor for a lifetime. […] I feel like we really got it right in ‘Moneyball' in a lovely, beautiful way to add to that lexicon, and I think this one [‘F1'] does that too on a really big level.” Pitt added that “F1” also has a “spiritual ending” which he is “really proud of.” Check out the full interview here.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During Baylee Littrell's run on season 23 of “American Idol,” he had no bigger cheerleader than his dad, Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell. But in an interview published on July 2, 2025, Brian told Parade Magazine that initially, he wasn't keen on the idea of his son trying out for the show. “But they courted him for a couple of years. In addition to the thousands of tens of thousands of singers who audition for producers virtually each season, “American Idol” casting producers also scour social media and performance venues for up-and-coming talent, encouraging rising stars to give the show a shot. Baylee, who's been trying to make it as a country and contemporary Christian artist, finally decided it was worth the exposure. Brian was a proud papa throughout 20-year-old Baylee's journey, from singing with his son for part of his audition, to cheering for him from the balcony during Hollywood Week. The 90s pop icon, who still tours extensively with the Backstreet Boys, often got emotional while supporting his only child with wife Leighanne Littrell, to whom he's been married since 2000. “He's just (the) most inspiring thing in my life right now. Top 20 isn't a bad thing out of 124,000.” Brian's bandmates also chimed in, telling Parade how cool it was to watch Baylee on “American Idol,” since he's been joining them backstage — and even onstage — since he was a little boy. AJ McLean said, “We've known Baylee his whole life, so to watch him come from singing with us during soundcheck to opening up for us back in the day to now, having his own career … He's an incredible songwriter. Honestly, he did fantastic in my opinion.” On June 24, Baylee released the original single he performed during Hollywood Week on “American Idol” called “Hey Jesus.” “I wrote it in a very dark time in my life,” Littrell told CCM before releasing the song. “A big common misconception is that God won't let us fall down. “The growing pains of life weighed heavy on my shoulders and I lived every day in fear of the next. At the time, I had never fully put my trust in God.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs has been found guilty on two out of five counts against him in federal court. The jury found Combs guilty of the Mann Act (a federal law that criminalizes the transportation of “any woman or girl for the purpose of prostitution or debauchery, or for any other immoral purpose”) in connection to his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura and an ex-girlfriend known under the pseudonym “Jane.” He was found not guilty of charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion in connection with Ventura and “Jane,” per ABC News. In addition to the federal case, dozens of civil suits have since been filed against Combs, who has admitted to domestic abuse but denied the more grievous charges against him. They were instructed to continue deliberating and ultimately returned with a not guilty verdict. The defense has requested he “be released on conditions to his home in Miami and offered a $1 million bond,” per NBC News. Both sides were granted several hours to submit letters arguing for or against release before the court reconvenes on Wednesday afternoon; Combs will remain in the courthouse until that time, ABC News reports. In a statement (via CNN), Ventura's lawyer said, “This entire criminal process started when our client Cassie Ventura had the courage to file her civil complaint in November 2023. Although the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sean "Diddy" Combs will face a monthslong process to determine his sentence, which could have been much more severe if he'd been convicted on all charges. Sean “Diddy” Combs has been convicted of illegal prostitution but acquitted of meatier sex-trafficking and racketeering charges, a significant legal victory for the disgraced rap mogul who faced up to life in prison if found guilty on all counts. Probation Department, which will calculate suggested sentencing guidelines based on various factors like Combs' criminal history and the seriousness of his offense. After this process, which can take months, Judge Subramanian will hold a sentencing hearing. The charges that Combs was found guilty of – transporting escorts across state lines for marathon sex parties called “freak-offs” – carry no mandatory minimum and a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Combs faced a far lengthier prison term if he'd been convicted on the other charges he faced: forcing women to have sex with escorts during the freak-offs, and operating a criminal syndicate under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. If Combs had been convicted under RICO in addition to the prostitution charge, he'd face a maximum of 40 years behind bars. As it stands, Combs defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo said Wednesday that the rapper should be immediately released from the pretrial jail where he's been in custody since his arrest last year. Agnifilo said Combs has “been given his life by this jury” and should be allowed to await sentencing from his home in Miami, according to CNN. Prosecutor Maureen Comey opposed the request, saying her office intends to seek prison time and noting that Combs “continued to commit a litany of crimes” after he knew he was under investigation last year. Judge Subramanian asked both sides to submit letters on the matter by this afternoon and said he'll make a decision afterwards about whether Combs will be released.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The mixed verdict found Combs guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution related to his ex-girlfriend, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, and an ex-girlfriend who testified under the name “Jane.” But he was found not guilty on the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. Had he been convicted on all charges, or even some of the more serious ones, Combs could have faced up to life in prison. Each violation of the Mann Act carries up to 10 years in prison, meaning Combs technically faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. Most legal experts, however, do not expect Judge Arun Subramanian to hand down such a harsh punishment. Combs has no prior criminal record, which could lead to a more lenient sentence, while Subramanian could also allow him to serve concurrent sentences for the two counts. A sentencing date for Combs has not yet been set. Green Day Fan Invited On Stage to Play ‘Good Riddance,' Plays ‘Wonderwall' Instead More pressing at the moment is whether Combs will be remanded back into custody or released on bond as he awaits sentencing. The government raised concerns that, if released, Combs could “disregard orders from this court,” citing evidence that the mogul “continued to commit a litany of crimes” — such as alleged abuse and drug use — even after he knew he was under federal investigation. Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo, however, pushed for his client's immediate release on bond, saying he would be “nothing short of a fool” to violate a court order.

Speaking to brother and co-host Jason Kelce on their New Heights podcast episode posted Wednesday (July 2), Travis shed some light on how the performance came about, raving, “Tay Tay showed up!” “I won't say when the idea came up, but when we were there at Tight End and Friends, and we knew there was a professional like Kane Brown, who can just, he can figure it out,” Travis continued. Tay just kind of went up to him and the band and went, ‘Hey, if you guys are down, I'll go up there, play a song and see if we can pop the roof off this place. The athlete went on to share that moments before the viral performance, Swift jotted down accompaniment notes for Brown's band members so that they could perform with her without missing a beat. “She was like in the back doing musical notes,” Travis said with awe. “Sheets of music, she was writing out — I think the high hats, maybe?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Jelly Roll and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson embraced in a big bear hug backstage at “American Idol” in May 2025, it was much more than a scene of two celebrities greeting each other. He revealed the two had been corresponding for years, helping each other through some dark times in their lives. But the timing had never worked out for them to meet up — until that fateful night at “American Idol.” Jelly Roll was on set at “American Idol” on May 12 because he was the show's first-ever artist-in-residence, a mentorship role he served in throughout season 23, guiding and encouraging the contestants. Johnson, meanwhile, was on set at “American Idol” that night for two reasons. First, his daughter performed in the Polynesian children's choir that backed up 2023 “American Idol” winner Iam Tongi, who sang his song from the new live-action “Lilo & Stitch” movie. Johnson posted on Instagram on May 12 about what a proud “girl dad” he was as he watched the choir back up Tongi. Johnson also promoted his upcoming animated Disney film, “Moana 2,” while in the audience at “American Idol,” in a brief segment with Ryan Seacrest. In his July 1 post, Johnson explained that he had first reached out to Jelly Roll before he was an international sensation, writing, “Several years ago (roughly 2017) I was going through a very hard thing at the time, I was struggling. Many of you know the drill, you put on ‘the face', show up to work, smile and get through it. The words moved me so much that I reached out to Jelly. I just called to say thank you brother. After Jelly Roll emerged from his trailer, the two embraced for a long time, telling each other how much they loved each other. “Jelly Roll and I have been buddies for almost 10 years — texting, showing love, support, always there for each other, whatever you need, I got you,” Johnson said. Among the things they've bonded over is growing up in Nashville without stable families, as well as Jelly Roll's recent health journey. When the two say each other, he told Johnson that he had lost 200 pounds and was prepared to lose another 100. In November, Johnson posted on Instagram Jelly Roll's health journey. It included a clip of Johnson on “The Kelly Clarkson Show” reading lyrics from “Only” and why Jelly Roll's song meant so much to him, and well as clips of Jelly Roll's progress losing weight. He wrote, “Always believed in you brother☝🏾 your music & friendship helped me thru a very hard time in my life when I was struggling to find a way.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>[Editor's note: The recap of episode eight publishes July 3. There's Richie, Jimmy, and the Faks, of course, all whirlwinds in their own right. This extra-long episode sees the whole Bear clan come together. Despite their reservations, Richie, Carmy, and Natalie have all turned out for Tiff and Frank's wedding, forcing themselves to face their various ghosts. Sydney is also there in her capacity as Richie's emotional support plus one (plus Marcus and Chester, who apparently slept with Frank's mom?! It's a classic entry into the wedding-episode canon, complete with reunited exes, estranged relatives, and dishy revelations. It also represents a pivotal moment for our big three characters: Carmy exorcising his demons, Sydney's priorities coming into focus, and Richie realizing he's not as alone as he thinks. Carm is even more on edge than usual, because he's about to see his mom for the first time since she drove through her own wall. And Richie is determined to make nice with Frank. Sugar and Francie—played by Oscar winner Brie Larson!—start shouting over each other within seconds, stomping their heels on the floor like angry horses. We've been waiting for literal years to find out what caused the rift between these two ex-BFFs, and the answer is juicy as hell: They hooked up! Michelle (Sarah Paulson) is the first to run into Donna, and you can instantly see her hackles rise. It's a quiet, intimate scene between two excellent actors as Tiff talks about her complicated feelings about her mom not coming to the wedding. He and fellow honorary Berzatto Claire try their best not to scare Frank too much: “It's a lot of people with very specific and unique personalities that feel things very strongly.” Best of luck to the groom! Carmy's spidey sense kicks in before he's even laid eyes on Donna, snapping him into a signature trauma-flashback montage. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance is achingly specific as always. From the way Deedee looks at her son, you can see how hard she's working to hold herself back. As far as I'm concerned, Richie coming to Carmy's rescue is proof positive that he's finally forgiven his cousin for the refrigerator incident. He and Sydney give Bear an out with a fake story about how he's needed in the kitchen and take over the conversation with Donna. But when Frank pulls Richie away, Syd is left all alone with the monster in Carm's closet. Sweet, innocent Frank needs help coaxing Evie out from under a table, where she's hiding out in protest of their planned stepfather-stepdaughter dance. It costs Richie more than Frank knows to bargain on his behalf, but he does it anyway because he's a really decent guy. He's also encouraged by the golden-boy groom's insecurity about being a good dad—an issue that's never been in question for Richie. Carmy is hiding out in the kitchen chomping on Nicorette when he runs into the last person he expected—or wanted—to see: Uncle Lee (Bob Odenkirk), who is probably Donna's boyfriend even though he swears their relationship is purely platonic. Carm opens up to him in ways we've never seen before. Lee has mellowed since we last saw him in “Fishes,” approaching Carm like a fellow adult whose choices he respects. Bear is shocked when Lee says he clocked his brief appearance at Mikey's funeral—and even more shocked that he didn't tell anyone. While Carm was off rising up through the fine-dining ranks, Lee became close with Mikey. And he talked about his little bro a lot—how proud he was of Bear, out there working at the best restaurants in the world, wrapping fish in potatoes. Lee also says Bear is more like his sensitive, intense mother than he knows. Back in the reception room, Sydney is genuinely enjoying Donna's company. It's loud, sure, but Syd likes the noise. Deedee asks what it's like to work with Carm, and Sydney remembers why she was so drawn to her talented, hardworking partner in the first place. She talks about the time visited Chef David's restaurant in New York so she could taste a Carmy Berzatto masterpiece. “You guys are very close,” Deedee says, and Sydney realizes that, despite the tension between them, it's true. With the same grace she showed when she left Natalie and Pete to gush over their newborn, Donna makes her exit so her son can stop cowering in fear. A wonderful farce unfolds as more Bears join. (Chester, hilariously, hates spiders but also loves them?) He chickens out and says math instead, but that bell can't be unrung. It's the exact inverse of Christmas at Donna's and not just because they're gathered under a table instead of around one. (Nat tells Pete there aren't any romantic vibes between them anymore, but I'm not convinced.) Meanwhile, Richie realizes that his jealousy toward Frank has been misplaced. Helping Evie to trust her stepdad doesn't mean he's replacing Richie; it just means he's made his daughter's support system even stronger. Sydney gets a text from Shapiro because she's been ghosting him yet again. We don't see her response, but we know what side she came down on when Richie asks what decision she's been nervous about. “I'm trying to tell people things,” he says, which Claire knows is terrifying for him. Tiff offers Jimmy her own painful truth: He and the rest of the Berzattos mean everything to her. Jimmy holds her close and promises that, for better or worse, she's a Bear forever. But then Teddy texts him a picture of their whole crazy family, sardined together under the table and grinning like idiots, and remembers that he has plenty of rocks to lean on.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Uma Thurman and Henry Golding join the returning cast in this follow-up to 2020's adaptation of the graphic novel series about immortal soldiers battling to protect humanity. A welcome surprise after months of COVID lockdown and upended release schedules, The Old Guard came along in 2020 to demonstrate that hard-charging action and emotionally textured drama need not be mutually exclusive. Its well-developed lead characters could handle themselves with MMA fight moves, knives, swords and Bronze Age axes. But they also had soulful interiority, their immortality sentencing them to existences of aching solitude and loss. Arriving five years later, Netflix's sequel has most of those elements, but it's missing the secret sauce — Gina Prince-Bythewood's commanding direction. Karlovy Vary's Krystof Mucha on Continuing the Legacy of Jiri Bartoska Joe's unabashed declaration of love and the passionate kiss they shared in the back of a truck full of macho armored thugs in the first movie was a gift to queer audiences starved for representation in superhero cinema. Release date: Wednesday, July 2Cast: Charlize Theron, KiKi Layne, Matthias Schoenaerts, Marwan Kenzari, Luca Marinelli, Veronica Van, Henry Golding, Uma Thurman, Chiwetel EjioforDirector: Victoria MahoneyScreenwriters: Greg Rucka, Sarah L. Walker Victoria Mahoney, who has directed extensively on episodic television as well as second unit on Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, does a polished job and maintains a confident pace. But the sequel ultimately is more competent than thrilling, and its moments of pathos too seldom resonate. The last film ended with Andy (Theron) mysteriously losing her immortality; fellow soldier Booker (Matthias Schoenaerts) exiled for 100 years because of a betrayal; and CIA agent Copley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) switching sides, pledging to use his expertise to cover the group's tracks and steer them to wherever their services were needed. A coda six months later showed Booker drowning his sorrows in Paris, coming home to find Quynh (Veronica Van) in his apartment. Did Netflix think two queer couples were too many?) Her ability, like her fellow immortals, to regenerate every time she dies means she has been coming back to life and drowning again for five centuries. She's fished out of the ocean and revealed gasping for breath in a brief prologue. While Nile (Layne) observes from a boat and Joe and Nicky distract some of the guards by speeding off in two vintage sportscars parked outside, Andy and Copley enter the mansion, where she conveniently finds a hefty sword hanging on the wall. Mahoney, cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, fight choreographer Georgi Manchev and the cast and stunt crew are all working at the top of their game here, with beatdown after beatdown, intercut with a pulse-racing car chase as Joe and Nicky are pursued by guards. When the protagonists regroup back at their safe house, Copley informs them that the dead man they believed to be the arms buyer was in fact just a conduit for an unidentified woman, seen in a CCTV photo awaiting facial recognition results. Tuah reveals that several volumes of his work were stolen by a woman of many names, now going by Discord (Uma Thurman), an immortal whose existence predates even Andy's. They learn that Discord has spent five centuries living in the shadows, amassing untold wealth and power. Andy's brooding nature gets fresh fuel with the vengeful Quynh's re-emergence, but with Nile now more accepting of her mentorship, the rapport between those two women acquires a new warmth and humor. There's an electrifying fight scene, freighted with emotional baggage and guilt, after Andy tracks Quynh down in Rome and they duke it out in an alley with lots of fancy footwork. While there's no shortage of guns, knives and assorted other blades used in the clashes, the emphasis on physicality, on body against body, is a strength shared by both movies. The hangout scenes once again are pleasurable, even if Kenzari and Marinelli are underutilized aside from their daredevilry in the early car chase. Nothing comes close to the swoony magic of their big moment in the first film, though it's sweet to watch them stagger off to bed together, with Joe playfully berating Nicky over his snoring when he's been drinking. But an intimate scene that appears to be building toward a kiss instead ends with them nuzzling foreheads. Still, the fact that these two have been spared much of the loneliness and sorrow suffered by their comrades because they have always had each other provides a tender note of queer affirmation. The climactic stretch, while it folds in some moving moments for Andy, becomes more routine once the action shifts to a Chinese-run secret nuclear facility in Indonesia, rigged with explosives. Everything points toward the inevitable smackdown between Andy and Discord — not to mention between Theron, whose fight skills have been on display not just in The Old Guard, but also in Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde, and Thurman, immortalized as Black Mamba in the Kill Bill movies. Whatever its shortcomings, The Old Guard 2 is a better-than-average original streaming feature — well acted by a highly capable cast, peppered with enough action to satisfy most appetites, and underscored with a melancholy vein of introspection about the conflicted roles of superheroes.
