                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new AI model is much better than doctors at identifying patients likely to experience cardiac arrest. The linchpin is the system's ability to analyze long-underused heart imaging, alongside a full spectrum of medical records, to reveal previously hidden information about a patient's heart health. The federally-funded work, led by Johns Hopkins University researchers, could save many lives and also spare many people unnecessary medical interventions, including the implantation of unneeded defibrillators. "Currently we have patients dying in the prime of their life because they aren't protected and others who are putting up with defibrillators for the rest of their lives with no benefit," said senior author Natalia Trayanova, a researcher focused on using artificial intelligence in cardiology. "We have the ability to predict with very high accuracy whether a patient is at very high risk for sudden cardiac death or not." The findings are published today in Nature Cardiovascular Research. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is one of the most common inherited heart diseases, affecting one in every 200 to 500 individuals worldwide, and is a leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people and athletes. Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy will live normal lives, but a percentage are at significant increased risk for sudden cardiac death. It's been nearly impossible for doctors to determine who those patients are. Current clinical guidelines used by doctors across the United States and Europe to identify the patients most at risk for fatal heart attacks have about a 50% chance of identifying the right patients, "not much better than throwing dice," Trayanova says. The team's model significantly outperformed clinical guidelines across all demographics. People with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develop fibrosis, or scarring, across their heart and it's the scarring that elevates their risk of sudden cardiac death. People have not used deep learning on those images. We are able to extract this hidden information in the images that is not usually accounted for." The AI model also can describe why patients are high risk so that doctors can tailor a medical plan to fit their specific needs. "Our study demonstrates that the AI model significantly enhances our ability to predict those at highest risk compared to our current algorithms and thus has the power to transform clinical care," says co-author Jonathan Crispin, a Johns Hopkins cardiologist. In 2022, Trayanova's team created a different multi-modal AI model that offered personalized survival assessment for patients with infarcts, predicting if and when someone would die of cardiac arrest.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This pilot study evaluates a newly developed point-of-care (PoC) device designed to measure bilirubin levels in human blood serum using a microfluidic cartridge and optoelectronic sensing module. Accurate bilirubin measurement is critical for assessing liver function and diagnosing conditions such as jaundice and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Traditional laboratory methods are accurate but not suitable for rapid or resource-limited settings due to their complexity. The goal of this study was to determine if the new portable PoC device could deliver comparable accuracy and clinical utility. Serum samples from 20 patients with bilirubin concentrations ranging from 2 μmol/L to 480 μmol/L were analyzed using both the PoC device and a standard laboratory method (the diazo method via the Abbott Alinity system). The PoC device employed dual-wavelength light detection (455 nm and 530 nm) and microfluidic flow to analyze small-volume samples. Bland-Altman analysis showed a small mean difference (−5.6 μmol/L) with no systematic bias. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated high diagnostic performance, with 90% sensitivity and 97% specificity in classifying bilirubin levels across clinical thresholds. The study concludes that the microfluidic-based PoC device offers a promising alternative for bilirubin testing, especially in settings where traditional lab infrastructure is unavailable. Although the sample size was small, the device met clinical accuracy standards and performed well compared to existing PoC solutions like Bilistick and BiliDx. The authors recommend larger-scale studies for further validation, including testing in patient populations with varying clinical profiles such as neonates and individuals with liver disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a common cause of hospital admissions and a major reason for emergency colon surgery, they add. To shed more light on this, the researchers derived an overall healthy lifestyle score (0-5) for diverticulitis from survey responses for 179,564 participants drawn from three prospective studies: the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHSII, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. The score was based on 5 elements that have independently been associated with heightened risks of developing diverticulitis: smoking; weight (BMI); physical activity; fibre intake; and red/processed meat intake. The association between this score and incident diverticulitis was confirmed among 30,750 participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). Genetic risk was assessed using a polygenic risk score (PRS) in 36,077 people with available genotype information. And higher levels of physical activity were associated with a 16% reduced risk compared with lower levels. While higher fibre intake was associated with a 14% lower risk, higher red meat intake was associated with a 9% increased risk. And every 1-point increase in healthy lifestyle score was associated with a 12% lower risk of diverticulitis. The findings were consistently observed across all three studies and in different racial groups. The association between healthy lifestyle score and incident diverticulitis was confirmed among 30,750 participants in the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS). Some 2183 new cases of diverticulitis were reported during an average monitoring period of nearly 12 years in this group. Genetic risk was assessed using a polygenic (cumulative) risk score (PRS) in 36,077 people with available genotype information in the NHS, NHSII, and HPFS groups. There were no notable differences in lifestyle factors across PRS categories, but PRS was significantly associated with incident diverticulitis. For each unit increase in PRS, the risk increased by 58%, and was particularly evident among those under the age of 60. For example, those in the lowest PRS category and with a healthy lifestyle score of 4-5 were 37% less likely to develop diverticulitis compared to those with a score of 0. Similarly, those with a medium PRS were 48% less likely to do so, while those in the highest PRS category were 50% less likely to do so. Further analysis showed that adopting a healthy lifestyle might prevent 23–42% of diverticulitis cases across PRS categories. And when the effect of PRS and a healthy lifestyle score were combined, those in the highest PRS category with a healthy lifestyle score of 0 or 1 were 5 times more likely to develop diverticulitis than those in the lowest PRS category with a score of 4 or 5. This is an observational study, and as such, can't establish cause. And the researchers acknowledge that ascertainment of diverticulitis was based on different approaches across the different studies. Nevertheless, they conclude: "Our data provide consistent evidence from multiple data sets indicating that adherence to a healthy lifestyle is linked to a reduced risk of developing diverticulitis, irrespective of one's genetic predisposition."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a large cohort, long-acting lipoglycopeptides (laLGPs) demonstrated comparable effectiveness to standard-of-care antibiotics for step-down treatment of serious Gram-positive bacterial infections in both individuals who used drugs and those who did not. “Our study highlighted utilization patterns and supported the clinical effectiveness of laLGPs in serious bacterial infections among a diverse patient population. While awaiting a randomized clinical trial, large national databases could help clinicians understand laLGPs' efficacy, especially for off-label use among PWUD [people who use drugs] individuals,” the authors wrote. This study was led by David Goodman-Meza, MD, PhD, Kirby Institute, Sydney, Australia. It was published online on May 21, 2025, in JAMA Network Open. The classification of people who use drugs relied solely on diagnostic codes, which may not have accurately represented the true population. Additionally, adherence to antibiotic therapy and completion of standard-of-care therapy could not be directly measured in this analysis. This study received internal funding from the UCLA Department of Medicine and grants from the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, the US National Institute on Mental Health, and others. Two authors reported having financial ties with several pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Inc., Gilead Sciences Inc., Janssen, and Global Services LLC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This research project will focus on developing more accurate metabolism models that will reduce the reliance on costly laboratory experiments while improving speed, efficiency and sustainability in drug discovery. The PhD research will address a critical need in modern drug development. To overcome the limited amount of available experimental data, existing predictive models use hybrid approaches that combine machine learning with physics-based methods. This project aims to replace those methods with more efficient and accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). These improved models will enable pharmaceutical teams to better identify risks associated with drug metabolism and guide the design of optimal compounds for synthesis, saving time and reducing costs while aligning their efforts with green chemistry principles. This research will specifically target MLIPs for drug-like molecules and metabolism mediated by Cytochrome P450 enzymes, a family responsible for the metabolism of 70-80% of all small molecule drugs. This integration ensures immediate practical relevance and positions Optibrium to deliver even greater value to pharmaceutical companies seeking efficient and sustainable drug development solutions. This initiative supports the EU's Green Deal objectives by training future experts in sustainable chemistry and biotechnology. INNOCHEMBIO will co-finance 15 PhD positions in total, with the first call for applications now open. Industry-academia collaborations like this provide PhD candidates with unique insights into real-world challenges whilst ensuring their research has immediate practical impact. The models we develop will directly improve our ability to support pharmaceutical researchers in making more informed decisions earlier in the drug discovery process."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful" budget reconciliation bill would make some of the most sweeping changes in health policy in years, largely affecting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act plans — with reverberations felt throughout the health care system. But using reconciliation to constrict rather than expand health coverage, as the GOP is attempting now? One of the best-known programs born via reconciliation is the "COBRA" health insurance continuation, which allows people who leave jobs with employer-provided insurance to keep it for a time, as long as they pay the full premium. Also included was the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals that take Medicare to treat or transfer patients with medical emergencies, regardless of their insurance status — a law that's become a focus of abortion opponents as they seek to limit access to the procedure. A key reason so much health policy has passed this way has to do with how Congress manages the federal budget. Federal government spending falls into two categories: mandatory, or spending required by existing law, and discretionary, which traditionally is allocated and renewed each year as part of the appropriations process. Lawmakers use the reconciliation process to make changes to mandatory spending programs — Medicare and Medicaid are among the largest — as well as tax policy. (For complicated political reasons, reconciliation bills cannot touch Social Security, the last prong in the entitlement program trifecta.) Reconciliation comes into play only if it is needed to reconcile taxes or mandatory spending to comply with the terms Congress sets for itself each year, through the annual budget resolution. This year the GOP's focus is finding the cash to renew Trump's expiring tax cuts, which largely benefit wealthier Americans, and boost military and border security spending. Usually, reconciliation instructions call for reductions in payments to health providers under Medicare — which costs the most of the federal health programs. As a result, all manner of now-familiar health programs were created by budget reconciliation bills, many of which provided health coverage to more Americans. The 1989 reconciliation bill created a new system for paying doctors who treat Medicare patients, as well as a new federal agency to study the cost, quality, and effectiveness of health care, today known as the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Children's health has been a popular add-on over the years, including the gradual expansion of Medicaid coverage to more children based on family income. The 1997 reconciliation bill created the Children's Health Insurance Program, which today provides insurance to more than 7 million children. In fact, the list of major health bills of the past 50 years not passed using budget reconciliation is short. The biggest health care law of recent decades — the Affordable Care Act — didn't start out as a reconciliation bill, but it ended up using the process to clear its final hurdles.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new study, Microsoft's AI-powered diagnostic system outperformed experienced doctors in solving the most challenging medical cases faster, cheaper, and more accurately. *Important notice:  arXiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information. A recent study on the ArXiv preprint server compared the diagnostic accuracy and resource expenditure of AI systems with those of clinicians regarding complex cases. The Microsoft AI team demonstrated the efficient use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine to tackle diagnostic challenges that physicians struggle to decipher. Often, physicians diagnose patients for an ailment through a clinical reasoning process that involves step-by-step, iterative questioning and testing. Even with limited initial information, clinicians narrow down the possible diagnosis by questioning the patient and confirming through biochemical tests, imaging, biopsy, and other diagnostic procedures. Solving a complex case requires a wide-ranging set of skills, including determining the most critical following questions or tests, staying aware of test costs to prevent increasing patient burden, and recognizing evidence to make a confident diagnosis. Multiple studies have demonstrated the enhanced efficiency of language models (LMs) in performing in medical licensing exams and highly structured diagnostic vignettes. However, the performance of most LMs was evaluated under artificial conditions, which drastically differ from real-world clinical settings. Most LMs models for diagnostic assessments are based on a multiple-choice quiz, and the diagnosis is made from a predefined answer set. A reduced sequential diagnosis cycle increases the risk of overstating static benchmarks' model competence. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an AI system based on a sequential diagnosis cycle to improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce test costs. To overcome the above-stated drawbacks of LMs models for clinical diagnosis, scientists have developed the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark (SDBench) as an interactive framework to evaluate diagnostic agents (human or AI) through realistic sequential clinical encounters. This journal typically publishes case records of patients from Massachusetts General Hospital in a detailed, narrative format. These cases are among the most diagnostically challenging and intellectually demanding in clinical medicine, often requiring multiple specialists and diagnostic tests to confirm a diagnosis. SDBench recast 304 cases from the 2017- 2025 NEJM clinicopathological conference (CPC) into stepwise diagnostic encounters. Information Gatekeeper is a language model that selectively discloses clinical details from a comprehensive case file only when explicitly queried. It can also provide additional case-consistent information for tests not described in the original CPC narrative. AI agents were evaluated on all 304 NEJM cases, while physicians were assessed on a held-out subset of 56 test-set cases. Physicians practicing in the USA and UK with a median of 12 years of clinical experience achieved 20% diagnostic accuracy at an average cost of $2,963 per case on SDBench, highlighting the benchmark's inherent difficulty. Physicians spent an average of 11.8 minutes per case, requesting 6.6 questions and 7.2 tests. GPT -4o outperformed physicians in terms of both diagnostic accuracy and cost. Commercially available off-the-shelf models offered varied diagnostic accuracy and cost. The current study also introduced the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO), a platform co-designed with physicians, which exhibited higher diagnostic efficiency than human physicians and commercial language models. Compared to commercial LMs, MAI-DxO demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy and a significant reduction in medical costs of more than half. MAI-DxO accomplished this by simulating a virtual panel of “doctor agents” with different roles in hypothesis generation, test selections, cost-consciousness, and error checking. Unlike baseline AI prompting, this structured orchestration allowed the system to reason iteratively and efficiently. MAI-DxO is a model-agnostic approach that has demonstrated accuracy gains across various language models, not just the O3 foundation model. The current study's findings demonstrate AI systems' higher diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness when guided to think iteratively and act judiciously. SDBench and MAI-DxO provided an empirically grounded foundation for advancing AI-assisted diagnosis under realistic constraints. Furthermore, large-scale interactive medical benchmarks involving more than 304 cases are required. Incorporation of visual and other sensory modalities, such as imaging, could also enhance diagnostic accuracy without compromising cost efficiency. NEJM CPC cases are selected for their difficulty and do not reflect everyday clinical presentations. The study did not include healthy patients or measure false positive rates. Moreover, diagnostic cost estimates are based on U.S. pricing and may vary globally. The models were also tested on a held-out test set of recent cases (2024-2025) to assess generalization and avoid overfitting, as many of these cases were published after the training cutoff for most models. The paper also raises a broader question: Should we compare AI systems to individual physicians or full medical teams? Since MAI-DxO mimics multi-specialist collaboration, the comparison may reflect something closer to team-based care than individual practice. Nonetheless, the research suggests that structured AI systems like MAI-DxO may one day support or augment clinicians, particularly in settings where specialist access is limited or expensive. *Important notice:  arXiv publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Patients with these lymphomas may require stem cell transplants, but the disease needs to be brought under control before patients can undergo this treatment. A new study by investigators from PETAL Consortium at Mass General Brigham found the combination of duvelisib and romidepsin to be effective, tolerable and safe for patients with R/R PTCL and CTCL. Their findings suggest that this drug combination offers a novel strategy to help these patients control the disease in order to be eligible for stem cell transplants. The results are published in Blood Advances. This real-world study builds upon prior clinical trials by providing a more comprehensive view of using the drug combination in clinical practice, including variations in clinical setting, prescribing patterns, and adverse event management within a diverse, higher-risk population. Despite dose modifications and interruptions, high response rates were observed in patients." Josie Ford, BS, first author, clinical research coordinator at Massachusetts General Hospital Clinicians administered the treatment to 38 patients, tracking treatment effectiveness, how long the patient lived and side effects. Study outcomes showed that the drug combination helped shrink or eliminate cancer in 61% of patients, with 47% having no detectable cancer. Eleven patients went on to receive stem cell transplants. The drug combination had manageable side effects, but one patient died from treatment-related complications. "Future direction would lie in determining markers of response or resistance, ideally through non-invasive monitoring so the treatment can be personalized."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), a type of arthritis commonly occurring in children, is a chronic, inflammatory condition that affects the joints, causing pain, swelling, stiffness, and limiting the range of motion. An imbalance between the regulatory and effector immune cells, primarily driven by the adaptive immune system and induced by both genetic and environmental factors, contributes to the pathogenesis of JIA. Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 14 JIA patients and four healthy controls (HCs) showed an increase in the levels of monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and platelets in JIA, along with a more pronounced pro-inflammatory response in JIA patients, particularly in sJIA versus non-sJIA subtypes. A comparison of CD4+ cell transcriptomic profiles of sJIA, non-sJIA, and HC cells showed enrichment of DEGs associated with regulating intrinsic apoptotic signaling and VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling pathways in the sJIA and non-sJIA groups. Similarly, the CD8+ transcriptomic profiles of the three groups showed a stronger inflammatory response, lymphocyte migration, and cytotoxicity in the sJIA subtype compared to non-sJIA, while T-cell apoptosis was higher in non-sJIA. Additionally, the B-cell response to IFN was stronger in sJIA than in non-sJIA, which suggests that while VEGFA/VEGFR2 signaling is associated with JIA pathogenesis, IFN may be one of the factors contributing to the different clinical manifestations of sJIA and non-sJIA. CellChat analysis revealed that interactions between the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, monocytes, and NK cells with other cell populations were abundant in both sJIA and non-sJIA cases, and macrophage MIF was expressed abundantly in all cell types. This study identified a new ligand-receptor pair, MIF (CD74-CXCR2), in the sJIA subtype, whose ligand CXCR2 is expressed only in monocytes. In conclusion, this study, the first to characterize the single-cell transcriptomic profile of immune cells in different subtypes of primary JIA, holds significant implications for the precise diagnosis and classification of JIA and may guide the development of personalized treatment strategies for JIA patients.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The three most common reasons schools called emergency medical services (EMS) were for neurological crises such as seizures, psychiatric conditions or substance abuse, and trauma related injuries, according to data from the national EMS registry analyzed by researchers from Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Michael Harries, MD, MAT, MA, lead author, Pediatric Emergency Medicine Fellow at Lurie Children's The authors point out that national advocacy efforts around passing Seizure Safe Schools legislation are ongoing and effective. The model bill recommended by the Epilepsy Foundation seeks to ensure not only that staff are trained, but that seizure medication is available and first-aid responders are legally protected. The American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on medical emergencies in schools, issued in 2022, specifies the available training programs for school staff, and the medications and equipment that schools should have on hand to respond quickly to potentially life-threatening emergencies. The study found that physical trauma occurred more frequently in elementary school age students (17 percent), while psychiatric conditions and substance abuse were more common among adolescents (18 percent). "Given the ongoing mental health crisis in youth, we were not surprised to find that psychiatric conditions and substance abuse were among the most common emergencies in schools," said senior author Sriram Ramgopal, MD, Emergency Medicine physician at Lurie Children's and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. "Our findings underscore the need for schools to proactively address mental health needs of students, especially teenagers. This may include establishing relationships with local mental health care facilities and improved training for staff on how best to respond to a psychiatric crisis. Overall, we need consistent policies across the country to ensure that all schools are prepared for common medical emergencies."
