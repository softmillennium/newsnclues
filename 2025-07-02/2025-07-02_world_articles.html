Ukraine's military intelligence agency (HUR) released on July 1 video footage showing domestically produced drones striking multiple Russian air defense assets and a fighter jet in occupied Crimea in what it described as a successful special operation.

The undated footage shows the combat use of UJ-26 drones, commonly known as Bober (Beavers), targeting high-value Russian military systems.

"These reliable weapons in the hands of HUR special forces are turning critically important Russian targets into useless scrap," the agency said in a statement. 

HUR added that the Bober drones are effectively "gnawing through" Russia's expensive air defense systems "like barberries."

The released footage shows that the strikes destroyed or severely damaged several Russian military assets, including a Pantsir-S1 air defense system and its crew, a Niobium-SV radar, a Pechora-3 coastal radar, a Protivnik-GE radar, and a Su-30 fighter jet stationed at the Saky airfield in occupied Crimea. 

The Kyiv Independent could not verify HUR's claims.

The strikes are part of Ukraine's ongoing efforts to degrade Russian military capabilities in Crimea, which has been under Russian occupation since 2014. Moscow reported Ukrainian drone strikes against the peninsula earlier on July 1, with the Crimean Wind Telegram channel reporting attacks in the vicinity of S-300/S-400 air defense systems.

Ukraine has increasingly deployed new drone systems to target Russian military assets on the front line and deep inside the Russian rear.

The Iranian Foreign Ministry has summoned the Ukrainian charge d'affaires to protest "inappropriate remarks" by Kyiv regarding recent Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran, the ministry said on July 1.

Tehran threatened Ukraine with unspecified "consequences" should such statements be repeated.

The diplomatic spat follows a wave of Israeli and U.S. air strikes targeting Iran's nuclear program, with Iranian forces attacking Israel and a U.S. base in Qatar in response.

Highlighting Iran's military support for Russian aggression against Ukraine, Kyiv responded by calling for the dismantling of the Iranian nuclear program to prevent it from threatening the Middle East or the wider world.

In response, Shahram Farsaei, head of the Iranian Foreign Ministry's Eurasian affairs department, relayed a protest note to Ukraine via the Ukrainian envoy in Iran, Kyrylo Pozdniakov. The ministry did not specify what exact comments prompted the reaction from the Iranian side.

Tehran also said that Ukrainian officials have "disregarded Ukraine's international legal obligations concerning respect for the principles and purposes of the U.N. Charter as well as the four Geneva Conventions."

Iran has provided ballistic missiles and thousands of Shahed drones to Russia, directly backing its armed aggression in Ukraine, itself launched in violation of international law and the U.N. Charter.

Moscow has backed Iran diplomatically after U.S. and Israeli attacks, urging a response from the U.N. Security Council and calling the attacks an "unprovoked aggression."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Israeli airstrike has killed one of Gaza's most senior doctors in a “catastrophic” loss to the already decimated healthcare system. A number of family members were reported to have been killed alongside him. “The killing of Dr Marwan al-Sultan by the Israeli military is a catastrophic loss to Gaza and the entire medical community, and will have a devastating impact on Gaza's healthcare system,” said Muath Alser, director of HWW. This is a tragic loss of life, but also an obliteration of their decades of lifesaving medical expertise and care at a time when the situation facing Palestinian civilians is unfathomably catastrophic,” Alser added. He cannot be replaced,” said Dr Mohammed Abu Selmia, director of al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. “He was a prominent scholar and one of the two remaining cardiologists left in Gaza. Bara'a, who was also working as a paramedic, was at an apartment block in Gaza City's al-Tuffah neighbourhood on 9 June treating people injured in an Israeli airstrike when the building was hit for a second time by Israeli artillery, killing everyone inside. “They were directly targeted,” said Afana, who says that Bara'a died alongside two other paramedics. If there had been some reaction from the world when healthcare workers were first targeted by the Israeli forces, they would have not dared to commit more of these attacks.” “He was kind and loved by everyone who knew him.” The total number of healthcare workers who have lost their lives in military attacks since the war began in October 2023 now exceeds 1,400 according to UN figures. Insecurity Insight, a conflict data NGO, says it has verified the deaths of hundreds of healthcare workers who have been killed inside health facilities, while attempting to reach wounded civilians, by Israeli sniper fire, when travelling in ambulances, while evacuating patients, at checkpoints and inside schools and refugee camps used as temporary shelters since October 2023. It is believed that hundreds more healthcare workers from Gaza remain in Israeli detention, where they have reported being tortured, beaten and held without charge. Medglobal, a medical NGO based in the US that provides medical services and care in Gaza, says it believes more than 300 medical staff are in Israeli prisons, among them senior physicians including Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, the director of the Kamal Adwan hospital who has been held in detention since December 2024.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Program mirrors earlier successful mission to fight new world screwworm fly, whose larvae can infest living tissue The US government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot. That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the US from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. “It's an exceptionally good technology,” said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. The US Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies – sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. There are fewer larvae, and, over time, the fly population dies out. It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the US and other countries north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year. The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary. Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the new world screwworm fly and its old world counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers – and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus. “A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,” said Michael Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association. Veterinarians have effective treatments for animals suffering from an infestation, but it can still be unpleasant – and also cripple an animal with pain. The new world screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive midwestern or great plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating. One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: females mate only once in their weeks-long adult lives. Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the US temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September. But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans. It plans to spend $8.5m on the Texas site and $21m to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies. In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's extension service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people. Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.</p>

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox. The drinking water system, it said, was polluted with a contaminant commonly known as GenX, part of the family of “forever” PFAS chemicals. It came from a Chemours plant in Fayetteville, near the winding Cape Fear River. Given that certain types of PFAS have been linked to cancer, there was widespread anxiety over its potential danger. In its big-picture PFAS action plan from 2019, the agency said it would attack this complex problem on multiple fronts. After his first administration said PFOA and PFOS in drinking water should be regulated, standards were finalized under President Joe Biden. Four other types of PFAS, including GenX, were also tagged with limits. But now, the second Trump administration is pulling back. Among those who challenged the standards in court is Chemours, which has argued that the EPA, under Biden, “used flawed science and didn't follow proper rulemaking procedures” for GenX. These EPA decisions under Trump are part of a slew of delays and course changes to PFAS policies that had been supported in his first term. Even though his earlier EPA pursued a measure that would help hold polluters accountable for cleaning up PFAS, the EPA of his second term has not yet committed to it. In public appearances, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has pushed back on the suggestion that his agency weakened the drinking water limits on GenX and similar compounds. Future regulations imposed by his agency, he said, could be more or less stringent. “What we want to do is follow the science, period,” he has said. That sentiment perplexes scientists and environmental advocates, who say there is already persuasive evidence on the dangers of these chemicals that linger in the environment. In both 2018 and 2021, the agency pointed to animal studies linking it to cancer, as well as problems with kidneys, immune systems and, especially, livers. (Chemours has argued that certain animal studies have limited relevance to humans.) Scientists and advocates also said it's unclear what it means for the EPA to follow the science while diminishing its own ability to conduct research. “I don't understand why we would want to hamstring the agency that is designed to make sure we have clean air and clean water,” said Jamie DeWitt, a toxicologist in Oregon who worked with other scientists on Cape Fear River research. Its liability provisions would help hold polluters responsible for the cost of cleaning up. Moving forward with this designation process was a priority, according to the PFAS plan from Trump's first term. Zeldin's EPA describes that plan as “historic.” And, when he represented a Long Island district with PFAS problems in Congress, Zeldin voted for a bill that would have directed the EPA to take this step. Zeldin has said repeatedly that he wants to hold polluters accountable for PFAS, but his EPA requested three delays in the court case challenging the Superfund designation that helps make it possible. An annual bill that sets defense policy and spending, signed by Trump in his first term, had charged the EPA with developing such a process. It would help authorities understand their spread and determine what protections might be warranted. Its approach, the agency said, is to give more time for compliance and to work with water systems to reduce PFAS exposure as quickly as feasible, “rather than issue violations and collect fees that don't benefit public health.” “It's just a big unanswered question whether this administration and this EPA is going to be serious about enforcing anything,” said Robert Sussman, a former EPA official from the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. As a lawyer, he now represents environmental groups that filed an amicus brief in PFAS cases. Back in North Carolina, problems caused by the chemicals continue to play out. (The chemicals commonly called GenX refer to HFPO-DA and its ammonium salt, which are involved in the GenX processing aid technology owned by Chemours.) Chemours told ProPublica that it invested more than $400 million to remediate and reduce PFAS emissions. It also noted that there are hundreds of PFAS users in North Carolina, “as evidenced by PFAS seen upstream and hundreds of miles away” from its Fayetteville plant “that cannot be traced back to the site.” PFAS-riddled sea foam continues to wash up on the coastal beaches. Chemours and water utilities, meanwhile, are battling in court about who should cover the cost of upgrades to remove the chemicals from drinking water. Community forums about PFAS draw triple-digit crowds, even when they're held on a weeknight, said Emily Donovan, co-founder of the volunteer group Clean Cape Fear, which has intervened in federal litigation. Pulling back from the drinking water standards, in particular, is “disrespectful to this community.” In a 2020 update to its PFAS action plan, the EPA highlighted its support for North Carolina's investigation of GenX in the Cape Fear River. Zeldin, too, has boasted about advancing PFAS research in an April news release. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water,” he said. At about the same time, though, the agency terminated a host of congressionally appropriated grants for PFAS research, including over $15 million for projects focused on food and farmlands in places like Utah, Texas and Illinois. Scientists at Michigan State University, for example, were investigating how PFAS interacts with water, soil, crops, livestock and biosolids, which are used for fertilizer. They timed their latest study to this year's growing season, hired staff and partnered with a farm. “If you halt it right now,” she said, “what we're doing is we're undermining our ability to translate the science that we're developing into some policy and guidance to help people minimize their exposure to PFAS.” About a month after PFAS grants to research teams in Maine and Virginia were terminated for not being aligned with agency priorities, the agency reinstated them. Even if the Michigan State grants are reinstated, there could be lasting consequences, said Hui Li, the soil scientist who led both projects. Uncertainty, lost capacity and spending restrictions have stunted the work at an EPA lab in Duluth, Minnesota, that investigates PFAS and other potential hazards, according to several sources connected to it. As one source who works at the lab put it, “We don't know how much longer we will be operating as is.” Meanwhile, the agency is asking Congress to eliminate more than half of its own budget. That includes massive staffing cuts, and it would slash nearly all the money for two major programs that help states fund water and wastewater infrastructure. The other was spotlighted in a paper by Trump's first-term EPA, which said communities could use these funds to protect public health from PFAS. It trumpeted examples from places like Michigan and New Jersey. “These are really technical, difficult jobs,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. “And the EPA, by encouraging so many employees to leave, is also losing a lot of institutional knowledge and a lot of technical expertise.” Her voice shook as she reflected on the EPA's workforce, “some of the finest scientists I know,” and what their loss means for public well-being.

The parent company of CBS News, Paramount Global, announced Tuesday that it has agreed to pay U.S. President Donald Trump $16 million to settle what legal experts called an entirely meritless lawsuit over the media organization's handling of a pre-election “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. Paramount said the settlement deal does not include a formal apology, but the company agreed to release written transcripts of future “60 Minutes” interviews with presidential candidates. Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout. As Paramount engaged in talks with Trump's legal team over the lawsuit in recent weeks, press freedom advocates and members of Congress implored the organization not to settle, warning that caving to the president would reward and embolden his attacks on media outlets he views as his political enemies. ), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) similarly warned Paramount that a settlement with Trump could run afoul of federal anti-bribery laws. Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders USA, said in a statement Wednesday that the settlement was “a shameful decision by Paramount.” “Instead, they chose to reward Donald Trump for his petty legal assault against both. “Paramount's leaders chose to be on the wrong side of that dividing line, but they'd be mistaken to believe appeasing Trump today will stop his attacks in the future,” Weimers added. “News media owners are much better off standing strong than acquiescing.” This story has been updated to include a statement from Reporters Without Borders USA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the European Union evolves into a military alliance a la NATO, Russia must stay vigilant and prepare itself to respond to this threat, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko said. In a broadcast by the Rossiya-24 TV channel, he noted that the European Union is morphing from a peaceful project into "something resembling a very aggressive military bloc." "This is being shaped not only by decisions to provide it with additional military capabilities to develop the military-industrial complex but also in terms of its entire philosophy," Grushko asserted. "This is ideological, and that bothers us a lot because we would indeed have to deal with a new military organization which harbors aggressive intentions against Russia and develops its military strategy and organization accordingly, fosters military opportunities which directly create threats to us against which we have to defend. And we will do so," the senior Russian diplomat emphasized. That said, Grushko expressed doubts that Brussels' plans would result in the emergence of an "independent NATO." "One must keep in mind that the US controls NATO and NATO controls the European Union. If you read all strategic documents passed jointly by NATO and the EU, <...> they postulate the European Union's subordinate role with regard to NATO. That is, NATO formulates the tasks, and the European Union carries them out," he continued. "So it is very hard to separate the European Union and NATO," Grushko concluded.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lisa Lambert is the chief executive officer of Quantum Industry Canada. A new economic race is under way – beyond just jobs or growth. Quantum technologies harness the strange behaviour of nature at its smallest scales, unlocking a powerful new platform poised to transform industries and national security. Quantum computers, for example, use entirely different rules than today's machines, allowing them to solve certain problems – such as simulating molecules and optimizing complex systems – that are beyond the reach of even the most powerful conventional computers. Quantum has now become a defining front in that new economic race. Canada's quantum sector is already making global waves. Across the country, researchers and companies are solving problems once thought to be decades away. A striking example: three Canadian firms – Xanadu Quantum Technologies Inc., Nord Quantique and Photonic – have each recently made world-first breakthroughs in quantum error correction, one of the hardest challenges to scaling quantum computing systems. Their work is drawing international attention: All three were selected by DARPA – the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Products Agency (DARPA), which was behind the internet and the Global Positioning System – for its elite Quantum Benchmarking Initiative. These breakthroughs represent just one part of Canada's broader quantum strengths. Canada has what it takes to lead – but only if we act with urgency and intent. BTQ Technologies CEO buys as Carney puts quantum computing in the G7 spotlight Prime Minister Mark Carney has set a clear ambition: to build the strongest economy in the Group of Seven countries. In June, he declared quantum a core focus of Canada's G7 agenda. Inspired by the successes of DARPA, BOREALIS sends a clear message: Quantum is integral to Canada's economic and strategic future. We were one of the first countries to recognize the quantum opportunity, making early strategic investments that positioned us as a global leader. Canada made the right foundational bets: funding research, growing a base of talent and building an emerging quantum industry that delivers a global impact that exceeds our scale. Canada's National Quantum Strategy, launched in 2021, is no longer globally competitive. Other countries are scaling fast, backed by strategic investment and national urgency. If we don't move now, we'll be locked out of systems, supply chains and decision-making tables being built without us – shutting us out of the very systems we helped make possible. Canada led groundbreaking AI research, built aerospace clusters from scratch and developed world-class telecom networks. But too often we've stopped short of translating scientific leadership into lasting economic and strategic advantage. We have been strong in discovery, but slow on scale. If we want to lead in quantum – and secure the greatest strategic advantage for Canada – we can't just innovate. Industrialization builds capacity: fabrication, integration, secure supply chains and deployment at scale. It's how we ensure that high-paying jobs, national prosperity and strategic control stay in Canada. Without it, we may be forced to rely on others for the very systems that underpin our economy and security. Quantum is not niche; it's a nation-building project. We need co-ordinated public-private investment, agile procurement and bold, milestone-based support that accelerates scale and sends a clear signal to global markets. Some of our most strategic companies are being eyed by foreign investors. McKinsey & Co. estimates that quantum technologies could unlock upward of US$2-trillion by 2035. Canada's National Research Council projects it could contribute more than 3 per cent of our gross domestic product by 2045, rivalling aerospace in scale and strategic importance. And every delay increases the chance we'll be left behind – for good. It will deliver economic resilience, national security and long-term strategic relevance for Canada. We can help shape the future or depend on systems with Canadian roots that were ultimately built and owned by others.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A village in Chicago's south suburbs is poised to purchase Pope Leo XIV's childhood home after its board voted unanimously on Tuesday to take control of the property. Leo, known before as Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected in May as the first American pope – a decision that stunned many in the United States who celebrated his ascension as a historic moment. A surreal moment as America celebrates its first pope — and wonders what his election means “We can either seize this moment and move it forward, or we can let that moment go to an investor,” Dolton Mayor Jason House said at a board meeting Tuesday. Other trustees at the Tuesday meeting joined the mayor in expressing support for the decision, with some citing the homes of Michael Jackson and Martin Luther King as examples of historic sites that have brought economic benefits for their communities. Officials, however, acknowledged the concerns and complaints of residents who say that traffic into the community has added further strain to already-dilapidated roads. “Purchasing the pope's house is admirable,” longtime Dolton resident Mary Avent told CNN affiliate WBBM, “but with the state we're in right now, I guess my concern is, do we have the money?” Avent told the outlet that Dolton currently lacks a police and fire chief, which she believes is more important. Trustee Edward Steave, at the Tuesday meeting, assured residents that their complaints were valid, but asserted “we can do this great thing at the same time.” It is unclear whether those repairs are being directed by the town. CNN has reached out to the Dolton Village Board for further information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For weeks, Trump and his team have promised Hill Republican leaders that he would deliver the headstrong GOP hardliners who are still vowing to defy the president on his agenda, according to three people familiar with the discussions. Now, it's all coming down to the wire. And Trump's key ally Speaker Mike Johnson is again facing a test of his powers in the narrowly divided House, as he seeks to steer his fractious conference to swallow a vote that many of them dislike. The White House brought in Dr. Mehmet Oz – who leads the agency in charge of Medicaid – to help educate members on related provisions in the Senate GOP bill, such as provider taxes and a bolstered fund for rural hospitals, and the potential impacts to hospitals in their districts, according to another person familiar with the discussions. Trump and Vice President JD Vance were both in attendance, helping to convince members to back the bill, those two people said. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told reporters after returning from the White House meeting with Oz, Trump and Vance. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise nodded to the importance of Trump's involvement in the discussions earlier Wednesday, telling reporters at the US Capitol, “The president from day one has been our best closer, and he's going to continue to be through today.” Both Johnson and Trump have been adamant that the bill land on Trump's desk in time for him to sign it on the Fourth of July, leaving almost no time for more talks. They also have almost no room for error: House Republicans can only afford to lose three votes if they have full attendance. So far, Republicans are still missing multiple members as lawmakers race to Washington after multiple storm-related flight delays. It all amounts to a pivotal week that could define Trump' second term: So far, the push to pass his agenda in Congress has been marred by weeks of tense GOP infighting that has even some Republicans worried about how the bill could play in the 2026 midterms. Yet if it passes next out of the House, Trump and his Hill allies believe it will help cement his legacy on issues like border security and tax policy – including fulfilling his campaign promises of no taxes on tips or overtime pay – while attempting to rein in federal spending by instituting work requirements for able-bodied adults for Medicaid and SNAP. Meetings were ongoing at the White House as of midday Wednesday, but key conservatives were still insisting they want to change the Senate bill — a promise that Trump and Johnson aren't willing to make. How about we send it back to him. Related article Here's how Trump's megabill will affect you Roy is a leading member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which outlined their opposition to the Senate's version of Trump's domestic policy bill in a new memo obtained by CNN. We have to get this thing right,” Harris said. Another possible “no” vote, Rep. Keith Self of Texas, said he was not invited to the White House. But it will likely take significant political muscle, as Johnson grapples with his own high-stakes battle between centrists and right-wing hardliners. The legislative brawl inside the US Capitol has also included some dramatic moments – including over the weekend when a key Republican, Sen. Thom Tillis, stunned Washington by announcing he would not seek reelection after defying Trump and voting to block his bill on the floor. (Within a day of Trump threatening to primary him, Tillis exited the race altogether.) Those high-stakes moments will likely continue on Capitol Hill. (That vote was already delayed by several hours Wednesday.) Some Republicans, including Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, still insist July 4 was an “arbitrary” deadline. Massie, who has consistently voted against the bill over his deficit concerns and has faced the ire of Trump, said he intends to stand firm against the bill. Asked if there was anything at all leadership could do to win his vote, he said, “We could go back to the drawing board.” Asked about the self-imposed deadline, he added: “There's no reason to bankrupt the country because you want to go shoot off some fireworks.” This headline and story has been updated with additional developments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. MICHAEL V. HAYDEN is a retired U.S. Air Force general who served as Director of the National Security Agency from 1999 to 2005 and Director of the CIA from 2006 to 2009. “Speak plainly!” Russian President Vladimir Putin snapped at his foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, at a televised security council meeting on the eve of his shambolic full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Once he had finally stammered out his support for recognizing the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states—the words Putin was waiting for—he was abruptly told to sit down, like an unprepared pupil flubbing an oral exam. Naryshkin's apparent ambivalence about embracing Putin's pretext for the war was likely due to the lack of solid intelligence that Putin's “special military operation” would return Kyiv to Moscow's imperial orbit. But rather than air any misgivings, Naryshkin chose compliance and conformity. Putin's unwavering belief that Ukraine would swiftly capitulate represents the greatest intelligence failure of his quarter-century tenure in power. He was furious when his invasion did not unfold as he envisioned, casting blame on and even arresting some senior security officials. Intelligence, in its best form, encourages political leaders to ask the right questions, challenge their assumptions, and consider what might go wrong. Although intelligence officers have a professional responsibility to adapt to the interests, foreign policy priorities, and preferred briefing style of the leaders they serve, sometimes the highest form of service an intelligence agency can provide is to disabuse its political masters of a strongly held but false idea. But under President Donald Trump, some of the same pathologies that make authoritarian regimes prone to intelligence failures are making the U.S. system similarly vulnerable. His populist, personalist style has led him to disregard the value of intelligence and abuse the agencies that produce it. In late June, the day before he sent U.S. bombers to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump dismissed Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's congressional testimony that Iran was not close to developing a nuclear weapon—an assessment that conflicted with the president's own claims. “I don't care what she says,” Trump said. After the U.S. strikes, he triumphantly declared that the targeted Iranian nuclear sites were “completely and totally obliterated,” whereas a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report made a more conservative estimation of the damage. The problem is not just that Trump himself belittles intelligence. His administration is also creating conditions in which senior officials tailor their assessments to please him. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said the “alleged ‘assessment' is flat-out wrong.” Gabbard and John Ratcliffe, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, quickly claimed to find “new intelligence” to support Trump's interpretation of events but declined to share it publicly. Increasingly staffed by loyalists rather than seasoned professionals—one critical counterterrorism office in the Department of Homeland Security suddenly found itself under the command of a recent university graduate with no national security experience—intelligence agencies risk becoming overly politicized, providing justification for policy decisions rather than informing them. Meanwhile, the United States faces serious national security threats, not least a heightened terrorism threat as Iranian-backed groups seek retaliation for the United States' strikes on Iran. Intelligence failures are inevitable even in healthy systems. Uncovering and properly assessing secrets is hard at the best of times; human fallibility guarantees that there will be errors in process and analysis. Intelligence officers in such systems operate in an environment where speaking truth to power is not tolerated, acquiescence is preferred over expertise, sycophancy trumps insight, and “alternative facts” must be presented to maintain the leader's preferred narrative. Offering good-faith assessments that contradict the ruler's views is considered disloyalty and invites punishment. Without space for analytical dissent and the presentation of unvarnished views, leaders can receive and act on faulty intelligence, as the hapless Naryshkin could attest. The United States today faces a similar risk. Trump's populism is characterized by deep skepticism toward credentialed authority and an intolerance of experts who present inconvenient facts or analysis that challenge his movement's core beliefs. As authoritarian leaders do, Trump has surrounded himself with loyalists who pass ideological litmus tests, such as by insisting that the 2020 election was “stolen” from Trump. The resulting culture of politicized analysis, self-censorship, and suppression of unwelcome truths mirrors the conditions in autocracies that generate intelligence failure. The most important qualification to serve Trump is personal loyalty, not competence or relevant experience. Several long-serving professionals have been asked who they voted for as a prerequisite for traditionally apolitical national security positions—a kind of loyalty test that disqualifies capable officers and sends a message to those who remain that continued service means compliance. Loyal senior intelligence officials serving a populist or an autocrat will often tailor their agencies' activities on the basis of what the leader may or may not want to hear. This can cause intelligence resources to be directed away from actual threats. As director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, Kash Patel has reorganized the agency to divert special agents and analysts toward immigration enforcement and the reduction of violent crime, leaving investigations into threats with more serious national security implications—counterterrorism, cybercrime, Chinese or Russian intelligence activity in the United States—underresourced. Although curtailing violent crime is a laudable goal, protecting U.S. national security requires that the FBI and other agencies manage a far wider array of risks. This is not the only example of the Trump administration's sidelining or shuttering intelligence units that focus on foreign malign influence operations, nor is it the only redirection of resources away from serious threats to serve political interests. In early May, Gabbard directed U.S. intelligence agencies to increase their intelligence collection in Greenland, specifically to assess the strength of the island's independence movement. If they are wasting valuable resources on nonexistent threats or dubious schemes to take control of other countries' territories, they are more likely to be surprised by the plans and intentions of adversaries such as China, Iran, and Russia. Politicians are always tempted to strip out caveats, overstate analytical confidence levels, or downplay dissenting views, as Trump did when he dismissed as “inconclusive” the DIA's initial report on damage to the Iranian nuclear program. His is not the first U.S. administration to prefer intelligence that fits around a particular policy narrative. In both cases, cherry-picking intelligence led U.S. presidents toward strategic failure. When they first reached this conclusion, Gabbard's chief of staff, a Trump loyalist, asked the council to “relook” at the evidence and “do some rewriting” so that the assessment would not be “used against” Gabbard or Trump—a nakedly political request. It is easy to foresee how firing intelligence officials for making evidence-based assessments could drive those still serving to engage in self-censorship and groupthink, both key ingredients in intelligence failure that are prevalent in autocratic systems. And if the president only receives assessments designed to please him, he will become stuck in his own echo chamber, unable to make fully informed decisions based on hard reality. If the United States' allies and partners consider U.S. intelligence untrustworthy or worry that their own intelligence may become politicized, they may choose to share less with Washington, which could rob U.S. intelligence agencies of a vital clue they may need to foil a plot or understand a key development. Cooperation with foreign agencies is a central part of U.S. intelligence gathering. Washington itself has enormous capabilities, but it cannot replace the collection and analysis provided by its partners. While publicly claiming that its actions are meant to depoliticize U.S. intelligence agencies, the Trump administration has in fact politicized them further by pressuring them to produce assessments that reinforce preferred policy narratives, dismissing assessments that don't, purging staff members who are perceived to be disloyal, and harassing the workforce through methods such as random polygraph tests conducted under the guise of leak investigations. It is clear to members of the civil service that their positions are subject to the administration's whims. Like the NIC leaders, they could be fired for simply doing their jobs. Like staff members working in diversity, equity, and inclusion offices, they could be fired for doing a job the administration did not want done. Like six National Security Council staffers who were let go after Trump met with the far-right activist Laura Loomer, they could be fired for perceived disloyalty. Or, like the director and deputy director of the National Security Agency, they could be fired for no stated reason at all. Administrative chaos masquerading as cost-cutting has sapped morale. In March, Trump's adviser Elon Musk and staffers at his so-called Department of Government Efficiency visited the CIA and the NSA headquarters, sending shivers down the spines of career professionals. Not only does their premature departure deprive the administration of their expertise and experience, but the cancellation of job offers means they will not be replaced by promising young officers brimming with passion and patriotism. Ideally, intelligence agencies should welcome and harness talent from all corners. During World War II, British intelligence benefited from Alan Turing's codebreaking genius in part because he kept his homosexuality hidden. Unfortunately, the Trump administration is repelling talent by making it clear that it no longer values diverse perspectives in U.S. intelligence agencies. A U.S. intelligence community that increasingly operates like that of an autocratic country will struggle to retain employees and recruit new ones. At the moment, public service may not look appealing to America's best and brightest. Thousands of intelligence officers are tapping their professional networks and getting their secret resumes cleared so that they can apply for private-sector jobs. A nervous and preoccupied workforce will hardly deliver peak performance. Demonizing intelligence ultimately makes the United States less safe. Federal law enforcement, for instance, relies on tips from citizens; repeatedly calling the FBI “irredeemably corrupt”—in the words of its deputy director—may dissuade people from cooperating when approached by special agents. And if Trump-aligned media outlets are spouting populist rhetoric about the threat from within—specifically, the threat that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies pose to civil liberties—politicians may find it difficult to support legislation that enables necessary intelligence gathering. Judging by the infrequency of his briefings in this area—his public schedule has not included more than one per week, in contrast to the six per week that his predecessors typically received—he seems uninterested in the advantages good intelligence can confer. He operates on instinct and often justifies his polices as “common sense,” which is the sort of populist heuristic approach that does not align with the methodical process of intelligence analysts. His ideological positions run headlong into empiricism, as the administration's fight with economists over the effects of its tariff policy has shown. It could take the form of a surprise attack, a misreading of an adversary, or an inability to anticipate another consequential event. Warnings, repeatedly dismissed with prejudice, may eventually stop arriving. Fear of retribution could cause officials to self-censor or avoid providing assessments that may provoke an ideologically motivated backlash, such as alerts about domestic violent extremism among far-right groups or about Russian information operations. As the former senior CIA analyst Brian O'Neill wrote in Just Security last month, “the next intelligence failure will not be a surprise. An intelligence failure on his watch may not compel Trump to fix the problems that caused it. Instead, he could blame U.S. intelligence agencies for falling down on the job or even falsely suggest that they were always out to get him. Any reform his administration introduced after an intelligence failure would likely be designed to further politicize the intelligence community, weaken its independence, and give the executive branch greater control of its budgets, personnel, and authorities. But those agencies will not be reaching their highest potential; if they are consistently misused, ignored, and politicized, they will not be able to produce the information advantage that the intelligence community was designed to deliver to the U.S. president. Ensuring American security today and for future generations depends on his good stewardship of this national treasure.

WASHINGTON, July 2. /TASS/. The US Department of Defense has suspended deliveries of air defense system missiles and precision-guided munitions to Ukraine due to depleted stockpiles, Politico reported citing sources.

According to the report, the decision to halt the shipments was initiated by US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby. It followed an internal review of US ammunition stockpiles, which raised concerns over the sharp decline in the overall number of artillery shells, air defense missiles, and precision-guided munitions.

Politico sources noted that the decision to suspend certain aid deliveries, originally approved under former US President Joe Biden's administration, was made in early June but has only now gone into effect.

When asked by TASS to comment on the Politico publication, the Pentagon stated that the US Armed Forces are "fully equipped to deter against any threat." According to Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell, "Our service members are fully equipped to deter against any threat, and the Senate's recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill ensures that our weapons and defense systems are modernized to protect against 21st century threats for generations to come.".</p>
