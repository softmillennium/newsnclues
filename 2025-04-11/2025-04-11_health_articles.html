                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new research perspective was published in Oncotarget, Volume 16, on April 4, 2025, titled "GSK3β activation is a key driver of resistance to Raf inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma cells." In this work, first author Diana Crisan and corresponding author Abhijit Basu from the University Hospital Ulm led a team that presents experimental evidence pointing to the protein GSK3β as a key contributor to drug resistance in melanoma. Their findings suggest that GSK3β becomes increasingly active in cancer cells during treatment, helping them survive and adapt despite ongoing therapy with BRAF inhibitors. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer in which nearly half of patients have mutations in the BRAF gene that accelerate tumor growth. This research perspective explores how GSK3β, a protein involved in metabolism and cell survival, becomes more active in melanoma cells that develop resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Over time, the cancer cells developed resistance and showed a marked increase in GSK3β levels. This pattern was confirmed across multiple melanoma cell models, suggesting that the finding is consistent and reliable. Importantly, the researchers observed that treating resistant cancer cells with a GSK3β inhibitor significantly reduced their growth. This result suggests that blocking this protein could restore sensitivity to treatment, highlighting GSK3β as a promising therapeutic target and supporting the idea of combining GSK3β inhibitors with existing melanoma therapies. "Remarkably, treatment of BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells with the GSK3 inhibitor LY2090314 for three weeks could overcome resistance and significantly decreased melanoma cell growth, confirming the causal role of GSK3 activation for BRAFi resistance development." It shows that resistance is not driven only by genetic mutations but may also involve adaptive changes in the cell's internal signaling and survival mechanisms. By identifying GSK3β as a potential contributor, the authors offer a new direction for improving the durability of targeted treatments in melanoma. As research continues, GSK3β may be a critical factor in the long-term success of melanoma therapy, particularly for patients who have stopped responding to standard BRAF-targeted drugs. GSK3β activation is a key driver of resistance to Raf inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma cells.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The use of virtual reality haptic simulators can enhance skill acquisition and reduce stress among dental students during preclinical endodontic training, according to a new study published in the International Endodontic Journal. The study aimed to evaluate the influence of virtual reality (VR) haptic simulators on skill acquisition and stress reduction in endodontic preclinical education of dental students. During preclinical training, dental students develop manual dexterity, psychomotor skills and confidence essential in clinical practice. VR and haptic technology are increasingly used alongside conventional methods, enabling more repetition and standardised feedback, among other things. In the present study, 40 volunteered dental students enrolled in preclinical endodontic training were randomly divided into two groups. One group trained with VR haptic simulators before practicing on artificial teeth, while the other practiced on artificial teeth first, followed by VR simulator. All received standardised lectures and demonstrations on access cavity preparation. Students who started their training with VR haptic simulators demonstrated significantly higher manual dexterity scores and self-assessed proficiency, as well as lower anxiety levels during preclinical training sessions, compared to the other group. In addition, they felt better prepared and more confident in performing access cavity preparations and managing procedural challenges. Stress levels were notably reduced following simulator practice in both groups. Simulator-based performance metrics were similar between the groups. The researchers point out that further research is needed to explore long-term effects and optimal integration strategies for VR simulators in dental curricula.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>UK-based blood testing company Thriva has joined forces with medical device manufacturer Tasso to use their innovative blood testing technology to tackle needle phobia, a condition that affects at least 1 in 10 adults. This health tech collaboration aims to make blood testing accessible and pain-free for individuals who experience an intense fear of needles by using a non-invasive, needle-free method. Needle phobia often deters people from seeking essential medical care, including preventative health measures. It is estimated that 10% of adults avoid vaccinations or medical procedures due to this reason, a decision that can have long-term health consequences. These fears can stem from a variety of psychological and physiological factors, including vasovagal responses (fainting due to a drop in blood pressure), hyperalgesia (heightened sensitivity to pain), and traumatic past experiences with needles. Harriet Evans, 24, from the Lake District, shares her experience with needle phobia: 'I've been scared of needles for as long as I can remember. There were a lot of blood tests, and I remember them sticking all sorts of things in my arms and hands. Thriva's blood tests screen for a variety of health issues using biomarkers in the blood, including cardiovascular health, liver function, hormonal balance, kidney function, iron levels and nutritional deficiencies providing comprehensive data to support people to manage their health. Unlike traditional methods that rely on finger pricks or venous blood draws, Thriva's personalized blood testing services uses the Tasso device, empowering users to track their health progress over time via regular testing (usually every 3-6 months). After testing, users receive a report by a GP in plain English, offering personalized lifestyle change recommendations based on the results. Tasso complements this approach with its innovative Tasso+ device, which enables virtually painless blood collection. The device uses advanced technology to collect whole liquid blood samples without the need for needles or finger pricks. This user-friendly solution allows individuals to perform tests at home, in their own time, fostering a sense of control that is particularly beneficial for those with needle phobia. Reflecting on her experience using the technology, Harriet said: “I had some general symptoms, like fatigue, around this time last year, and I have a family history of an underactive thyroid, so I wanted to get things checked out. The main benefit of home testing kits is that you're empowered to do things in your own time. “I decided which day I wanted to do the test, I had a cup of tea and a snack, put the TV on, and did it one step at a time. I put the patch on first, decided when to click it, felt the tiniest needle, and then didn't feel anything. By eliminating the pain and anxiety associated with traditional blood testing methods, the collaboration aims to address both needle phobia and the broader need for accessible preventative care, ensuring more people can monitor their health and take timely action. By combining Thriva's technology and expertise with Tasso's innovative blood collection device, we empower people to understand what's happening inside their bodies through regular, painless testing. This approach helps individuals optimize their health for both immediate and long-term well-being. It goes beyond simply identifying problems—we provide the insights and support needed for meaningful, lasting improvements." Erwin Berthier, Co-founder of Tasso, added: "At Tasso, we're passionate about making high-quality blood testing easy and accessible to drive personalized health solutions. Our Tasso+ device is designed to eliminate the barriers that keep people from getting the important health information they need. Partnering with Thriva brings our virtually painless blood collection technology to a wider audience, empowering patients with needle phobia to take control of their health in a comfortable and convenient way."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The National Lipid Association (NLA) and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) have released a Joint Scientific Statement focused on the management of hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years who do not have a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Older persons have many competing medical and social needs, so treating high cholesterol in those without cardiovascular disease may not always be straightforward for clinicians and patients. Vera Bittner, MD, MSPH, MNLA, co-chair of the scientific statement The statement reviews the current evidence surrounding lipid-lowering therapies in older individuals without established ASCVD and offers pragmatic recommendations to support clinical decision-making in this unique population. As the U.S. population continues to age, the number of individuals over 75 years old living without diagnosed cardiovascular disease is growing. However, the decision to initiate or continue cholesterol-lowering therapy in these patients can be challenging due to limited clinical trial data, the presence of comorbidities, polypharmacy, and differing goals of care. This statement serves as a critical resource to guide personalized treatment decisions-balancing potential benefits in ASCVD prevention with the realities of aging and the end-of-life, frailty, medication burden, and patient preferences.

We analyzed 36 randomized controlled trials and overwhelmingly concluded that cannabinoids are no more effective at treating pain than placebos. At the same time, there are continuing concerns about adverse effects, including the risk of psychosis and dependence syndrome." Director of The Centre for Innovation in Pain and Health Research Professor Paul Hodges said one of their aims was to conduct high-priority clinical trials to evaluate pain treatments, care models, and preventive strategies. "We are striving to accelerate the development of effective interventions so that we can enhance the lives of people impacted by pain," Professor Hodges said. "We are doing this through developing new tools to characterise people's pain, accelerating the translation of treatments from fundamental research to the clinic, and implementing new ways to test treatments using clever new types of clinical trials."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you've ever lost loved ones to the disease, you might recognize the physical and emotional changes cancer patients often endure during their final months. They seem drained of strength and spirit. New research published in Science suggests apathy and lack of motivation are symptoms of a condition called cancer cachexia. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Associate Professor Tobias Janowitz explains: "Many patients complain of symptoms in that category. They say, 'I don't know what's going on with me. I don't feel like eating it.' Usually, they'd be excited and enjoy it. They just don't seem to engage so much." Also frustrating, cachexia severely limits patients' ability to tolerate common cancer treatments. CSHL scientists have been studying the condition for years. Now, in a major development, Janowitz and colleague Adam Kepecs at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WashU Medicine) have identified a connection between the brain and the immune system that is responsible for cachexia-related apathy. Screening for elevated immune system proteins in the brains and bodies of mice with cachexia led the team to IL-6, which gets released during inflammation and has long been associated with cachexia. Decreasing IL-6 signals in connected brain areas made the mice more motivated. We discovered a full brain circuit that senses inflammation in the bloodstream and sends signals that reduce motivation. This reveals that apathy isn't just an emotional or psychological reaction to cachexia-it's built into the biology of the disease." Adam Kepecs, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis The discovery further suggests that existing antibody treatments could be repurposed to improve cancer patients' quality of life. Working across cancer and neuroscience has brought the researchers this far. Their ultimate hope is that one day, through continued interdisciplinary collaboration, they will help turn cachexia into a condition patients can overcome. That would be a welcome development not only for people battling cancer but also for their loved ones who suffer alongside them. A neuroimmune circuit mediates cancer cachexia-associated apathy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Consumption of holy water from Ethiopia has recently led to several cases of cholera in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) with a multidrug-resistant Vibrio cholerae strain, according to a study published in Eurosurveillance. Researchers detected multidrug-resistant Vibrio cholerae O1 linked to recent outbreaks in Eastern and Middle Africa in clinical specimens and the holy water. The ongoing cholera outbreak in Ethiopia began in 2022, and by 9 February 2025 a total of 58,381 cases and 726 deaths had been reported. There was a resurgence of the outbreak on 6 February 2025 reported in the Amhara region leading to 163 cases and 3 deaths, with more recent numbers being unavailable. In Germany, three people were initially reported via the European surveillance portal for infectious diseases (EpiPulse) as suspected of having cholera on 25 February 2025. All patients were identified as being of Ethiopian ethnicity. Two had travelled to Ethiopia in January, and acquired a small plastic bottle of water with water from the holy well in Bermel Giorgis. Upon their return to Germany, both people consumed the water. A third person received splashes of water to the face, including the lips, and possibly ingested some of it. One patient required intensive care, but all recovered. In the UK, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) identified four patients, among which two reported recent travel to Ethiopia to the Amhara region, and one specifically mentioning a 9-day trip to Bermel Georgis. Three were admitted to hospital, with one requiring intensive care. One person who had also travelled to Ethiopia also had symptoms of cholera, but was not tested and recovered without medical treatment. Genetic analysis of the bacteria in stool samples from the UK cases showed that they belonged to a multidrug-resistant clade of Vibrio cholerae O1 previously linked to outbreaks of cholera in Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in Eastern and Middle Africa. Consumption of holy water has been previously identified as a risk factor for cholera in Ethiopia. Public authorities have taken preventive measures during religious holidays, and the Ethiopian National Guideline for Cholera Surveillance and Outbreak response has also addressed the associated risks. However, the spread of cases into Europe related to a cholera outbreak in Africa is unusual.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To address the bleeding risk in liver failure patients, the safety of regional mesylate anticoagulation (RMA) in centrifugation artificial liver support systems (cALSS) is proposed for study. In this prospective single-arm study, ALF and ACLF patients were treated with cALSS using RMA. Blood ammonia, model for end-stage liver disease scores, and survival rates at 28 and 90 days were assessed. All 57 patients showed no new bleeding within 24 h post-cALSS. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified pre-R and pre-MA as key factors for R exceeding 10 m at 0.5 h post-cALSS, with odds ratios of 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84–0.98) and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.05–3.90), respectively, P < 0.05. The predictive values were pre-MA ≤ 38 mm (AUC = 0.817, 95% CI [0.690–0.907], P < 0.001) and pre-R > 6.3 m (AUC = 0.790, 95% CI [0.661–0.888], P < 0.001). Patients showed improvements in blood ammonia and model for end-stage liver disease scores after the last session, especially those with high initial levels (>80 µmol/L and >30). cALSS with RMA is safe for liver failure patients with a high risk of bleeding. Adjusting the mesylate dose based on pre-R and pre-MA enhances safety.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Therapy-related B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) following treatment for multiple myeloma is a rare occurrence. Despite its rarity and the lack of recognition by the World Health Organization as a distinct disease entity, previous publications indicate its possible emergence following myeloma treatment. The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of IgG kappa multiple myeloma, status post multiple lines of therapy. Bone marrow morphologic evaluation revealed numerous blasts. Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrated that these blasts were B lymphoblasts, despite MYC and unusual surface kappa light chain expression. A diagnosis of B-ALL with surface kappa light chain expression post-myeloma treatment was made. Next-generation gene sequencing revealed pathogenic mutations in KDM6A and KRAS. In summary, we present an interesting case of B-lymphoblastic leukemia with unusual surface light chain expression in a patient who has previously undergone myeloma treatment. Although it has not been categorized as a WHO-recognized disease entity, our case provides additional evidence supporting that myeloma treatment, particularly lenalidomide therapy, is associated with secondary B-ALL. The identification of new predominant clones in follow-up bone marrow samples of myeloma patients should alert clinicians to the possible emergence of a secondary B-cell neoplasm.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite significant advances in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment, it remains incurable, with limited therapeutic options. Currently, repurposing already tested, safe drugs has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy against various neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. Using a drug-repurposing approach, the current study investigated the neuroregenerative potential of polysialic acid mimicking compounds, 5-nonyloxytryptamine oxalate (5-NOT) and Epirubicin (Epi), an anti-cancer drug, in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as a PD model. The excitotoxic model was established by exposing SH-SY5Y cells to 500 µM of MPP+ and subsequently treating them with the test compounds. The effect of MPP+-induced toxicity on cellular and nuclear morphology, as well as on the expression of neuroplasticity and cell survival proteins, were studied by immunostaining, gelatin zymogram, and Western blot assays. Further, 5-NOT and Epi treatment also protected SH-SY5Y cells by restoring levels of nitric oxide, matrix metalloproteinase, and stress response proteins. Interstingly, 5-NOT attenuated MPP+-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by regulating the intrinsic protein kinase AKT/BAD apoptotic pathway and the P-38 MAP kinase synaptic plasticity pathway. The present data provides compelling evidence for the potential beneficial role of 5-NOT as a glycomimetic drug candidate targeting the neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons, a hallmark feature of patients suffering from PD. Identification of novel compounds from small molecule libraries mimicking the functions of PSA may offer new therapeutic avenues for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A multi-institutional study led by Moffitt Cancer Center found that percutaneous hepatic perfusion using a melphalan hepatic delivery system may help patients with a rare eye cancer that has spread to their liver. This disease, known as metastatic uveal melanoma, is traditionally very hard to treat and usually has poor outcomes. The phase 3 FOCUS trial, published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology, compared two treatments for metastatic uveal melanoma. One group of patients received the melphalan hepatic delivery system treatment, while the other group received standard of care treatment. Patients treated with the melphalan hepatic delivery system experienced significantly improved outcomes than those receiving alternative care. The median progression-free survival for these patients was 9.1 months, compared with 3.3 months for those on standard treatments. The disease control rate also substantially increased from 46.9% to 80.0%. Patients treated with the melphalan hepatic delivery system lived a median of 18.5 months, compared with 14.5 months for those receiving other forms of care. Although there were some side effects, mostly related to blood cell counts, these were treated with standard care as an outpatient and mostly resolved with observation alone. The treatment provides an option that does not interfere with their quality of life and gives patients a chance at longer survival." Jonathan Zager, M.D., surgical oncologist in the Cutaneous Oncology Department at Moffitt and lead author of the study Unlike regular chemotherapy, this treatment delivers a high dose of the drug directly into the liver, which is isolated with a series of catheters and balloons via percutaneous insertions. Studies will also look at combining this treatment with other new therapies. The FOCUS trial is sponsored by Delcath Systems, Inc.
