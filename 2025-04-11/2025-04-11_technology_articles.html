                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Social Security Administration backed off its plan to cut phone services, but it's still taking steps to limit the ways that people will be able to access information about the essential agency. The SSA plans to stop issuing communications through normal channels like press releases and will instead make statements exclusively on X. “We are no longer planning to issue press releases or those dear colleague letters to inform the media and public about programmatic and service changes,” SSA regional commissioner Linda Kerr-Davis said, per Wired. The SSA pretty regularly engages with the public, including advocacy groups, through “Dear Colleague” letters that directly address the concerns of third parties who have questions or concerns about Social Security-related matters. All of that, it seems, will disappear and be replaced by the SSA X feed. The agency's account currently has just over 138,000 followers. By comparison, about 73 million people (that's about 1 in every 5 Americans) receive Social Security benefits of some kind and may be interested in updates regarding those services. Outages have lasted full days at certain points, but the administration has claimed it has nothing to do with DOGE's efforts, which have already left the agency short-staffed and scrambling. Anyway, those outages will probably be used as justification for shifting communication to X, which has been Musk's preferred platform for communication even before he bought it. In 2020, Musk dissolved Tesla's press office entirely and shifted the company's comms exclusively to what was then Twitter. That is distinctively not the case for Social Security, which primarily serves people of retirement age. People can start receiving their full Social Security benefits at 67 years old.

A new shipbuilding startup called Blue Water Autonomy has emerged from stealth with the promise of developing captain-less naval ships.

The Boston, Massachusetts-based company has raised a $14 million seed round from Eclipse VC, Riot, and Impatient Ventures. The startup was founded in 2024 by former members of the U.S. Navy, leaders of Amazon Robotics, and iRobot.

Blue Water Autonomy joins an ever-growing list of startups that are taking advantage of a splurge in defense investment. Defense tech funding set a new record in 2024, led by Anduril's $1.5 billion Series F round and Saronic — another autonomous maritime startup that notched a $175 million Series B.

The startup says it has developed a full-stack autonomy suite and concept ship designs in “under a year.” It's already salt-water testing a 100-ton autonomous test vessel just outside of Boston, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch. 

The seed funding will help Blue Water Autonomy expand its engineering team and accelerate testing, according to a release.

“No other company is tackling this problem at the ship level like Blue Water,” Seth Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said in a statement. “The team is a rare combination of roboticists and Navy veterans that positions them to be a critical partner to the Navy, the entire Department of Defense, and will have a major impact on the maritime industry.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“We are no longer planning to issue press releases or those dear colleague letters to inform the media and public about programmatic and service changes,” said SSA regional commissioner Linda Kerr-Davis in a meeting with managers earlier this week. Previously, the agency used dear colleague letters to engage with advocacy groups and third-party organizations that help people access social security benefits. Recent letters covered everything from the agency's new identity verification procedures to updates on the accuracy of SSA death records (“less than one-third of 1 percent are erroneously reported deaths that need to be corrected,” the agency wrote, in contrast to what Elon Musk claims). The letters and press releases were also a crucial communications tool for SSA employees, who used them to stay up on agency news. Since SSA staff cannot sign up for social media on government computers without submitting a special security request, the change could have negative consequences on the ability for employees to do their jobs. “Do they really expect senior citizens will join this platform?” asked one current employee. How isn't this a conflict of interest?” Another staffer added: “This will ensure that the public does not get the information they need to stay up-to-date.” Linda Kerr-Davis also did not immediately respond to a request for comment by WIRED. The Social Security Administration is actively communicating with beneficiaries and stakeholders,” says Liz Huston, a White House spokesperson. Rather, to improve the delivery of services, staff are being reassigned from regional offices to front-line help – allocating finite resources where they are most needed. President Trump will continue to always protect Social Security.” After he purchased the company, Musk fired contract content moderators and shifted content moderation efforts to a crowd-sourced fact-checking tool called Community Notes. In 2023, an EU official warned the platform was a major source of fake news, based on a commissioned study that reported “Twitter has the highest discoverability" of disinformation. The regional office workforce will soon be cut by roughly 87 percent, sources tell WIRED. “We know that you all depend on these folks to manage your front line, to help with questions,” said Kerr-Davis, who works in the Kansas City regional office. “I'm going to be pretty candid here in sharing that the support will be pretty minimal until we can stand up our skinny regional office.” Kerr-Davis acknowledged that the restructuring could limit the agency's ability to combat fraud, a major goal of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. “Won't losing subject matter experts lead directly to fraud, waste, and abuse?” she asked on the call, reading a question from an SSA staffer. “And yes, I mean, we do rely on [their] help … Things are going to break, and they're going to break fast.” This story has been updated with comment from the White House.

It's better to feel the tactile feedback of a full-sized keyboard with keys that press down as your type—at least that's my preference anyway. If you primarily use a laptop but are looking to have some extra options, listen here. Well you can get this mouse and keyboard set from Logitech for hardly anything. They're bundled together and normally priced at $40, but right now you can get the pair for just $34. This is an absolute must for anyone dealing with numbers and/or Excel all day. Plus you have all your calculator functions right there. This thing is spill resistant, so gamers need not fear drinking your Mountain Dew Baja Blasts nearby. The keyboard has got a crazy long battery life. You can keep your desk free of unnecessary cables as it'll last up to three years before needing replacement. The mouse likewise can last awhile, coming in at about 18 months. As they are wireless, the connection is dependable utilizing 2.4 GHz at a range of up to 10 meters. This is a niche use case, but that's great for if you have one of those mini PCs or a Raspberry Pi hooked up to your living room TV and need a means of controlling it from the couch. Some Xbox games also now support mouse and keyboard if you want to mess around with that too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lazarus, Cowboy Bebop creator Shinichirō Watanabe‘s newest sci-fi anime series on Adult Swim, is the talk of the town in anime circles. But regarding Lazarus itself, some fans have noticed differences between the Japanese and U.S. releases, leaving them wondering if they are missing out on a potentially superior version of the series. An X/Twitter post by user SaeIssho points out scenes from Lazarus protagonist Axel Gilberto's parkour prison escape in the anime's premiere episode seem to have added frames and improved compositing polish in the Japanese version. The tweet, which has garnered over 91,000 views, has ignited curiosity among fans about whether the remaining 12 episodes will feature similar subtle differences and if it might be worth waiting for the Japanese language version of the show set to release on Adult Swim and Max in May. For instance some scenes in the Japanese version are about twice as long in terms of key frames, and there are noticeable differences in compositing choices across various parts of the EP. Given all the recent turmoil over stuff like the Nintendo Switch 2 having a cheaper, Japanese-only version; general anxiety over vibe-based tariffs, and China reinforcing the proverbial inward barbwire gate over the U.S. with limited releases of films like A Minecaft Movie; anime fans' nagging sense of FOMO over Watanabe's return to sci-fi isn't completely left-field. Speaking with io9, a source close to the show's production says minor tweaks were made to the U.S. and Japanese broadcast versions of Lazarus to pass the Harding test—an automatic test for flashing and patterns that could trigger photosensitivity and epilepsy. Think the infamous Pokémon Porygon episode, where a lightning bolt flash reportedly triggered over 700 alleged instances of nausea, dizziness, headaches, and photosensitivity-triggered seizures in audiences across Japan back in 1997. They include dropping a few animation frames and slightly darkening numerous shots. The source stressed that neither animation nor redone composites were added to either show version, and Watanabe approved all updates. Though, knowing the anime community, fans will probably still rewatch the Japanese language version of Lazarus for the chance to hear Cowboy Bebop alumni voice actors like Koichi Yamadera (Spike Spiegel) and Megumi Hayashibara (Faye Valentine) as Dr. Skinner and Herch, respectively. In our review of Lazarus' first five episodes, we said the anime has the juice, writing “Lazarus firmly establishes itself as a series capable of delivering a compelling anime without compromising on animation quality, musical score, or thematic depth in its early goings.” Hopefully, the show will continue its winning momentum to its final episode.

Musk considers himself self-sufficient and does not need help with technology — if he does, he will ask.” And then there's the relatable stuff, like his dislike of unexpected Wi-Fi outages and his penchant to take a nap, even on day trips.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every summer, an area of deep underwater canyons off western Australia's south coast called Bremer Canyon becomes the preferred feeding ground for marine predators including sharks, pilot whales, beaked whales, and the highly intelligent orcas. As such, Bremer Canyon has become a popular whale-watching destination. The scene, caught on camera, was bloody, heartbreaking…and normal, despite our aching human hearts. In fact, it was also special, in a ruthless way: It's only the fourth time orcas hunting a blue whale has been filmed at Bremer Canyon. As the blue whale's fate was sealed, orcas celebrated with breaches and tail slaps,” reads a social media post by Naturaliste Charters Whale Watching, after a stark graphic content warning. “We're all still pretty shell shocked,” Jennah Tucker, a marine biologist who works on Naturaliste Charters and witnessed the hunt, told the ABC. “We definitely do as much as we can to not be involved and to have no interference, but it's a very difficult thing to watch; it can be very brutal,” she admitted, adding that, at one point, almost 30 orcas overwhelmed the pygmy blue whale as it tried to flee. While popular culture abuses our fear of sharks, orcas are actually the world's top marine predators and they roam every ocean. Despite being commonly known as “killer whales,” they're a member of the dolphin family. Though it's understandably difficult to witness such a bloody scene, the orcas weren't engaging in senseless violence—they were behaving as nature intended them to.

A mysterious whale that has puzzled scientists for decades may not be an anomaly, but a clue to what climate change is doing beneath the waves. When whales migrate from their cold feeding grounds to warmer breeding waters, they carry tons of nutrients in their urine. There may be fewer than 100 Rice's whales left in the Gulf of Mexico, but the Department of the Interior doesn't believe that should stop ships from traveling as fast as they choose. In 2018, scientists documented the same orca mother carrying her dead calf for 17 days across more than 1,000 miles of water. Scientists are puzzled by what prompted the “sexy foreigner” to cross three oceans. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.</p>

This rule exempts products from AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Intel, and other chipmakers who outsource wafer fabrication to Taiwanese companies from the punitive 125% tariff China now imposes on products from the U.S. However, this badly hurts Intel, Global Foundries, Texas Instruments, and chip designers who produce chips in America. The rule applies to both packaged and unpackaged semiconductors. Because China deems Taiwan its own territory, chips fabricated by TSMC, Micron, UMC, Vanguard, and other chipmakers in Taiwan will be exempt from punitive 125% import duties imposed on products from then U.S. even though virtually all contemporary chips from companies like AMD, Broadcom, Intel, Nvidia, Micron, and Qualcomm are developed in America and are sold by U.S.-based company. By applying this rule, the Chinese government kills two birds with one stone. On the one hand, it allows chipmakers to ship their products to China without any restrictions or punitive tariffs, which enables China-based fabs to continue making actual products based on those chips, thus keeping Chinese facilities busy. As an added bonus, China shows American companies that it considers Taiwan its own territory and actually means it by not imposing any punitive import duties. On the other hand, it punishes American chipmakers and chip designers that produce their ICs in the U.S., which includes companies that outsource to GlobalFoundries' Fab 8 in New York as well as Texas Instruments, which builds its chips in Texas. As an added bonus, the Chinese government helps TSMC, UMC, Vanguard, and China-based foundries to potentially land new customers. Many products made in China use chips from American companies produced in America by companies like Analog Devices, GlobalFoundries, NXP, or ON Semiconductor, or fabbed by contract chipmakers in the U.S., such as Intel or GlobalFoundries. Consequently, companies that use chips from the U.S. will now have to find alternatives, which takes time and costs money. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. One thing to note is the stark contrast between how Chinese customs treat semiconductor products and how American customs treat chips in terms of 'country of origin.' For example, a memory IC developed in the U.S., fabbed in Japan, but packaged in China is considered a Chinese product subject to punitive tariffs, according to the current laws.

When sex toy brand Dame first launched in 2014, its focus was on making no-frills sex toys for people with vulvas. In its quest to close the “pleasure gap,” the company's first product was the Eva—a hands-free clitoral vibrator that could be comfortably worn during penetration thanks to a clever design. A 2015 study of over 1,000 women published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 percent can orgasm through intercourse alone, and 37 percent said clitoral stimulation was necessary for orgasm during intercourse. Its Indiegogo campaign raised more than $850,000, one of the most successful crowdfunded sex toys in history. It's a sex toy for couples—the best of both worlds. Combined with my 10-plus years covering sexual wellness and sex toys, I can confidently say that I know my way around cock rings and have tried more than my fair share. The Hug doesn't look like any cock ring I've seen before. Knowing nothing about Dame, my partner said, "It looks like it was designed by a woman.” This was by no means an insult, but a compliment. As much as I don't want to do a compare-and-contrast session about cock rings, the Hug has a major standout feature that must be addressed. In a world of silicone cock rings that require either a lot of lube or a flaccid shaft to get it on the penis, the Hug has pinchable arms, so you can easily put it on and take it off at any time, no matter the erection status. Having been with partners who struggled to get cock rings on and/or off, it's a much smarter design. Clitoral stimulation always feels like an afterthought with most of the cock rings on the market designed to pleasure both partners. This was something both my partner and I loved. While finagling and readjusting sex toys is sometimes necessary, the Hug was very much in sync with both of our bodies. I consider the Hug a near-perfect sex toy. My partner and I used it multiple times, with my forever-beloved water-based lubricant Bijoux Indiscrets' Sex au Natural, and each time it floored us both. The Hug takes about two hours to charge and lasts only an hour, but that's not really a bad thing for a cock ring. Blood flow to the penis shouldn't be restricted for more than 30 minutes. It's 100 percent waterproof, easy to navigate with its one button, very quiet (not quite whisper-quiet), and USB-C rechargeable. It's ultimately designed for hetero couples or someone with a penis who's flying solo and experimenting with erections and blood flow. If it remotely sounds appealing, trust me, the Hug is something you'll want in your sex toy arsenal. If you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users. 2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora. OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.” OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos. In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior. OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer. OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch. OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans. Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.” OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that's “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story… OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model's “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email. ChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users. It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they're inconsistent at best. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data. Alyssa Stringer was formerly the Audience Development Manager for TechCrunch.

Arrow Lake might have some fuel left in the tank, as Intel's latest IPO (Intel Performance Optimizations) tech is reportedly hitting pre-builts in China, per UNIKO's Hardware at X. It is important to note that Intel has not detailed or announced an IPO for the global market. In addition, for the time being, it appears these profiles are aimed at system integrators and OEMs, not individual customers. Enthusiast and gamers can use many techniques to get the most out of their CPU. AMD offers a PBO that auto-tunes your CPU to extract maximum performance with minimal manual intervention. The catch is that all these utilities can technically void your warranty if things go south. IPO is designed to serve as a middle ground between stock profiles and overclocking, with proper warranty coverage. In an example profile shared by UNIKO's Hardware, a pre-built from Maxsun with IPO lands a sweet 200 MHz uplift in core clock speeds while pushing RAM speeds to DDR5-8400 from DDR5-8000, resulting in a purported 10% FPS increase (on the pre-built's marketing material). This might make Arrow Lake a compelling choice against Ryzen offerings, particularly for system integrators. Despite the substantial buildup to Arrow Lake, performance on launch day was subpar, with these chips failing to beat even their last-generation counterparts in some scenarios. Arrow Lake's MCM (Multi Chip Module) design eats away a chunk of the performance, with the memory controller designated to a separate tile, incurring unwanted latency penalties.

The final update, microcode version 0x114 and CSME firmware kit 19.0.0.1854v2.2, launched in January, but our testing proved contrary to Intel's claimed performance improvements. IPO is Intel's latest attempt to wring every last bit of performance from Arrow Lake, but we are still light on details regarding availability.

The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is a strong gaming laptop with an Nvidia RTX 5080 Laptop GPU and a bright display, but it doesn't feel as premium as its price tag, and its GiMate AI doesn't add much. Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. There are so many PCs that are Pro, Plus, Max, or some similar combination, that when I hear "Master," it better be cream of the crop — one of the best gaming laptops. The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16, with its RTX 5080 laptop GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 275 HX is a strong performer with a bright OLED screen, but there's still room for improvement.The Aorus Master starts at $3,099.99, which isn't cheap. And Gigabyte's other big push on the Aorus Master is its GiMate AI, which I found to be of dubious utility.That doesn't make the Aorus Master a bad gaming laptop – the performance is certainly there. But you'll have to decide if you're willing to accept some flaws and limitations while spending over three grand. Though many gaming laptops use plastic to prevent overheating and reduce weight, Gigabyte's implementation of the material doesn't feel great. But the material feels like something I'd expect from a Happy Meal toy. At least on the lid, Gigabyte should've gone with premium aluminum. Mix that with the RGB keyboard (including a handful of transparent keys), and there's no mistake that this laptop is meant not just for gaming, but for gamers. We've seen similar styling from Asus, particularly under its Strix Scar brand, but there's definitely an abundance of gamer signaling going on here. My editor told me it "looks like the RGB is leaking." On the left side of the laptop, there's a Thunderbolt 5 port over USB Type-C, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, HDMI 2.1, and an Ethernet jack. I'd rather see a full-size SD card slot on a laptop of this size (there seems to be room for it) Measuring 14.06 x 10.0 x 1.18 inches and weighing in at 5.51 pounds, the Aorus Master 16 isn't the most portable of gaming laptops. Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU (16GB GDDR7, 175W maximum TGP, 1,702 MHz boost clock) USB Type-C with Thunderbolt 5, USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, MicroSD card slot (UHS-II), HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, 3.5mm headphone jack For gaming, the Gigabyte armed the Aorus Master 16 with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU and an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX. I used the Aorus Master 16 to continue my adventures in Alan Wake 2. I used the Quality render setting at native resolution with DLSS and 4x Frame Gen enabled, along with the high-quality graphics preset and ultra ray tracing. As I explored some previously haunted woods (look, things can get less haunted in this game), the frame rate ranged between 90 and 133 frames per second. Frame Gen was a necessity for these settings, though. Without them, the game sometimes ran below 30 frames per second, so I would have to turn the quality down. At high resolutions, though, the Blade 16's RTX 5090 won out, as games are typically less dependent on the CPU as you add more pixels. Meanwhile, the GPU ran at 1,609.59 MHz and climbed to 60.50 degrees C. Outside of gaming, it should meet on-the-go productivity needs. In our review unit, it was paired with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. The Gigabyte's drive proved slow on our file transfer test, copying 25GB of files at 665.26 MBps. The 16-inch, 240 Hz, OLED panel on the Aorus Master is luminous, but not as vivid as Gigabyte's competition.As I explored a forest at sunrise in Alan Wake 2, the green foliage was vibrant, and the entire scene was lightly colored by an appropriate orange tint. In this case, the Aorus was more in line with the HP Omen 16 and Alienware m18 R2, beating them each by only a few percentage points. Gigabyte's keyboard features poppy scissor switches that provide a comfortable bounce while writing and gaming. But I wish the keycaps were larger, and there's clearly room for them, as Gigabyte has some speaker grille patterns (but not actual speaker grilles) on each side of the keyboard. At this price, I'd prefer to see haptic feedback, although the mechanical click works well enough here. The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16's speakers are passable for listening to music. While there's not much bass, the xylophone from the sample was loud and clear.The speakers are better tuned for gaming. In Alan Wake 2, dialogue was clear, and ominous background music was appropriately haunting.Dolby Access comes preinstalled to adjust the speakers, but making adjustments didn't do much to enhance the experience. Removing the Master 16's bottom cover requires dispatching 12 screws. There are three sizes here, so be sure to keep track of which ones go where.The cover is held on tight, but a well-placed pry tool around the hinges lets you move around and click through the plastic clips. Be careful when removing the bottom, however, as there's a ribbon table attached to to control the RGB lighting. The battery is easily accessible, though you'll need to separate that cable. You can also access the RAM SO-DIMMs and SSD. Our review unit used one SSD, but we appreciated a second slot so that you can upgrade the system on your own later. Gaming laptops usually need to be plugged in to hit their full potential, but the Aorus Master 16 is seeing slight generational gains in battery life. That's longer than last-gen Intel/Nvidia laptops, though the AMD/Nvidia-based Blade 16 - with its 28W CPU - ran for an impressive (at least, for a gaming laptop) 7:21. We measure skin temperatures for gaming laptops while running the Metro Exodus benchmark. (That's not too uncomfortable to use, just warmer than the rest of the surface, which was closer to 75 degrees. Perhaps that's an argument in favor of the plastic Gigabyte uses for its chassis. It's only 1080p, which is a shame on a laptop for over $3,000, but calls and photos weren't blurry or grainy. Some colors were a bit cool for my liking, and I appeared pretty pale under our office's fluorescent lights. It boils down two apps: Gigabyte Speed and GiMate. Gigabyte Speed tries to prioritize gaming traffic on your network. The other is GiMate, a system monitor that Gigabyte claims has AI capabilities.GiMate doesn't actually feel that different from Gigabyte's previous Control Center. The GiMate is also ostensibly an AI agent. You can tell it that you want to play a game, and it will switch to Game Mode. But in the time it would take to chat with the LLM, you could switch these manually with two clicks. But when I ask it for the best settings for a game, it doesn't tell me. All this chatbot does is change hardware settings. Gigabyte sells the Aorus Master 16 with a 1-year warranty. We tested the Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275 HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which will run you $3,099.99 as of this writing.There's one other variant of the Master 16 with the same CPU and RAM, but an RTX 5090 Laptop GPU and 2TB of storage. Those upgrades are pricey, though, bumping the cost to $4,299.99. The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 shows that Nvidia's RTX 5080 Laptop GPU is a powerful chip, often within striking distance of the more powerful RTX 5090 Laptop GPU and even more competitive than the 5090 when paired with a 28W CPU in the Razer Blade 16.But the Aorus Master, despite its $3,099 price as tested, doesn't feel like a premium device. But the plasticky build, especially on the lid, just doesn't feel like a laptop that costs so much money. Gigabyte needs to spend a bit more on build quality here.The GiMate AI isn't terribly helpful, especially the chatbot. Sure, I appreciate the nag to switch to integrated graphics whenever I unplug the device, but Nvidia Optimus can do that for me. The Chatbot is so limited in what it can do that I'd rather just go into an options menu and click.But the fundamental gaming performance is. I just wish the Aorus Master felt truly masterful in all regards. Andrew E. Freedman is a senior editor at Tom's Hardware focusing on laptops, desktops and gaming.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's nothing new—politicians complain about silly science projects funded by the government to get taxpayers riled up. You might think super expensive particle accelerators or even dirt-cheap experiments on the color of petunias are a waste of money. But even if you care only about money in and money out, if you account for all the downstream effects—which no one can foresee—these projects often do pay off. Let me tell you about another silly little experiment that turned out to have an extremely high ROI. This was at a time when humans were just starting to play around with batteries and electric currents. The next equation comes from a cool phenomenon. But how do you make a magnetic field? This is the basic idea behind an electromagnet. But Maxwell added a second mechanism—a changing electric field. And here's why this was such a big deal: This suggested that changing electric and magnetic fields would create an oscillation that can travel through space: an electromagnetic wave. Well, that was the idea, but for years it remained unproven. Then, in 1888, Heinrich Hertz created his little experiment. According to the theory, this spark would produce changing electric and magnetic fields that should propagate through space. So he set up a second loop of wire with a gap—only this one wasn't attached to any power source. But looking closely, you could see that a second spark was created in this gap. It showed that electromagnetic waves were real and they could travel across a room. (Early radio transmitters like Marconi's used this same spark-gap method.) I mean, it's been like 150 years, so you probably have access to stuff that Hertz didn't have—like Legos. Here's what you need: some wire, an old barbecue lighter, and a light bulb. (I used a tiny neon bulb, but an LED works too.) The lighter has a piezoelectric crystal inside that can produce large voltages when compressed. The key point here is that, like in Hertz's loop, these back wires are not connected to any power source. The two wires in back are the receiving antennas, and they will produce an electric current just like with Hertz's loop of wire. Here's what it looks like when you fire that spark. You are actually both sending and receiving electromagnetic waves. When Hertz showed his experimental verification of Maxwell's equations, the science community knew it was cool, and the general public got curious. Journalists, naturally—ever the pragmatists—asked him what it could be used for. “It's of no use whatsoever … this is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right—we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. Why waste money on experiments if they're not useful? Well, the honest truth is, that's not why we do science. It's just one of the things that make us who we are. In fact, you are likely using the results of Hertz's experiment right now. (Radio waves are just a slice of the electromagnetic spectrum.) This was then used for the wireless telegraph that allowed people to communicate with ships out at sea using Morse code. After that, people figured out how to send music and soap operas and commercials via radio waves, such that we now just call it “radio.” There was also this thing called television that could broadcast moving pictures through space. Since the device sends out electromagnetic waves that reflect off objects, you can measure how long it takes for the signal to come back, which tells you how far away they are—i.e., radar and lidar, which is used in self-driving cars. It's literally everywhere—you're swimming in a sea of electromagnetic waves. So if the US spends money on science, will it boost profits and economic growth? There are many cool discoveries with no real application. I mean, look at gravitational waves detected from colliding black holes. Will that lead to a new type of internet or something? But we're definitely richer for knowing about it.

Meanwhile, VideoCardz has leaked various custom models from MSI, displaying the use of a 16-pin (12VHPWR) power connector. A single 8-pin PCIe power connector, capable of providing up to 150W, is more than adequate for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti since it can draw an additional 75W from the PCIe slot, resulting in a combined total of 225W. While some might suggest that MSI opted for the 16-pin connector for better cable organization, the visual distinction between a standard 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 16-pin one is minimal since both configurations ultimately require a single power cable. At any rate, consumers shouldn't have to worry about the probability of the 16-pin power connector melting since a GeForce RTX 5060 Ti pulls nowhere near the same amount of power as a GeForce RTX 5090 or GeForce RTX 4090. Alternatively, the custom model from MSI may feature an exceptionally high factory overclock that justifies the 16-pin power connector. MSI seem to have four custom GeForce RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards ready for the market. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming Trio, available in black or white, is the flagship model with a triple-fan cooling system, while the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming leverages a dual-fan cooler. Nvidia's mainstream Blackwell graphics cards offer PCIe 5.0 support, though this interface is overkill for gaming purposes. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti will also support PCIe 5.0, but with a twist.

It doesn't come as a shock that Nvidia's x060-class graphics cards, such as the GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, along with AMD's Radeon RX x600 models like the Radeon RX 6600 or Radeon RX 7600, came with an x8 electrical PCIe interface. Graphics cards in this tier are typically not fast enough to merit an x16 connection, and an x8 connection somewhat helps reduce manufacturing cost. While the 16-pin power connector has proven problematic, it's here to stay. Currently AMD continues to cling to the 8-pin PCIe power connectors for its current RDNA 4 graphics cards, at least one manufacturer, Sapphire, has put a 16-pin power connector on a Radeon RX 9070 XT. Some high-end power supplies have already started to decrease the number of 8-pin PCIe power cables in favor of the 16-pin. Zhiye Liu is a news editor and memory reviewer at Tom's Hardware.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Several AI chatbots designed for fantasy and sexual role-playing conversations are leaking user prompts to the web in almost real time, new research seen by WIRED shows. If the systems are configured improperly, however, this can lead to chats being exposed. The vast majority of these appeared to be test setups, while others contained generic prompts relating to educational quizzes or nonsensitive information, says Greg Pollock, director of research and insights at UpGuard. “There were a handful that stood out as very different from the others,” Pollock says. Three of these were running-role playing scenarios where people can talk to a variety of predefined AI “characters”—for instance, one personality called Neva is described as a 21-year-old woman who lives in a college dorm room with three other women and is “shy and often looks sad.” Two of the role-playing setups were overtly sexual. Pollock says the company collected new data every minute, amassing around 1,000 leaked prompts, including those in English, Russia, French, German, and Spanish. It was not possible to identify which websites or services are leaking the data, Pollock says, adding it is likely from small instances of AI models being used, possibly by individuals rather than companies. No usernames or personal information of people sending prompts were included in the data, Pollock says. “There's clearly absolutely no regulation happening for this, and it seems to be a huge mismatch between the realities of how this technology is being used very actively and what the regulation would be targeted at.” WIRED last week reported that a South Korea–based image generator was being used to create AI-generated child abuse and exposed thousands of images in an open database. Child-protection groups around the world say AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which is illegal in many countries, is growing quickly and making it harder to do their jobs. The UK's anti-child-abuse charity has also called for new laws against generative AI chatbots that “simulate the offence of sexual communication with a child.” This software allows people to relatively easily deploy open source AI models on their own systems or servers. Rapid improvements to generative AI over the past three years have led to an explosion in AI companions and systems that appear more “human.” For instance, Meta has experimented with AI characters that people can chat with on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. Generally, companion websites and apps allow people to have free-flowing conversations with AI characters—portraying characters with customizable personalities or as public figures such as celebrities. People have found friendship and support from their conversations with AI—and not all of them encourage romantic or sexual scenarios. Perhaps unsurprisingly, though, people have fallen in love with their AI characters, and dozens of AI girlfriend and boyfriend services have popped up in recent years. “People being emotionally bonded with their AI companions, for instance, make them more likely to disclose personal or intimate information.” “Sometimes people engage with those chats in the first place to develop that type of relationship,” Boine says. As the AI companion industry has grown, some of these services lack content moderation and other controls. Character AI, which is backed by Google, is being sued after a teenager from Florida died by suicide after allegedly becoming obsessed with one of its chatbots. Aside from individual companions, there are also role-playing and fantasy companion services—each with thousands of personas people can speak with—that place the user as a character in a scenario. Some of these can be highly sexualized and provide NSFW chats. “We stress test these things and continue to be very surprised by what these platforms are allowed to say and do with seemingly no regulation or limitation,” says Adam Dodge, the founder of Endtab (Ending Technology-Enabled Abuse). “This is not even remotely on people's radar yet.” Dodge says these technologies are opening up a new era of online pornography, which can in turn introduce new societal problems as the technology continues to mature and improve. “Passive users are now active participants with unprecedented control over the digital bodies and likenesses of women and girls,” he says of some sites. While UpGuard's Pollock could not directly connect the leaked data from the role-playing chats to a single website, he did see signs that indicated character names or scenarios could have been uploaded to multiple companion websites that allow user input. Data seen by WIRED shows that the scenarios and characters in the leaked prompts are hundreds of words long, detailed, and complex. It adds that all the characters are over 18 and that, in addition to “Josh,” there are two sisters who live next door to the character. That can lead to situations where people may overshare and create risks. “If people are disclosing things they've never told anyone to these platforms and it leaks, that is the Everest of privacy violations,” Dodge says. “That's an order of magnitude we've never seen before and would make really good leverage to sextort someone.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AI-native psychiatry, built for scale and covered by insurance We're building the AI-native operations layer for psychiatric care. Not diagnostics, but what happens outside the visit—the real operational backend: scheduling, documentation, billing, intake, risk detection, and more. If you want to build core infrastructure with real AI, own systems end-to-end, and work directly with a deeply technical founder still up to his neck in the code—read on. Hey—I'm Daniel, co-founder and CTO of Legion Health (YC S21). Mental health care is operationally broken—patients ghosted, clinicians buried in forms, payers chasing missing notes. The industry is flooded with AI startups trying to automate away diagnosis—and even providers as a whole. We're building a real-time, AI-powered backend for mental health clinics—LLM agents + structured systems that coordinate human care like it's software. Our agent infrastructure supports over 2,000+ patients — with only one support human. Unlike most AI startups, we are our own customer. The systems you build directly impact our clinicians and patients today. You're not joining an idea-stage pipe dream or a late-stage dinosaur. We move fast, shipping multiple meaningful features straight to real patients and providers every single day. You'll own entire domains end-to-end—architecture, implementation, iteration—not just JIRA tickets. This is the frontier of applied AI in healthcare. You'll help answer questions at the frontier of AI, like: What does reliable agent infrastructure look like in production? What's the role of structured data in a world with LLMs? How do we make agents auditable, evolvable, and fast? We're looking for founding technologists who can think in systems and ship fast. PHI security, audit pipelines, real-time schedulers, transcript parsing When the next 20 years of mental health care can still be shaped by a few engineers with systems taste, speed, and conviction. You'll shape core systems and help decide what we build next. If you've ever said, “I wish I could've been there when [insert legendary product] was getting built,” this is that moment. If this resonates, I want to work with you. Let's build the founding systems of AI-native mental healthcare—and make something people didn't think was possible.
