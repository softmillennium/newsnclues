            Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing United Healthcare's chief executive officer, are asking a federal judge to block the Justice Department from seeking the death penalty, calling the decision a “political stunt.”
    


            Earlier this month Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the Justice Department would pursue the death penalty in Mangione's case, fulfilling President Donald Trump's campaign promise to resume federal executions.
    


            Mangione's attorneys are seeking court intervention, arguing that the Justice Department should be prevented from seeking the death penalty because it didn't follow certain protocols and violated Mangione's due process.

            Bondi's public statements, they argue, also tainted the grand jury pool.
    


            “The stakes could not be higher. The United States government intends to kill Mr. Mangione as a political stunt,” his lawyers wrote to the judge. “Mr. Mangione's counsel asked for three months to prepare a fulsome mitigation submission to the Department of Justice's Capital Committee and was ignored.”
    


            Bondi has said she will direct the interim US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Matthew Podolsky, to seek the death penalty in the case if Mangione is convicted on capital murder charges. A spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment on the case on Friday.
    


            Mangione, 26, is facing state and federal murder charges for allegedly gunning down United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside of a hotel in midtown Manhattan last year.
    


            Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the state charges. He was charged in a federal criminal complaint but has not yet been indicted on federal charges. One of the federal charges, murder through the use of a firearm, carries a maximum sentence of death, if convicted.
    


            Since Bondi's announcement, donations to Mangione's legal defense fund have poured in. Supporters have contributed over $850,000 in total, with many recent donations citing the Justice Department's decision to seek the death penalty.

            Mangione's lawyers said they argued against the death penalty in a “hastily assembled” meeting with federal prosecutors in New York during the final days of the Biden administration and were later informed that the Capital Case committee had not reached a decision. His lawyers said they then sought three months to make a fuller submission with mitigating factors but were informed a decision would be made before then.
    


            “Ultimately, any mitigation would have fallen on deaf ears in any event, as the Attorney General was plainly concerned only with ‘the President's directive' and with the ‘Make America Safe' policies of the administration instead of the facts of this case,” his attorneys wrote in the filing.

            A painting of an iconic scene of President Donald Trump surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania last summer now hangs in the Grand Foyer of the White House, after an official portrait of former President Barack Obama was moved from the location.
    


            The White House's official social media account posted an image of the Trump painting – the authenticity of which two officials confirmed separately to CNN. The Obama portrait was moved across the Grand Foyer in place of a President George W. Bush portrait. The 43rd president was moved to join his father by a nearby staircase.
    


            The dramatic image of Trump raising his right fist, with blood splattered across his face, became an emblem of strength in his presidential campaign. As of Friday morning, it hangs in one of the most prominent places in the East Wing of the White House.
    


            White House tradition calls for portraits of the most recent American presidents to be given the most prominent placement, in the entrance of the executive mansion, visible to guests during official events. An official Trump portrait has not yet been revealed, but an official said the president wanted this moment from Butler, Pennsylvania, to serve in the role of prominence.
    


            The move is reminiscent of a decision Trump made during his first term, when he replaced portraits of Bill Clinton and George W. Bush in the Grand Foyer, choosing instead to highlight William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt.
    


            Obama's portrait still hangs in a place of prominence, just across the Grand Foyer from where it has been since 2022. A portrait of former President Joe Biden has not been finished.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House Historical Association for comment. A spokesperson for Obama declined to comment.
    


            Privately funded by the nonprofit White House Historical Association, the formal tradition of the presidential portrait came to be in the early 1960s under first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, according to former White House curator Betty Monkman. Prior to that, there had been a relatively “haphazard” policy, Monkman said in a 2017 podcast for the association, with the portraits being funded by Congress or commissioned by friends – or by the president himself.
    


            Details on the origin of this Trump portrait, its artist and who paid for it were not immediately clear, though it appears to be based on iconic photographs of Trump taken moments after the assassination attempt at his July 2024 Butler, Pennsylvania, rally by Associated Press photographer Evan Vucci and New York Times photographer Doug Mills.
    


            In the modern era of White House portraits, presidents and first ladies have invited their predecessors, former staff and friends and family for unveiling ceremonies.
    


            “It's a statement of generosity on the current president and first lady to invite all these people from an outgoing administration,” Monkman said, recalling a ceremony during the Johnson administration for Eleanor Roosevelt's portrait unveiling.
    


            The new painting was carried inside the West Wing early Tuesday morning and was hung without significant pomp and circumstance on Friday morning, according to a person familiar with the matter.
    


            Official portraits of the president and first lady for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery's collection are currently in the works, though an unveiling has yet to be announced. Both of those portraits will be paid for by privately raised funds, including a $650,000 donation from Trump's Save America PAC, and an additional private donation, which supports artist fees, shipping, framing, installation and events, according to National Portrait Gallery spokesperson Concetta Duncan.
    


            A print of a 1989 photograph by Michael O'Brien of a smiling Trump in a suit, tossing a red apple, is also in the National Portrait Gallery's collection.

            The Department of Homeland Security requested the Social Security Administration to enter more than 6,000 names of immigrants into its database used to track dead people, according to a DHS official with knowledge of the decision.
    


            The move will effectively financially starve the immigrants, cutting off their ability to legally work in the country, receive various government benefits and access financial services like credit and bank accounts. The Trump administration is hoping it will drive them to self-deport, according to the official. It's all a part of the administration's efforts to crack down on migrants in the country.
    


            The move, first reported by The New York Times, targets immigrants who have Social Security numbers and may have entered the United States under programs that have ended, like the Biden administration's temporary work programs.
    


            A White House official told CNN the immigrants in question are temporarily paroled on the terror watchlist or have FBI criminal records and are ineligible to receive Social Security benefits. But the official did not provide any further evidence to support that claim. “Effective April 8, 2025, CBP terminated parole for all these people with written notice to each of them,” the official said.
    


            “Under President Trump's leadership, the government is finally doing what it should have all along: sharing information across the federal government to solve problems,” a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “Information sharing across agencies is essential to identify who is in our country, including violent criminals, determine what public safety and terror threats may exist, scrub these individuals from voter rolls, as well as identify what public benefits these aliens are using at taxpayer expense.”
    


            Another source with knowledge of activities at SSA tells CNN the DOGE leaders there have now renamed the database previously known as the Social Security Death Master file to the “Ineligible  file.”
    


            The announcement drew sharp criticism from the former SSA commissioner, Martin O'Malley, who served under former President Joe Biden.
    


            “If they can, contrary to the law and every regulation and without any due process, mark people inside SSA's database dead who legally entered the country and were legally required to be issued a work SSA number, then they can do that to anybody,” O'Malley told CNN.
    


            White House spokeswoman Liz Huston said in a statement: “President Trump promised mass deportations and by removing the monetary incentive for illegal aliens to come and stay, we will encourage them to self-deport. He is delivering on his promise he made to the American people.”
    


            Immigrants receive Social Security numbers when they are authorized to work legally in the US. These numbers are crucial for them to land employment.
    


            The agency, however, has recently made it more difficult for immigrants to obtain numbers and cards by requiring them to go to field offices to get the documents instead of having them issued by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services. The change was first reported by Popular Information and confirmed to CNN by a former Social Security official.
    


            Also, Elon Musk has claimed without evidence that immigrants are abusing the system and improperly receiving Social Security numbers. He claimed that Democrats are trying to use the program to lure immigrants and tip voting in favor of their party.
    


            Senate Finance Committee ranking member, Democrat  Ron Wyden whose committee oversees Social Security said the move takes away earned benefits.
    


            “Declaring a Social Security number as dead is nearly impossible to undo, doubly so now that Elon Musk and DOGE have eviscerated customer service at the agency. This action raises the prospect of the Trump Administration stealing legally earned Social Security benefits from American citizens, further proof that Trump's promise to protect Social Security is a lie.”

            Doctors in Argentina were already on high alert when a pregnant Russian woman showed up at the hospital on March 21 with two other women to give birth. Hospital staff in the Patagonian city of Bariloche had seen them before – four days earlier, they struggled to answer questions about where they lived and how they were related. The 22-year-old mother-to-be looked nervous and malnourished, and her companions didn't let her speak, according to police reports and Argentina's prosecutor.
    


            The women accompanying her implored doctors to document the baby's last name as Rudnev – the name of a notorious alleged cult leader opera­ting in the country – whom they insisted was the father, according to a prosecutor's report.

            A week later, Argentine police located Konstantin Rudnev at one of the city's airports and arrested him – part of a wave of arrests that day of over a dozen Russian nationals believed to be associated with his group. The two women accompanying the expectant mother to the hospital were also arrested in a raid of their shared home.
    


            According to Argentina prosecutor Fernando Arrigo, the pregnant woman may have been a victim of Rudnev's Ashram Shambala, an organization described by Russian authorities as a cult.
    


            Neither Rudnev nor his associates have been charged with a crime yet in Argentina, where criminal probes start with arrest and investigation before formal allegations. Arrigo's office says it is examining the possibility that the mother and her infant were coerced into a scheme for Rudnev to obtain Argentine citizenship by having a child born in the country.
    


            His office is officially investigating 21 Russian nationals in the country who are accused of “being part of a criminal organization that, for the purposes of sex trafficking and slavery, recruited a 22-year-old woman brought from Russia.”
    


            Asked about the investigation and the claim that Rudnev is a cult leader, his lawyers in Argentina declined to comment.
    


            Mechanical engineering graduate-turned-religious leader, Rudnev founded the Ashram Shambala religious group in 1989. According to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti, he told followers that he was an “alien from Sirius,” a messiah sent to Earth to save people.
    


            The sect once had a presence in 18 regions of Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, and up to 30,000 members. Many of them cut off contact with their families and joined the group, where they worshipped their founder.
    


            Rudnev spread his philosophy and recruited followers through yoga classes, Russian authorities investigating the case told RIA Novosti. His book “The Way of the Fool” ridiculed the idea of starting a family, the desire to have children, study, and work, and extolled blind submission to his wishes, RIA reported.
    


            Russian authorities had previously tried to bring Rudnev to trial, but the cases never made it to court because his followers refused to testify. Those followers, according to Russian judicial sources, said they joined the sect voluntarily and had no intention of leaving, RIA Novosti reported at the time.
    


            In 2013, a district court in Siberia sentenced Rudnev to 11 years in prison for rape, violent sexual acts, illegal drug trafficking, and for creating a religious group that violates the citizens' rights, according to RIA.
    


            As police arrested Rudnev and eight others at the Bariloche airport on March 28th, he tried unsuccessfully attempted to harm himself, the prosecutor's report said.
    


            Investigators said all the women arrested along with Rudnev and one other man that day showed “signs of malnutrition” similar to those that put hospital staff in Bariloche on alert.
    


            A search of their cell phones revealed “food rations and purchases of various products were authorized, and mandatory fasting was ordered as a form of punishment,” according to Arrigo.
    


            Authorities also found on some of the travelers and their homes more than a hundred cocaine pills, a satellite phone, a dozen cell phones, nearly $1,000 worth of Argentine pesos and other currencies and two pickup trucks. Properties rented by the suspected Ashram Shambala members were all found to have blacked-out windows and mattresses on the floor, according to the prosecutor's report.

            The Trump administration intends to eliminate the research arm of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, close all weather and climate labs and eviscerate its budget along with several other NOAA offices, according to internal documents obtained by CNN.
    


            The documents describe the administration's budget proposal for 2026, but indicate the administration expects the agency to enact the changes immediately.
    


            The cuts would devastate weather and climate research as weather is becoming more erratic, extreme and costly. It would cripple the US industries — including agriculture — that depend on free, accurate weather and climate data and expert analysis. It could also halt research on deadly weather, including severe storms and tornadoes.
    


            The administration intends to make significant cuts to education, grants, research and climate-related programs in NOAA, the plan says, which the administration believes “are misaligned with the … expressed will of the American people.”
    


            While the phrase “climate change” refers to the manmade influence on the global climate system via planet-warming fossil fuel pollution, “climate” in NOAA parlance is simply the weather that has been observed over time.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House and the Department of Commerce, which houses NOAA, for comment on the plan.
    


            The plan “will put American communities in harm's way,” Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, said in a statement. “This move has nothing to do with efficiency – and in fact, it will endanger our communities and leave us all more vulnerable to destructive and costly natural disasters.”
    


            The plan cuts NOAA's overall budget by more than 27%. It eliminates NOAA's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research office and stops funding regional climate data, climate competitive research and sea grant programs. Overall, it cuts the research office's funding by roughly 75%, and moves all remaining branches that used to be under OAR to different NOAA departments.
    


            The research office includes the National Severe Storms Laboratory, which studies destructive storms, including tornadoes, and works to increase warning lead time. It also includes the Meteorological Development Laboratory, whose mission is to improve public-facing forecast and data products.
    


            The proposed budget also severely defunds other key offices of NOAA, such as the National Ocean Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, and transfers most of the fisheries service functions to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which sits under the Interior Department. The Space Weather Prediction Center, which monitors solar activity for harmful radiation events, would move under the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            The internal Trump administration document says the National Marine Fisheries Service “should prioritize permitting” to “unleash American energy” from activities like offshore oil drilling.

            A source familiar with the plan told CNN that while the draft budget for fiscal year 2026 will have to be approved by Congress, it is also being distributed to the agency now as guidance on how to slash its current operating budget for the agency, which means the cuts could be implemented this year.
    


            The budget proposal eliminates NOAA's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research office and stops funding regional climate data, climate competitive research or sea grant programs. Overall, it cuts the funding for programs currently under the research office by roughly 75%.

‘Average man from Derbyshire' shocked to find photo of tattoo celebrating child's birth was used to deport migrants

A British man was shocked to discover that a photo of his tattoo was included in a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to identify alleged members of a notorious Venezuelan criminal gang, Tren de Aragua (TdA).

Earlier this week, 44-year-old Pete Belton, who lives in the English county of Derbyshire, told the BBC that he was stunned to find a photo of his forearm tattoo featured in a DHS document among nine images of tattoos intended to assist in “detecting and identifying” TdA members.

Belton, who says he has no connection to the Venezuelan group, expressed his disbelief, telling the BBC: “I'm just an average middle-aged man from Derbyshire.”

The DHS document notes that open source material “has depicted TdA members with a combination of the below tattoos”.

Among them appears to be Belton's tattoo, which depicts a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth, as well as other tattoos which include stars, skulls, the Michael Jordan “jump man” basketball logo, crowns and guns.

The BBC reported that it conducted reverse image searches for some of the tattoos depicted, and discovered that several of the images first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious connections to TdA or any other gangs.

They traced the image of Belton's tattoo to an Instagram post from nearly a decade ago by a Nottingham-based UK tattoo artist.

Belton said that initially he found it a “bit strange” and a “bit funny” that his tattoo was in the document, but now he is worried about a planned family trip to Miami in August with his wife and daughter, and that it might turn into a “six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantánamo”, he said.

“In my head I'm thinking if I'm working in border force and I saw me walking through I'd think ‘hey-up we've got one, he's the one in the document',” he told the BBC.

The DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

The same image of Belton's tattoo also seemingly appears in a report by the Texas department of public safety (DPS) about TdA activity.

The DPS also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration

after newsletter promotion

Since taking office, the Trump administration has deported hundreds of individuals it alleges to be members of TdA, sending them to a notorious prison in El Salvador without even a court hearing.

But in recent weeks, questions regarding the accuracy of these gang allegations have intensified, with lawyers arguing that some of the deportees were misidentified as a result of their tattoos.

Lawyers representing one man say that he was deported over a crown tattoo, which he says is inspired by the Real Madrid football team logo.

In another case, lawyers representing a makeup artist say he was deported after officials deemed his crown tattoos proof that he was a member of TdA. But his lawyers assert that his tattoos reference only the Three Kings Epiphany celebrations.

Exclusive: Action comes five years after lack of legal recognition for humanist marriage in England and Wales was ruled discriminatory

Two couples are taking the government to court over its failure to legalise humanist marriage in England and Wales five years after a ruling that the lack of recognition was discriminatory.

Engaged couples Terri O'Sullivan and Edd Berrill, from Coventry, and Nicole Shasha and Rory Booth, from Leicester, are preparing to go to court in their fight to be married in line with their humanist beliefs.

“It's insulting that we've got to try to prove our beliefs are valid to have them recognised,” O'Sullivan, 45, said. “It makes me feel a bit emotional because it's so important to us.”

O'Sullivan was raised as a Jehovah's Witness before leaving the religion at 21 after years of abuse and becoming homeless.

“To be able to stand in front of our friends and family and talk in a way that's important to us, it means everything … Being an ex-religious person who's experienced religious abuse, it's important I can now be something positive – I'm not just an atheist, I'm a humanist.”

Shasha, 32, said: “We're the examples, but there's going to be thousands of individuals like us.”

Booth, 32, said it was important they took a stand. “It's about making sure that people are treated fairly no matter who they are. It's not really just a humanist issue, it's an issue of fair treatment for everyone.”

Humanism, a non-religious worldview that emphasises human agency, is not recognised under marriage laws, meaning couples having a humanist celebrant must also have a civil registration service.

In 2020, the high court ruled the lack of legal recognition for humanist marriage in England and Wales “gave rise to discrimination”, with Mrs Justice Eady saying the then justice secretary, Robert Buckland, “cannot simply sit on his hands”.

Humanist marriages are legal in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and elsewhere in the world including New Zealand, Canada and Australia. In Scotland in 2022 there were 9,140 humanist wedding ceremonies compared with 8,072 based on faiths or other beliefs.

“It just feels like it has been fobbed off,” O'Sullivan said. “It makes no sense that it's perfectly fine in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but it's just not here. There's nothing really outlandish or bizarre about our views, they're pretty common.”

Berrill, 42, said he “started secondary school as a Catholic and left it as an atheist”, before discovering humanism 15 years ago.

“It's important for someone to represent the views and the rights of the non-religious, to stand up for us and make sure we've got the same representation and are afforded the same opportunities,” he said.

Shasha, who is a humanist funeral and wedding celebrant, co-runs a humanist group in Leicester with Booth, her partner of 11 years.

“I think sometimes people can assume that [humanism] is a vague ephemeral thing,” Booth said.

“We run a community group much like many religious people do …. So being able to have the humanist philosophy as part of our wedding would be a really lovely thing for us. It's an equalities issue.”

The government is expected to announce plans this year for an overhaul of marriage laws, which could allow weddings to take place at a variety of venues, based on recommendations from the Law Commission.

Humanists are concerned a major shake-up would take years to implement, and are calling on the government to move quicker to legalise humanist ceremonies.

Andrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, which is supporting the action, said: “Since 2013, every leader of the Labour party has said they supported legal humanist marriage and every Labour frontbench spokesperson has urged the government to act without delay.

“But today the same bad arguments that Labour comprehensively debunked from the opposition benches are made by Labour ministers without a blush. I can completely understand the frustration of these couples.”

He said expensive legal action was “nobody's first resort” and that “humanist marriage could be made legal within weeks at no cost and with no detriment to anyone, if the government chose to do so”.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “It is right the government takes the time to consider this important issue, including the Law Commission's 2022 report, and will set out its position in due course.”

            A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan's misty skyline into a tragedy.
    


            The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents – who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24.
    


            Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river.
    


            “The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,” Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS.
    


            A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. “The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,” former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday.
    


            Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN's Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn't feel safe in his own building.
    


            “Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,” Rakesh said.
    


            Here's what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board:
    


            The victims include Agustín Escobar, 49, his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, and their three children. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprubí's 40th birthday.
    


            “We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,” a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident “an unimaginable tragedy.”
    


            Camprubí was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020.
    


            “We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,” said a statement from Siemens Energy. “Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.”
    


            In addition to her international corporate career, Camprubí is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprubí's grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world.
    


            The pilot was also killed, though officials have not yet released their identity.
    


            CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims.
    


            The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims.
    


            The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan's downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

            Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon.
    


            At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said.
    


            Jersey City resident, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, described the sound as “such a loud sound. It felt like thunder,” she told WCBS. “Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it's just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that's when it was like, ‘OK, what's happening.'”
    


            With the helicopter's catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN's Kate Bolduan.
    


            “There's nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,” Brandt Anderson said.
    


            First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X.
    


            The aircraft's main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, WCBS reported.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat.
    


            “The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,” Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday's crash. “I'm a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon.”
    


            When asked about the helicopter's maintenance, he said, “That's something my director of maintenance handles.” The director of maintenance declined to comment.
    


            Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation.
    


            “(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn't arrive,” Roth told The Telegraph Thursday.
    


            The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.
    


            Maintenance records are not public and during investigations NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident.
    


            The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday's crash.
    


            Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a “go-team” to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have.
    


            The helicopter was flying within New York's Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone.

Advocates braced for revamp of certification system as experts warn of political pressure being brought to bear

Advocates for academic freedom are bracing for what they expect to be the next phase of the government's effort to reshape higher education: an overhaul of the system accrediting institutions of higher learning.

Donald Trump has made no secret of such plans. During the campaign, he boasted that accreditation would be his “secret weapon” against colleges and universities the right has long viewed as too progressive.

“I will fire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics,” Trump said last summer. “We will then accept applications for new accreditors who will impose real standards on colleges once again and once for all.”

In recent weeks, the government has taken aggressive actions against US universities in the form of funding cuts, a ban on diversity initiatives, and the targeting of international students. Dismantling the accreditation system would be a powerful tool to further erode the separation between the government's political ideology and what US students are taught.

While it's unlikely that Trump can delist currently recognized accreditation agencies, which are controlled by a bipartisan body enshrined in federal law, there are several ways in which the administration could weaken their authority to enforce schools' compliance with a series of standards. Project 2025 and efforts to curtail accreditors' power in some conservative states offer a blueprint for what several education professionals who spoke to the Guardian, along with officials at the Department of Education, fear may be an impending executive action on the issue.

Targeting accreditation – the peer-review system guaranteeing quality assurance on learning institutions – is part of the right's broader strategy to undermine higher education as a whole, advocates warn. Because accreditation by a recognized agency is required for students to be eligible for federal financial aid, the government has huge financial sway over how the system works.

“The Trump administration unfortunately doesn't care about quality assurance in higher education,” said Tariq Habash, a former education department official. “If colleges and universities do not align with this administration on diversity policies, on immigrants' or trans rights, or on speech supporting Palestinian rights, Donald Trump wants them to suffer the consequences, by illegally cutting off access to federal funds.”

Accreditation has been in place for centuries, but the government tied it to federal funding in the aftermath of the GI bill of 1944, when countless veterans were essentially defrauded by sham schools. Since the 1960s, degree-granting institutions have been overseen by a so-called “triad” regulatory mechanism involving federal and state authorities and independent accrediting agencies. Today, there are dozens of accreditors recognized by the Department of Education, including many specialised in technical subjects and six major regional accreditation agencies.

One way in which Trump may seek to undermine the current system – and one of several proposed by Project 2025 – would give states the authority to approve institutions for federal aid purposes, bypassing accreditors altogether. That's a troubling prospect for the ability of universities to remain independent of political pressure.

“If a state wanted to force institutions to act in certain ways to achieve accreditation, this would be a huge cudgel that could be used to make really fine-level changes in colleges and universities across the state,” said Timothy Cain, a professor of higher education at the University of Georgia who has researched accreditation practices. “At the core of it, it's a real problem for American democracy.”

Project 2025 also outlines how the government could prohibit accreditors from requiring universities to adopt diversity policies, from “intruding” upon the governance of state schools, and from enforcing standards that “undermine religious beliefs”. Such prohibitions would severely weaken accreditors' authority to ensure quality and serve as guardrails for education institutions' autonomy from government.

Trump is also expected to expand long-existing conservative attacks on the accreditation apparatus, which rightwing activists and legislators have often referred to as a “cartel”.

In 2023, Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, argued in a lawsuit against the Biden administration that the government had “ceded unchecked power” to accrediting agencies. Florida and North Carolina have passed legislation seeking to weaken accreditation standards. And during Trump's first term, the then secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, loosened accreditation regulation in the name of free-market competition, introducing policies that critics said would give schools an option to “shop” for more friendly accreditors.

Some Republican senators, including Marco Rubio before Trump appointed him secretary of state, also introduced legislation at the federal level seeking to prevent accreditors from requiring universities to adopt what Rubio called “woke standards”.

“The endgame is always about controlling the curriculum, and controlling what takes place within the classroom,” said Isaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College, whose research focuses on conservative efforts to undermine higher education. “In order to remake the institution, you need to get rid of the guardrails that would prevent you from exerting that much external interference.”

But there is an additional risk in Trump's suggestion that he would pave the way for “new accreditors” more aligned with the administration, Kamola noted.

“You're going to see a bunch of fly-by-night, grifty, Trump University-style colleges that are going to appear,” he said.

“And without accreditation, and federal funding being tied to accreditation, you're going to see a massive exodus of federal funds into the hands of a higher education mass grift economy. Student loan money will be spent in institutions that under the current regime would never be accredited.”

Some farmers recovered from president's first-term trade war and a fresh one is estimated to cost the state $6bn a year

California's $59bn agricultural industry is bracing for disruption as Donald Trump's tariffs continue to spike tensions and trigger economic turmoil with China – one of the state's biggest buyers.

California is the country's breadbasket, supplying roughly one-third of US vegetables and 75% of its fruits and nuts. But it also exports much of its produce – close to $24bn worth in 2022. This means farmers in the state could lose out significantly as China imposes retaliatory tariffs on US goods.

The threat of another prolonged trade war has contributed to growing uncertainty in an industry where decisions often have to be made long before harvests or sales. It's difficult for producers to decide to cull or keep dairy cows from their herds, rip plants tended to for years from the soil or pluck trellises of grapevines from their pastures.

Already grappling with extreme weather events that have damaged or destroyed crops and water restrictions that added challenges, a spate of Trump policies – including attacks on agricultural research, a funding freeze of billions from the US Department of Agriculture, and crackdowns on migrant workers – have left farmers reeling.

“The uncertainty is probably more of a problem than the tariff itself,” said Zachary Williams, sales director for Stewart & Jasper Orchards in Newman, California. “Uncertainty about whether there will be, or won't be, is a little harder to plan around.”

The issue is sharply affecting California almond growers, who collectively export close to three-quarters of what they grow. Roughly 76% of almonds eaten around the world currently come from the state, but Australia, the second-largest producer, could cater to countries unwilling to pay higher prices.

Fallout from Trump's first-term trade war is still fresh on the minds of many farmers and growers in the Golden state, when they were hit hard by Chinese retaliation.

“The first trade war was a disaster for California agriculture and in particular for tree nut exports – and they never really recovered,” said Colin Carter, professor emeritus of agriculture economics at the University of California, Davis. “Prices for pistachios and almonds have only just begun to rebound, he added, “but now the tariffs are even higher”.

The expansion of almond acreage stalled during the first trade war and walnut orchards were ripped from the ground. “A lot of farms were put up for sale, bankruptcies have impacted some processors, and that affected farms as well,” Carter said.

That trade war caused a $27bn loss to US agriculture. California tree nut growers were among the hardest hit, with losses at $880m, according to a 2022 analysis by UC Davis researchers.

Few saw a full recovery, even with a 2018 $12bn federal aid package for US farmers. Even though almond prices fell by more than a dollar a pound, “California's farmers were largely left out of the government compensation schemes,” Carter and his colleagues found in an analysis published late last year. Midwestern farmers, he said, received the bulk of federal subsidies.

This time around, Carter said, it could be worse. A new trade war could cost $6bn per year and wipe out one-quarter of California's agricultural exports. “This would have a ripple effect across the state, from the large almond orchards in the Central valley to the small family vineyards scattered throughout wine country,” according to Carter's analysis.

Officials at the USDA have hinted that the administration might offer aid funds for impacted farmers again, but the federal government might not be in a position to offer as much support or recovery tools if the Trump administration continues slashing staff, programs and budgets.

Almond farmers are well aware of the risks. Rick Kushman, a spokesperson for the Almond Board of California, said they are “closely monitoring the impacts” from both retaliatory levies and US tariffs that could affect imported materials the industry relies on.

Advocates for growers have also pushed officials to proceed cautiously.

“Almonds remain California's top agricultural export, $5.8 billion in 2024, underscoring their importance to both the state and national economies,” Alexi Rodriguez, the president and CEO of the industry advocacy group Almond Alliance, wrote in a letter to agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, and trade representative Jamieson Greer in March. She called for “careful consideration to be given to the risks of retaliatory tariffs”.

“When US tariffs are imposed, the resulting retaliatory tariffs could significantly disrupt US almond exports, depress farm prices, and further shift market share to competitors,” she said, noting that California almonds contribute more than $9bn to the state's economy.

But even as Trump takes grave risks with California agriculture in his attempts to rework global markets, few in the industry have been outwardly critical of his actions. Many growers are instead focusing on their confidence that the president will come through with campaign promises to make more water available for thirsty crops, even as supplies grow shorter.

A single almond requires more than a gallon of water to grow and trees have to be irrigated throughout the year. The nuts are controversial in the drought-prone state, where regulators are working to reign in strain on underground aquifers. Meanwhile, farmers face increasingly steeper fines and fees, along with challenges to maintain their orchards.

Along Highway 5, a thoroughfare that snakes through the heart of California's ag-land, large signs still signal the region's support for Trump and its ire against water restrictions. Farmland sprawling across the state's rural Central valley is still a bright-red belt in a deeply blue state.

Carter said he finds it ironic. Tariffs could prove even more costly than California's last devastating drought.

“The president says he supports agriculture but these trade wars send an opposite signal,” Carter said. “We are seeing that now. It is coming again. Foreign countries know which commodities to target.”

            Former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol moved back on Friday with his wife and their 11 dogs and cats to their apartment in an upscale district of Seoul, close to the prosecutors' office where the impeached leader worked before entering politics.
    


            Yoon and his wife Kim Keon Hee, known for their love of pets, are beginning a new life after he was impeached for a failed attempt to impose martial law and removed from office.

            Under Yoon, South Korea passed a bill to ban the eating and selling of dog meat in the country. The number of pets they own grew from four dogs and three cats at the start of his presidency, and now include a retriever that is a retired service dog adopted by Yoon in 2022.
    


            The couple's 164 sq meter apartment is located in a complex in the glitzy “Gangnam” area south of the Han river, and some neighbors have raised concerns about the return of a man who so polarized the nation during his stint in office.
    


            As many as 50 presidential security service personnel will be deployed to guard the couple, who are entitled to protection for at least five years, according to South Korean media reports.
    


            The three 37-story towers that make up the Acrovista complex are home to more than 750 households. Previously, South Korean presidents have moved into detached houses after leaving office, which have afforded much greater privacy.
    


            The security arrangement in the crowded residential property where they will now live is believed to have been one of the reasons that delayed their move back to the private home by a week after he was stripped of the presidency.
    


            Some neighbors have also fretted about their complex becoming a magnet for crowds of supporters and critics the couple might attract, local media reported, though others posted a welcome banner at the building entrance.
    


            Yoon said he had to declare martial law to raise the alarm about his opponents' unrelenting obstruction of political process that paralyzed government.
    


            The Acrovista complex is built on the site of the country's worst human-caused disaster - the collapse of a major department store in 1995 that killed 502 people and injured nearly 1,000 others.

Editor's note: Shift Your Mindset is an occasional series from CNN's Mindfulness, But Better team. We talk to experts about how to do things differently to live a better life.



            Although often invisible, chronic pain is everywhere. More than one-quarter of Americans have pain lasting more than three months.
    


            With medical treatment and lost productivity costs of up to $635 billion annually in the United States, pain is expensive as well as debilitating. The fact that traditional Western and alternative medicine have yet to confirm either a cause or a solution doesn't help.
    


            Psychotherapist Nicole Sachs is determined to interrupt this bleak narrative with a cure rooted in evidence-based brain science and mind-body medicine.
    


            In her new book, “Mind Your Body: A Revolutionary Program to Release Chronic Pain and Anxiety,” the author, podcaster and public speaker shares her method for eliminating not just chronic pain but also long Covid-19, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue and many other conditions. Where medication, physical therapy, supplements, procedures and treatments have failed, her approach, using a targeted writing practice called JournalSpeak, offers a possible cure.
    


This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.



CNN: What is mind-body medicine, and what role does it play in chronic pain? 



Nicole Sachs: Mind-body medicine is a paradigm that recognizes the influence of stored trauma and repressed emotions on physical health. My mentor, Dr. John Sarno, was a pioneering practitioner who challenged the Western assumption that pain or discomfort always correlates directly with the affected body part. His scientific work uncovered that, while real, some physical symptoms are not always tied to pathology in the body.
    


            Dr. Sarno called this condition Tension Myoneural Syndrome, or TMS, which is an umbrella term for the epidemic of chronic conditions that do not resolve by treating the symptomatic area of the body. Instead, chronic pain and other conditions can result from nervous system dysregulation that creates physical symptoms in response to stored trauma and an overflow of repressed emotions.
    


CNN: How can emotional stress cause physical symptoms?



Sachs: First, it helps to remember that all humans have unconscious processes that are essential to living, like circulating our blood, breathing or making our heart beat. In a sense, the unconscious nervous system signaling that causes chronic pain is equally reflexive. Beneath consciousness, each of us has an emotional reservoir that holds the extent of our grief, rage, terror, despair and shame. The extremity of these feelings is kept below the surface, under the cover of darkness, because feeling the pain of these emotions all the time would make it impossible to live our lives.
    


            Humans are a social species, and our need for connection is as imperative as food and water. If we were constantly aware of the depth of our emotional pain, we'd be too shut down to connect with others. So, our nervous system tries to keep that pain under wraps.
    


            But everyone reaches a point in life when this reservoir starts to bubble over. Too much stress, trauma or some devastating life event and all the emotions that have been stuffed down start to knock at the door of consciousness. That's when our nervous system steps in.
    


CNN: Why would the nervous system intentionally cause pain?



Sachs: Our nervous system has evolved to protect us against threats. Your brain perceives your repressed emotional world and stored trauma as predators, seeing them as far more dangerous problems than the physical manifestations of pain — because they're not easy to solve. And so, alarm bells go off. The nervous system switches into fight, flight, freeze or fawn mode. When your emotional “reservoir” becomes overwhelmed, your brain sends pain signals as a protective strategy.

A fitness expert shares a game plan for living without back pain



            If you are someone who struggles with back pain, for instance, that's likely your nervous system triggering symptoms to keep you safe — I call this “safe in the un-safest way.”
    


            Back pain might trigger you to take a pill, get into bed and cancel your plans for the day. This restores to the brain a sense of control and familiarity. However unwanted consciously, illness and injury are protective. They require us to slow down and allow us to ask for help, draw boundaries, say no and stay home. And just as you don't have a choice about whether to pull your hand off a hot stove, you don't get to decide not to have back pain right now if your reservoir is overflowing.
    


CNN: Does this mean the pain isn't real?



Sachs: The pain is very real; it just originates from emotional rather than physical stressors. Here's the fascinating part — all pain signals get fired by the brain and nervous system, landing in different bodily systems and muscles. All pain is felt from the brain. So, when you burn your finger, the nerves in your finger tell the brain that the sensory environment has changed. Then the brain, in a flash, interprets the level of danger and sends pain signals back to the finger. Pain's No. 1 objective is to protect you. With TMS, the brain sends these same pain signals as a protective mechanism, even without physical injury.
    


            Today's brain imaging technology even reveals that whether someone is experiencing emotional heartbreak or just broke their ankle the same part of the brain lights up.
    


CNN: What's the cure?



Sachs: Treatment has three key components. The first part of my prescription is knowledge. I need to teach you about the brain science and provide enough human examples to help you believe and not dismiss that this is what's happening in your human body.
    


            The second component of treatment is JournalSpeak — a specific writing practice I developed to release emotions. The third is practicing patience and kindness for yourself — self-compassion is a verb!

Startling new science reveals the truth about chronic pain



CNN: What is JournalSpeak, and how is it different from other forms of writing?



Sachs: JournalSpeak is a 20-minute, unfiltered writing practice, informed by your understanding of the nervous-system science, where you express your most unreasonable, raw emotions. This practice is like putting a ladle into the reservoir and dumping it out systematically, one day at a time. Once the level drops below maximum capacity, the pain signals stop firing, because your nervous system no longer feels the urgency to protect you from conscious awareness. After the 20 minutes, you destroy the writing. It's about releasing, not analyzing. Like blowing your nose into a tissue, you don't need to look at it again.
    


CNN: How could complaining on paper heal pain?



Sachs: JournalSpeak is like a venting apparatus for a closed system. Energy is neither created nor destroyed; it shifts from one form to another. The energy of grief and rage and shame and fear gets transformed into physical pain in the closed system of the human body. Writing the most unbridled, impolite, unreasonable, pathetic rant that gives voice to unseen, unheard parts of you opens a relief valve that transfers emotional pain onto the page. Once that energy is vented, the nervous system stops sending physical pain signals.

CNN: Is this approach limited to pain?



Sachs﻿: Not at all. One person's fatigue is another's back pain, is another's migraine or irritable bowel, or long Covid, and so on. The theory at the center of this approach is that there is one genesis for all these symptoms. The same principles can apply to autoimmune conditions, digestive issues and other chronic symptoms. The underlying mechanism is always the same: the nervous system sending signals as a protective response.
    


            When people realize that the sensations we feel in our body, no matter what they are, are controlled by the brain and the nervous system, they can understand why it really doesn't matter how the symptoms are showing up. The central nervous system is the control room for everything in the human experience.

Sachs: More and more scientific literature documents remission of pain and other chronic symptoms through mind-body practices. Recently, a randomized controlled trial by Dr. Michael Donnino, a professor of medicine and emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, compared three treatment approaches for chronic back pain.
    


            The first group continued their existing treatment regimens, while the second took an eight-week mindfulness stress reduction course. Participants in the third group received a 12-week psychophysiological intervention based on Dr. Sarno's work where they explored their emotional history using mind-body techniques. This group reported significantly less pain than participants in the other groups. About six months later, nearly 64% of people from the mind-body group reported being pain-free.
    


            Donnino's findings from a similar study on long Covid showed that symptoms previously attributed to physical causes resolved with mind-body medicine.

CNN: How can someone tell if their symptoms are TMS-related?



Sachs: First, consult a doctor to ensure that medically treatable diagnoses are not the root cause of your pain. But if you've had multiple medical tests with no clear explanation, if your pain moves around, or if it seems triggered by stress, these are potential TMS indicators. The key is understanding that pain can be a messenger, not just a malfunction. Once you receive a clean bill of health or you're diagnosed with chronic symptoms deemed incurable, nervous system dysregulation is a likely cause, and it's time to consider my three-part treatment approach.
    


CNN: Do I need to change my life to heal my symptoms?



Sachs: The goal is to recognize and process your emotions, not necessarily remove every source of stress. You don't have to blow up your life, quit your job or put your kids up for adoption. You don't need to change your life; you just need to know how you feel about it.

CNN: What's the first step toward mind-body healing?



Sachs: Start with curiosity. Approach your body with compassion, listen to its signals and remember that healing is possible. The beauty of this approach is its fundamental message of hope: Your body is not broken, and you have the power to heal. It's about understanding the intricate connection between your emotions and physical experience, and learning to work with your nervous system, not against it. Your body is trying to protect you. By understanding this, you can start a profound healing journey.
    


            You have so much more power than you realize to affect your physical and emotional health.

Carmaker removes ‘order now' buttons for Model S saloon and Model X SUV on its Chinese website amid tariffs war

Tesla has stopped taking orders in China for two models it previously imported from the US, as companies scramble to adapt to prohibitive tariffs imposed in Donald Trump's trade war.

The manufacturer, run by Trump's close ally Elon Musk, removed “order now” buttons on its Chinese website for its Model S saloon and Model X sports utility vehicle.

Tesla did not give any indication of why it had made the changes but it came after the rapid escalation of the trade war between the US and China. In tit-for-tat moves, Trump has raised total tariffs on China to 145%, while China responded on Friday by increasing its levies on US exports to 125%.

The border taxes make the goods trade between the two countries prohibitively expensive and mean cars imported from the US are now much less attractive in China than those produced locally.

New orders for the two imported models were also no longer available on Tesla's mini-program account on the Chinese social media app WeChat, Reuters reported. The “order now” buttons were replaced with “view available cars” for the Model S and Model X on the US carmaker's website, with some remaining cars appearing to be available for Chinese buyers.

Since 2020 Tesla has produced its Model 3 and Model Y cars in a large factory in Shanghai, giving it some insulation from the tariffs. However, the company is still likely to be heavily affected. Analysis by Nikkei Asia in 2023 suggested that about 40% of the companies supplying Tesla with battery materials were Chinese, although the carmaker has sought to source parts and materials from outside China as trade tensions between the US and China have increased.

Musk has been a key player in the Trump administration, leading the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, in its efforts to slash the US federal budget that have been described as illegal by constitutional experts. Yet he has also appeared to criticise the tariffs, saying last week that there should be “zero tariffs” between the EU and US. That is a stark contradiction to the 10% tariffs imposed by Trump on every nation in the world for 90 days, with the threat of the return of even higher levies.

Tesla last month warned the US government that tariffs could harm American companies, in a letter to the White House's trade representative.

The possible loss of orders would represent a significant financial blow to Tesla, at a time when it is already struggling with slumping demand, particularly in Europe. Although it is tricky to work out the motivations of buyers, analysts have said that Musk's close association with Trump has tarnished the brand, contributing to the sales slump. The company also has an ageing lineup of models that are struggling to compete with newer offerings, particularly from Chinese rivals such as BYD.

Dan Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, an investment bank, argued last week that Tesla was still undervalued, despite it being the most valuable carmaker in the world, at an $812bn market valuation on Friday. However, he said the company was facing a “full-blown crisis” and that Musk needed to leave the Trump administration.

Tesla was approached for comment.

Self-styled anti-corruption crusader Brice Nguema helped overthrow Bongo  family dynasty in August 2023

An estimated 1 million Gabonese citizens head to the polls on Saturday to vote in the country's first presidential election since an August 2023 coup ended the 55-year Bongo family dynasty. For Brice Nguema, the junta leader turned civilian head of state, it could be a chance to cement his democratic credentials.

Last November, 860,000 registered voters approved a referendum for a new constitution with two seven-year presidential terms and an amnesty for participants in the removal of Ali Bongo, who had succeeded his father in 2009. Officials are yet to release data on the updated voters' register but previously said they expected an additional 300,000 new registrations, including from those who have recently come of age.

Observer missions are already in place, including that of an eight-person Commonwealth team led by Danny Faure, a former president of Seychelles.

Four independents are in the race for president but analysts say the favourite is Nguema. Since coming to power, 50-year-old Nguema has styled himself as an anti-corruption crusader who had to resort to a coup to end an unpopular family dynasty, despite also being a cousin to Bongo. In October 2023, he made headlines for reportedly refusing to draw a salary for the presidency.

Those announcements drew plaudits in the oil-rich central African state where a third of the 2.3 million people live in poverty.

“Gabonese tell themselves that someone who works with this much ardour is trying to transform things,” Joseph Tonda, a sociologist at Omar Bongo University in Libreville, told Reuters news agency earlier this month.

But like his cousin, Nguema has maintained close ties with France even in the face of high anti-French sentiments in the region. And a 2020 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) revealed multimillion-dollar assets abroad, believed to be the proceeds of embezzlement during his time in the presidential guard.

His closest challenger is the ex-prime minister Alain Claude Bilie By Nze, who was in government until the coup. Nze, who has campaigned as a pragmatic veteran seeking to create jobs and reduce the size of government, has also tried to dissociate himself from the old guard.

Other candidates include the former tax official Joseph Lapensée Essingone and Stéphane Germain Iloko, previously a member of the former ruling Gabonese Democratic party (PDG).

The coup, one of a string of military takeovers in west and central Africa between 2020 and 2023, was well received in Gabon, with many citizens trooping to the streets of Port Gentil and Libreville, its two biggest cities.

But there are concerns that Nguema may also be using the same Bongo playbook of muzzling dissent.

In particular, the Union for Democracy and Social Integration (UDIS) party – once allied with the former ruling party – has accused the administration of targeting its exiled leader, Hervé Patrick Opiangah, who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged incest and undermining state security.

Opiangah, 54, a former mining minister, has proclaimed his innocence and filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.

Edmond Ngadi, a UDIS spokesperson who has called the matter a “state conspiracy”, said Opiangah was being targeted for mobilising for people to vote no during the 16 November referendum.

“This is a blatant violation of human rights … he is a Gabonese citizen who simply asks to return to his country safely to be able to secure his family, secure his businesses and also participate in the life of his country,” Ngadi said.

HBO renewed Mike White's hit drama before third season aired and rumours abound about luxury settings and return of stars

You've only just got home from a holiday when you start planning the next one. So it is with the super-rich spa satire The White Lotus. The gunsmoke is still clearing from the finale of the third season but speculation is rife about where the HBO hit will head next.

This week's climax of Mike White's drama might have divided critics, but it was still group chat-dominating, column inch-gobbling TV, notching its highest ratings yet. The show was renewed for a fourth trip before the third had even aired, with White reportedly pitching HBO execs his next idea while still filming in Koh Samui. Buzz is now building about the next chapter, expected on our screens in late 2026.

Each season has unfolded at a luxury resort in a different region. Viewers have been whisked to the Pacific (the debut season in Hawaii), Europe (the Sicily-set sequel) and Asia (the third hotel from hell, filmed in Thailand). White has previously said his dream for the show is to “hit every continent”.

If the pattern continues, options are likely to be Africa (there are rumours of a Moroccan riad, Kenyan safari or a sightseeing tour of Egypt), South America (Buenos Aires has been mentioned) or Australia (White has alluded to its “wealth of talent”).

A factor is the production's partnership with Four Seasons, after signing a reported £25m deal in 2021 to film exclusively in the high-end chain's resorts. Its five-star hotel in Marrakech's ancient medina has emerged as a frontrunner. White apparently stayed at the Four Seasons Tamarindo in Mexico before Christmas, potentially on a research trip. He is also said to have looked at £1,000-per-night glamping at the Four Seasons in Tanzania's Serengeti national park.

There is conjecture that after three sun-soaked stories, a cold climate would provide a change of gear. White had been spotted in Norway, making that a strong favourite. Local press reports suggest it nearly happened for season three. There are no Four Seasons sites in Norway, but spectacular alternatives include the Juvet Landscape hotel, which featured in the HBO series Succession.

However, the show's producer, David Bernad, has hinted this is a longshot, saying: “Mike doesn't like the cold. He's a California guy. He's not built for snow.” For his part, White has teased that the fourth season could move away from beach settings, saying: “I want to get a little bit out of the ‘crashing waves on rocks' vernacular.”

Tax incentives and subsidies will play a part in the decision, making Japan an attractive proposition. Four Seasons Kyoto or Osaka head the shortlist here. However, there have been calls for the production to stay closer to home. The media union Sag-Aftra wants the fourth season to be shot in California as part of its “stay in LA” initiative.

Perhaps the most definitive clue came from HBO's head of drama, Francesca Orsi, who said in February: “We're location scouting in the next couple of weeks. I can't really say where we're going to land but chances are somewhere in Europe.”

There are plenty of Four Seasons spots in mainland Europe to choose from, notably Cap-Ferrat in the French Riviera. However, White will not take an obvious path. “Where we choose to go next could be hugely impactful to that destination,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “That's why it was so cool to shoot in Thailand. It's hard to go backward. Doing it in Paris feels like a cop-out.”

As for the season four cast? Stick a pin in a list of A-list acting talent. Woody Harrelson came close to being cast in season three as the Bangkok berserker Frank, ultimately played by Sam Rockwell. It was only scheduling conflicts that scuppered Harrelson's involvement, so he could be high on the hitlist next time. Hollywood names will probably be joined by a scene-stealing British actor or two, with big impressions made by Tom Hollander, Leo Woodall, Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood in previous series.

Each season has featured overlapping characters. Jennifer Coolidge's needy heiress Tanya McQuoid provided continuity between the first two seasons in meme-spawning style. In season three Natasha Rothwell returned as the spa manager Belinda and Jon Gries as Tanya's murderous widower Greg AKA Gary.

Rothwell is a firm favourite with fans and could be due another comeback. Having tapped Greg for $5m hush money, Belinda has gone from put-upon staff to potential pampered guest. What better way to illustrate how wealth corrupts? Rothwell has said she “knows nothing” of what White has planned but would return if asked.

If she does not get the call, who are the other candidates? The unhappy honeymooners Shane and Rachel from season one (Jake Lacy and Alexandra Daddario) or season two's sex worker Lucia (Simona Tabasco) could work well. If it is a season three star, possible names include Carrie Coon as the brittle lawyer Laurie Duffy, Patrick Schwarzenegger as the protein shake-guzzling Saxon Ratliff or Parker Posey as his mother, Victoria, set to become a “prison widow”.

White has even mentioned an all-star series as a “cool” idea. “I feel like they'd do all the douchiest guys together or all the hotel managers together,” said Schwarzenegger.

One member of the White Lotus team who will not be returning is the Emmy-winning composer Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, whose feud with White has played out in public. After De Veer spoke out about creative differences over the latest theme tune, White hit back that this was “a bitch move”. We can safely assume someone else will supply season four's signature music.

            If José Luis Ballester was trying to make a name for himself at his first Masters tournament, he certainly succeeded. Just not in the way he might have expected before his opening round.
    


            The debutant, known by his nickname Josele, admitted to urinating in Rae's Creek on the 13th hole at Augusta National Thursday afternoon. Not quite the water hazard relief golfers usually take.
    


            The 21-year-old, who qualified for the major after winning the 2024 US Amateur at Hazeltine in Minnesota, defended his decision after the round.

            “I completely forgot that we had those restrooms on the left of the tee box,” Ballester told reporters.
    


            “And then I'm like, ‘I really need to pee.' Didn't really know where to go, and since JT (Justin Thomas) had an issue on the green, I'm just like, ‘Okay I'm just going to go sneak here in the river.'”
    


            Ballester didn't think anyone would see him. The Spaniard might've underestimated the number of fans and officials at an event like the Masters as after his bathroom break, he got a round of applause.
    


            “They clapped for me. Probably one of the (loudest) claps that I really got today. Like, really loud. So that was kind of funny,” Ballester said.
    


            Despite confirming that fans saw him, he felt no regret and was not concerned about any potential repercussions from Augusta officials.
    


            “It was not embarrassing at all for me,” Ballester added. “So, if I had to do it again, I would do it again.”
    


            And clearly it wasn't too much of a distraction as the Arizona State senior went on to par the hole.
    


            Peeing into Rae's Creek wasn't the only eye-catching moment of Ballester's opening round. He also garnered attention on social media for his Arizona State hat featuring upside down “Sun Devils” lettering. Augusta National is known to have strict dress code rules for players and patrons alike – something Jason Day knows all too well after being asked to tone down his outfits this year.
    


            Ballester, who was playing with last year's Masters winner Scottie Scheffler and world No. 8 Justin Thomas, ended the day tied for 73rd at four over par.

            When a 7.7 magnitude earthquake destroyed her family's home in Myanmar, US-based international student Hope Pyae felt helpless.
    


            On the morning of March 28, she woke to frantic calls from friends, who described to her the devastation of what was the strongest quake to have hit the country in more than 100 years. Thousands of people had been killed and injured, and untold numbers lay buried beneath the rubble.
    


            Glued to her phone, she grew desperate for updates as videos of fallen buildings and sacred pagodas spread across social media. She feared the worst for her family. And as the extent of the damage grew, so too did her feeling of impotence.
    


            Hope, for whom CNN is using a pseudonym for safety reasons, is among the growing number of international students who say they do not dare leave the US because they fear they will be barred from re-entry due to President Donald Trump's clampdown on immigration.
    


            The earthquake destroyed Hope's family home, forcing her parents to move into a one-story house they now share with nearly a dozen other relatives. She yearns to visit them, to offer her support, but feels trapped by the uncertainty of what might happen upon her return to US soil.
    


            “I really want to go home. I miss them so much,” Hope says, adding she is unable to shake “this feeling of, ‘what if I never meet them again,' or ‘what if somebody passes away' and I can't be [there].”
    


            So she remains in the US, journaling alone in her dorm to cope with the sadness.
    


            Since re-entering office in January, Trump has led a widespread crackdown on immigration which has included a series of arrests and deportation proceedings against people associated with US colleges and universities, sending shockwaves across the immigrant and academic community.
    


            As a result, many US colleges and universities, including UC Berkeley and Columbia, have begun advising international students, faculty, and staff to avoid non-essential travel, citing the unpredictability of US immigration policy and the possibility of Trump enacting a travel ban.
    


            Myanmar, also known as Burma, was among those countries included in the travel ban Trump ordered in his first term and, according to a memo seen by Reuters, is on a list of nations that could face a similar measure in his second.
    


            Against this background, many international students feel they have little choice but to stay put.
    


            For Hope, who is studying clinical psychology, there is a painful twist in that when she left Myanmar, she had mentally prepared herself that she might never see her family again – but for very different reasons.
    


            Her parents knew they would not have enough money to visit her, and they did not want her to risk coming back to a country that has been wracked by an ongoing civil war since a military junta took power in a coup four years ago.
    


            “When I left my country, I was like, ‘Oh, this might also be the very last time we meet,'” says the 21-year-old.
    


            She did not foresee it would be the politics of America, rather than Myanmar, that would hold her back.
    


            Another student from Myanmar, Emma, a high school senior from a township near the capital city Naypyidaw, had big dreams when she learned last month that she had been accepted to study political science at a US university with full financial aid.
    


            But she fears Trump's clampdown could hinder her ability to get a student visa, even as an applicant with financial aid and a scholarship.
    


            Emma, also identified by a pseudonym, fears that even if she does get into the US, she would then be too anxious to leave in case she is stopped from re-entering, despite having a valid visa.
    


            She is finishing off her high school studies in India, where her parents sent her for safety after the outbreak of the war, and is currently unable to contact them due to a combination of the damage the quake did to communication lines and deliberate VPN internet blockages by the military junta.
    


            The last, brief time she managed to get through to her family was on the day of the quake. Her mother was crying because a building had collapsed onto Emma's aunt, killing her.
    


            “The world [has] broken down in front of them,” she says. “It's like they don't have their world anymore.”
    


            There were more than 3,200 students from Myanmar studying in the US in the 2023/2024 school year, according to the Institute of International Education, a global non-profit that facilitates international student exchanges, including fellowships administered by the State Department. But they are not the only ones worrying about the immigration clampdown.
    


            Some 5,000 Myanmar nationals were issued immigrant and non-immigrant student and employment-based visas during fiscal year 2023, according to figures from a US State Department spokesperson, while thousands of others have come as refugees.
    


            According to the Department of Homeland Security, in the same fiscal year, over 6,000 Myanmar nationals came to the US as refugees – following only behind the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, and Afghanistan.
    


            A further 2,300 are under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, which opened to people from Myanmar about three months after the 2021 coup, according to the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy organization. Many of those with TPS also fear for their future, following the recent move by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to end the protection for about 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders.
    


            With no certainty of being able to enter, let alone stay in the US, Emma is planning to apply to universities in Europe and Asia as a backup plan.
    


            Wherever she ends up, she will feel the pull of her family in Myanmar – and particularly of her mother, with whom she has been particularly close since Emma's younger sister died when she was 8.
    


            “My parents already lost a child, and now I'm the only child. So, [my mother] really wants me to be with her, by her side,” she says.
    


            The shifting sands of US immigration policy are far from the only thing stopping students from returning to Myanmar for a visit.
    


            As a young man of fighting age, Hornbill, 19, faces the prospect that even a quick trip home could lead to him being drafted into the very same military he has dedicated much of his life to opposing.
    


            Three years after the coup that brought it to power, Myanmar's military – the Tatmadaw – introduced a draft for all men up to the age of 35 and women up to 27, and up to age 45 and 35 for men and women specialists, respectively, such as doctors.
    


            Before Hornbill, another pseudonym, moved to the US in July 2024 to study graphic design, he had actively protested against the junta leadership that overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint. Such defiance could easily have resulted in his death, as could any one of the several violent confrontations he had with soldiers. Miraculously, he escaped with his life – unlike his friend who was shot dead during an anti-coup demonstration.

            Since the coup, the Tatmadaw has cracked down on all dissent against it as it wages a brutal civil war that has displaced more than three million people. It has shot peaceful protesters and disappeared those who speak out against it. Its terror tactics include burnings, beheadings, mutilations, and torching villages, according to the UN.
    


            Still, Hornbill says he remains determined to speak out.
    


            “We're going to be the last generation to suffer from this,” he said. “We don't want our sons, grandsons, our next generation to suffer from this. We want our country to be at a better place for the next generation. So, we will sacrifice whatever we have to, but we're not letting this affect our next generation too.”
    


            Emma, 19, would also be eligible for mandatory military service were she to return. Still, she thinks it's a risk she needs to take soon, before she gets to the US and the window of opportunity closes.
    


            Her plan is to switch her passport type (Myanmar issues several different ones) from “standard visit” to “student,” which she hopes will prevent her from getting flagged for the draft when she crosses the border.
    


            “It's a very risky choice,” she concedes.
    


            “But I really want to go back home because I'm pretty, pretty sure it's going to be five, six years – until I graduate – [and that] I will not be able to go back home.”

            Republican Rep. Joe Wilson believes former President Joe Biden's landmark climate law was “fraud.” He dislikes the tax credits it created for solar power and electric vehicles. He's not opposed to clean energy, he said, he's just not interested in taxpayers funding it.
    


            But he is proud of the development of a Scout Motors electric vehicle factory and the 4,000 jobs it stands to create in his South Carolina district. The project, under construction about 15 miles north of Columbia, is relying at least in part on funding from the climate law, but Wilson thinks they'd move forward with the venture even if Republicans carry out Trump's desire to kill the clean energy credits in an upcoming budget vote.
    


            “I have not discussed this with (the company), but it would be my view from my visit there and understanding of what they're doing, I think they're so professional, they can handle it on their own without government subsidy,” Wilson told CNN.
    


            “Scout Motors is here to stay,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “With that said, the tax incentives that help companies who choose to manufacture great products here in the United States are important for our business. Repealing these tax incentives could have a significantly negative impact on American innovation, American job creation, and the growth of Scout Motors.”
    


            Wilson's position reflects the battle brewing between Congressional Republicans: Some vocally defend Biden's tax credits because they're bringing billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs to their districts; others want fulfill Trump's promise to terminate the law.
    


Nearly 80% of the investments sparked by the climate law has been in Republican congressional districts, according to data from the nonpartisan think tank Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Republicans represent 14 of the top 20 congressional districts that are set to gain the most jobs.
    


            Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas have gained most of the new jobs in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing, said Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group. Unlike Wilson, experts and business leaders aren't bullish the clean-energy ventures can stand on their own.
    


            “We'll see a huge number that get canceled” if the tax credits are killed, Houser said. “It's hard to predict exactly which facilities will get canceled, but a bunch of them will.”
    


            That could devastate Republican voters.
    


            “The worst thing that can happen is these factories get built, open, and either leave a ton of expected growth (and) jobs on the table — or they close entirely,” said Albert Gore, the executive director of EV trade group the Zero Emission Transportation Association. “That's a terrible outcome for these districts.”
    


            Republican infighting is on the verge of spilling into public view as Congress inches closer to its massive budget proposal, after House Republicans cleared a key procedural hurdle on Thursday. Now the hard work of filling in the budget blueprint while simultaneously making significant spending cuts begins, which is where the fate of the energy tax credits will be determined.
    


            Trump has vowed to “terminate” Biden's clean energy law, dubbing it the “Green New Scam,” and his administration has attempted to halt several federal grant programs created by the law with varying amounts of success.
    


            But it will take an act of Congress to reverse the tax credits that have spurred the investment and jobs in mostly Republican districts.
    


            No Republican lawmakers voted for the climate and tax law when it passed in summer 2022, opposing the climate measures as well as unrelated programs that boosted the number of IRS agents to collect tax revenue.
    


            Now, many House Republicans acknowledge the vital economic role clean-energy tax credits are playing in their districts.
    


            Rep. Mark Amodei, whose Nevada district is poised to gain more than 20,000 jobs in mining, refining and processing lithium for EVs and batteries, told CNN that continuing to fund these facilities in his district is “fundamental.”
    


            A bill that doesn't include these tax credits would be a red line for him, he said.
    


            “This makes good economic development sense, tariff policy sense and trade sense,” said Amodei, who recently met with lithium business leaders in his district. “If you don't have lithium production, it's like, ‘I'm going to see the baseball game, but we don't have a stadium.'”
    


            Buddy Carter's district in Georgia is home to a Hyundai electric-vehicle factory that could add more than 8,000 jobs, depending on outstanding funding from IRA tax credits. Carter thinks Republicans “should take a scalpel to (the clean energy law), and not a sledgehammer.” It's unclear which tax credits he would propose cutting and which he would keep.
    


            Carter told CNN the response he has received across the party, including from House Speaker Mike Johnson, has been “mixed.”
    


            House GOP lawmakers who want to keep the tax credits told CNN they have been doing outreach on the issue for months, which has included letters to House GOP leadership, educating members with specific examples of how their districts have benefited and conversations with the Trump administration.
    


            “This is something that I've been talking about for well over a year,” said Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus.
    


            The Trump administration's aggressive tariff push has shined a brighter spotlight on the case for the continuation of IRA tax credits.
    


            “Especially now with all the tariffs and the interest in trying to bring manufacturing back to the US, you can't have that manufacturing if you don't have energy and you can't run the plant,” said New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino, who led 21 Republicans in a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee last month calling for the tax credits to be preserved.
    


            Garbarino said there is a “need” for energy from renewables like wind and solar to keep projects powered. “It takes 10 years to build a natural gas plant,” he added.
    


            Rep. Darin LaHood of Illinois, whose district stands to gain nearly 13,000 jobs from projects including a re-opened Stellantis EV assembly plant as a result of IRA tax credits, acknowledged to CNN that there was a “bullseye” on the legislation since it was not initially passed with bipartisan support.
    


            LaHood, who sits on the Ways and Means panel, told CNN the task for Republicans will be figuring out how to not pull the rug out from under businesses that have been counting on and planning around these federal dollars.
    


            “These tax credits are not going to last in perpetuity or until the end of their life currently in the bill. But let's figure out what's the appropriate sweet spot for a reasonable ramp down” LaHood said, emphasizing that approach will vary by sector.
    


            Meanwhile, Rep. Randy Weber, who represents a swath of coastal Texas southeast of Houston, is not worried if his district loses over 10,000 jobs related to offshore wind manufacturing and carbon capture that IRA tax credits would bring.
    


            “If we have to give a little, we'll give a little,” Weber told CNN. “You're talking about jobs, but you're also talking about things that people have disagreement on. Not everybody is for offshore wind. I wish I could tell you they are.”
    


            In Tennessee, Ford is building a massive EV and battery factory in Rep. David Kustoff's district, which is part of the reason it stands to gain as many as 18,000 jobs — the most in the nation — from Biden's tax credits.
    


            Kustoff says the businesses he represents “have made investments where they've relied on what was passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.”
    


            But, deep in conversations with his fellow Ways and Means Committee members, Kustoff has a less-than-reassuring message to send back home.
    


            “Stay tuned.”

President Donald Trump is happy to talk about the financial markets when they're rising, as they were on Wednesday, but when markets were falling Thursday in the aftermath of his remarkable turnabout on tariffs, he punted to the closest adviser around.
    


            This time, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was in the hot seat.
    


            When a reporter in the Cabinet Room asked Trump to weigh in on yet another day of tumbling stocks, the president said: “Scott, do you want to have a statement on that?”
    


            “Sure,” Bessent said, pausing for a moment. “The up 2, down 1, is not a bad ratio – or up 10, down 5.”
    


            As his fellow Cabinet members and the president watched, Bessent filled the air with words. Finally, he arrived at this definitive message: “We will end up in a place of great certainty over the next 90 days on tariffs.”
    


            The next three months at the White House, until the deadline of the tariff pause approaches on July 8, will offer a telling window into just who has Trump's ear on trade policy.
    


            For now, that clearly includes Bessent, who is credited with persuading the president to pull back – at least temporarily – from the brink of economic calamity, emerging as one of the leading voices in the latest round of global economic upheaval.

            But others, including trade hawk Peter Navarro, continue to wield influence with Trump, even if to some it appeared his hardline position fell out of favor with Trump in his decision to retreat.
    


            Navarro acknowledged Thursday he wasn't in the room as the president reached his final decision; that duty fell on Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has rarely missed an opportunity to visit the West Wing, sometimes to the confusion of the people who work there.
    


            But Navarro — a longtime Trump ally who served prison time last year for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee that investigated January 6, 2021 — said it hardly mattered.
    


            “It doesn't matter who was in the room. The boss calls and whatever. That's not the point,” Navarro told CNN. “The point is that this team is the best team in history, we provide him the appropriate set of advice, every one of us on the team has a different skill set that combines to the collective wisdom of the group and the boss makes the decision.”
    


            To some, Trump's economic team amounts to “angels and demons,” whispering their divergent advice on tariffs and trade from opposite shoulders. To others, the disparate band of aides that have spent the past week forming, then reversing, new worldwide tariffs are all birds of a feather, willing to indulge the president's impulses no matter the economic cost.
    


            Whichever the interpretation, one truth abides in the second iteration of the Trump presidency: no one is voicing much dissent to the president himself, who continues to wage a global trade war that has spooked markets, foreign leaders and many of his own allies.
    


            That, officials say, is key to understanding the dynamics of the president's economic agenda amid an ever-more-volatile global economic standoff: Trump's objectives rest on the unapologetic view that the experts are wrong, and his gut is right.
    


            While Trump advisers this week quietly acknowledge the obvious — that the messaging, preparation and execution each fell far short of what was necessary on the reciprocal tariff plan — the decision to green light the action wasn't based on a whim.
    


            “Somebody had to pull the trigger,” Trump told reporters. “I was willing to pull the trigger.”
    


            Still, a week on the brink and the fallout in the day after Trump's three-month pause on some tariffs has laid bare the challenge ahead, and the people who will manage it.
    


            The Wall Street vs. Trade Warrior construct that defined Trump's first economic team was rife with bureaucratic knife fights, profanity-laced shouting matches and, on more than one occasion, aides on the verge of physical altercation.
    


            From the outside, the 2.0 version of Trump's team has been viewed in a similar manner, with former hedge fund manager Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in the “Wall Street” camp and Navarro, Lutnick and Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff for policy, filling the “trade warrior” roster.
    


            That dynamic does exist, but by degrees of difference, not chasms. And unlike in Trump's first term, when advisers like Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin made overt efforts to limit the president's tariff impulses, the president's advisers this time have all been explicit that they aren't there to chart their own path. Trump decides, and they execute, whether it was their preferred option or not, White House officials say.
    


            That dynamic was on display this week, as Trump's tariffs rocked the global economy. Trump's team regularly updated him on market conditions and had asked for his team to prepare a number of options for ways to pump the brakes as market conditions worsened. He kept a close eye on the business news networks and the perspectives shared on television by CEOs.

            Trump and some of his senior aides took notice when it appeared some members of his team seemed out of step in interviews, including on whether the tariffs amounted to a negotiation or whether they were meant to be permanent. Lutnick's appearances in particular frustrated many officials, and his television bookings waned in the days before Wednesday's pause.
    


            Mostly, however, Trump was on the phone with foreign counterparts and powerful executives desperate for some kind of exit ramp.
    


            “He just loves this shit,” a senior White House adviser said. “Talking deals with the most powerful people in the world when he's got all the cards and leverage is like air for him.”
    


            Trump has made clear to his economic team that he wants to be personally involved in each negotiation – and that he plans to drive a hard bargain and secure tangible wins, even if his threshold or even parameters for that metric are a mystery to his top aides.
    


            “My opinion is that there's a variety of improvements that could take place,” Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran said when asked for clarity earlier this week. “But at the end of the day the president is the decider and he's gonna decide.”
    


            Miran's answer, while obvious on some level, also reflects a reality about Trump's economic team that is dramatically different from his first. There are disagreements and varying degree of enthusiasm about the president's final decision to impose sweeping new tariffs from the Rose Garden on April 2. But there has been no real attempt at changing his mind.
    


            The White House has, at times, tried papering over the differences between Trump's aides. But for the most part, they have allowed the dissension to spill into public view, suggesting it actually reflects a robust decision-making process and not the chaotic viper pit it can appear from the outside.
    


            “(Trump) has people at the highest levels of this government in this White House who have very diverse opinions on very diverse issues. But the president takes all opinions in mind, and then he makes the best decision based on the best interests of the American public,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week while explaining why Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser who has little role in trade talks, called Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” online.
    


            “Elon and I are fine,” Navarro told CNN on Thursday. “It's no problem. It's no problem.”
    


            Bessent is among the newest members of Trump's economic team – shedding his Democratic stripes long ago to support the president's campaign – who has been put forward again and again as a reassuring voice over the past week. He often appears as something of a reluctant messenger, being asked to deliver news through carefully parsed words that can move markets.
    


            A longtime associate of Bessent, who does not share his current political views, said it was “astonishing” to see Bessent become the face of Trump's policy, but also “comforting” to see him searching for an exit ramp.
    


            “If he didn't know what he was getting into before this, he knows it now,” the associate said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating Bessent. The associate said he had “empathy, but no sympathy” for Bessent's role.
    


            Bessent has actively sought to downplay both his own role in the decision and how heavily the markets factored into Trump's thinking.
    


            “He and I had a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along,” Bessent told reporters in the White House driveway, an opaque reference to the lengthy conversation he held with Trump in Florida and on Air Force One about how to better articulate the endgame of the tariffs, which in his view was a series of negotiated trade deals.
    


            That stood in contrast to Lutnick, who wasted little time making clear on social media that he had been standing in the room with Trump when he made the reversal announcement.
    


            Navarro, meanwhile, took what appeared to be a loss in stride. He denied any tensions with his fellow advisers.
    


            “It's the whole team. We work together beautifully. I mean, Scotty is one of my best friends. We have known each other for years now,” he said on Fox Business, using a nickname for Bessent not particularly widespread in Washington. “It's a beautiful thing. … If you went behind the scenes and actually sat in on some of these meetings, we got really smart people. Each has their own comparative advantage. We all get along. We all have great ideas.”
    


            “And the president – the president is the one who guides this whole thing,” he said.
    


            Caustic, indefatigable and the keeper of Trump's maximalist “Tariff Man” flame, Navarro is firmly in the barrel as allies look for scapegoats to pin for a disjointed and messy rollout.
    


            Navarro has been a mainstay in Trump's orbit since Jared Kushner called him out of the blue, offering the role of trade adviser to Trump during his first campaign. He'd come across Navarro's book “Death by China” in the search for anyone who aligned with Trump's hardline protectionist views.
    


            He's never left, despite a long list of efforts to keep the two apart. Cohn blocked his ability to send memos directly to Trump's desk. Mnuchin undercut his ability to push more hawkish China views in the first term. And onetime chief of staff John Kelly demoted him to the periphery of the White House organizational chart.
    


            A judge sentenced him to jail.
    


            Navarro left prison and flew directly to the 2024 Republican National Convention to speak a few hours later. At one point, he pulled his fiancé on stage with him and kissed her.
    


            Standing at the back of the convention hall floor, a Republican official who served on Trump's first White House staff shook his head with a smile.
    


            “This is peak Peter,” he said.
    


            That same official, reminded of that moment this week, laughed and asked to change his answer.
    


            “I was wrong, clearly,” the official said. “This – these tariffs – this is peak Peter.”

This blog is now closed, you can read the latest in our Ukraine coverage here

We're just getting new lines from the Kremlin, confirming that US president Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff who landed in Moscow a few hours ago will meet Russian president Vladimir Putin.

In reports carried by Reuters from Russian agencies, Ria and Interfax, the Kremlin is also quoted as saying the pair will talk about Ukraine and “may discuss Putin's meeting with Trump”.

But also a caveat that “Witkoff's visit to Russia cannot be called momentous, no breakthroughs should be expected.”

… and on that note, it's a wrap from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

US envoy Steve Witkoff visits Russia today, where his is expected to meet Russian president Vladimir Putin (14:27). The meeting comes amid growing impatience over Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire and peace talks over Ukraine, with US president Donald Trump saying “Russia has to get moving” (16:10).

Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov warned Russia was ramping up its military production and has shown no will for peace (12:55).

His comments came on the day as western allies mobilised over €21bn in new military aid to Ukraine, including from the UK and Germany.

But German defence minister Boris Pistorius stressed that “given Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future.”

British defence secretary John Healey strongly pushed back on EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas's apparent criticism that there was a lack of clarity on the Coalition of the Willing's plans for the reassurance force in Ukraine (9:39), saying the planning was “real, substantial, well advanced,” and the EU was not a part of it (12:59).

On economy front, the EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič will go to Washington on Sunday for further talks with US counterparts on tariffs, a commission spokesperson confirmed (11:52).

And finally, in Greenland, the head of the US military base that was visited by vice-president JD Vance has been fired for criticising Washington's agenda for the Arctic island (10:35).

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

I am also on Bluesky at @jakubkrupa.bsky.social and on X at @jakubkrupa.

We also got an update from Trump on what he thinks about Russia as his envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow for talks with president Vladimir Putin.

Here's his post on Truth Social:

Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war - A war that should have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!

… and if you wondered what president Donald Trump thinks of his tariffs policy, here's his take, as published on Truth Social just now:

We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY. Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT

If you want to know what the markets think – the New York Stock Exchange has just opened for trading – our business live blog is here:

The EU will not rip up its tech rules in an attempt to reach a trade deal with Donald Trump, the bloc's most senior official on digital policy has said.

Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission vice-president responsible for tech sovereignty, indicated the EU was not going to compromise on its digital rulebook to reach an agreement on trade with the US – a key demand of Trump administration officials.

“We are very committed to our rules when it comes to the digital world,” Virkkunen said in an interview with European newspapers, including the Guardian. “We want to make sure that our digital environment in the European Union … that it is fair and it's safe and it's also democratic.”

But also a caveat that “Witkoff's visit to Russia cannot be called momentous, no breakthroughs should be expected.”

Elsewhere, Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has offered his condolences to friends and relatives of a Spanish family who died in New York on Thursday after their sightseeing helicopter crashed in the Hudson River, killing all onboard including the pilot.

It emerged on Friday that the victims were Agustín Escobar, his wife, Mercè Camprubí, and their three children, who were 11, five and four. The identity of the pilot has not yet been made public.

The sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair and crashed upside down into the Hudson between Manhattan and the New Jersey waterfront shortly after 3pm local time, leading to a huge response from emergency crews.

Umerov gets asked about Witkoff's trip to Russia, but sidesteps the question, as he says he only just heard about it, and he hopes to hear from US counterparts on this later.

And that concludes the press conference.

Pistorius gets also asked if Germany could provide more Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine, but he says that is not an option at that moment as it is waiting on deliveries of these systems itself.

Asked about it, Germany's Pistorius plays down the significance of US defence secretary Pete Hegseth's participation via a video call, and not in person.

He says “it is a matter of schedules,” as Hegseth only returned to the US from other grips, and said that some other ministers were not physically here for the same reason.

“The most important fact was that he took part,” he said.

He says:

“And in the near future, in the weeks to come, we will see what's going to happen with the US participation, with the US support. 

I am not able to … look in the crystal ball. We wait and see. …

We take on more responsibility as Europeans and Nato as Europeans, together with UK.”

Ukraine's Umerov supports him speaking along the same lines.

UK defence secretary John Healey strongly pushed back on EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas's apparent criticism that there was a lack of clarity on the Coalition of the Willing's plans for the reassurance force in Ukraine (9:39).

Asked about it, he says:

Our planning is indeed for the Coalition of the Willing, [it is] real, substantial, well advanced. The European Union is not part of that planning.

Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov says he informed other ministers that “Russia is ramping up its production … and does not show any evidence [it is] willing to have peace.”

He thanks allied countries for their continuing help, stressing the particularly urgent need for more air defence systems.

UK defence secretary John Healey says today's discussions led to over €21bn in fresh military aid commitments from allied countries, “a record boost in military funding for Ukraine.”

He adds the UK also continues its support, with the total of £4.5bn to be spent on military support for Ukraine this year.

Healey joins Pistorius in calling out Putin's continuing aggression:

Today is one month to the day in which Russia rejected president Trump's peace settlement. 

Putin said he wanted peace, but he rejected a full ceasefire. 

Putin said he wanted peace, but he continues to drag his feet and delay negotiations. 

Putin said he wanted peace, but his forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike.

Speaking about the current situation, German defence ministers Pistorius – who is expected to retain his job in the next coalition government – says that:

“Given Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future.” 

He adds:

“We will ensure that Ukraine continues to benefit from our joint military support. Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting, and we will support it.”

Germany's Pistorius condemns Russia for “continuing its attacks against Ukraine,” as he says Moscow “is still not yet interested in peace.”

“Ukraine needs a strong military, and only then can the negotiation process lead to a just and lasting peace,” he says.

German, British and Ukrainian defence ministers are giving a press conference after today's meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group now.

I will bring you they key lines here.

Separately, speaking at a press conference in Warsaw, EU economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis spoke about the US tariffs, saying that:

The nature of these rapidly moving developments make it difficult to assess their impact on the EU's economic outlook.

But what is clear and what also ministers in today's meeting agreed on is that the impact of the tariffs, it will be the US itself that will be first and most hit by the tariffs.

He said that early model simulations indicated the US GDP would be reduced by 0.8 to 1.4% until 2027, with the EU's growth hit much lower, at 0.2%.

“These model simulations do not account for additional loss of investor and business confidence in the US economy, which could further the negative GDP impact,” he added.

He said:

“So let me make it clear, Europe did not start this confrontation, and Europe does not want this confrontation. 

Tariffs go against the political and economic logic of deep and longstanding transatlantic trading partnership, … so from commission side, will continue to closely monitor financial developments in a days and weeks ahead. 

We're ready to negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome while defending our economic interests so there is no need to continue to hurt the US own and our economy.”

We're getting an update on US envoy Steve Witkoff's visit to Moscow, with TASS news agency reporting he met with Vladimir Putin's international cooperation envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

I will bring you more on their conversation if and when we have it.

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič will go to Washington on Sunday, a commission spokesperson told the Irish broadcaster RTÉ.

Olof Gill told RTÉ radio:

The trade commissioner is gong to Washington to try and sign deals. That is what we are focused on.

Twice-daily hiking trips for civilians in Golan buffer zone recently seized by Israel sold out almost immediately

Israel's military is organising hiking tours for civilians in newly occupied Syrian territory during the Passover holiday, local media has reported.

The twice-daily tours in the contested Golan Heights will run for a week beginning this Sunday. Tickets sold out almost immediately.

Under a military escort in bulletproof buses, small groups will travel up to 2.5km into Syrian territory that was off limits until the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) seized the Golan buffer zone after the fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December. Israel has occupied the Golan Heights since 1967 and now controls hundreds more square kilometres of Syrian land.

The itinerary includes the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, which overlooks Damascus, and Lebanon's Shebaa Farms at the foot of the mountain. The Israeli-occupied strip of Lebanese land, reputedly the site of God's covenant with Abraham, has been a flashpoint for violence between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for decades.

Visitors will also be able to hike and swim in the Ruqqad river valley which flows into the Yarmouk on the border with Jordan, and see parts of the abandoned Ottoman Hejaz railway, which used to connect the empire's capital in Istanbul to Haifa, Nablus and holy sites in present day Saudi Arabia.

The trips have been organised by the IDF's 210th Division, the Golan regional council, the Keshet Yehonatan religious education centre, the environmentalist Golan Field School and the Israel nature and parks authority, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported.

The tours are part of a wider initiative, “Returning to a Safer North”, after the end of last year's Israel-Hezbollah war, which was part of the regional fallout ignited by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in the Gaza Strip.

The Israeli military said: “It's important for us to restore heritage and tourism to the region and to tell the story of the battles fought during the war.”

Tourists sign up at their own risk and the trips may be cancelled at short notice if there are security issues. In response to questions from Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the IDF said that the tour was “inside Israel”, rather than Syria, although the visits take place in the Golan Heights demilitarised buffer zone, internationally recognised as Syrian territory.

The IDF began a heavy bombing campaign across Syria targeting the regime's weapons stockpiles shortly after Assad fled the country, while ground troops advanced in violation of a 1974 agreement.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has demanded that forces belonging to Syria's new Islamist-led transitional government stay away from the border area and that the IDF remain until an alternative arrangement can be found.

Given demand, organisers have said that they hope the security situation will permit additional tours to Syria after Passover.

JENA, La. (AP) — Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil can be kicked out of the U.S. as a national security risk, an immigration judge in Louisiana found Friday during a hearing over the legality of deporting the activist who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations.

The government's contention that Khalil's presence in the United States posed “potentially serious foreign policy consequences” was enough to satisfy requirements for his deportation, Immigration Judge Jamee E. Comans said at the conclusion of a hearing in Jena.

Comans said the government had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable.”

Lawyers for Khalil said they plan to keep fighting. The judge gave them until April 23 to seek a waiver. Meanwhile, a federal judge in New Jersey temporarily barred Khalil's deportation.

Addressing the judge at the end of the hearing, Khalil mentioned that she said at a hearing earlier in the week that “there's nothing more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness.”

“Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process,” he added.

His lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout, also criticized the hearing's fairness.

“Today, we saw our worst fears play out: Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing, and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent,” Van Der Hout said in a statement.




Khalil, a legal U.S. resident, was detained by federal immigration agents on March 8 in the lobby of his university-owned apartment, the first arrest under President Donald Trump's promised crackdown on students who joined campus protests against the war in Gaza. 

Within a day, he was flown across the country and taken to an immigration detention center in Jena, thousands of miles from his attorneys and wife, a U.S. citizen who is due to give birth soon.

Khalil's lawyers have challenged the legality of his detention, saying the Trump administration is trying to crack down on free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has cited a rarely used statute to justify Khalil's deportation, which gives him power to deport those who pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”

At Friday's hearing, Van Der Hout told the judge that the government's submissions to the court prove the attempt to deport his client “has nothing to do with foreign policy.”

Earlier this week, Comans challenged the government to share proof that Khalil should be expelled from the country for his role in campus protests against Israel and the war in Gaza. She said if evidence does not support his removal, she would “terminate the case on Friday.”

On Friday, Justice Department attorneys said in papers filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, that Comans would not have the authority to immediately free Khalil.

They said an immigration judge could determine if Khalil is subject to deportation and then conduct a bail hearing afterward if it is found that he is not.

Khalil isn't accused of breaking any laws during the protests at Columbia. The government, however, has said that noncitizens who participate in such demonstrations should be expelled from the country for expressing views that the administration considers to be antisemitic and “pro-Hamas,” referring to the Palestinian militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Khalil, a 30-year-old international affairs graduate student, had served as a negotiator and spokesperson for student activists at Columbia University who took over a campus lawn last spring to protest Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

The university brought police in to dismantle the encampment after a small group of protesters seized an administration building. Khalil is not accused of participating in the building occupation and wasn't among the people arrested in connection with the demonstrations.

But images of his maskless face at protests, along with his willingness to share his name with reporters, have made him an object of scorn among those who saw the protesters and their demands as antisemitic. The White House accused Khalil of “siding with terrorists,” but has yet to cite any support for the claim.

Federal judges in New York and New Jersey have ordered the government not to deport Khalil while his case plays out in court.

The Trump administration has said it is taking at least $400 million in federal funding away from research programs at Columbia and its medical center to punish it for not doing enough to fight what it considers to be antisemitism on campus.

Some Jewish students and faculty complained about being harassed during the demonstrations or ostracized because of their faith or their support of Israel. 

Immigration authorities have cracked down on other critics of Israel on college campuses, arresting a Georgetown University scholar who had spoken out on social media about the Israel-Gaza war, canceling the student visas of some protesters and deporting a Brown University professor who they said had attended the Lebanon funeral of a leader of Hezbollah, another militant group that has fought with Israel.

The Federalist correspondent Brianna Lyman joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss a DOJ appeals order to return a suspected MS-13 member to the U.S. and 19 states suing over President Donald Trump's election executive order. 

A Maryland federal judge lambasted government attorneys Friday during a hearing over efforts to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, from a prison in El Salvador. 

Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported to El Salvador last month for being an alleged MS-13 gang member. His attorneys, however, have maintained that he does not have any ties to the violent gang. 

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned DOJ attorney Drew Ensign as to Abrego Garcia's whereabouts after the Supreme Court upheld Xinis' order that federal officials must coordinate his return back to Maryland.

Xinis asked Ensign where Abrego Garcia was, and under "whose authority," to which Ensign responded, "I do not have that info."

"I do not have that knowledge, and therefore I cannot relay that info to the court," Ensign said. "They have not provided that confirmation before this hearing."

The judge was unsatisfied with the government's answer. "I'm not asking for state secrets. I'm asking where one man is," Xinis responded. "The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I'm asking a very simple question: ‘Where is he?'"

After Ensign again said he did not have the information on hand, Xinis said, "That is extremely troubling."

In a Thursday order, the Supreme Court noted that "The United States acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador was therefore illegal." 

DOJ ASKS TO DISMISS VIRGINIA CASE AGAINST SALVADORAN ACCUSED MS-13 LEADER SET TO BE DEPORTED

The high court proceeded to say that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador."

Ensign made clear during the Friday hearing that the government intended to comply with the Supreme Court's order. When asked what had been done thus far to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, Ensign said it was "unclear."

"That means they haven't done anything," Xinis responded.

Xinis and Ensign engaged in a back-and-forth over their reading of the high court's order. Ensign said the government had understood the order to require that it must "hear what the executive branch says in a brief."

"We read the Supreme Court's order differently," Ensign said. "It said deference to the executive branch."

Xinis, instead, said her reading was that the government take all the necessary steps to facilitate the return as soon as possible.

"I hear you and disagree," Xinis responded. 

ACCUSED MS-13 LEADER NABBED BY PATEL'S FBI TO REMAIN IN CUSTODY FOR NOW, JUDGE RULES

Xinis proceeded to request daily updates as the case continued "from a person with direct knowledge," saying she would be issuing an order that delineated the request. 

"My message, for what it's worth is, if you can do it, do it tomorrow. I don't understand why it can't be done," Xinis said. 

Ensign noted that he thought the orders were "impractical" but reemphasized that the government would be complying with the Supreme Court's order. 

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked to weigh in on the matter during a Friday briefing in light of El Salvador's president visiting the White House next week. 

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked to weigh in on the matter during a Friday briefing in light of El Salvador's president visiting the White House next week.  

"The Supreme Court made their ruling last night very clear that it's the administration's responsibility to facilitate the return, not to effectuate the return," Leavitt said. 

"The District Judge made clear that she's not going to let the government continue to play games while a man's life is at stake," Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, counsel for Abrego Garcia, told Fox News Digital. "They need to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia home, and until then, they need to provide meaningful status updates showing their progress in doing so."

Abrego Garcia was arrested in Baltimore on March 12 after working his shift as a sheet metal apprentice. The complaint states that he had also picked up his now-five-year-old son, who has autism and other disabilities, from his grandmother's house before his arrest.

Abrego Garcia had initially fled El Salvador to escape gang violence, according to court documents. Beginning in 2006, gang members "stalked, hit, and threatened to kidnap and kill him in order to coerce his parents to succumb to their increasing demands for extortion."

He eventually entered the United States illegally in 2011 and began living in Maryland with his brother, who is an American citizen.

Interim Top Federal Prosecutor for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba addresses reports that New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has allegedly ordered police to stop cooperating with ICE on ‘Hannity.'

President Donald Trump's longtime legal counsel and appointee as U.S. attorney for New Jersey announced Thursday she will launch a probe into Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over reports that state police were asked to ignore new immigration warrants.

Alina Habba said on "Hannity" she decided to launch the probe following a Shore News Network report that an internal memo from New Jersey State Police (NJSP) Col. Patrick Callahan revealed Murphy and Platkin ordered that officers not pursue thousands of immigration warrants recently added to the National Crime Information Center.

The move was reportedly meant to be in line with former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal's 2018 "Immigration Trust Directive," which limited the types of voluntary assistance state and local police could offer the feds.

"We know that the governor has on his website, currently, dos and don'ts for his local state of law enforcement. Those dos and don'ts instruct them not to cooperate with illegal immigrants who have administrative warrants that have been issued by the court after due process," Habba said.

"It is instructing them to go against our federal rules, our executive orders."

She said her new probe into Murphy and Platkin should be a warning to all other state leaders that if they hinder the FBI, DEA or other federal law enforcement agencies, they will be held accountable.

"[W]e are to take all criminal, violent criminals and criminals out of this country and to completely enforce federal law. And anybody who does get in the way of what we are doing - which is not political, it is simply against crime - will be charged in the state of New Jersey for obstruction, for concealment, and I will come after them hard."

Habba, whose office is based in Newark, said she met with state law enforcement on Thursday and noted they do not have the same authority as federal officers, but they can still legally notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hand off or alert them to immigration-related investigations.

DEMOCRATS RAIL AGAINST ‘EGREGIOUS' ICE RAID IN NEW JERSEY AFTER MILITARY VETERAN QUESTIONED 

"If anybody wants to use politics or their position to go and violate any federal law or any executive order in this state, and that includes sanctuary cities, and I'm looking at you in Paterson - I will be investigating you, and if you did commit a crime, if you ordered obstruction, if you are ordering concealment and harboring, you will be charged."

Fox News Digital reached out to Murphy, Platkin and Paterson, New Jersey, Democratic Mayor Andre Sayegh for comment.

Sayegh recently made waves politically last month, when he declared Paterson the American "capital of Palestine." The city has a large Muslim and Arabic population.

Murphy recently suggested he was housing a migrant at his Monmouth County home and went on to dare Trump to do something about it.

In February, he said he and New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy were talking about "someone in our broader universe whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to."

"And we said, you know what? Let's have her live at our house above our garage," Murphy said.

"Good luck to the feds coming in to try to get her."

Fox News Digital reached out to NJSP for more information on the memo and its actions in regard to Murphy's order.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen hit back at the Trump administration's 'tone' regarding Greenland on Friday. (Denmark Foreign Ministry)

The Pentagon fired the commander at the U.S. Space Force base in Greenland after she distanced herself from Vice President JD Vance, who recently visited the headquarters. 

After the vice president's visit, Col. Susannah Meyers emailed base personnel on March 31, writing, "I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the U.S. administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base."

She added that she had "spent the weekend thinking about Friday's visit — the actions taken, the words spoken, and how it must have affected each of you." The email was first reported by Military.com.

The Space Force said in a public statement Meyers had been relieved of command "due to loss of confidence in her ability to lead."

"Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties," the statement read. 

Col. Shawn Lee has now assumed the command, Space Force said. 

"Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense," Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell posted on X. 

Meyers became commander of the 821st Space Base Group in July, according to a Facebook post about the change-of-command ceremony. 

Republican Sens. Tommy Tuberville, Ala., Eric Schmitt, Mo., and Jim Banks, Ind., all praised the firing of the commander on X. 

"Colonel Meyers tried to politicize the Space Force and was held accountable. Lloyd Austin isn't SecDef anymore," Banks wrote.

Vance, during his visit to the snow-covered island, criticized Denmark for treating Greenlanders as "second-class citizens." 

"Our message to Denmark is very simple," Vance said. "You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security of this incredible, beautiful landmass."

The vice president further accused Denmark of not keeping Greenland safe from China and Russia. 

Vance was the highest-ranking official to ever travel to the base in Pituffik, the White House said. 

The Trump administration has made acquiring Greenland a top goal. 

"We need Greenland for national security and international security," President Donald Trump said on March 11.

"So, we'll, I think, we'll go as far as we have to go," the president continued, speaking from the Oval Office. "We need Greenland. And the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark. Denmark has to have us have Greenland. And, you know, we'll see what happens. But if we don't have Greenland, we can't have great international security."

"I view it from a security standpoint, we have to be there," Trump added.

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A pastor was abducted by armed and masked men as he was preaching a sermon before a congregation in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, police said Friday. 

Four men broke into the Fellowship Baptist church in Motherwell Township on Thursday evening, stole two cellphones from members of the congregation and took away the pastor in his own truck, said police, who have now initiated an investigation into abduction and armed robbery. 

Local media named the victim as Josh Sullivan, 45, from the U.S. state of Tennessee, but police would not confirm the identification. 

According to the Fellowship Baptist church blog, Sullivan, who described himself as a “church-planting missionary,” his wife Meagan and two children arrived in South Africa in November 2018 to run the Motherwell branch.

An image showing Sullivan preaching behind a pulpit was uploaded on X by a user going by the name of Tom Hatley. Sullivan identifies a man with the same name as his childhood and training pastor on his own blog. Hatley claimed that he was posting on Sullivan's wife's behalf and prayed for a safe return.

A Maryville, Tennessee woman by the name Tonya Rinker, who lists Sullivan as her son in her profile, expressed heartbreak on Facebook and asked for prayers for her son, daughter-in-law and grandkids, adding that the American embassy in South Africa was working on finding him.

Police spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge confirmed in a statement that the stolen truck, a silver Toyota Fortuner, was found abandoned in Motherwell a short while after the incident.




Additionally, the police Anti-Gang Unit has now taken over the investigation that was opened by the South African Police Service in Motherwell.

Beetge would not be drawn to give any particulars about the victim but said protocol dictated that once a ransom was demanded, the case would be handed over to the Hawks — a specialized police unit that investigates organized crime, economic crime, corruption, and other serious crimes.

“As I understand, there has been no ransom raised,” said Beetge, urging anyone with information to come forward.

As they await Sullivan's safe return, supporters flocked to the pastor's personal blog site and other social media platforms to offer their well-wishes.

“We are now praying that you delivered from these evil men,” a poster named Richard Stockton said on the church website. “Praying the Holy Spirit well work on their hearts and be saved. And release you!!!”

Another supporter called Kody Moore said Josh was a “faithful brother doing much to make Christ known in Africa.”

“Please pray for Josh to be brought home safely and especially his family during this absolutely terrible time. May Christ be magnified,” he tweeted on X.

Fox News' Nate Foy reports live from Jersey City on the helicopter crash that killed six individuals, including the pilot and a family from Spain. Warning: This video contains disturbing footage.

New details have emerged regarding the final moments of the helicopter that plunged into the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Thursday afternoon. 

The pilot of the doomed aircraft reportedly radioed about needing to refuel minutes before the helicopter crashed into the chilly waters, according to New York Helicopter Tour CEO Michael Roth, whose company operated the helicopter.

"[The pilot] called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn't arrive," Roth told The Telegraph. 

All six people on board – including five members of the same family – did not survive.

"The only thing I know by watching a video of the helicopter falling down, that the main rotor blades weren't on the helicopter," Roth told the New York Post. "I haven't seen anything like that in my 30 years being in business, in the helicopter business. The only thing I could guess – I got no clue – is that it either had a bird strike or the main rotor blades failed. I have no clue. I don't know."

The five passengers have been identified as Siemens executive Agustin Escobar, Mercé Camprubi Montal, an energy technology company global manager, and the couple's three young children, according to The Associated Press.

The pilot's identity had not been released as of Friday morning. 

Photos posted on the helicopter operator's website showed the family smiling inside the aircraft moments before it took off.

The flight departed a Downtown Manhattan heliport at approximately 3 p.m. and was in the air for about 18 minutes. Bystander footage of the crash shows the aircraft's rotor detaching from the cabin as it rapidly falls through the air before hitting the water near Jersey City. 

Authorities began receiving 911 calls regarding a helicopter crash in the Hudson River around 3:17 p.m., New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during a news conference on Thursday. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the helicopter spinning uncontrollably before landing in the water. 

New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed the family was visiting from Spain, adding it is "heartbreaking" that a family traveling to the city became victims of such a tragic accident.

"We had over 65 million people that visited our city last year, and just think about it, you're on a vacation, you're with your family, you want to experience New York from the sky, and something like this happens. It's heartbreaking to everyone," Adams said, in part.

Emergency personnel arrived at the scene within minutes, including divers from the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) and New York City Police Department (NYPD). NYPD drivers pulled four people from the wreckage, while the FDNY recovered two additional people, according to Tisch. 

First responders attempted lifesaving efforts on an adjoining pier, but four people were pronounced dead at the scene and the others were pronounced dead at local hospitals. 

The water temperature in the Hudson River at the time of the crash was in the mid-40s, according to FOX Weather.

"The Coast Guard and Army Corps, along with local partners, continue to support the NTSB in their ongoing investigation and debris recovery efforts," the U.S. Coast Guard said in a statement. 

The helicopter was salvaged hours later, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. 

The incident occurred less than a mile from Manhattan and near the Holland Tunnel, where 15.8 million vehicles travel between New York City and New Jersey per year. Immediately following the crash, the Coast Guard implemented a safety zone around the Holland Tunnel and Hudson River, which remained in effect until 10 p.m. Thursday.

Roth and New York Helicopter Tours did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

The incident was the first helicopter crash the city has seen since 2019, after an aircraft struck the roof of a skyscraper, killing the pilot. 

"Our hearts go out to the families of those who were onboard," Adams said. "It's almost reminiscent of the plane going down here on the Hudson River. Thank God we didn't lose any lives back then. It's still fresh and still new, the investigation is ongoing, and … the family members, we lift them up in prayer."

Russian American ballerina Ksenia Karelina said in a video she was "so grateful" to President Donald Trump after landing on American soil following a prisoner swap with Russia. 

Trump shared the video on Friday morning on his Truth Social account, writing, "Glad to have you back home." 

"Mr. Trump, I'm so, so grateful for you to bring me home and for [the] American government. And I never felt more blessed to be American and I'm so, so happy to get home. Thank you," Karelina said to a camera after landing late Thursday night at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. 

Karelina shared a long embrace with her fiancé, boxer Chris Van Deerden, after stepping off the plane. She has been offered Post Isolation Support Activities, which is a reacclimation program for wrongful detainees, a U.S. official said.

Moscow released Karelina on Thursday in exchange for German Russian citizen Arthur Petrov, who was arrested in 2023 in Cyprus at the request of the U.S. on charges of exporting sensitive microelectronics, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

"American Ksenia Karelina is on a plane back home to the United States. She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release. POTUS will continue to work for the release of ALL Americans," Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on X.

Karelina was sentenced to 12 years in a Russian penal colony after pleading guilty to treason for donating $51.80 to a Ukrainian charity in early 2024. She was initially detained for "petty hooliganism" while visiting family in Russia that year. 

Russian authorities claimed that Karelina, who lived in Los Angeles, raised money for the Ukrainian army and took part in "public actions" that supported Ukraine while in the U.S.  

Karelina was left out of a massive August 2024 prisoner swap that resulted in the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, Paul Whelan and Alsu Kurmasheva from Russia.

She is the latest American prisoner detained in another country to be freed under Trump's administration. In February, Trump brought American history teacher Marc Fogel, who had been detained in Russia since 2021, back to the U.S.

            A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan's misty skyline into a tragedy.
    


            The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents – who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24.
    


            Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river.
    


            “The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,” Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS.
    


            A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. “The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,” former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday.
    


            Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN's Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn't feel safe in his own building.
    


            “Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,” Rakesh said.
    


            Here's what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board:
    


            The victims include Agustín Escobar, 49, his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, and their three children. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprubí's 40th birthday.
    


            “We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,” a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident “an unimaginable tragedy.”
    


            Camprubí was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020.
    


            “We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,” said a statement from Siemens Energy. “Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.”
    


            In addition to her international corporate career, Camprubí is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprubí's grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world.
    


            The pilot was also killed, though officials have not yet released their identity.
    


            CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims.
    


            The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims.
    


            The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan's downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

            Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon.
    


            At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said.
    


            Jersey City resident, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, described the sound as “such a loud sound. It felt like thunder,” she told WCBS. “Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it's just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that's when it was like, ‘OK, what's happening.'”
    


            With the helicopter's catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN's Kate Bolduan.
    


            “There's nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,” Brandt Anderson said.
    


            First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X.
    


            The aircraft's main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, WCBS reported.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat.
    


            “The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,” Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday's crash. “I'm a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon.”
    


            When asked about the helicopter's maintenance, he said, “That's something my director of maintenance handles.” The director of maintenance declined to comment.
    


            Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation.
    


            “(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn't arrive,” Roth told The Telegraph Thursday.
    


            The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.
    


            Maintenance records are not public and during investigations NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident.
    


            The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday's crash.
    


            Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a “go-team” to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have.
    


            The helicopter was flying within New York's Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone.

            The fast-worsening trade war between the United States and China – the planet's premier geopolitical powers, whose economies are intricately entwined – threatens to wreak severe damage on both nations and will send shockwaves worldwide.
    


            Since President Donald Trump launched this potential cataclysm, it's fair to ask whether he's got a strategy and how he sees the endgame.
    


            As usual, Trump is improvising. His stunning escalation in tariffs on China this week didn't follow any meaningful formula. He's acting, as he always does, like a real estate shark, raising the stakes to intolerable levels to seek leverage. It's the latest manifestation of the “madman theory,” by which Trump conjures the most extreme of circumstances to try to spook his opponents.
    


            Perhaps it will work and China, not eager to wreck an economy that no longer pumps out eye-popping growth numbers, will rush to the table. Many China experts believe that Beijing doesn't want to go to the brink any more than Trump does. The potential consequences of a full-on trade war for both sides might leave them with no option but to step back.
    


            But after Trump's latest raising of the stakes on Thursday when he confirmed tariffs on Chinese goods would now hit 145%, Chinese President Xi Jinping hit back, pushing duties on US goods entering China to 125%. Xi said that China was “not afraid.”
    


            There were also new signs that Trump's team doesn't appreciate the factors in Beijing driving China's calculations. CNN's Kylie Atwood reported that the administration had privately warned the Chinese not to respond to the US tariffs and that Xi should request a call with Trump, a source familiar with the discussions said. Such a move would have implied that the Chinese president was a supplicant to the US president who started the standoff, an intolerable possibility for Beijing.
    


            The risks are massive.
    


            “We're now in a huge (trade) war with China, and the tariffs that have been imposed on China are what I would call prohibitive,” former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Zain Asher and Bianna Golodryga on CNN International Thursday. “They're going to result in massive impacts on the United States and the global economy. No one knows where these policies are headed.”
    


            Trump's tactics assume that the threat of massive consequences will force China into negotiations – as happened in his first term when the two sides reached a trade agreement that was never fully implemented even before the Covid-19 pandemic effectively shut down US relations with Beijing.

Trump is waiting for Xi to call. The Chinese see it differently



            But coercing China could backfire, given its vast economic weight and its sensitivity to slights from Western powers it views as trying to thwart its rise. China's population is unlikely to respond well to threats after years of nationalistic policymaking and propaganda aimed at superseding the United States.
    


            Trump insisted Thursday that his personal chemistry with Xi would be decisive. “He's been, in a true sense, he's been a friend of mine for a long period of time,” he said at a Cabinet meeting.
    


            Trump often reminisces fondly about a visit by Xi to his Mar-a-Lago resort during his first term, when the two munched on “the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen” and he informed his stunned guest about military strikes he'd just ordered in Syria.
    


            Cake diplomacy is unlikely in Trump's second term.
    


Chumminess isn't really Xi's style. China prefers negotiations to be conducted in grueling lower-level formal diplomacy. Leader meetings are highly scripted – far from the scenario of big guys getting together in a room and thrashing it out that Trump prefers.
    


            “President Xi Jinping … is not a negotiator. His role is not to be engaged in a trade negotiation; instead it's the working level, the bureaucrats, the functionaries negotiate the deal,” said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. “From that perspective, I do see some short-term logistical challenges, even though the intent to de-escalate may still be there in China.”
    


            There's also no chance China will expose its leader to a freewheeling Oval Office session when anything can happen. Just ask Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky after his dressing-down earlier this year. Or Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was surprised this week when Trump said he might not lift tariffs in a return for the Jewish state eliminating its trade deficit with the US.
    


            But as the global trade war quickly evolved over the past several days, the administration hatched a new idea: use trade agreements with allies to isolate and pressure China. This seems a long shot, however, since the president has alienated nations that he'd need for this, including Canada and those in the European Union. America's friends have decided the US is an unreliable partner and they'll have to go their own way.
    


            CNN's Alayna Treene asked Trump to identify his “endgame with China” on Thursday.  The president shook his head when asked if he was waiting for Xi to blink and couldn't say how he'd resolve the showdown. “Look, for years we've been ripped off and taken advantage of by China and others, in all fairness, but … that's the big one,” Trump said.
    


            This is an astonishingly blasé attitude given the ramifications of a conflict between the world's largest economies that could have incalculable consequences.
    


            One reason a trade war between the US and China could be so disruptive is that the two economies have become so intertwined.
    


            Years of integration have helped both countries. American consumers have enjoyed cheap access to clothes, shoes, electronics such as iPhones, and other consumer goods, which has raised the middle-class quality of life. China has used US trade to expand manufacturing and to lift tens of millions of its people out of poverty. The profits have been pumped into high-tech industries and China's growing military.
    


            In the United States, the downside of this arrangement has been that cheap goods from China have hammered US industries, from steelmaking in the Rust Belt to furniture manufacturing in North Carolina. And the longtime rationale behind the US' China policy – that economic development would inevitably loosen the grip of Beijing's communist leaders – did not pan out. China hawks in Washington now argue that the US effectively built its 21st century superpower enemy with its own addiction to cheap consumer goods.
    


            Foreign policy analysts used to argue that the enmeshed nature of the China-US relationship would provide a firewall against military conflict. But now the talk is about decoupling, the process of de-integrating the American and Chinese economies – the two powers on either side of the world's most dangerous geopolitical rivalry.
    


            If trade dies out between the US and China, the consequences will be painful. The price of goods that form a vital part of American life could shoot up. This could fuel inflation, worsening the quality of life for millions and hurting consumer confidence, which in turn could tip the US into a recession.
    


            In China, a prolonged trade war could particularly hurt small businesses, which are the engine of its economy. Unemployment could rise, which is always a concern for a nation obsessed with keeping a lid on unrest. Western observers often forget that while China's authoritarian system suppresses dissent, it does have its own form of internal politics that its leaders cannot ignore.
    


            This means that a trade war between the US and China could become a grueling test of which populace can take the most economic pain.
    


            The magnitude of the potential conflict has US officials casting around for a strategy.
    


            There is one approach that would leverage American strength and global power and that might have a chance of building pressure on Beijing to act on consistent US complaints about market access, theft of intellectual property, industrial espionage and other issues.
    


            There's only one problem: It would conflict with Trump's “America first” mantra.
    


            In an interview with Fox Business on Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pointed out that US allies such as Japan, South Korea and India would soon be in trade talks with Washington, as would Vietnam. “Everyone is coming to the table, and basically China is surrounded,” he said. Bessent added that a topic of talks should be a joint goal: “How do we get China to rebalance? That is the big win here.”
    


            Kevin Hassett, the head of Trump's National Economic Council, said Thursday that Trump's Cabinet meeting would discuss whether the US should make trade deals with allies to create a united anti-China front. America's power has long been multiplied by its alliance system – a key advantage that China does not enjoy. A common approach between the trading nations of North America and Europe would be hard for Beijing to ignore.
    


            Yet everything that Trump has done since he arrived back in the Oval Office has been designed to destroy this group of like-minded democracies.
    


            Several times this week he dissed the European Union. “The EU has been very tough over the years … I always say it was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade.” In fact, US policy for years – despite many trade disputes – has been to support a strong EU as a American-allied bloc of prosperity, unity and democracy in a continent that was the epicenter of the bloodiest wars in human history.
    


            Fierce anti-Europe sentiment elsewhere in the administration might also be a problem. Vice President JD Vance revealed his distaste for the continent at the Munich Security forum and also in a group chat of officials about air strikes in Yemen.
    


            Trump's provocations in the Western hemisphere could also frustrate any joint anti-China front.

Old US-Canada relationship is ‘over,' warns Canadian prime minister



            A unified North American trading powerhouse has long been seen as a potential bulwark against China. But Trump has repeatedly threatened to annex Canada and has targeted Mexico with some of his toughest tariffs.
    


            For months, Canadian politicians like Ontario Premier Doug Ford have been pleading with Trump to link up with Canada to combat China. “We always believe in the Am-Can fortress, working together to make the two strongest nations in the world. That's what we want to do,” Ford told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Thursday.
    


            But after weeks of attacks on Canada's sovereignty, Trump has made it almost impossible for its leaders to cooperate with the US – especially during the current general election campaign north of the border. New Prime Minister Mark Carney has warned that his country's traditional relationship with Washington is over.
    


            The idea of building an anti-China cooperative of US-allied powers isn't new. In fact, Trump has already shut it down once.
    


            On his first day in office in his first term in 2017, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a group of 12 nations including allies like Mexico, Canada, Japan, and Australia, as well as Japan. The president also ended talks with Europe on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership that would have linked the world's two largest markets.
    


            It may already be too late to change course.
    


            “The US right now is an incredibly unreliable partner to anyone in the world, and I don't know how we are going to get back to being reliable,” Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration, told Isa Soares on CNN International on Thursday.

South Korea's Constitutional Court, by unanimous decision, removed conservative-leaning Yoon Suk Yeol from office on April 4, citing his December 3 declaration of martial law. 

The election to replace Yoon has been set for June 3. An anti-American, hardcore leftist, Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party of Korea, is now the leading candidate to become the 14th president of the Republic of Korea. 

If Lee gets his way, he will almost certainly try to end South Korea's alliance with the United States and there will be nothing stopping him from opening his country to more Chinese and North Korean infiltration. He apparently believes in the reunification of Korea, so as president he will probably do all he can to merge his Republic of Korea into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the formal name of North Korea.  

TRUMP SAYS HE HAD 'GREAT CALL' WITH SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, SUGGESTS DEAL POSSIBLE

The South Korean people as a whole do not share Lee's agenda, but there are two problems. Lee is absolutely ruthless — he threatened "horrific mass bloodshed and chaos" this month if the Constitutional Court freed Yoon — and his party is almost certain to rig the next election.

The next election, therefore, could be the last in Korea. 

All the national elections this decade in South Korea have been marred by fraud. Minjoo, as the Democratic Party of Korea is commonly known, almost certainly changed ballots in at least the last three national elections, starting in 2020.  

Its "uniformly narrow" wins in district after district in the National Assembly contests in 2020 were "statistically improbable" as were the results in the National Assembly election last year. The results in both 2020 and 2024 were substantially different than late polling suggested, an indication of ballot fraud. 

Also, improbable was Lee Jae-myung's impressive showing in the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to Yoon by a much closer margin than the last polls indicated.  

What is the possibility of ballot rigging now? "There's a very high likelihood of fraud in the upcoming South Korean presidential election, say, 99%, maybe 100%," Grant Newsham, a South Korea analyst, told me after Yoon was removed. "Every stage of the electoral process is susceptible to manipulation and outright fraud. The National Election Commission, the NEC, is a tainted organization and shows no signs of wanting to address vulnerabilities, much less actual evidence of fraud." 

"The NEC after the Constitutional Court's ruling is even more powerful," Tara O of the East Asia Research Center pointed out in comments to me recently. "They hate it when anyone mentions election fraud." 

South Koreans mention fraud, with good reason. In October 2023, the South Korean National Intelligence Service tried to penetrate the country's election infrastructure and found that the NEC's system was easily compromised. The NIS found it could manipulate votes, vote counts, and electoral rolls, among other things.  

North Korea's hackers, including the notorious Lazarus Group, also have penetrated the NEC's system.

Worse, as Newsham points out, "There's been no apparent effort to strengthen the NEC network." There has been an almost complete failure by government officials and prosecutors to examine and fix what independent observers, such as Newsham, have observed. 

The failure to fix South Korea's faulty election infrastructure will have consequences. "This upcoming election is Minjoo's best chance ever to get control of the main levers of power and move the Republic of Korea toward a one-party state, its long-term objective," says Newsham, also author of "When China Attacks: A Warning to America." "Will they cheat your way to power with this last piece of the puzzle, the presidency? Of course, they'll try."

Why should Americans care? The last leftist president, Minjoo's Moon Jae-in, tried to force Samsung and other South Korean giants to disclose technology, thereby giving China invaluable assistance. Samsung, along with Taiwan's TSMC, makes the world's most sophisticated computer chips. Its tech in the hands of Beijing, especially if Taiwan were to fall to China, would give China control of chipmaking worldwide. 

Geopolitical considerations are even more important, and China and North Korea know what's at stake. Beijing and Pyongyang have actively engaged in covert efforts to overthrow South Korea's democracy. As David Maxwell of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Asia Pacific Strategy reports, "China's United Front Work Department has been conducting extensive covert operations in South Korea as part of Beijing's broader ‘unrestrictive warfare' strategy."  

What is the possibility of ballot rigging now? "There's a very high likelihood of fraud in the upcoming South Korean presidential election, say, 99%, maybe 100%," Grant Newsham, a South Korea analyst, told me after Yoon was removed.

Maxwell also notes that pro-North Korean elements within South Korea, including political figures, civic organizations and clandestine groups, are receiving "covert assistance" from North Korea's United Front Department and Reconnaissance General Bureau.

A destabilized South Korea would pose significant challenges to American security interests. As Maxwell, who served five tours of duty in the South with the U.S. Army, points out, "For North Korea and China, undermining the South Korean government is a means to fracture the Republic of Korea-United States alliance, dismantle the U.S. nuclear umbrella, and ultimately drive Americans forces out of the Korean peninsula and mainland Asia." 

Newsham worries about something that now seems inconceivable but is in fact entirely possible. "South Korea," he says, "could become the next Venezuela."

            A family's afternoon sightseeing excursion above the misty shoreline of Manhattan ended in tragedy Thursday after the helicopter carrying them crashed off the New Jersey shoreline, killing them and the pilot.
    


            Spectators watched the helicopter as it dropped from the sky and slammed into the river upside down as fluttering debris landed in the water.
    


            The victims included Agustín Escobar, a Siemens executive, and his family, according to a law enforcement official. The family was visiting from Spain, New York Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Thursday. CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims.
    


            While not much is known about why the helicopter crashed, its staggering descent from the sky shocked witnesses as first responders did what they could to rescue the victims. 



            At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a helicopter crash in the Hudson River near the New Jersey coastline at Pier A Park in Hoboken, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. When first responders arrived, police pulled four people out of the water and FDNY pulled out two people, she said.
    


            Four victims were declared dead on scene and an additional two people were taken to local hospitals, Tisch said. Two children were taken to the Jersey City Medical Center before being pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X.
    


            “Our hearts go out to the family of those who were on board,” Adams said.
    


            President Donald Trump also sent his condolences via a Truth Social post, saying “God bless the families and friends of the victims” and that Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy was looking into the incident.
    


            The helicopter, operated by the tour company New York Helicopter Charter, is currently submerged in the river. 



            “The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,” Michael Roth, the CEO of New York Helicopter Charter Inc., told CNN Thursday evening.
    


            “I'm a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon,” he added. When asked about the maintenance of the helicopter, Roth said, “It's my director of maintenance who deals with that.”
    


            The company's director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not public and the NTSB limits what companies can say publicly during an investigation. 



            Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, called the incident “an unimaginable tragedy” in a post on X.
    


            “I share in the grief of the victims' loved ones at this heartbreaking time,” he said.
    


            FlightRadar24 reported the aircraft to be a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, based on ADS-B tracking data. It was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was good until 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. There was no information immediately available on the pilot, according to Adams.
    


            The helicopter took off from the downtown Manhattan heliport at 2:59 p.m., where it flew south before turning to fly north along the Manhattan shoreline, up the Hudson River, Tisch said. At 3:08 p.m., the helicopter reached the George Washington Bridge and then turned to fly south along the New Jersey shoreline, where shortly after it lost control, she said.
    


            When the helicopter hit the water, officials believe it was inverted, leaving the cabin visible in the water, Tisch said. Reports that the helicopter stopped in mid-air and pieces of the helicopter were falling off before it hit the water is consistent with 911 reports, she said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, she said.
    


            The helicopter flew for about 16 minutes before going down into the water, according to analysis by CNN and flight tracking site FlightRadar 24.
    


            The flight path reflects much of what officials said, showing the aircraft took off from lower Manhattan and did a circle near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge at about 1000 feet. At that point it turned back south, ultimately coming to rest in the water near New Jersey.
    


            The path up the Hudson is a popular sightseeing route.
    


            When the helicopter crashed, it was cloudy with winds around 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph according to various weather reports in the area.
    


            Visibility at the surface was good — 10 miles — but it was cloudy as a system is moving into the region, bringing light rain to the region this afternoon and evening.
    


            Helicopters on an air traffic control frequency were asked to look for anyone in the water following the crash. “Please keep your eyes open. You guys see anything in the water, please let us know,” said an emergency response pilot on the frequency.
    


            The FAA is temporarily prohibiting drone pilots from flying near today's helicopter crash unless they have specific authorization.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is investigating the situation alongside the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB is leading the investigation and will provide updates.
    


            The helicopter was in the Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where no air traffic control services are provided, Secretary Duffy said in a post on X Thursday. Several minutes before entering that area, air traffic control from LaGuardia Airport was providing support, he said.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board chair and investigators are on their way to the site of today's deadly helicopter crash in the Hudson River.
    


            “The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate Thursday's crash of a Bell 206 L-4 helicopter near Jersey City, New Jersey,” the Board said in a social media post. “The team is expected to arrive tonight.”
    


            The cause of the crash is under investigation by the NTSB, which will pore over documentation on all the work that had been done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent Federal Aviation Administration issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023 required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts, requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            The helicopter that crashed in the Hudson River was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid until 2029, according to FAA records.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on an approaching boat.

            “The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate Thursday's crash of a Bell 206 L-4 helicopter near Jersey City, New Jersey,” the Board said in a social media post. “The team is expected to arrive tonight.”
    


            The cause of the crash is under investigation by the NTSB, which will pore over documentation on all the work that had been done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent Federal Aviation Administration issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023 required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts, requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            The helicopter that crashed in the Hudson River was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid until 2029, according to FAA records.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on an approaching boat.

PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) — A Japanese pilot slammed his Zero fighter plane into the USS Missouri and ignited a fireball on April 11, 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa. The suicide attack instantly killed the pilot, but none of the battleship's crew members were badly hurt.

The Missouri's captain ordered a military burial at sea with full honors, marking one of the more unusual and little-known episodes of World War II. The pilot received the same funeral that the ship would have given one of its own sailors.

Eighty years later, the Missouri is a museum moored at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, not far from the submerged hull of the USS Arizona, which sank in the 1941 Japanese bombing that propelled the U.S. into the war. On Friday, three of the captain's grandsons will mark the anniversary of the attack and burial with the mayors of Honolulu and the Japanese city of Minamikyushu, from which many kamikaze pilots set off on their suicide missions.

“This is one of the ship's great stories and explains, in part, why the ship became an international symbol of peace and reconciliation within two years of its launching and rather than just an instrument of destruction,” said Michael Carr, CEO of the Battleship Missouri Memorial. “This is a remarkable story of compassion and humanity, even in the midst of one of the worst battles of World War II.”

Here's what to know about the attack on the Missouri and the pilot's burial:




Japan launched a suicide attack campaign as a last-ditch measure to push U.S. forces back late in the war, when it was hopelessly losing. 

The Imperial Navy founded the Kamikaze Tokko Tai, which translates as Divine Wind Special Attack Corps, and the Imperial Army followed with its own unit. Internationally their missions are called kamikaze, but in Japan they are better known as “tokko,” which means “special attack.” 

The pilots flew hastily constructed planes and even reconnaissance and training aircraft because the military lacked sufficient equipment. They took off on one-way flights with just enough fuel to reach their targets.

Kamikaze sank their first ship on Oct. 25, 1944, when a navy Zero pilot smashed into the USS St. Lo in the Philippine Sea while carrying a pair of 550-pound (250-kilogram) bombs. Britain's Imperial War Museum says they killed 7,000 Allied naval personnel in all. 

Their initial 30% success rate fell to about 8% by mid-1945 due to declining crew skills, dwindling aircraft capabilities and improved U.S. defenses. 

Some 4,000 pilots died on suicide missions, about 2,500 navy and more than 1,400 army, most of them university students drafted in late 1943. Many launched from Chiran, a tea farming town that today is part of Minamikyushu, a city in southwest Japan.

The missions became more intense as Japan's outlook grew more dire and the military showcased the sacrifice of the pilots to drum up patriotism and support for the war. Those who failed to take off or survived were considered a disgrace. 

Despite stereotypes of kamikaze as super-patriots who volunteered to die, many were not, as shown by their carefully nuanced last letters to loved ones and survivor accounts. 

“They were victims of war,” said Hiroyuki Nuriki, mayor of Minamikyushu, who noted the pilots were only around 20 years old and had futures. 

“I'm sure they didn't want to die, but they still had to go,” he said. “That's the tragedy of war, and that's why we should never start a war again.”

The Battle of Okinawa lasted 82 todays, with fierce fighting on land and sea. On April 11 the Missouri fended off aerial assaults from multiple directions and already had downed one kamikaze plane when a second approached.

The Missouri's gunners hit the Zero fighter with a 5-inch (12.7-centimeter) round. The plane plunged, but it leveled out about 20 feet (6 meters) above the ocean and headed for the ship's starboard side. 

The crash ripped off the plane's right wing, which landed on the deck. Fuel in the wing caught fire, unleashing a giant plume of smoke. The crew controlled the fire within five minutes. 

The dent left by the attack is still visible on the Missouri's hull.

Capt. William Callaghan ordered the funeral to be held the next morning. 

The crew collected red and white cloth and sewed a makeshift “rising sun” flag so he could be buried under his own colors, said Frank Clay, curator of the Battleship Missouri Memorial. They cleaned the body, wrapped it in canvas and placed it on a tray against the rail beneath the flag. 

Marine rifle guards gave a gun salute and a bugler played taps. The chaplain gave an invocation and said, “Commit his body to the deep.” The crew tipped the tray and the body slid into the sea. 

It was the only known instance of U.S. forces holding a military funeral for a kamikaze pilot.

Some crew members resented the ritual, while others grumbled but later came to believe it was the right thing to do, Clay said. 

Ed Buffman, who was a teenage gunner's mate 2nd class on the Missouri, said he did not dwell on it: “The next day you're ready to go back and battle again.” 

Little is known of Callaghan's reasons for ordering the ceremony, which appeared on the ship's daily schedule for meal times and other routine activity. 

Carey Callaghan said his grandfather never spoke of the burial and his family didn't learn about it until 2001. He said his grandfather had empathy and a sense of dignity, which was reflected by the funeral. 

A remarkable thing, Callaghan said, was that three years earlier, his grandfather lost his brother, Rear Adm. Daniel Callaghan, to Japanese gunfire off Guadalcanal.

Scholars believe he was Setsuo Ishino, a petty officer 2nd class in a flight training program. 

The pilot took off from Kanoya air base in southern Japan with 15 others as part of the No. 5 Kenmu Squadron. Most failed to hit their targets and crashed into the ocean. 

“Dear Mother, The time has come for me to blossom at last. I am fulfilling my final duty with a smile. Please don't say anything, this is for our country,” Ishino wrote. “The next time we see each other, we will be under the beautiful cherry blossom trees at Yasukuni Shrine. Please don't cry, only smile and tell me ‘well done.'”

Then-President Barack Obama referenced the burial in 2016 when he visited Pearl Harbor with then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He told those gathered that Callaghan showed “we must resist the urge to demonize those who are different” and do so “even when hatred burns hottest.”

Thanks to Callahan's act, the Missouri museum and the Chiran Peace Museum, which displays army tokko artifacts, today are partners and help each other with exhibits. 

Nuriki, the Minamikyushu mayor, said it is important to remember the events of April 11, 1945, and the tragedy of kamikaze pilots as Asia-Pacific tensions rise. 

“We share the history between the former enemies that have become friends,” he said. “We should keep telling the story and think about peace.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Russian-American woman freed by Moscow arrived back in the United States late Thursday as part of a prisoner swap completed as the two countries aim to repair ties.

A plane carrying Ksenia Karelina landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews, where she was greeted by her fiancé. Morgan Ortagus, President Donald Trump's deputy special envoy to the Middle East, presented her with a bouquet. She was released earlier in the day in exchange for a Russian-German man who'd been jailed in the U.S. on smuggling charges.

Karelina was arrested in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg in February 2024 and convicted of treason on charges stemming from a donation of about $52 to a charity aiding Ukraine. U.S. authorities have called the case “absolutely ludicrous.”



“They released the young ballerina and she is now out, and that was good. So we appreciate that,” President Donald Trump said at a Cabinet meeting Thursday. He said the release followed conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Arthur Petrov was released as part of the swap in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, according to the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Russia's main security and counterintelligence agency. Petrov was arrested in Cyprus in August 2023 at the request of the U.S. on charges of smuggling sensitive microelectronics to Russia and extradited to the U.S. a year later.

Karelina was among a growing number of Americans arrested in Russia in recent years as tensions between Moscow and Washington spiked over the war in Ukraine. Her release is the latest in a series of high-profile prisoner exchanges Russia and the U.S. carried out in the last three years — and the second since Trump took office and reversed Washington's policy of isolating Russia in an effort to end the war in Ukraine.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe hailed “the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort.” The CIA also emphasized that “the exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.”

Meanwhile, Russian and U.S. diplomats met in Istanbul for a second round of talks on normalizing embassies' work, following the first such meeting in February. The State Department said the delegations “exchanged notes to finalize an understanding to ensure the stability of diplomatic banking for Russian and U.S. bilateral missions.”

It said the U.S. reiterated its concerns about the Russian ban on hiring of local staff, “the key impediment to maintaining for stable and sustainable staffing levels at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.”

Alexander Darchiyev, Russia's ambassador to Washington, who led Moscow's delegation in the talks, praised their “positive atmosphere” and noted the parties agreed to continue discussions to facilitate diplomats' travel. He added that the Russian side also pushed for a quick return of its diplomatic property seized by U.S. authorities.

In February, Russia released American teacher Marc Fogel, imprisoned on drug charges, in a swap that the White House described as part of a diplomatic thaw that could advance peace negotiations. That same month, Russia released another American just days after arresting him on drug smuggling charges.

Karelina, a former ballet dancer also identified in some media as Ksenia Khavana, lived in Maryland before moving to Los Angeles. She was arrested when she returned to Russia to visit her family last year.

The FSB accused her of “proactively” collecting money for a Ukrainian organization that was supplying gear to Kyiv's forces. The First Department, a Russian rights group, said the charges stemmed from a $51.80 donation to a U.S. charity aiding Ukraine.

“I am overjoyed to hear that the love of my life, Ksenia Karelina is on her way home from wrongful detention in Russia,” Karelina's fiancé, professional boxer Chris van Heerden, said in a statement. “She has endured a nightmare for 15 months and I cannot wait to hold her. Our dog, Boots, is also eagerly awaiting her return.”

He thanked Trump and his envoys, as well as prominent public figures who had championed her case, including Dana White, a Trump friend and CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Trump also credited White, too, saying the UFC boss had called him about the case.

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on X, “President Trump and his administration continue to work around the clock to ensure Americans detained abroad are returned home to their families.”

The exchange was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The United Arab Emirates' state-run WAM news agency released photos of Karelina boarding a plane and one of her standing next to Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE's ambassador to the U.S.

The FSB, which said Putin had pardoned Karelina before the swap, released a video showing her being escorted to a plane somewhere in Russia. The footage then featured what appeared to be the scene of exchange at the Abu Dhabi airport, with Petrov walking off a plane and shaking hands with Russian officials on the tarmac.

The video showed Petrov undergoing medical checkups on a flight to Russia. “I have no particular complaints, just a bit tired,” he said.

Another video released by the FSB later in the day showed him walking off a plane after arriving in Russia. 

Petrov was accused by the U.S. Justice Department of involvement in a scheme to procure microelectronics subject to U.S. export controls on behalf of a Russia-based supplier of critical components for the country's weapons industries. He was facing a 20-year prison term in the U.S.

Abu Dhabi was the scene of another high-profile prisoner swap between Russia and the United States. In December 2022, American basketball star Brittney Griner was traded for the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. 

The UAE has been a mediator in prisoner swaps between Russia and Ukraine, while the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai has become home to many Russians and Ukrainians who fled there after the start of Moscow's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

            When discussions began over releasing Israeli hostages shortly after the October 7 attack by Hamas, the negotiators tasked to strike a deal were mostly intelligence and security professionals. But in February, Israel made an important change that those now involved say has had a profound slowing effect on the discussions to resurrect the broken ceasefire: The file was taken over by the prime minister's closest political aide, Ron Dermer.
    


            With Dermer, says a source involved in the negotiations, there's a “significant difference in momentum,” from when Israel's team was led by intelligence chiefs David Barnea and Ronen Bar.
    


            “There is a clear shift in [Israeli] priorities,” the source said. “Negotiations are seemingly being politicized from the Israeli team.”
    


            Now, Barnea, who directs the Mossad, has been sidelined and Bar, who ran the internal security service Shin Bet, has been fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, causing an uproar in Israel.
    


            The decision to push aside career national security professionals in favor of Netanyahu's closest adviser was intended to give Netanyahu more control over the negotiation process, an Israeli source familiar with the negotiations said.
    


            “The political considerations of the Israeli team led by Dermer is not having a positive impact,” says an American who advocates for the families of Israeli hostages. “The families understand that Dermer is a big problem to getting their loved ones.”
    


            An Israeli official pushed back on claims that Dermer's position at the helm of negotiations has hampered progress or politicized the negotiations, saying, “Negotiations need to be judged by results, not process.”
    


            “To reach a deal, you need someone who actually represents the will of the government that will authorize said deal, not ‘dissent,' which only served to undermine negotiations,” the official said.
    


            The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that started as President Donald Trump took office collapsed last month when Israel re-launched its military operations and US and Israeli officials accused Hamas of rejecting a deal to extend it, which Hamas denied.
    


            There had long been indications Israel planned to resume its war against Hamas after the first phase of the ceasefire deal, when 38 Israeli and Thai hostages were released over six weeks.
    


            Netanyahu regularly cites freeing the hostages as a top priority. But so is the destruction of Hamas, and critics have accused him of prioritizing the latter at the expense of the former, namely because that is also where the prime minister's political interests lie.
    


            Destroying Hamas has long been the priority of key right-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition, who have invariably threatened and followed through on threats to quit the government.
    


            With Dermer in charge of the negotiations, Netanyahu can more deftly manage the delicate political balancing act that has influenced Israeli decision-making at every critical turn of the ceasefire negotiations.
    


            During the many months of ceasefire negotiations last year that ultimately led to a ceasefire deal in January, Israeli security officials balked at Netanyahu's shifting positions and stall tactics that they believed were influenced by political considerations and delayed the brokering of a deal. But with Dermer now in charge and intelligence leaders marginalized, those dissenting views have featured less prominently in Israeli security discussions and in Israeli press reports.
    


            While in the US to meet Trump earlier this week, Netanyahu rejected accusations that freeing the hostages isn't a top priority.
    


            “The president looked at me and told the journalists who were present: ‘This man is working constantly to free the hostages.' I hope that this shatters the lie that is being circulated to the effect that I am not working for them, that I don't care. I do care, and I am doing it and we will be successful,” Netanyahu said.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel recently made a direct appeal to Dermer, whose title is the Minister of Strategic Affairs, accusing him of leaving them “in complete darkness.”
    


            “When you were appointed as head of the negotiating team, we were promised that this would help reach a breakthrough on a new agreement,” the letter said. “In reality, more than a month has passed and there is no progress in sight.”
    


            Barnea and Bar had regularly shuttled to Egypt and Qatar, as well as other countries, for ceasefire talks that included the heads of the CIA, Egyptian intelligence and the prime minister of Qatar.
    


            Now Dermer speaks less with mediators from Egypt and Qatar, which maintain direct relationships with Hamas, according to the source involved in the negotiations.
    


            The US point person has also shifted from the former CIA director to the Trump administration's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who has accused Hamas of intransigence that caused the recent ceasefire to break down.
    


            “If you're the Trump team, you blame Hamas but behind the scenes I believe they are trying to push both sides,” the American who works with the hostage families said.
    


            A spokesperson for Witkoff said in a statement, “Ambassador Witkoff and the Trump administration are in lockstep with Israel in their pursuit of freeing the hostages, including American Edan Alexander, and achieving peace – which means Hamas out of power in Gaza. To achieve this, difficult negotiations are necessary.”
    


            Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler have tried to figure out formulas to get Hamas to release the remaining Americans – one living and four dead – and get the truce extended enough to try to negotiate the next phase.
    


            “The US is doing everything possible to release alive and deceased US hostages, which necessitates the deal,” said an Egyptian official. While Israel “doesn't see hostages superseding breaking Hamas.”
    


            Most recently, Hamas agreed to an Egypt- and Qatar-backed proposal that mirrored one Witkoff presented last month to release the lone living American hostage, Edan Alexander, along with four others and extend the peace through Ramadan and Passover.
    


            Israel quickly countered, demanding 11 living hostages, almost half of the 24 remaining. That would more dramatically cut into what Hamas views as their greatest leverage over Israel.
    


            “We're still working on the Witkoff plan for an extension,” said a diplomat familiar with the discussions. “I think we have some wiggle room that we can work on.”
    


            Israel had early in the ceasefire delayed launching negotiations for the second phase whose terms stipulated the release of all remaining hostages, a permanent ceasefire and a withdrawal by Israel's military from Gaza.
    


            That could have meant the survival of Hamas – even if not in power - and flown in the face of Netanyahu's goal of “total victory.” It would also have threatened Netanyahu's government.
    


            Those second phase talks never began.
    


            “There's no clarity on the [Israeli] objective,” the first source involved in the talks said, adding: “Americans are getting impatient.”
    


            As Israel's latest operations have taken the death toll in Gaza over 50,000, there has been promising movement to resurrect the truce, those involved say.
    


            Hamas is feeling the pressure, both from Israel's military and widescale protests by Palestinians in Gaza, said a US official familiar with the negotiations.
    


            “Hamas is struggling for oxygen,” said the official who accused Hamas of missing American opportunities last month to keep the ceasefire going. “They're not very quick to move.”
    


            The American working with the hostage families has felt “some air being breathed back into the process.”
    


            “There's a real sense of urgency and push on the part of the Americans and the [Egyptian and Qatari] mediators,” the source involved in the negotiations said.
    


            To try to salvage the ceasefire, hostage envoy Boehler made an unprecedented move: meeting directly with officials from Hamas, which the US considers a terrorist organization.
    


            That meeting angered Israeli officials, and reportedly Dermer in particular. Boehler confirmed he spoke with Dermer after and defended the meeting, telling CNN: “we're not an agent of Israel.”
    


            With much of Hamas' leadership inside Gaza decimated, it's not clear if the military leaders still fighting Israel are on the same page as the political leadership engaging with mediators, including Boehler, the source involved in the negotiations said.
    


            “Stubbornness in Hamas also unhelpful. They need to account for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza,” the source said.
    


            Meanwhile, the discussions continue with the Israeli team led by Dermer, but which still includes security professionals working on the technical details.
    


            “The Israeli team is putting a lot of effort, but the way it's being managed tactically from the top,” the source said, “the current structure of the negotiation team is not as helpful as needed for progress.”

            The 89th playing of the Masters got off to a blazing start at Augusta National Golf Club on Thursday, with Englishman Justin Rose ending the day atop of the leaderboard.
    


            The first major of the year got started with a ceremonial tee shot from Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson. After that, 95 players began the quest for the iconic green jacket.
    


            The 44-year-old Rose put himself in strong position to win his second career major, after posting a career-low 7-under 65 opening round, his fifth time leading the tournament after the first round.

            Rose, who sits three shots ahead of world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, Ludvig Åberg, and Corey Conners, had previous success in Augusta, finishing in second in 2015 and 2017.
    


            Despite never winning the prized tournament, Rose's confidence has never wavered in his ability to one day get there.
    


            “I feel like I've played well enough to win this tournament,” Rose said after the round. “I just feel like I don't have the jacket to prove it. … I've obviously played, I've played a lot of good rounds of golf here. Got a lot of crystal, which is obviously always nice.
    


            “But yeah, you know, ultimately, you want to be last man standing on Sunday, and I was a shot shy – I guess Sergio and I in 2017, that was a real 50/50. That could have gone any which way down the stretch. A little bit of Lady Luck here and there is always the difference here at times.
    


            “But I've had my luck on occasion and been a champion. But you've got to be playing the golf to keep creating those opportunities, and obviously the only way to do that is to get your name on the leaderboard. I definitely don't shy away from it.”
    


            Scheffler, a two-time Masters champion, came into the tournament the betting favorite and he certainly looked the part.
    


            The 28-year-old Scheffler coasted to a bogey-free 68 to sit within striking distance of the lead ahead Friday's second round.
    


            Scheffler, who will be hoping to join an exclusive club by winning a third Masters title and has the chance to be the first player to defend his green jacket since Tiger Woods in 2002, said he felt “pretty good” about his four-under par score.
    


            “I had a feeling the golf course was going to get pretty firm,” Scheffler said. “The areas to hit your irons out here are pretty small and they get even smaller when the greens are firm, so there's definitely some challenge to the golf course today, and I'm sure that'll continue as the week goes on.”
    


            Rose will tee off at 8:52 a.m. ET while Scheffler get going at 1:23 p.m. ET.
    


            World No. 2 Rory McIlroy quickly went from looking like a true contender for his maiden green jacket to possibly missing the cut.
    


            Through the first 14 holes, the 35-year-old blazed out to a 4-under par, bogey-free round.
    


            That was until the last couple holes.
    


            McIlroy, who has won twice this season on the PGA Tour including at The Players Championship, took a pair of double bogeys late and settled for a 72 which saw him fall from second place down to 27th on the leaderboard.
    


            The Northern Irishman declined to speak to reporters following the round.
    


            In his pursuit for a career grand slam, McIlroy will look to rebound on Friday with a 9:58 a.m. ET tee time.
    


            It was a nightmare round for two youngsters - American Nick Dunlap  and highly-rated Spanish amateur Jose Luis Ballester.
    


            The 21-year-old Dunlap, playing in his second career Masters, shot a historic opening round 18-over 90 to find himself in last place on the leaderboard.
    


            Dunlap, a two-time winner of the PGA Tour, became the first player under 38 years old to fail to break 90 at the Masters.
    


            It's the worst score at the Masters since Ben Crenshaw's 91 back in 2015.
    


            Dunlap did not speak to reporters after the round.
    


            Life comes at your fast, especially when you are young.
    


            For the 21-year-old, Arizona State University senior Ballester, it came at the expense of stuff beyond his actual play.

            Last year's US Amateur winner Ballester, who played alongside Scheffler and Justin Thomas on Thursday, admitted to going to the bathroom at Rae's Creek at Augusta National.
    


            Ballester said he forgot there were bathrooms near the 13th hole tee box and relieved himself in the creek much to the delight of spectators.
    


            “Didn't really know where to go, and since (Justin Thomas) had an issue on the green, I'm like, I'm just going to sneak here in the river and probably people would not see me that much, and then they clapped for me,” Ballester said.
    


            “Probably one of the claps that I really got today real loud, so that was kind of funny.”
    


            Ballester added that he had no regrets.
    


            “They saw me. It was not embarrassing at all for me. If I had to do it again, I would do it again,” Ballester said.
    


            Dunlap will tee off at 12:50 p.m. ET while Ballester is at 1:23 p.m. ET.

Panelists Christina Pascucci and Cata Truss discuss the White House defending their aggressive deportation agenda to reporters on ‘Fox News @ Night.'

The Trump administration was handed another win on Thursday after a federal judge ruled that everyone in the U.S. illegally must register with the federal government and carry documentation.

The Associated Press reported that Judge Trevor Neil McFadden, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, sided with the administration after arguing it was enforcing an existing requirement for everyone in the country who is not a citizen of the U.S.

Rather than rule on the substance of the Trump administration's arguments, McFadden ruled that the group pushing to stop the requirement did not have standing to pursue their claims.

McFadden's ruling will go into effect Friday.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Thursday that the deadline to register for anyone who has been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday, adding that the registration requirement will be enforced to the fullest.

"President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now. If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream," DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in the statement. "The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws — we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans."

The DHS began warning illegal immigrants in February that they should leave the country or face serious consequences.

The secretary said DHS will enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was enacted in 1952 and created several tools to track illegal aliens and compel them to voluntarily leave the U.S.

DHS said the tools include criminal penalties for migrants who choose not to leave the U.S., fail to register with the federal government and get fingerprinted, and fail to notify the federal government of changes to their address.

Illegal immigrants who fail to depart the U.S. will be charged with a crime resulting in a "significant penalty," DHS said.

But migrants who fail to register with the federal government could be fined, imprisoned or both.

Registration is mandatory for anyone 14 and older without legal status. Anyone registering will be required to provide their fingerprints and address.

Canadians are also required to go through the registration process if they have been in the U.S. for more than 30 days – this includes "snowbirds," who spend winter months in warmer areas like Florida.

While it has long been required for people who live in the U.S. and are not American citizens, the requirement has only been enforced in rare circumstances.

For instance, the requirement was enforced in a limited way after Sept. 11, 2001, when the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System required noncitizen males 16 and older from 25 countries – all but one of them Arab or Muslim – to register with the U.S. government.

Even though the program did not lead to terrorism convictions, it pulled over 13,000 people into deportation proceedings. The program was suspended in 2011 and dissolved in 2016.

 Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., discusses efforts to deport illegal migrants under the Trump administration on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a lower court's decision to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national living in Maryland, from an El Salvador prison where federal officials sent hundreds of suspected criminals and gang members in March.

Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported to the El Salvadoran megaprison last month for being an alleged MS-13 gang member, but his attorneys maintain he does not have any gang ties.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered federal officials to coordinate his return back to Maryland in a Monday order, calling his deportation "wholly unlawful." On Thursday, the Supreme Court sided with Xinis. 

"On March 15, 2025, the United States removed Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia from the United States to El Salvador, where he is currently detained in the Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT)," the order states. "The United States acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador was therefore illegal."

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she "would have declined to intervene in this litigation and denied the application in full."

"Nevertheless, I agree with the Court's order that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the processes to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador," Sotomayor wrote. "That means the Government must comply with its obligation to provide Abrego Garcia with ‘due process of law,' including notice and an opportunity to be heard, in any future proceedings."

The High Court further said it "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador."

The Justice Department responded to the order in a statement to Fox News in a statement. 

"As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs," the statement says. "By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy."

Federal court filings showed Abrego Garcia had fled El Salvador to escape gang violence. Starting around 2006, gang members "stalked, hit, and threatened to kidnap and kill him in order to coerce his parents to succumb to their increasing demands for extortion."

He entered the United States illegally in 2011 and traveled to Maryland, where his older brother, a U.S. citizen, lived.

Around 2016, Abrego Garcia became romantically involved with a female U.S. citizen — Jennifer Vasquez Sura — and her two children, also U.S. citizens. They moved in together and the woman became pregnant with his child. Abrego Garcia worked in the construction industry to support his family, court filings say.

On March 28, 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, to solicit employment and was recruited by three other men. Prince George County Police Department soon arrived at the scene and detained all four men.

"At the police station, the four young men were placed into different rooms and questioned. Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was asked if he was a gang member; when he told police he was not, they said that they did not believe him and repeatedly demanded that he provide information about other gang members," court documents state. "The police told Plaintiff Abrego Garcia that he would be released if he cooperated, but he repeatedly explained that he did not have any information to give because he did not know anything."

A judge later granted his release, and Abrego Garcia married his now-wife in 2019. He did, however, miss the birth of his child while in federal custody, the federal complaint says. 

Abrego Garcia was arrested in Baltimore on March 12 after he worked a shift as a sheet metal apprentice in Baltimore and picked up his now-5-year-old son, who has autism and other disabilities, from his grandmother's house, the complaint says.

AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Justin Rose did more than just match his best score at the Masters.

With a round that was nearly nine shots better than the field Thursday, the 44-year-old Rose managed to steal the spotlight from the Masters dominance of Scottie Scheffler and the endless quest of Rory McIlroy to complete the career Grand Slam.

Rose felt his 7-under 65 had the potential to be something special. And even with a bogey on the final hole, it was every bit of that.

He opened with three straight birdies. He ran off three in a row around the turn. And he wound up with a three-shot lead over Scheffler, Ludvig Aberg and Corey Conners.

“When I have been playing well, I feel like I have been competing at a high level,” Rose said. “My consistency maybe has not been as high this year. But my good is good again. So I'm excited about that.”

Scheffler did his part in his bid to win a third Masters green jacket in four years, playing a bogey-free round of 68. 

McIlroy, so desperate to win this major and complete the career Grand Slam, was right there with him until the end. He took a pair of double bogeys late in the afternoon with careless mistakes and had to settle for a 72. It was the seventh straight time he failed to break 70 in the opening round of the Masters.

He declined to speak to the media after his round.

Rose set one Masters record: The fifth time he has had at least a share of the 18-hole lead, breaking the mark held by Jack Nicklaus. The glaring difference, of course, is Nicklaus has six of those green jackets.




It also was the eighth time Rose has had at least a share of the lead after any round at Augusta National, something only five others have done. All are Masters champions.

“I feel like I've played well enough to win this tournament,” said Rose, whose best chance was a playoff loss to Sergio Garcia in 2017. “I just feel like I don't have the jacket to prove it. ... But you've got to be playing the golf to keep creating those opportunities, and the only way to do that is to get your name on the leaderboard. I definitely don't shy away from it.”

Rose opened with a 25-foot birdie putt and made his eighth birdie with a 20-foot putt on the par-3 16th. In between was a series of good shots — smart shots — that gave him plenty of chances and he converted most of them.

Augusta National, soaked by rain that washed out most of the Monday practice round, already was getting scary fast.

The average score was 73.6. Only six players broke 70, and 20 others broke par.

“Ridiculous. That's nuts,” Viktor Hovland said about Rose's score. “Those greens are so firm. I remember a few years ago — I can't remember what year it was — but he kind of did something similar. I think this one is probably a little bit more impressive because out of all the Masters I've played, this is probably the firmest it's been on a Thursday. It's definitely no joke out there.”

Scheffler was 3 under at the turn, including one birdie on the par-5 eighth in which his ball was deep in a divot hole short of the green. He managed to get that out some 20 feet left of the pin and used the slope to bring it back to 15 feet and made the putt.

He was rarely under stress.

“I struggled for what felt like two pars today,” Scheffler said “But other than that, the golf course was in front of me most of the day, kept the ball in play, did a lot of really good things out there.”

U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau and Tyrrell Hatton carried the LIV Golf flag, both at 69. DeChambeau had seven birdies in his up-and-down day, a show of his scoring power.

“Making some bogeys for me probably frees me up a little bit and says, you know what? Just go out and play some golf,” DeChambeau said.

The roars came early, along with a few shockers.

Fred Couples, who wondered a month ago if at 65 with a creaky back he would still be welcomed to play, became only the second player that age to break par. Couples holed out from the fairway on the 14th with a 6-iron hybrid on his way to a 71. Tom Watson was also 65 — by 28 days he is still the oldest — when he shot 71 in 2015.

The horror show belonged to Nick Dunlap, a 21-year-old who last year won on the PGA Tour as an amateur. This must have felt like amateur hour when he made double bogey on the final hole for a 90. It was the highest score since Ben Crenshaw shot 91 in 2015 at ag 63.

Hideki Matsuyama might have caught the worst break when his approach into the par-5 13th hit the pin and caromed into the tributary of Rae's Creek. The wildest day belonged to Nicolai Hojgaard — one eagle, five birdies, four pars, five bogeys and three double bogeys. Do the math and that comes out to 76.

“It's mentally draining playing a round like this,” Hojgaard said.

And then there was McIlroy, chipping into the water from behind the 15th green for double bogey, and then going long on the 17th and compounding that mistake with a three-putt for another double bogey.

Far more blissful on a warm spring day was Rose, who at one point had it going so well that he felt like a pitcher throwing a no-hitter.

He pitched to 6 feet for birdie on the par-5 eighth. He hit wedge to the ninth and used the slope to set up a 5-foot birdie, giving him a career-low 31 on the front nine. That was followed by a 12-foot birdie putt.

“That's when the day felt a bit different. That's when I felt I was doing something potentially more on the special side,” Rose said. 

And then he really began to pull away from the field with a smart pitch away from the water to set up a 10-foot birdie on the 15th, followed by the 20-foot birdie on the 16th. The pins on the final two holes allowed for birdies and Rose was thinking super special. He got par-bogey instead that didn't ruin his mood.

“I'm 44. Golf is not going to get easier for me in the next five, 10 years, whatever it's going to be,” Rose said. “So your opportunity is less going forward. So you have to make the most of it.”

An alert from U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Friday notified users of a glitch in the system that is used to exempt freight from tariffs, including shipments from China that were already on the water at the time of this week's whipsaw in tariffs policy, and any trade from nations now under the 90-day pause put in place by the Trump administration.

The alert explained that U.S. Customs discovered that the entry code for U.S. shippers to use to have their freight exempted is not working and "the issue is being reviewed."

In the alert, Customs advised filers "to transmit cargo release separately and follow up with the summary filing when resolved."

Normally, when a U.S. importer pays for their freight, they file both the cargo release forms and their financial papers, so they can pay for their cargo. To keep the cargo moving, Customs is advising importers to file the cargo release form now, and file the financial form later, once the glitch is corrected.

For now, that means the tariffs are not being collected by the U.S. government.

The tariffs being paused on many nation's trade, and the Chinese tariffs still in effect, are based on the sailing date, or the date the freight leaves the factory or warehouse. This is called an "on the water" clause and is in effect for all freight bound to the U.S. that has been on the water before the April 5, 9, and 10 tariff announcements.

The on the water clause has not changed, even though the China tariff percentages have increased to 145% and a series of other recent tariffs have been put in place.

CBP said it will issue an update when this issue is resolved.

For U.S. shippers and the supply chain, it's the latest blow at a time of uncertainty and fear about tariffs policy. It also raises questions about Customs ability to handle the new policy and collect the tariffs revenue that is key to Trump administration economic goals.

Interpretations of the multiple executive orders, social media posts, and customs alerts have some U.S. companies and industry groups trying to figure out when the new tariffs will be deployed.

"There has been some confusion on what President Trump has said in social media posts on when the tariff starts and what is written in the executive order," said Jarred Varanelli, vice president of US sales at logistics firm Savino Del Bene. "Social media posts are not law on the pause and increase in tariffs. With the constant changes to the regulations, all customs brokers in our industry have a difficult task ahead of them."

Despite President Trump saying numerous times tariffs are in effect and being collected, U.S. shippers tell CNBC they have not been charged higher tariff rates on their containers, some of which came in as late as yesterday.

Dewardric McNeal, managing director and senior policy analyst at Longview Global with a focus on international trade, foreign affairs and defense, tells CNBC glitches do happen, but the timing is unfortunate and will lead to more questions about Customs' ability to keep up with the pace of the tariffs.

"Whether you agree or disagree with the policy, you have to ask, do we have the ability to do it this rapidly?" said McNeal. "This glitch may be an indication we need more time. It seems odd this is the time it happens. This adds policy chaos for the implementer."

To keep the freight moving, Customs is telling firms to pay the duties and tariffs within ten days of the cargo's release to Customs, by which time it expects the glitch should be fixed.

"It's a mess, to simply state it," said McNeal. "I don't think it will slow down goods. But it will increase the paperwork for the U.S. companies who are suffering tariff whiplash. These companies will need to refile that at a later date. Trade will flow but at greater complexity."

The U.S. is currently at work on negotiations with over 75 countries on tariffs deals that Trump has said will be tailored to each nation.

The uncertainty at Customs entry points come within the context of much greater business anxiety.

Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a three-generation educational toy company which makes its products in China, said this year it was scheduled to expand with the construction of a new building, but now he is pausing expansion and reviewing his company's financials to see where cuts can be made.

"I cannot run my business based on social media posts," said Woldenberg. "This is making it difficult for me to make my business decisions. Instead of planning on growth, I'm talking about surviving. This trade policy can kill me and hundreds of small businesses like me. This will eliminate jobs. The banking industry and insurance industry that serve businesses both large and small will be impacted if companies go bankrupt."

Woldenberg expects massive disruption. "The interconnectedness of all of this is not well understood. This policy was crafted with little interest in the details. It's these details that will drive business and the economy down the toilet."

President Donald Trump on Friday said five more law firms have struck agreements with his administration that involve them committing to at least $600 million total in pro bono work for causes the president supports.

The new deals follow similar moves by numerous other law firms, which came as Trump threatens to sign punitive executive orders targeting legal offices for their past or current association with his perceived enemies.

Trump on Truth Social on Friday said that four firms — Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Allen Overy Shearman Sterling US LLP, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, and Latham & Watkins LLP — have each committed to at least $125 million in free legal work, for a total of $500 million.

In a separate post, Trump announced a similar deal with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, LLP for at least $100 million.

The pro bono services will be directed toward causes that both Trump and the firms support, include assisting veterans, combating antisemitism and ensuring "fairness in our Justice System," according to the posts.

All five firms also agreed not to "engage in illegal DEI discrimination and preferences" and commit to "Merit-Based Hiring."

They additionally affirm not to deny representation to clients "because of the personal political views of individual lawyers."

Trump's also revealed that, as a result of the agreements with Kirkland, Allen, Simpson and Latham, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has withdrawn letters it sent them on March 17 "and will not pursue any claims related to those issues."

The Department of Justice missed a Friday morning deadline set by a federal judge in Maryland to inform her of the Trump administration's plan for securing the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison, where he has been held since being deported.

The DOJ, in a filing, told District Court Judge Paul Xinis that her 11:30 a.m. ET deadline was "impracticable." 

The department noted that her order came hours after the Supreme Court upheld her prior directive that the U.S. government facilitate the return of Abrego Garica, who the DOJ has said was deported due to an administrative error.

But the Supreme Court in its decision Thursday night had said, "For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps."

Xinis has scheduled a 1 p.m. status hearing in the case. 

The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld Xinis' original order in the case, which directed the Trump administration "to facilitate and effectuate the return" of Abrego Garcia. 

The Supreme Court, however, told Xinis she needed to clarify her directive's use of the word "effectuate ... with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs."

Xinis within hours modified her order in response to the Supreme Court decision, and directed the administration to "take all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible."

She also told the DOJ to tell her before Friday's hearing "the current physical location and custodial status of Abrego Garcia ... what steps, if any, Defendants have taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's immediate return to the United States," and "what additional steps Defendants will take, and when, to facilitate his return."

In this article

Apple is once again in the crosshairs of a global trade war. This time, the stakes may be even higher.

On April 2, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on a wide range of imported goods, including those from China, India, Vietnam and other countries critical to Apple's supply chain. That move sent shockwaves through global markets, wiping out over $640 billion in Apple's market value in just five days.

"It's the most head-scratching, absurd policy move we've seen in years," said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities. "Apple is in the eye of the storm."

CNBC technology reporter Kif Leswing calls it a "massive moment for Apple."

"Even with all their efforts to diversify production, the company still depends on China, and now they're facing tariffs from nearly every country they manufacture in," Leswing said.

While the stock rebounded on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for select nations, the broader uncertainty around Apple's global manufacturing model hasn't gone away. China tariffs remain at a staggering 145%.

"No company is more impacted by this tariff Armageddon than Apple," Ives said.

Apple still assembles 90% of its iPhones in China, largely through its partnership with Foxconn. China also handles 80% of iPads and over half of Mac computers, according to Evercore ISI.

"Apple's been trying to get ahead of this," Leswing said. "They've been making iPhones in India, assembling Macs in Malaysia, sourcing from Vietnam, but those countries are now seeing tariffs too. That puts Apple in a really tough spot."

India, Vietnam and Thailand were all key parts of Apple's post-COVID diversification strategy. Under Trump's new plan, imports from many of those countries face tariffs as high as 26% to 46%, although the president reduced most tariffs to 10% on Wednesday.

Still, the message from the White House is clear: Apple needs to make products in the U.S.

In theory, tariffs are meant to bring jobs and production back to the U.S. In practice, moving high-tech manufacturing out of China is neither fast nor cheap.

"If you want an iPhone made in the U.S. and you want it for $3,500, we should make it here," said Ives. "If you want it for $1,000, you keep it in China."

The iPhone 16 Pro Max currently starts at $1,199, but one UBS estimate shows that new tariffs could raise the price by $350. Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley estimates Apple may need to increase prices across the board by 17% to 18% to cover the added cost.

Apple has started building some iPhones in India and iPads in Vietnam, but the company remains heavily reliant on China's infrastructure, skilled labor force, and dense manufacturing network.

"It would take decades just to move 10% of Apple's supply chain to the U.S.," Ives said. "The global supply chain is built in Asia."

As panic rippled through the markets, Apple kept quiet. The company has declined to comment publicly on the tariffs and has offered no updated guidance to suppliers or shareholders.

That stands in contrast to 2019, when CEO Tim Cook personally lobbied the first Trump administration to exempt iPhones from a previous round of tariffs, and succeeded. This time, no carve-outs have been announced.

"It's kind of a cipher right now, what Tim Cook is cooking up in Cupertino," said Leswing. "They've said very little."

According to reporting from 9To5Mac, Apple has started modeling out different tariff scenarios and even chartered at least five planes in late March to stockpile products before tariffs took effect.

Analysts say Apple's options are limited in the short term. The company is expected to delay price hikes until its next product cycle, likely with the iPhone 17, but that could impact demand in a cooling smartphone market.

Apple already faces pressure over its slow rollout of artificial intelligence features and stagnating hardware innovation. If the tariffs remain in place, or escalate further, the ripple effects could be massive.

"This could throw the U.S. into a self-inflicted recession," Ives said.

So far, investors are watching closely for signs of a shift in strategy or a more forceful response from Apple leadership.

"Apple is the poster child for the trade war," said Leswing. "And right now, they're not saying much at all."

Watch the video to understand how tariffs are shaking Apple's supply chain and what it could mean for your next iPhone.

Mari Shor was deep into a firm-wide presentation on what President Donald Trump's tariffs meant for the dozens of consumer companies she analyzes at Columbia Threadneedle when someone interrupted her. Mari, the tariffs are paused, the colleague said, the stocks you cover are soaring.

For days, Shor had been scrambling to tweak her profit models to incorporate the steep tariffs Trump unveiled last week and now those new estimates looked, for the moment at least, irrelevant. A day later, as stocks began to sink anew, Shor marveled at the blinding confusion created by all the twists and turns in Trump's trade war.

A group of Senate Democrats on Friday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate President Donald Trump and others for "potential violations of securities law" related to the president's announcement this week of a pause in so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from many countries.

"Specifically, we ask the SEC to determine whether President Trump, any members of his cabinet, or other donor, insiders, and Administration officials engaged in insider trading, market manipulation, or other securities laws violations on April 9, 2025, when President Trump announced that it was a "GREAT TIME TO BUY" into the stock market," the Democrats said in a letter.

"President Trump's statement came just hours before he announced a 90-day pause on his recently-announced tariffs, leading to a historic market rally after days of dramatic market declines," the letter said.

The letter was signed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Arizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, as well as Sen. Adam Schiff of California and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden.

An SEC spokesperson declined to comment.

CNBC has requested comment from the White House on the letter.

On Thursday, White House spokesman Kush Desai dismissed comments from Schiff and other Democrats raising concerns about possible insider trading related to Trump's pause.

"It is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering," Desai said in a statement.

"Democrats railed against China's cheating for decades, and now they're playing partisan games instead of celebrating President Trump's decisive action yesterday to finally corner China," he said.

President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. could have wide-ranging consequences for drugmakers and American patients, some experts told CNBC. 

The duties could disrupt the complex pharmaceutical supply chain, drive up the prices of drugs in the U.S. and exacerbate shortages of critical medicines, some health policy experts said. Drugmakers often rely on a global network of manufacturing sites for different steps of the production process. 

"We are already in a state where prescription drugs are unaffordable to many," Mariana Socal, a health policy professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNBC. 

"Anything that we change, any trade policies, any tariff policies, anything that further increases the cost of prescription drugs, be it in the supply chain, the distribution network, risks increasing costs to the consumer even further and just worsening the affordability crisis for drugs in America that we've had for a long time," she said. 

Trump this week doubled down on plans to impose "major" pharmaceutical-specific tariffs "very shortly," which battered the stocks of some drugmakers early Wednesday. He said he would pause steep tariff rates on dozens of countries following a market fallout that same day, but it does not appear to apply to levies on specific industries like autos, steel, aluminum and pharmaceuticals. 

Trump exempted pharmaceuticals from his sweeping tariffs unveiled last week. Still, he has said duties on drugs will encourage drugmakers to move manufacturing operations into the U.S. at a time when domestic production in the industry has shrunk significantly.

But experts said it's unclear whether tariffs will influence more companies to make more drugs in the U.S. It would cost drugmakers billions of dollars and take at least several years for them to do so, they added. 

Some drugmakers, such as Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie, may be better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note last week. The majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added. 

Meanwhile, Novartis and Roche "look more at risk" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.

The impact of tariffs will look different depending on the type of drug, experts said. Manufacturers of already cheaper generic drugs, which account for about 90% of the medicines prescribed in the U.S., could get squeezed the most by tariffs, according to Arda Ural, EY Americas Life Sciences Leader. 

Those medications, which are generally much more affordable for patients, have far lower profit margins than branded drugs and often rely on ingredients made in China and India, so tariffs could force some generic drugmakers to leave the U.S. market altogether. 

Pharmaceutical tariffs could ultimately undermine the government's efforts to rein in the high costs of health care in the U.S. Americans pay around two to three times more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries, according to a 2024 report from RAND. 

The tariffs could worsen the unprecedented shortfall of medicine in the U.S., which is driven by factors such as manufacturing quality control and demand surges. There are 270 active drug shortages in the U.S., which has remained unchanged for the past three quarters, according to data from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.

But some drug categories will likely be more vulnerable to shortages than others if tariffs go into effect, said Marta Wosińska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center on Health Policy.

Generic sterile injectable drugs, which are commonly used in hospitals, are already more prone to shortages and have faced persistent supply issues for years. Those include products like IV saline bags, cancer chemotherapy drugs and lidocaine, which is used to numb pain.

Generic sterile injectables have complex manufacturing processes and low profit margins, which could make it more difficult for their producers to absorb tariff-induced cost increases. 

Manufacturers of those injections also have limited ability to pass on cost increases due to certain contracts with so-called group purchasing organizations that lock in the prices but not the quantity of what they buy, Wosińska said. Group purchasing organizations broker drug acquisitions for hospitals and other health-care providers, and their contracts with manufacturers generally last one-to-three years.

If manufacturers of generic sterile injectables can't pass on higher costs, they may exit the U.S. market and worsen shortages of those essential drugs, said Wosińska. She said their other option is cutting costs, which is "concerning" because it could affect a product's quality and lead some manufacturers to temporarily slow down production due to issues like contamination. 

Generic oral drugs similarly face low margins, but their manufacturing is less complex and the market is more competitive. These include common pills such as statins for high cholesterol, multiple blood pressure medications and metformin for blood sugar control. 

Those oral drugs are used the most by Americans, as about 187 billion generic drug tablets and capsules were dispensed in retail and mail pharmacies in 2024 alone, according to a recent Brookings report by Wosińska.

She told CNBC that those drugs function more like a "spot market," where pharmacies and buyers can quickly switch suppliers if one source is disrupted by tariffs. While levies may drive up prices, manufacturers of these drugs have fewer binding contracts, allowing them to pass on higher costs more easily than their injectable counterparts can, according to Wosińska.

The impact of tariffs on costly branded medications, which have patent protections and don't face competition from generic drugs, will look a lot different, some experts said. Tariffs on medications imported from Europe would likely hit the hardest, as a significant amount of branded drug manufacturing is done there and in the U.S. 

"Branded products are already predominantly manufactured in the U.S. at about 50%, and the primary importation is from Europe at about 35%," said EY's Ural. 

There is "little to no manufacturing" of those drugs in China or India, he said. 

Still, branded drugs typically have higher profit margins and more stable supply chains than generic medications. That makes branded manufacturers better positioned to absorb higher costs from tariffs or pass them onto payers – and ultimately, consumers. 

Since manufacturers of a given branded drug monopolize its market, they could raise its price, leaving "the American consumer with no other choice because those products are protected by patents that no one else has," Johns Hopkins' Socal noted.

"With tariffs, the question will become, how much higher prices are we going to pay for these branded products?" she said.

Patients will likely notice higher prices for branded drugs more than increases to generic medication prices, Wosińska said. A price hike on a branded drug would directly translate to higher out-of-pocket spending for people in high-deductible commercial insurance plans or with high coinsurance rates, she noted. 

It's still unclear what Trump's tariffs will look like. But a patient with a 20% coinsurance rate could see their monthly out-of-pocket expenses rise if tariffs are imposed, since their share of the cost is directly tied to the branded drug's price.

By contrast, generic medications already have lower price points, so "even if a $3 drug increases by 25%, that is not going to be something that will really show up for patients," Wosińska told CNBC. She added that many patients have insurance plans with fixed co-pays for those drugs. 

But overall, "the primary impact on patient pocketbooks would be indirect—premiums would likely rise as the payer spending on drugs increases," she noted in her Brookings report. 

The question is whether manufacturers will want to raise prices as they face fierce blowback from patients and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for charging higher drug prices in the U.S. compared to other countries. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have targeted that imbalance. 

In a March 28 note, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said he heard from multiple CEOs of pharmaceuticals that "they may have to pass on some of the impact [from tariffs] as a price increase."

But he said doing so will "add more fire" to criticism of the higher prices of many drugs in the U.S. relative to Europe. Raffat said it could backfire "in a big way," and could revive a plan from Trump's first term that ties U.S. prices to those paid in other similar countries. 

Some Wall Street analysts have raised concerns that it will be difficult to reshore production in the U.S. because it is costly and could take several years. 

"Global supply chains are complex, with Pharma among the most–it's not as simple as moving where someone screws in little screws to make an iPhone," BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Wednesday. 

He said the tariffs will "likely do little to shift manufacturing" back to the U.S. since companies already have robust operations in the country. Seigerman said he expects most large pharmaceutical companies will likely set a goal of "waiting until the end of Trump's presidency to consider more permanent manufacturing decisions."

Some companies have already invested billions to boost U.S. manufacturing. This year, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson both announced new domestic manufacturing investments worth $27 billion and $55 billion, respectively, over several years. 

But some of those drumakers have already pushed back on tariffs, warning about their potential impact on research and development in the industry. 

"We can't breach those agreements, so we have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies," Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told BBC in an interview last week. "Typically, that will be in reduction of staff or research and development, and I predict R&D will come first. That's a disappointing outcome."

Larry Fink

BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he was caught by surprise at the breadth of President Donald Trump's tariffs last week on many countries, including key US trading partners.

“The sweeping US tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” Fink said on a call on Friday with analysts after the company reported first-quarter financial results.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Friday that he thinks the U.S. economy has weakened to the point of growth possibly turning negative.

"I think we're very close, if not in, a recession now," Fink said on "Squawk on the Street."

Fears of an economic slowdown have risen sharply since President Donald Trump unveiled widespread tariffs last week, sparking a sell-off in the stock market. Trump on Wednesday announced that he was pausing some of those import levies for 90 days, but that move has not been enough to restore confidence in the economy, Fink said.

"I think you're going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there's more certainty. And we now have a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty," Fink said Friday.

Surveys of consumers and business leaders have shown weakening sentiment in recent months. However, other pieces of economic data like job growth and retail sales have held up better. Fink said consumers may have been stocking up on goods ahead of the threatened tariffs, which could be masking some underlying economic weakness.

Despite his concerns, Fink said he did not think the U.S. was in a financial crisis and he expects "megatrends" in the economy like artificial intelligence would persist.

At an event for the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Fink said that other CEOs also think the U.S. is "probably in a recession."

Fink's latest remarks come after BlackRock announced its first-quarter financial results. In a press release Friday morning, the CEO commented that "uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations."

The asset management giant's financial results were mixed. BlackRock reported $11.30 in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter, above the $10.14 expected by Wall Street analysts, according to LSEG. However, $5.28 billion in revenue was short of the $5.34 billion consensus estimate.

On the assets front, BlackRock reported $84 billion in net inflows during the quarter and ended March with nearly $11.58 trillion under management.

Shares of the firm were up less than 1% in morning trading.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Friday that he expects estimates for corporate earnings to fall amid the uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's trade negotiations.

On a call with reporters to discuss first-quarter earnings, JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum said he didn't see a reason to pull the bank's guidance, which is contingent on how the economy and interest rates play out.

His boss, Dimon, then interjected, speaking about the broader corporate world: "I would just add companies, some have taken away their guidance. I expect to see more of that."

"Analysts have generally reduced their S&P estimate earnings by 5%," in recent days, Dimon said. "I think you'll see that come down some more."

Later Friday, Dimon specified that he expected analysts to slash their S&P 500 earnings estimates for growth of 5% to become flat and then as much as negative 5% "probably the next month."

Companies will be reporting earnings over the next several weeks, giving managers an opportunity to update investors on their outlook during a period of heightened uncertainty. Markets have whipsawed since Trump announced a sweeping set of tariffs on America's trading partners last week, and have remained volatile as U.S.-China tensions have escalated.

Already, companies with exposure to the consumer including Walmart, Delta and Frontier Airlines have reined in parts of their guidance to investors.

The uncertainty is causing clients to pull back from acquiring companies and making investments as they adopt a wait-and-see attitude, Dimon and Barnum said.

Anecdotal examples suggest that "people are being cautious," Dimon said. "You know, people are pulling back on doing deals, not just big ones, but middle-market companies are being very cautious about investment."

Barnum added the environment has led businesses to drop long-term plans in favor of "near-term optimization of supply chains."

"This level of policy uncertainty is one that makes it hard to plan for the long term," Barnum said.

Meanwhile, consumers have held up in the first quarter, and more recently there are signs they've been accelerating purchases on concerns that tariffs will make items more expensive, the CFO said.

China hit back at the US on Friday with a 125% tariff on imports, the latest escalation in the trade war between the two superpowers sparked by President Donald Trump's trade levies.

In a fiery statement, China's Finance Ministry accused the US of "bullying" and said it risked becoming a "joke" on the world stage.

"The US's arbitrary imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, disregards the post-World War II global economic order built by the US itself, and violates basic economic laws and common sense. It is completely unilateral bullying and coercion," the statement said.

"Even if the US continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of the world economy," it added.

The new tariffs are set to go into effect on Saturday, the ministry said. It added that it would not reciprocate with further tariff increases should the US retaliate again.

"If the US continues to play the tariff numbers game, China will ignore it," the statement said.

Previously, China said the tariff rate on US imports would be 84%, a level imposed on Wednesday.

On Thursday, the White House said the combined tariff rate being imposed on China was 145%, not the 125% that had previously been reported.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on Friday that the difference between the two figures was "negligible in any practical economic sense. " But they said the markets reacted to an increased decoupling of two of the world's largest economies.

"Neither the US nor China are showing signs of backing down, with President Trump expressing confidence in his tariff plans yesterday, even as he acknowledged potential 'transition problems,'" the analysts said.

Earlier in the week, Trump announced that he would pause a large swathe of his tariffs for 90 days, though many — including tariffs on China — remained in effect.

Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said on Friday that the president's willingness to change his stance on tariffs in response to equity and bond market turmoil showed some sensitivity to market turbulence.

"To be sure, the significant tariffs on China will cause economic disruption if they remain in place," he said. "But while downside risks do remain, we believe the risk of a more severe economic downturn is now more limited."

On Truth Social, Trump wrote Wednesday: "At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable."

The Trump administration estimated the US ran a trade deficit of $295 billion with China in 2024, with the US importing $440 billion in goods from China and China importing $145 billion in goods from America.

China's announcement of new retaliatory tariffs had a mixed impact on European stocks, though it was less significant than moves earlier in the week.

Germany's DAX was down 1.5% by about 1:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. ET), while Britain's FTSE 100 was up about 0.4%. Europe's broad Stoxx 600 fell 0.6%.

US futures were trading a little higher, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all set to open up by about 0.2%.

Japan's Nikkei 225 tumbled almost 3% by the end of the trading day, and South Korea's Kospi lost 0.5%.

"Both China and the US have sent clear messages, there is no point of raising tariffs further," Zhiwei Zhang, the president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in a note on Thursday.

"The next stage is to observe and evaluate the damage to economic activities in the US and China," he added.

"Andor" creator and showrunner Tony Gilroy says Disney is working on a horror project within the "Star Wars" universe.

The showrunner briefly touched on the future of the "Star Wars" franchise when speaking to SFX Magazine in March ahead of the final season of "Andor." He joked that he'd like to see "a three-camera sitcom in 'Star Wars' or a horror movie."

Gilroy spoke to Business Insider on the "Andor" season two red carpet in London on Thursday. 

Asked what he would do with a "Star Wars" horror project, he said Lucasfilm and Disney already had one in development: "They're doing that. I think they're doing that. I think that's in the works, yeah."

Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gilroy didn't say whether the project was a TV show or a movie.

He also clarified his previous comments: "I'm agnostic about what should be done. I was riffing on the thing where I said, 'Oh, do a three-camera comedy,' so I was riffing. Sometimes riffing doesn't work with the 'Star Wars' community."

Referring to "Andor," Gilroy said: "The right creator, and the right moment, and the right vibe … you can do anything. So, my hope is that the show connects, and then we can pass along the favor that we were given from 'Mandalorian,' and we can pass along a good healthy backwind to someone else who wants to do something else cool."

The "Andor" series is a more serious affair than some of the other "Star Wars" projects of late. The political thriller focuses on the growing rebellion against the Empire in the years before 2016's "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," as well as 1977's "Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope."

The first season, released in 2022, was met with widespread critical acclaim and earned a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Its success showed that the "Star Wars" franchise can explore wider themes and genres without relying on the Jedi, lightsabers, and the Force to keep its audience engaged.

"Andor" season two starts streaming on Disney+ on April 22.

I recently visited Redwood Materials, a company that's deeply entrenched in the electric vehicle industry.

This startup has agreements worth billions of dollars with major automakers and EV battery manufacturers, including VW, Toyota, GM, and Panasonic. So when I sat down with Redwood's chief commercial officer, Cal Lankton, I asked for his outlook on EV sales.

Elon Musk's DOGE activities have dented the allure of Tesla vehicles, and there are nagging questions over EV demand and whether the auto industry is all in on this technology — or not.

Lankton, though, was unequivocal during our interview:

"We've been very fortunate to have a strong set of partners — to be very tied into their demand plans and how they see the market evolving — and we have not seen softening," he said.

"In fact, EV demand is continuing to increase. 2024 was the largest year of EV shipments on record in North America, and I think 2025 will be even larger," Lankton added.

Concerns about a slowdown in EV adoption have been overblown and driven by "some in OEMs in particular," Lankton said, without naming names. OEM refers to an original equipment manufacturer, or a company that designs and makes its own cars.

"But the consumer is looking at EVs as compelling options," he said. "OEMs in North America are offering more and more compelling options and we feel very bullish about the long-term growth of electric vehicles."

It's fair to take Lankton's view with a pinch of salt. Redwood Materials is relying on EV demand staying strong to support its ambitious business plans.

But the data also supports his view. Cox Automotive's Q1 2025 report found the US EV market continuing to grow. And while certain brands have lost ground, others are leaning into long-term demand with confidence.

In the first quarter, almost 300,000 EVs were sold in the US, up 11% from a year earlier, Cox estimated.

While Tesla saw a decline, legacy auto brands such as Chevrolet, VW, Toyota, and Honda saw massive growth, year over year. Porsche was a real standout. It sold more than 4,000 EVs in Q1, up 250% from a year earlier. Taycans aren't cheap either!

"Despite many obstacles — and what you may read elsewhere — electric-vehicle sales continue to grow at a healthy pace in the US," Cox wrote in its latest report.

The Model S and Model X account for only a fraction of Tesla's sales in China.

Tesla Inc. stopped taking orders in China for Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles — both of which are imported from the US — after the countries raised tariffs on one another in an escalating trade war.

The electric-car maker was offering the option to order the two models as of the end of March, according to a screenshot of its China website archived by Wayback Machine. Although that had been removed as of Friday, existing inventory of cars, such as a white Model S listed for 759,900 yuan ($103,800), is still available.

Building GPT-4 took a lot of manpower. Now, OpenAI says it could rebuild GPT-4 with as few as five people, all because of what it learned from its latest model, GPT-4.5.

In a company podcast episode published Friday, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, asked a question to three key engineers behind GPT-4.5: What's the smallest OpenAI team that could retrain GPT-4 from scratch today?

Altman said building GPT-4 took "hundreds of people, almost all of OpenAI's effort" — but things get much easier once a model is no longer at the frontier.

Alex Paino, who led pre-training machine learning for GPT-4.5, said retraining GPT-4 now would "probably" take just five to 10 people.

"We trained GPT-4o, which was a GPT-4-caliber model that we retrained using a lot of the same stuff coming out of the GPT-4.5 research program," Paino said. "Doing that run itself actually took a much smaller number of people."

Daniel Selsam, a researcher at OpenAI working on data efficiency and algorithms, agreed that rebuilding GPT-4 would now be far easier. 

"Just finding out someone else did something — it becomes immensely easier," he said. "I feel like just the fact that something is possible is a huge cheat code."

In February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, saying it was the company's largest and most powerful model to date.

Altman described it in a post on X as "the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person."

Paino said GPT-4.5 is designed to be "10x smarter" than GPT-4, which was released in March 2023.

"We're scaling 10x beyond what we did before with these GPT pre-training runs," Paino said.

Altman also said OpenAI is no longer "compute-constrained" on the best models it can produce — a shift he thinks the world hasn't really understood yet.

For many AI companies, the biggest hurdle to building better models is simply having enough computing power.

"It is a crazy update," Altman said. "For so long, we lived in a world where compute was always the limiting factor," he added.

Big Tech has been pouring billions into AI infrastructure. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta are expected to spend a collective $320 billion in capital expenditures this year to broaden their AI capabilities.

OpenAI announced in March that it had closed the largest private tech funding round on record, including $30 billion from SoftBank and $10 billion from other investors, bringing the company's valuation to $300 billion.

The fresh capital will help OpenAI scale its computing power even further, the company said in a statement at the time.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in February that demand for AI compute will only grow.

"Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning can consume much more compute," Huang said on the call.

As for what's needed to hit the next 10x or 100x jump in scale, Selsam, the OpenAI researcher, said it's data efficiency.

The GPT models are very efficient at processing information, but there's a "ceiling to how deep of an insight it can gain from the data," he said.

"At some point, as the compute keeps growing and growing, the data grows much less quickly," he said, adding that "the data becomes the bottleneck."

Pushing beyond that, he said, will require "some algorithmic innovations" to squeeze more value from the same amount of data.

Emma Walmsley on navigating global politics and why inclusion still matters

In her eight-year tenure as chief executive officer of GSK Plc, Emma Walmsley has seen off a combative activist investor, navigated multi-billion dollar litigation in the US and spun out a consumer health company, Haleon Plc. Her latest challenge is preparing the drugmaker for the looming threat of getting dragged into President Donald Trump's trade war.

The 55-year-old has worked to turn GSK — which traces its history to the 18th century — into a forward-looking pharma company by embracing new developments, including pivoting back to cancer medicines and investing in artificial intelligence. Still, with the share price stubbornly low, she's facing pressure from investors to improve performance.

Dollar and Treasurys are selling off on Friday as President Donald Trump's trade war ratchets up the risk for American assets.

The US Dollar Index — which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies — fell below the key 100 level for the first time since July 2023. The index chalked up 2.7% in losses over the past week and is 7.6% lower year to date.

Meanwhile, Treasury yields have risen, which means that prices of the assets have fallen because the two metrics move in opposite directions. The 10-year Treasury yield is around 4.45% — up nearly five basis points.

The spike in bond yields — which typically indicates higher interest rates — helped prompt Trump to put a 90-day pause on most tariffs.

The slump in the greenback and Treasurys is significant because they are typically considered safe assets that investors flock to in times of uncertainty. Treasurys are considered risk-free.

In contrast, investors are putting their money into classic haven assets elsewhere, like the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and gold.

Some analysts are calling the sell-off in the dollar, Treasurys, and US equities the "Sell America" trade.

"There has been a pronounced 'sell US' vibe flowing through broad markets and into the classic safe-haven assets, with the USD losing the safe-haven bid put in over the past week," wrote Chris Weston, the head of research at Pepperstone, an Australian foreign exchange broker.

The dollar's steep losses signal that many investors are focusing on the idea that "Trump's reluctant pause on tariffs was due to increased system risk and migrating capital away from Ground Zero," Weston wrote on X on Friday.

Even though Trump's pause on most tariffs for 90 days sent markets into a stunning rally on Wednesday, the gains came off quickly on Thursday, showing investors' jitters about ongoing macro uncertainty.

The unusual pattern of higher long-term interest rates and sharply lower stock prices suggests a "generalized aversion to US assets in global financial markets," wrote ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, on X on Wednesday.

"We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market," Summers wrote.

Movement in the yen reflects investor unease as the currency was trading around 146 through the tumult.

The trade suggests that the US's "flip-flopping of policy is now demanding a higher risk premium of US asset markets," wrote Chris Turner, the global head of markets at ING, in a Thursday note. The dollar was trading around 143 to the yen on Friday.

The unusual market movements come amid unprecedented tumult sparked by Trump's trade war that is shaking confidence in the central role of the dollar in the global financial system — a position that others are also eying.

"The big element of constancy in US policy of the past decades is the attachment to the central role of the dollar. I believe that the Trump administration also has that view, but it is very incoherent in the way it practices that," Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the French central bank governor and a policymaker at the European Central Bank, told France Inter radio on Thursday. "What has happened in recent days and weeks plays against the confidence in the US currency."

However, this can be positive for developing the international role of the euro, Villeroy said.

ING's Turner wrote that euro assets could benefit if the "Sell America theme" unfurls fully.

On Friday, the euro hit a three-year high against the dollar.

Linda McMahon may have meant artificial intelligence — but the steak sauce brand A.1. heard opportunity.

​​After the secretary of education repeatedly referred to artificial intelligence as "A1" on a panel this week, the brand jumped in to savor the moment.

"You heard her. Every school should have access to A.1.," the brand wrote in a Friday Instagram post, alongside an image of its bottle slapped with a new label: "For education purposes only."

A big slogan across the graphic said: "Agree. Best to start them early."

McMahon made the slip while speaking at the ASU+GSV Summit, a conference on the future of education and work. She was on a panel discussing the role of AI in the workforce — but things took a saucy turn.

"You know, AI development — I mean, how can we educate at the speed of light if we don't have the best technology around to do that?" she said. The former CEO of WWE used the correct abbreviation for artificial intelligence, before pivoting into the world of condiments.

McMahon said she heard about "a school system that's going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching in every year." McMahon continued: "That's a wonderful thing!"

"Kids are sponges. They just absorb everything," she added. "It wasn't all that long ago that it was, 'We're going to have internet in our schools!' Now let's see A1 and how can that be helpful."

McMahon and A.1. did not respond to requests for comment.

The brand joins others that have seized a quick moment of fame on social media.

Coffee Mate's marketing team sprang into action after the season finale of "The White Lotus," creating a semiviral post that played off a key moment from the show.

The coffee creamer brand worked with the hit HBO series on two limited-edition flavors ahead of the latest season: piña colada and Thai iced coffee. An executive said his team had no idea that piña coladas would be featured on the hit show's finale on Sunday night.

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he doesn't really need to have Elon Musk in his administration.

"Elon has done a fantastic job. Look, he's sitting here, and I don't care. I don't need Elon for anything other than I happen to like him," Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.

Trump said on Thursday that he had recently purchased a Tesla vehicle as a "show of support" for Musk.

"I don't need his car. I actually bought one, and they said, 'Oh, did you get a bargain?' No. I said, 'Give me the top price.' I paid a lot of money for that car," Trump said.

Trump's purchase took place during a White House event last month, where he was seen trying out a red Tesla Model S with Musk.

"He's done a fantastic job but he hasn't been treated properly," Trump said of Musk on Thursday.

Musk, who was at the meeting, was seen smiling and nodding to Trump's remarks.

Musk has been spearheading cost-cutting efforts at the White House DOGE office. In an attempt to slash spending, DOGE has laid off thousands of government workers and shuttered foreign aid programs. These rapid cuts have sparked fear and chaos across the government.

Musk said at the Thursday Cabinet meeting that DOGE will cut nearly $150 billion in spending for the 2026 fiscal year.

But these broad cuts at DOGE and the turmoil that comes with them have also hit Musk's business interests. Tesla showrooms nationwide have been the target of protests, and Tesla owners have said their vehicles have been defaced.

"If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?" Musk told Tesla employees during an all-hands meeting last month.

"Listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable," Musk added.

Musk has been one of Trump's biggest supporters. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent at least $277 million supporting Trump and other GOP candidates in last year's elections.

But Musk appeared to break with the administration after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on over 180 countries last week.

Musk called for a "free trade zone" between Europe and the US during a meeting with Italy's League Party on Saturday. Musk also criticized Trump's top advisor, Peter Navarro, saying he was "dumber than a sack of bricks" after he called Musk a "car assembler."

Last week, Vice President JD Vance told Fox News in an interview that Musk would stay on as an advisor even after he completes his work with DOGE.

Trump said on April 3 that he expects Musk to leave his administration "in a few months" but said he wants Musk to stay on for "as long as possible."

Musk is now working for the administration as a special government employee. Per federal law, such employees cannot work for more than 130 days in a 365-day period.

"Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete," the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, wrote in an X post on April 2.

Musk and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

The US's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, on Thursday ordered the termination of IT and consulting contracts with companies including Accenture and Deloitte, calling it "wasteful spending."

In a Department of Defense memo, Hegseth said he would cut a Defense Health Agency contract "for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce."

Also on the chopping block is the Air Force's contract with Accenture to "re-sell third-party Enterprise Cloud IT Services," which Hegseth said the government could "already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources."

In the memo, Hegseth also said he was terminating 11 other contracts for consulting services supporting what he called "non-essential" activities, including diversity, equity and inclusion, climate matters, and the Pentagon's COVID-19 response.

Hegseth said the terminations "represent $5.1 billion in wasteful spending" at the DOD and would result in nearly $4 billion in savings.

He said the savings would be reallocated to serve "critical priorities to Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence."

He did not specify in his memo which Pentagon projects this money would go to.

In response to a request for comment, the DOD directed Business Insider to an X video of Hegseth talking about the terminations.

"By the way, we need this money to spend on better healthcare for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant. That's a lot of consulting," Hegseth said in the video.

Hegseth also expressed his gratitude to Elon Musk's cost-cutting outfit, DOGE, which has been targeting federal spending across various agencies and has championed the layoffs of thousands of federal workers and the shuttering of foreign aid programs.

"So we want to thank our friends at DOGE. We want to thank all the folks here that have helped us unpack this, reveal it, and we're excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer and the warfighters at the Department," Hegseth said in his X video.

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, mentioned the Defense Department's $841 billion budget in an op-ed article he wrote with Vivek Ramaswamy for The Wall Street Journal in November. Ramaswamy, who was co-leader of DOGE at the time, left DOGE in January.

"The Pentagon recently failed its seventh consecutive audit, suggesting that the agency's leadership has little idea how its annual budget of more than $800 billion is spent," the pair wrote.

Last month, Hegseth announced that the Defense Department was terminating over $580 million in programs, contracts, and grants that DOGE had identified as wasteful spending.

Representatives for Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BI.

Waymo has arrived in Tokyo. 

The Alphabet-owned robotaxi company announced on Wednesday that its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles will begin mapping out seven central wards of Tokyo — Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Chūō, Shinagawa — which represent some of the city's major commercial hubs.

The cars, however, won't be driverless yet.

Nihon Kotsu and GO, two of Japan's largest taxi platforms, will manage the fleet and manually drive the vehicles. This will help the Waymo cars gather data and learn the country's unique driving patterns, such as left-hand traffic.

"Initially, the Nihon Kotsu drivers will manually drive the car, just like you or I would with our hands on the wheel and no autonomous driving enabled," Sandy Karp, a spokesperson for Waymo, told Business Insider in an email. "Waymo will use the information from these driving missions to begin adapting and validating its autonomous driving technology for operation in Japan."

Waymo will begin the mapping process with 25 vehicles, Karp said.

The spokesperson sent BI a photo of one of the vehicles backing out of a shipment container at an undisclosed port in Japan earlier in March. In the photo, a Nihon Kotsu crew member watches the Waymo as it pulls out of the container.

Karp said the vehicles have since been moved to a depot and are "getting upfitted with some adjustments" to comply with local laws and regulations, including new vehicle signage and an additional blindspot mirror attachment.

Yasuharu Wakabayashi, president of Nihon Kotsu, said in a statement that the company's drivers have trained in the US and are "well-prepared to begin introducing Waymo's vehicles to Tokyo."

"We anticipate that autonomous robotaxis will help address driver shortages in the future," he said. "We view this initiative as the first step toward building an ideal ecosystem that unites people and advanced technology."

Waymo's approach to a fully autonomous driver system includes mapping out a specific area with its vehicles before it can launch to the public without human supervision.

This differs from other autonomous vehicle-focused companies like Wayve or Tesla, which rely more heavily on end-to-end learning models for its self-driving software. This essentially allows the car to learn to drive in its environment on the go without the need to map out an area beforehand.

Proponents of this approach argue that end-to-end learning allows for a more efficient ability to scale. Waymo's director of product management, Vishay Nihalani, told BI at a recent autonomous vehicle conference in Los Angeles that as Waymo's driver continues to learn, the robotaxi will require less time to map out any given city. 

Waymo has also sought partnerships with third parties, including rideshare platforms, to help manage its fleets in some cities.

In Austin and Atlanta, for example, Uber manages Waymos's fleet, which includes vehicle maintenance and depot operations. In San Francisco, Waymo maintains the vehicles on its own.

According to the company, Waymo now provides more than 200,000 paid passenger weekly trips.

The service now operates in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Austin, Atlanta, and Silicon Valley geofenced areas.

YORK COUNTY, Pa. (WHP) — A York County man has pleaded guilty to charges relating to years worth of improper tax return filings.

According to a release from the United States Department of Justice, 45-year-old Waylon Wilcox of Dillsburg filed false income tax returns for years 2021 and 2022.

Authorities said Wilcox had sold 97 pieces of digital artwork from a "CryptoPunks" collection of "10,000 unique art characters."

The DOJ confirmed that:

These "non-fungible tokens", also known as NFTs, Wilcox had sold for millions of dollars but, when filing for taxes, Wilcox checked no when asked if he sold, exchanged, or received virtual currency for his 2021 tax filing.

Wilcox also checked no in 2022 when asked if he received, sold, or exchanged digital assets.

Because of this, Wilcox's underreported income led to his owed taxes being reduced by roughly $3 million between 2021 and 2022.

Wilcox later pleaded guilty on April 9 of 2025 to two counts of filing false individual income tax returns.

This week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche called for an end to targeting crypto mixers, while New York Attorney General Letitia James called for a further crackdown on them.

On Monday, Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Blanche published a memo entitled “Ending Regulation By Prosecution” in which he stated that the U.S. Department of Justice will stop its crackdown on bitcoin and crypto mixers.

Here's the exact language he used in the memo:

“…the Justice Department will stop participating in regulation by prosecution in this space. Specifically, the Department will no longer target virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and offline wallets for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations…”

The following day, New York Attorney General (NYAG) James co-authored a letter in which she called on congressional leaders to create federal crypto regulation, in part to prevent the use of crypto mixers for illicit purposes.

Here's what she and her co-authors had to say about crypto mixers:

“Effective legislation must require cryptocurrency platforms to expressly comply with anti-money laundering laws, know your customer (“KYC”) regulations and cyber security protocols to prevent the use of cryptocurrency to finance terrorism, adversarial regimes, and crime. Cryptocurrency that cannot be fully traced, such as those going through money laundering mixers, must not be allowed to be converted, directly or indirectly, to U.S. dollars.”

While DAG Blanche gave the benefit of the doubt to users of Bitcoin and crypto mixers, NY AG James implied that all users of such mixers are criminals, as she refers to the technology as “money laundering mixers.”

Such language is deeply concerning to hear from the attorney general of a state — much less any lawyer — as it presumes guilt.

NY AG James has employed this type of rhetoric around Bitcoin and crypto since she assumed the attorney general role in 2018, and it's unfair because 1.) she's never once acknowledged that human rights and pro-democracy activists use mixers to preserve both their privacy and the privacy of their donors and 2.) U.S. citizens have a right to financial privacy.

So, as the topic Bitcoin privacy becomes more prominent in the political sphere, be sure to do your part to amplify the type rhetoric that DAG Blanche is using while pushing back on the dangerous and unjust rhetoric from the likes of NY AG James.

It's up to us to make our voices heard on this issue and to let our elected officials know that it matters to us, especially as the Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash cases unfold (more on both cases in the discussion below).

The fight for our right to transfer value across the internet privately is afoot. Please don't stay on the sidelines.

 Rising systemic risks and distrust in the Federal Reserve could push investors toward Bitcoin as a safe haven. 

Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, addressed the issue of rising Treasury yields on April 11, suggesting that they might indicate a shift in investor sentiment away from United States government debt. Kashkari highlighted that the Federal Reserve has tools to provide more liquidity if necessary.

While underscoring the importance of maintaining a strong commitment to reducing inflation, Kashkari's remarks signal a possible turning point for Bitcoin (BTC) investors amid growing economic uncertainty.

The current 10-year US government bond yield of 4.5% is not unusual. Even if it approaches 5%, a level last seen in October 2023, this does not necessarily mean investors have lost confidence in the Treasury's ability to meet its debt obligations. For example, gold prices only surpassed $2,000 in late November 2023, after yields had already decreased to 4.5%.

Rising Treasury yields often signal concerns about inflation or economic uncertainty. This is crucial for Bitcoin traders because higher yields tend to make fixed-income investments more appealing. However, if these rising yields are perceived as a sign of deeper systemic issues—such as waning confidence in government fiscal policies—investors may turn to alternative hedges like Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's trajectory will largely depend on how the Federal Reserve responds. Liquidity injection strategies typically boost Bitcoin prices while allowing higher yields could increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth and negatively impacting Bitcoin's price in the short term.

One strategy the Federal Reserve could use is purchasing long-term Treasurys to reduce yields. To offset the liquidity added through bond purchases, the Fed might simultaneously conduct reverse repos—borrowing cash from banks overnight in exchange for securities. 

While this approach could temporarily stabilize yields, aggressive bond purchases might signal desperation to control rates. Such a signal could raise concerns about the Fed's ability to manage inflation effectively. These concerns often weaken confidence in the dollar's purchasing power and may push investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge.

Another potential strategy involves providing low-interest loans through the discount window to give banks immediate liquidity, reducing their need to sell long-term bonds. To counterbalance this liquidity injection, the Fed could impose stricter collateral requirements, such as valuing pledged bonds at 90% of their market price.

This alternative approach limits banks' access to cash while ensuring borrowed funds remain tied to collateralized loans. However, if collateral requirements are too restrictive, banks might struggle to obtain sufficient liquidity even with access to discount window loans.

Although it is too early to predict which path the Fed will take, given the recent weakness in the US dollar alongside a 4.5% Treasury yield, investors might not place full trust in the Fed's actions. Instead, they may turn to safe-haven assets such as gold or Bitcoin for protection.

Ultimately, rather than focusing solely on the US Dollar Index (DXY) or the US 10-year Treasury yield, traders should pay closer attention to systemic risks in financial markets and the spreads on corporate bonds. As these indicators rise, confidence in the traditional financial systems weakens, potentially setting the stage for Bitcoin to reclaim the psychological $100,000 price level.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could consider a short-term crypto oversight framework to allow firms to keep innovating while the agency works out a more permanent answer to digital assets regulation, interim Chairman Mark Uyeda suggested during a Friday event at the agency's Washington headquarters.

"We should consider whether there may be a more efficient method of regulation under an accommodating federal regulatory framework," said Uyeda, in a recorded statement played at the agency's latest crypto industry roundtable. "While the Commission works to develop a long term solution to address these issues, a time-limited, conditional exempt relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term."

The securities regulator is waiting for Congress to deliver a crypto market-structure law that will allow it to start writing the rules that the digital assets sector has been clamoring for. That may happen as soon as later this year, according to the lawmakers working on that effort, but months will pass before its arrival and even longer for the SEC and other relevant federal agencies to write regulations and put them in motion.

During this second in a series of crypto roundtables the agency hosted as it overhauls its digital assets stance, Uyeda was still running the agency, though the incoming chairman, Paul Atkins, is poised to take over. Once he arrives, though, Uyeda and fellow Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, a crypto advocate, will still be on board.

The Republican commissioners noted crypto platforms' interest in handling both traditionally SEC-regulated activity and business outside the agency's scope, all under the same roof.

"What can and should we do in the short term, and what should Congress consider in the longer term to ensure that the regulatory gaps are filled as firms increasingly seek to combine securities and non-securities trading activity?" asked Peirce, who leads the SEC Crypto Task Force.

The SEC's sole Democratic commissioner, Caroline Crenshaw, argued that some of the market disruptions and company failures in the recent past have forced industry observers to become "painfully aware of the mismatch between investors expectations and reality."

"Crypto trading platforms are unique because, among other reasons, they often perform multiple services under one roof, sometimes including bridge clearing and custody," said Crenshaw. In traditional finance, those kinds of functions are "typically performed by separate registered entities," because they come with a "high risk of conflicts of interest and risks for investors."

 President Donald Trump has overturned the IRS's DeFi broker rule, a measure that had threatened to curb DeFi innovation. 

In a significant win for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, US President Donald Trump overturned the Internal Revenue Service's DeFi broker rule, which would have expanded existing reporting requirements to include DeFi platforms.

Increasing US crypto regulatory clarity will attract more tech giants to the space, requiring existing crypto projects to focus on more collaborative tokenomics to survive, according to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson.

Trump signed a joint congressional resolution overturning a Biden administration-era rule that would have required DeFi protocols to report transactions to the Internal Revenue Service.

Set to take effect in 2027, the IRS DeFi broker rule would have expanded the tax authority's existing reporting requirements to include DeFi platforms, requiring them to disclose gross proceeds from crypto sales, including information regarding taxpayers involved in the transactions.

Trump formally killed the measure by signing off on the resolution on April 10, marking the first time a crypto bill has been signed into US law, Representative Mike Carey, who backed the bill, said in a statement.

“The DeFi Broker Rule needlessly hindered American innovation, infringed on the privacy of everyday Americans, and was set to overwhelm the IRS with an overflow of new filings that it doesn't have the infrastructure to handle during tax season,” he said.

The next generation of cryptocurrency projects must embrace a more collaborative approach to compete with major centralized tech companies entering the Web3 space, according to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson.

Speaking at Paris Blockchain Week 2025, Hoskinson said one of the main criticisms of the crypto and DeFi space is its “circular economy,” which often means that the rally of a specific cryptocurrency is bolstered by funds exiting another token, limiting the growth of the whole industry.

Hoskinsin said that to have a chance against the centralized technology giants joining the Web3 industry, cryptocurrency projects need more collaborative tokenomics and market structure.

“The problem right now, with the way we've done things in the cryptocurrency space, is the tokenomics and the market structure are intrinsically adversarial. It's sum 0,” said Hoskinson. “Instead of picking a fight, what you have to do is you have to find tokenomics and market structure that allows you to be in a cooperative equilibrium.”

He argued that the current environment often sees one crypto project's growth come at the expense of another rather than contributing to the sector's overall health. He added that this is not sustainable in the face of trillion-dollar firms like Apple, Google and Microsoft, which may soon join the Web3 race amid clearer US regulations.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are often praised for offering around-the-clock trading access, but that constant availability may have contributed to a steep sell-off over the weekend following the latest US trade tariff announcement.

Unlike stocks and traditional financial instruments, Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies enable payments and trading opportunities 24/7 thanks to the accessibility of blockchain technology.

After a record-breaking $5 trillion was wiped from the S&P 500 over two days — the worst drop on record — Bitcoin remained above the $82,000 support level. But by Sunday, the asset had plummeted to under $75,000.

Sunday's correction may have occurred due to Bitcoin being the only large tradable asset over the weekend, according to Lucas Outumuro, head of research at crypto intelligence platform IntoTheBlock. 

“There was a bit of optimism last week that Bitcoin might be uncorrelating and fairing better than traditional stocks, but the [correction] did accelerate over the weekend,” Outumuro said during Cointelegraph's Chainreaction live show on X, adding:

Outumuro noted that Bitcoin's weekend trading can also have upside effects, as prices often rally in calmer conditions.

Bybit's market share rebounded to pre-hack levels following a $1.4 billion exploit in February, as the crypto exchange implemented tighter security and improved liquidity options for retail traders.

The crypto industry was rocked by the largest hack in its history on Feb. 21, when Bybit lost over $1.4 billion in liquid-staked Ether (stETH), Mantle Staked ETH (mETH) and other digital assets.

Despite the scale of the exploit, Bybit has steadily regained market share, according to an April 9 report by crypto analytics firm Block Scholes.

“Since this initial decline, Bybit has steadily regained market share as it works to repair sentiment and as volumes return to the exchange,” the report stated.

Block Scholes said Bybit's proportional share rose from a post-hack low of 4% to about 7%, reflecting a strong and stable recovery in spot market activity and trading volumes.

The hack occurred amid a “broader trend of macro de-risking that began prior to the event,” which signaled that Bybit's initial decline in trading volume was not solely due to the exploit.

Almost 400,000 creditors of the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX risk missing out on $2.5 billion in repayments after failing to begin the mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process.

About 392,000 FTX creditors have failed to complete or at least take the first steps of the mandatory Know Your Customer verification, according to an April 2 court filing in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.

FTX users originally had until March 3 to begin the verification process to collect their claims.

“If a holder of a claim listed on Schedule 1 attached thereto did not commence the KYC submission process with respect to such claim on or prior to March 3, 2025, at 4:00 pm (ET) (the “KYC Commencing Deadline”), 2 such claim shall be disallowed and expunged in its entirety,” the filing states.

The KYC deadline has since been extended to June 1, giving users another chance to verify their identity and claim eligibility. Those who fail to meet the new deadline may have their claims permanently disqualified.

According to the court documents, claims under $50,000 may account for about $655 million in disallowed repayments, while claims over $50,000 could amount to $1.9 billion, bringing the total at-risk funds to more than $2.5 billion.

BlackRock's spot digital asset-focused funds generated net inflows for a fifth consecutive quarter, but the value of those assets tumbled by 9% as the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum slumped, the company said in its latest earnings release.

As of March 31, the world's largest asset manager held $50.3 billion worth in ETF digital assets, about $5 billion less than in the previous quarter, according to the release.

Still, among asset managers, BlackRock remained the leader in inflows with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) adding $2.7 billion and $548 million in inflows, respectively, during the quarter. The combined $3.1 billion represents about 3% of net flows into BlackRock's products in Q1. BlackRock currently has 463 products listed on the U.S. stock market, according to Stock Analysis.

As of Friday, BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF had nearly three times the AUM of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, totalling $45 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. BlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF had an AUM of $1.8 billion, less than the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF's $3.46 billion footprint, although the latter is a conversion from an existing fund and has shed $4.1 billion since its ETF debut. 

Still, investors had less of an appetite for BlackRock's crypto products in the first quarter amid a largely risk-off environment. Over the past 12 months, BlackRock's crypto ETFs generated $30 billion worth of net inflows, averaging around $7.5 billion per quarter. IBIT has added about $39 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024. 

The price of Bitcoin fell 12% in the first quarter, representing the asset's worst performance since the second quarter of last year. Ethereum's price meanwhile collapsed 45%,its biggest plunge since Q2 2022), but BlackRock's crypto ETFs still generated inflows.

BlackRock, which first tapped Coinbase as a custodian for its crypto ETFs, recently turned to Anchorage Digital. BlackRock disclosed in filings earlier this week that it would now lean on the digital assets trust bank as an additional option for safeguarding digital assets.

Traditional U.S. assets are going haywire as U.S.-China trade tensions continue to rattle global markets, now coupled with fresh data of tumbling sentiment towards the U.S. economy and mounting inflation concerns.



The most recent University of Michigan survey, published on Friday, found that consumer sentiment fell to 50.8 from 57.0, nearing the most depressed level in three years and far below that seen during the 2020 Covid shutdowns. Year-ahead inflation expectations surged to 6.7%, up from 5% in the prior month and the highest read since 1981.



On the back of the data, investors resumed selling long-term U.S. government bonds and the greenbacks, two assets traditionally considered as safe havens. The 10-year Treasury yield soared above 4.55% during U.S. morning hours, up more than 50 basis points in just a week. Meanwhile the dollar index (DXY) sank below 100 to a three-year low. Gold, meanwhile, hit a fresh record of $3,240 per ounce.



After a wildly volatile past few sessions, U.S. stocks were trading in a far tighter range on both sides of unchanged on Friday. At press time, the Nasdaq was higher by 0.6%



Meanwhile, cryptocurrency markets were moving higher, with bitcoin (BTC) holding just above $82,000, gaining 4% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was up 3%, with altcoin majors Solana's SOL, Avalanche's AVAX leading with 6% gains.







While some macroeconomic analysts are fearful that the recent surge in government bond yields is threatening the future outlook of the U.S. economy, others believe investors are reading too much into short-term market swings.



"U.S. dollars and U.S. government debt, two of the market's most liquid safe haven categories, are going haywire," Noelle Achison, analyst and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said in a Friday note. "This is not the case for other safe havens, however, just those directly tied to the U.S."



“I believe that it is much more likely that recent sharp moves in these asset classes is due to highly leveraged market participants being forced out of positions than due to fundamentals,” said billionaire investor Bill Ackmann in a post on X.



“Technical factors are driving the dramatic market moves," Ackman continued. "As a result, markets have become increasingly unreliable as short-term indicators of the impact of policy changes."

So far this year, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has erased the gains it made in 2024 and has been on the hardest receiving end (among major altcoins) of the crypto sell-off we've witnessed in the past month. For comparison, on a YTD basis, ETH has lost ~55%, Bitcoin (

Momentum trading among smaller cryptocurrencies know as “altcoins” is rising in the current market volatility, according to data from platform PowerTrade.

Traders and investors are reportedly hedging their bets and speculating on opportunities with cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL). Trading volume in XRP options soared to over $5 million in the last week as the market see-sawed between gains and losses.

PowerTrade says most of the trading activity remains concentrated in short-dated expirations, which one would expect given the current level of volatility in crypto and stocks. The action suggests that investors are anticipating significant short-term price movements and are trying to capitalize on sharp price swings up and down.

Amid the current volatility, XRP's price fell to a five-month low of $1.61 earlier this week only to bounce back to $2, according to market data. Traders are betting on whether an asset such as a cryptocurrency's price will rise or fall in a short period of time.

The current market ups and downs have enabled traders to bet on, and capitalize from, short swings in prices. PowerTrade says the current activity shows people are engaging in short-term “momentum trading,” which are bets on quick price moves among the likes of Dogecoin.

The price of DOGE is currently at $0.16, having declined 52% on the year.

Most analysts don't offer ratings or price targets on Dogecoin, so instead we'll look at the cryptocurrencies three-month performance. As one can see in the chart below, the price of DOGE has fallen 53% in the last 12 weeks.

April 11th, 2025 – Dublin, Ireland



Headquartered in Ireland with recognized legal status under EU law, the Foundation is positioned as a global nonprofit entity committed to reshaping the future of public trust and sustainable development by bridging governments, civil society, and the tech community.

The Foundation's governance is led by a distinguished board of directors composed of former heads of state from Europe. The board is chaired by Bertie Ahern, former three-term Prime Minister of Ireland and a key architect of the Good Friday Agreement. Board members include Lawrence Gonzi (former Prime Minister of Malta), Péter Medgyessy (former Prime Minister of Hungary), Danilo Türk (former President of Slovenia), and Petar Stoyanov (former President of Bulgaria).

The Foundation is actively expanding its global advisory board, bringing together respected figures from all five continents—including former presidents, scientists, diplomats, and cultural leaders—to guide strategic planning and foster international collaboration in delivering impactful social initiatives.

At the heart of the Foundation's mission lies a commitment to public good: advancing global efforts in education, healthcare, environmental protection, and humanitarian aid. The Foundation aims to build a “verifiable model of cooperative goodwill,” powered by transparent governance and next-generation technology. As its founders emphasize, “It is not a specific technology that changes the world—but the shared consensus around trustworthy institutions and global cooperation.”

AB Charity Foundation is technically supported by AB DAO, which provides the blockchain infrastructure underpinning the Foundation's operations. Through smart contract automation, 15% to 30% of the gas fees from every transaction on the AB public chain are directed into a dedicated charity pool. This mechanism enables a new operational model for charitable funding—combining on-chain fundraising, automated distribution, full-chain auditability, and third-party compliance assurance.

In addition, 15% to 30% of the returns generated from investments by the AB Ecosystem Fund will also be directed into the Foundation's pool. The fund has already supported dozens of projects, with more initiatives in the pipeline—strengthening the financial sustainability of the Foundation's mission.

By leveraging blockchain's inherent transparency, the Foundation aspires to become a scalable model for next-generation philanthropic infrastructure—ensuring every donation is traceable, every distribution verifiable, and every intention honored.

Digital assets transactions from Bitcoin, XRP, other cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) must be reported on taxpayer's tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service says that income from digital assets like Bitcoin and other tokens is taxable.

Millions of Americans use cryptocurrency. About 17% of U.S. adults say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency, according to 2024 findings from the Pew Research Center.

As tax season nears its end, here's what to know about reporting report crypto such as Bitcoin to the IRS.

The IRS says that individuals who sold crypto, received it as payment, or had other digital asset transactions must accurately report it on their tax return.

This includes convertible virtual currency and cryptocurrency, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For tax purposes, the agency treats digital assets as property, not currency.

The "Yes" or "No" digital assets question listed on federal income tax returns must be answered correctly:

"At any time during the tax year, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?"

According to an IRS, you answer "yes" if you received digital assets (crypto, Bitcoin, NFTs) as payment for property or services, from a reward or award, from mining, staking and similar activities, and more criteria.

If you're unsure how to respond to the digital assets question, the IRS provides a questionnaire to help determine how to answer it. Generally, if you had any digital asset transactions, you check "yes," but if not, you check "no."

Everyone who files must answer the digital asset question that appears at the top of these forms:

Taxpayers must report all income related to their digital asset transactions, the IRS notes, regardless of whether they result in a taxable gain or loss. Here's what the agency recommends when reporting crypto and other digital asset transactions.

The general deadline to file a federal return with the IRS is just days away, on April 15, 2025. For state taxes, the deadline in Ohio is also April 15, with an extension filing deadline of October 15, 2025.

A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst is leaning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins over the “very short-term.”

The analyst pseudonymously known as Capo tells his 950,600 followers on the social media platform X that following the decision by US President Donald Trump to pause on America's global trading partners.

Bitcoin could rally by up to 22% from the current level while altcoins could skyrocket by up to 2x over the next few days.

“After the 90-day pause on tariffs, the market is reacting well. BTC could move towards the $92,000 – $98,000 zone. Many altcoins could bounce 50% – 100%.”

Bitcoin is trading at $80,420 at time of writing.

The pseudonymous analyst, however, says that over the next few weeks, there's a “decent chance” the crypto market will witness another capitulation.

“Whether triggered by renewed tariff talk or something else (another pandemic scare, or escalating conflict), we'll need to adapt as things develop. But the probability is high.”

After another round of capitulation, Capo says that altcoins could then witness a bullish trend over the next few months.

“Some altcoins might break highs, others won't. But prices are now very oversold, and returns could be very good. Even if a black swan hits, that would only improve the accumulation zones forming since late March.”

According to the pseudonymous analyst, the Bitcoin bull market could end in the third quarter, with the bear market likely to start in September this year.

“This is where things could get really ugly. Like I've said before, this “bull market” never felt like a real bull market. BTC was pushed up artificially by [exchange-traded funds] ETFs and USDT/USDC minting. Meanwhile, many altcoins are still near their lows. This disconnect is concerning.

September might be a key pivot.”

The Program on Entrepreneurship caught up with alum Edison Siu, whose company, Solo, aims to contribute to a more human-centric internet.

Last week, SOM hosted the second annual Yale Blockchain Conference. The conference featured panels from a number of industry experts and alums. Included in the lineup was SOM alum and keynote speaker Edison Siu, who organized the first Blockchain Conference at Yale in 2024 and returned to speak about his company, Solo. Founded in 2024. Solo is a blockchain company that focuses on enhancing user verification within the Web3 ecosystem.

The Program on Entrepreneurship caught up with Edison in the wake of the conference to discuss his journey.

What inspired you to start Solo? Was there a specific problem or moment that sparked the idea?

The idea for Solo was sparked during a blockchain course I took at Yale, taught by Professor Ben Fisch. One lecture focused on Worldcoin and its attempt to create a “proof-of-humanity” system using biometric orbs. That discussion opened my eyes to a fundamental need in the Web3 ecosystem—verifying real human users in a decentralized way.

I was fascinated by the implications. While Worldcoin's approach was bold, it raised serious concerns around hardware centralization, privacy, and regulatory compliance. I started to wonder: is there a way to build a system that verifies human uniqueness without relying on centralized infrastructure?

That question led me to discuss the concept with two brilliant minds—my now co-founders, Professor Sissi Wu, an AI expert focused on user behavior analytics, and Professor Stephen Wang, a specialist in zero-knowledge cryptography and blockchain architecture. Together, we envisioned a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution for continuous humanity verification—one that didn't rely on proprietary hardware, but could instead leverage widely accessible mobile devices.

What started as a classroom curiosity quickly evolved into a mission. The more we explored, the more we realized that Sybil attacks were crippling real-world applications across Web3—from airdrops and governance to data labeling and DePIN. Solo was born to address this gap. Our goal is to build a scalable, secure, and user-friendly proof-of-humanity protocol that enables what we call “credible anonymity”—a future where users can remain anonymous, yet accountable, in the new internet.

Can you walk us through your background before launching Solo? Have you always been in tech or crypto?

My journey into crypto started back in 2017 when I was involved in the “Kimchi Premium” arbitrage - one of the early opportunities that highlighted the inefficiencies and potential of the global crypto markets. In 2018, I transitioned into a more structured role, leading marketing for one of the first licensed crypto exchanges in Asia. That experience gave me exposure to both the regulatory landscape and the importance of user trust in building Web3 infrastructure.

Later, while pursuing my MBA at Yale, I led the SOM Blockchain Club and co-organized the first-ever Yale Blockchain Conference in 2024. Through that experience, I deepened my understanding of the ecosystem from both a technical and policy perspective, and also connected with many researchers and builders working at the intersection of crypto and real-world use cases.

These experiences laid the foundation for Solo—combining my passion for crypto with a mission to bring scalable, privacy-preserving identity infrastructure to Web3.

What does success look like to you personally, and has that definition changed over time?

To me, success means creating real, lasting impact on society—building something that doesn't just generate returns, but fundamentally improves how people live, connect, and interact. This definition of success became much clearer after I joined the Yale MBA program, where the school's mission of “educating leaders for business and society” deeply resonated with me. It reinforced my belief that entrepreneurship should serve a broader purpose. With Solo, we're not just building another Web3 tool—we're aiming to redefine digital identity and enable more fair, secure, and human-centered systems. That, to me, is what success looks like.

What has been your biggest technical challenge so far, and how did your team overcome it?

One of our biggest technical challenges was building a biometric verification system that is fully decentralized while still protecting user privacy. Most existing solutions either rely on centralized hardware or expose sensitive user data during the process. We wanted Solo to be different—something that works on any mobile device, proves each user is a real, unique person, and preserves privacy at every step.

To overcome this, we combined advanced cryptographic tools like homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to verify users while preserving their biometric data. This required close collaboration between our team's expertise in cryptography, blockchain systems, and AI. It took months of iteration and testing, but we ultimately created a scalable and privacy-preserving architecture that can support real-world use cases across Web3.

What is your biggest milestone that you've reached to date?

Our biggest milestone to date has been securing integration partnerships with a strong lineup of high-impact Web3 projects, including Sapien, Perle AI, GEODNET, Synesis One, and PublicAI. Each of these partners operates in domains where proof-of-humanity is critical—whether it's data labeling, decentralized mapping, or AI alignment—and they've chosen to work with Solo to ensure their user base is made up of real, verified humans, not bots. These agreements not only validate the need for our solution but also give us a direct path to acquiring tens of thousands of users from day one.

In parallel, we closed our pre-seed funding round led by Draper Associates and joined by Velocity Capital. We're also fortunate to have the backing and guidance of some of the best minds in the space, including Brian Retford (Founder of RISC Zero), Ahmed Rashed (Founder of Perle AI and former Head of Growth at Scale AI), and Matt Katz (Founder of Caldera). Their support affirms our technical and strategic direction and gives us a unique edge in executing our vision.

Together, these partnerships and backing have given Solo both the credibility and momentum to become the foundational layer for identity in Web3.

How do you see Solo contributing to building a more human-centered internet?

Solo contributes to building a more human-centered internet by ensuring that every digital interaction is tied to a real, unique person—without compromising privacy. In today's internet, bots distort online communities, drain resources from real users, and undermine trust in digital ecosystems. Solo solves this by enabling decentralized biometric verification that is both privacy-preserving and scalable, so users can prove they are human without revealing who they are.

Our long-term vision is to enable “credible anonymity,” where users can remain pseudonymous while building verifiable reputations and being held accountable for their actions. This foundational layer of trust unlocks an entirely new form of the Web3 economy—one where users can access uncollateralized loans, meaningful credit scoring, and personalized recommendations, all without sacrificing their privacy. It also allows individuals to retain ownership of their data, choosing when and how it's shared or monetized. By anchoring digital identity in privacy-preserving but verifiable human authenticity, Solo paves the way for a more equitable, secure, and human-first internet.

What advice would you give to other founders working at the edge of privacy tech, crypto, and AI?

Stay focused on solving a real human problem - technology should be in service of that. At the intersection of privacy, crypto, and AI, it's easy to get caught up in hype or complexity. But the winning solutions are the ones that are not only technically sound, but also usable, compliant, and clearly aligned with user needs. Build with privacy as a core design principle, not as an afterthought, and surround yourself with collaborators who bring both technical depth and ethical clarity. And most importantly—stay resilient. The frontier is where it's hardest, but also where the biggest impact is made.

In the last 24 hours, according to data from Tradingview, the crypto market has recorded surprising performances: some altcoins have posted triple-digit increases, awakening the interest of investors and analysts.

Among these, Marso.Tech, HIRO, and StupidCoin stand out, with growths of +643.63%, +603.93%, and +279.47% respectively.

Summary

Marso.Tech (MARSO), with a growth of +643.63%, dominates the ranking. The crypto has a price of 0.000075850 USD and a contained market capitalization (764,000 USD), with a circulating supply of over 10 billion tokens. Despite the scarcity of information about the project, speculative interest seems high, typical of micro-cap.

Follows HIRO, with a +603.93%. Here too we are talking about a crypto at a very low price (0.000411299 USD) and with an even smaller market cap (93,070 USD). The high relative volume (over 34,000 USD in the last 24h) indicates an unusual trading flow, often a symptom of temporary pumps.

The meme coin continue to surprise. StupidCoin records a +279.47% with a market cap of 1.8 million USD and almost a billion tokens in circulation. The dynamics are similar to those seen with Dogecoin or Shiba Inu: large community, viral narrative, and movement on social media.

Similar is the case for Jerry, which marks a +168.72% and even has 1 billion tokens in circulation. The capitalization, however, is more limited (645,210 USD), making the token particularly exposed to short-term manipulations.

BurgerCities (BURGER) grows by +184.76% and stands out from the others due to a more solid base: capitalization of 1.4 million USD and presence in the DeFi and decentralized gaming sector. The daily trading volume is remarkable (almost 600,000 USD), indicating a growing interest in play-to-earn projects.

Another example is Kryptomon (KMON), with a +110.08% and a hybrid category between gaming, NFT and collectibles. Even though the unit price is low (0.00026884 USD), the circulating supply (189 million) and the contained market capitalization (51,000 USD) make it a high-risk bet.

The current price explosion in many small cap and meme coin could represent the beginning of a new speculative phase:

However, this scenario depends on a favorable macro condition and the maintenance of positive sentiment, which currently remains fragile.

On the other hand, there are signals that evoke speculative dynamics typical of bubbles:

In this context, enthusiasm can quickly turn into panic, especially if Bitcoin were to correct or negative news were to emerge from regulatory authorities.

The crypto market continues to prove highly volatile and full of surprises. The extreme performances of Marso.Tech, HIRO, and other altcoins highlight the return of speculation, especially in the meme coin sector and low-capitalization projects.

However, it is important to distinguish between momentary movements and structural trends. The coming days will be crucial to understand if we are at the beginning of a new expansionary cycle or simply in a short speculative rally.

              South Korea leads in digital asset takeover within the last ten years. A cocktail of technological advancement, young investors, and a connected society created a breeding ground for trading practices.
            

The digital financial landscape has changed constantly with South Korea being at a crossroads. The country-long regarded as the most enthusiastic adopter of blockchain technology and digital assets-is now tightening its regulatory grip. From being a refuge for tech-savvy investors, the West has become somewhat of a battleground for innovation versus regulation. The crackdown on cryptos in South Korea is not only an internal change of policy; it is a broader reflection of the true conflict between financial freedom and systemic security around the globe.

Among the pack, South Korea leads in digital asset takeover within the last ten years. A cocktail of technological advancement, young investors, and a connected society created a breeding ground for trading practices. For many of Korea's youth, digital assets came to symbolize not only a financial instrument, but also an economic opportunity in an otherwise unfair society where avenues of traditional wealth—like real estate—seemed permanently closed.

It raised alarm bells concerning rapid growth in trading volume and speculation. It attracted money-laundering, tax evasion, and increased absence of proper investor protection. Also, open-ended markets, lack of transparency, and cyber threats just continued shaking trust. What once considered the booming frontier now began showing signs of fragility.

The government of South Korea would have to respond with increasing urgency by launching a series of legislative and regulatory measures aimed at tightening the government's nosebleed level of oversight. This shift denoted the beginning of a new chapter-the one in which unchecked innovation need no longer be tolerated.

While much of the world continues to debate under which laws to treat digital assets, South Korea has taken a more proactive approach. The regulatory bodies began developing a tailored framework that explicitly delineated the responsibilities of market participants, including mandatory registration of trading platforms, extensive anti-money laundering measures, and disclosure requirements aimed at enhancing transparency.

Together with the preliminary legislative moves, the authorities proposed licensing schemes that required operators to comply with traditional financial standards. In its nature, this went beyond the punitive—this was also about legitimizing the space. By raising the threshold, South Korea would look to push out malefactors and create a fertile ground for responsible development.

Reactions were mixed toward such policies. Clarity was welcomed by some; over-regulation, they felt, would come in the way of innovation and push developers and investors away to jurisdictions with lighter regulations. Hence, the regulators' task remained to demarcate the line to allow for enough security while not curtailing progress.

Clarity was welcomed by some; over-regulation, they felt, would come in the way of innovation and push developers and investors away to jurisdictions with lighter regulations. Hence, the regulators' task remained to demarcate the line to allow for enough security while not curtailing progress.

Something South Korea decides in crypto will echo far beyond its borders. It happens to be one of the most technologically advanced economies in Asia, and thus its policy decisions often serve as a model-or cautionary tale-for its neighbors.

The neighboring countries are looking on. Some countries might emulate South Korea's stringent approach, viewing it as a necessary step toward legitimizing an outright industry. Others may take a more laissez-faire stance, hoping to attract talent and capital through lighter regulatory treatment.

Of course, the danger with any disunity in regulation is that it invites arbitrage, so that actors simply migrate to jurisdictions with the fewest restrictions. This underscores the need for greater international collaboration towards harmonization of the regulatory landscape-and this is easier said than done.

Regulatory and innovation contradictions are inherent in their nature, for as they create an environment free of scam and stabilize the market, it hinders sometimes free innovations or developments. The new regime comes with two-edged swords when this applies to developers and entrepreneurs in South Korea. Some appreciated the clarity it brings, so they use it as a springboard to a more robust and compliant platform. Others, meanwhile, argue that these two impediments and costs of compliance weigh heavily on small players and on startups, giving rise to the feeling that in the end, only the largest might have the resources to survive, reducing competition.

These, however, are big assumptions in contrary of the historical record, quite resilient has been the technology sector in South Korea. The same country that created some of the finest technological innovations in the world may just somehow adapt or survive, even against heavier regulation.

It is not the closing of the road, but rather a calibration. South Korea knows what to do as authorities learn, adjust and evolve with the environment. Coming changes in regulation will bridge other gaps such as decentralized platforms, digital national identity validation, and cross-border cooperation.

Most importantly, a balancing act is needed as any regulatory change is put in place-the extremes of either having too much oversight or too little. Too tight will kill the country's perhaps most innovative financial sector in history, while too lax will leave serious and devastating risks for citizens. Given its reputation for forward-thinking governance and high technological agility, South Korea is poised perfectly to strike the balance.

It may be able to protect this market and even shape the future of digital finance in Asia and other parts of the globe.

This year's Bitcoin price prediction targets $250K – but is this viable? And if so, what's the best altcoin to buy to make the most of it?

Charles Hoskinson thinks it will.

His perspective – decidedly bullish – neatly supports more technical factors that indicate $BTC, even if it falls further, could be near the end of a correction phase and ready to start another upwards surge.

With bullish predictions growing adoption, $BTC's path to $250K is taking shape. Here's how MIND of Pepe ($MIND) could capitalize on the Bitcoin run and reap major rewards for early investors.

Bitcoin is once again commanding bullish headlines. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, shared his Bitcoin price prediction, saying it will hit $250K in 2025 or early 2026.

He based his prediction on broader market factors – more on that later – but his instincts align nicely with more technical indicators.

First, the bad news: the market's recent turmoil led to a mass round of liquidations, dropping the Open Interest (OI) to market cap ratio from 17% to just over 10%.



Liquidations took a lot of positions, and a lot of investors and market players, off the board. That likely concentrated the market slightly.

But that leads to the good news: the remaining market should be much healthier, with many bad positions gone could be ready to make big moves

Analysts on X, notably Sina of 21st Capital, estimate that $BTC has completed over 75% of a possible correction. He notes that macro-economic conditions are uncertain, and a true recession (defined as two consecutive quarters with no economic growth) would throw off his analysis.

But barring that, the low end for $BTC would be $90K by the end of 2026.

If the bottom is truly in for $BTC, and the rebound is incoming, is $250K just around the corner?

Or will Trump's tariff turmoil throw things off?

For the record, Charles Hoskinson doesn't think the Trump tariffs will ultimately impact Bitcoin's momentum.

In a bold statement on CNBC, Charles Hoskinson claimed $BTC is poised to hit new heights on the back of macroeconomic tailwinds and increasing global stablecoin adoption.

And Hoskinson doesn't think the tariffs will ultimately have too much impact.

‘The markets will stabilize a little bit, and they'll get used to the new normal, and then the Fed will lower interest rates, and then you'll have a lot of fast, cheap money, and then it'll pour into crypto.'

The ‘new normal,' Hoskinson noted, will return to an earlier era of geopolitics. Great powers will throw their weight around more, global trade networks will be restructured. The current international order will be replaced by great power networks

That would turn $BTC, stablecoins, best altcoins, and most of the crypto economy into far more than a cool financial innovation. They would instantly be the cornerstones of a new financial network, capable of transcending competing nations and fiat networks.

No wonder Hoskinson's Bitcoin price prediction targets $250K; if he's right, that could be only the beginning.

What if $BTC does reach $250K? If the bull run starts, and you don't own $BTC – or don't hold enough of it – how can you capitalize on its gains?

Look for the best altcoins and the best meme coins that could follow $BTC's upward momentum. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) will launch an autonomous agent on X to interact directly with crypto analysts and make its own crypto predictions.

Not only that, but MIND will also be able to interact directly with the blockchain. Eventually, that means the AI agent will be able to launch its own tokens, exclusively for $MIND token holders.

Will MIND of Pepe be able to out-predict and out-analyze Charles Hoskinson, who co-founded Ethereum, has a decade of crypto experience (a virtual lifetime in crypto terms), and is also behind Cardano, a Top Ten crypto with a market cap of $22B?

Only time will tell. But MIND of Pepe can build on the meme coin star power of Pepe, combined with cutting-edge AI technology.



The roadmap leverages AI to its fullest, deploying a fully-autonomous AI agent, and even allocating a full 25% of the total token supply to the AI's control.

Intrigued? Learn how to buy MIND of Pepe in our guide, and see why we think the token's price can hit $0.00535 by the end of the year. You can also follow the project on X and Telegram, and join the ranks of early investors who earn an impressive 284% staking APY during the presale.

Visit the presale page to learn more.

If Bitcoin price prediction is right and it truly is heading toward $250K, the best altcoins will stand to gain the most, including top trending crypto with a low market cap yet high growth potential like $MIND.

With exclusive insights, MIND of Pepe could give $MIND token holders a much-needed leg up on a competitive, bullish market.

Of course, always do your own research. This is not financial advice, and the crypto market remains highly volatile.

Bitcoin has swung wildly over the last week as traders ride U.S. president Donald Trump's tariff rollercoaster (with Michael Saylor's Strategy issuing a shock warning).

Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes' CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!"

The bitcoin price is holding up following the latest tariff shots fired by Trump and China after plunging along with stock markets in early April—even as Wall Street grapples with a looming “existential threat” from crypto.

Now, while traders bet on a Federal Reserve game-changer, the bitcoin price is braced for a dollar "confidence crisis" as the ICE U.S. dollar index plummets to its worst day since 2022.

U.S. president Donald Trump is grappling with a growing U.S. dollar "crisis of confidence" that some ... More think could boost the bitcoin price.

“The question of a potential dollar confidence crisis has now been definitively answered—we are experiencing one in full force,” ING analysts including Francesco Pesole wrote in a note seen by Bloomberg. “The dollar collapse is working as a barometer of ‘sell America' at the moment.”

The escalating Trump-led global trade war saw the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of global currencies, fall sharply this week, dropping under the 100 level and putting it on course to return to its 2022 range.

“The market is re-assessing the structural attractiveness of the dollar as the world's global reserve currency and is undergoing a process of rapid de-dollarisation,” Deutsche Bank's global head of FX research George Saravelos wrote in a note seen by City AM.

The dollar's decline is seen by some as boosting the bitcoin price as traders bet bitcoin will follow in gold's footsteps, performing as a safe haven asset.

"Like a rising tide, the dollar's decline is lifting other assets," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments, adding “a falling dollar supports cryptocurrencies.”

The bitcoin price has dropped from its all-time high in recent weeks but has outperformed the ... More tech-heavy Nasdaq as the U.S. dollar suffers a "crisis" of confidence.

“Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities may have garnered excessive attention, while its ties to Federal Reserve policy and the U.S. dollar's trajectory deserve greater scrutiny,” LMax Group's market strategist Joel Kruger said via email.

Trump has been pushing Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates as he embarks on his global trade war, fuelling expectations the Fed could be forced to cut interest rates through 2025, either in response to a tariff-led economic slow down or because Trump has fired Powell.

“Market dynamics are shifting as the Fed's outlook adjusts to pressures from U.S. trade policy, with expectations of steeper rate cuts in 2025 now taking hold. This pivot toward a more accommodative stance is poised to narrow yield differentials, weakening the dollar's appeal and, in turn, creating a supportive tailwind for bitcoin," Kruger said.

Buterin advocates for integrating privacy tools in wallets and proposes dApp-specific addresses to limit user activity traceability.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a streamlined roadmap to enhance Layer-1 privacy on the blockchain network.

In a blog post on April 11, Buterin introduced a framework focused on improving user confidentiality without requiring significant changes to the network's core infrastructure.

The proposal targets four distinct areas of privacy, including making on-chain payments private, partially obscuring user actions within decentralized applications, hiding read-access data from the blockchain, and anonymizing network-level communications.

Buterin stated that if these upgrades are implemented, they could usher in a new standard in which private transactions become the default.

He continued that while individual dApp activity may remain visible, the link between a user's actions across multiple platforms would be obscured.

The Ethereum co-founder concluded that this approach would offer privacy from observers and infrastructure-level threats like compromised RPC nodes.

Buterin's proposal begins with integrating privacy tools such as Railgun directly into Ethereum wallets. He argued that this would let users manage shielded balances without relying on third-party wallets, making privacy more accessible by default.

According to him:

“There should be a ‘send from shielded balance' option, ideally turned on by default. This should all be designed to feel maximally natural from a UX perspective. Users should NOT have to download a separate ‘privacy wallet.'”

He also advocated for using a separate address for each dApp. While this approach could introduce user experience trade-offs, it significantly limits activity traceability across multiple applications.

To support this, send-to-self transactions must preserve privacy by default; a design Buterin views as necessary despite the added complexity.

Expanding on this, Buterin explained that such changes align well with existing efforts in cross-chain interoperability, where users already interact with various chains through separate workflows.

He pointed out that integrating these features into in-app wallets would help standardize private interactions without major architectural shifts.

Buterin also called for technical improvements, such as using TEE-based RPC privacy as a short-term solution and planning to transition to private information retrieval (PIR) when ready.

Additional recommendations include connecting each dApp to separate RPC nodes, advancing proof aggregation protocols, and supporting privacy-enhanced keystore wallets.

Oluwapelumi values Bitcoin's potential. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power.

In a detailed post shared this week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin introduced a new roadmap to significantly enhance user privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. 

This offers a structured path toward robust privacy features that require minimal changes to Ethereum's Layer-1 consensus, thus promising near-term benefits without overhauling the network's core.Layer-1 Unconditional Privacy

Buterin's proposal addresses four key areas: privacy of onchain payments, anonymization of onchain activity within applications, safeguarding private reads to the chain (such as RPC calls), and network-level obfuscation. 

My own current privacy roadmap (much lighter on L1 changes, but also more limited in its consequences): Highly encourage people to read both! — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) 

Rather than waiting on long-term innovations or radical protocol shifts, Buterin presents an incremental and implementable strategy that could fundamentally change the way Ethereum users experience privacy.

Crucially, he calls for Ethereum wallets to natively integrate privacy tools such as Railgun and Privacy Pools, enabling users to maintain a “shielded balance.” 

Transactions made from this balance would be private by default, streamlining the experience so that users no longer need specialized wallets to ensure confidentiality. 

Usability, Buterin argues, should not be sacrificed for privacy. Instead, privacy should be intuitive and seamless.

To eliminate traceable links between actions taken across different decentralized applications (dApps), Buterin advocates for the use of separate addresses per application by default. 

While this requires a trade-off in convenience, he believes it is essential to breaking the visible chain of associations that currently compromise user privacy.

Complementing this is a push for privacy-preserving self-transactions and the adoption of protocol-level tools like FOCIL and EIP-7701. 

Together, these standards would allow privacy-focused applications to function without the need for public transaction relays, which will bolster resistance to censorship.The Philosophical Shift Toward Unconditional Privacy

Vitalik's latest privacy proposal echoes a growing consensus within the Ethereum ecosystem on how privacy should be unconditional, not optional. 

He supports the view recently advanced by Ethereum developer pcaversaccio, who the current “opt-in” model of privacy as fundamentally flawed.Source: ethresear.ch

He argues that the current paradigm, where users must make deliberate choices, often at the expense of convenience and usability, to shield their activity, is not sustainable.

Instead, privacy must become the default, deeply embedded into Ethereum's protocol stack. 

Transactions, smart contracts, and user interactions should be confidential by design, not by exception. The network must be structured so that privacy isn't seen as suspicious but as standard.

Buterin's roadmap aligns with this sentiment, advocating for UX-first, protocol-assisted mechanisms that make private activity indistinguishable from public ones. 

The goal is to create an Ethereum that functions as a maximally private and self-sovereign financial system, not one where privacy is a luxury or afterthought.Scaling Layer-1: How Buterin's Broader Vision for Ethereum Supports Privacy and Resilience

Vitalik Buterin's focus on privacy is just one piece of a larger architectural puzzle he's been shaping throughout the year. 

In earlier statements, he stressed that Ethereum's future depends on both Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) improvements, a hybrid approach designed to balance scalability, decentralization, and resilience.

💻 During a Tako Q&A, broke down Ethereum's evolving structure, touching on L1 security, L2 expansion, and why flexibility is crucial for long-term blockchain sustainability. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) 

These changes, he said, would allow Ethereum to process more transactions without undermining its decentralized nature.

He cautioned, however, against a purely L2-centric strategy. For Ethereum to remain robust, it must retain a strong and scalable base layer.

This same resilience argument underpins his recent blog post advocating for a tenfold increase in L1 gas capacity. 

🔍 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes scaling Ethereum's gas by 10x, citing benefits for security, efficiency, and censorship resistance. The move could support seamless exits and lower transaction costs. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) 

While the network recently raised its L1 gas limit from 30 to 36 million (a 20% boost), Buterin believes further scaling is not only justified but essential. 

In this way, his push for privacy, scalability, and decentralization all converge toward a singular goal, which is an Ethereum that is secure, sovereign, and usable, not just for the technically elite, but for everyone.

Crypto is going through a bull market breakup. And now it's every blockchain for itself. 

Under the Biden administration, Gary Gensler, the former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was crypto's great unifier. Seen by the industry as an overzealous regulator, he encouraged American crypto firms to band together in a shared strategy: fight his agency's enforcement actions in court, and lobby for the passage of bills that would restrain him from doing more damage. 

“When everyone faces the choice of living or dying, everyone's on the same page: they want to live,” said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, newly-minted CEO of the Solana Policy Institute (SPI). 

But that is no longer the case, explains Whitehouse-Levine, as crypto has gotten virtually everything that it could have ever wanted in the last election. It now has a pro-crypto president, a Congress that is pushing through legislation with haste, and an SEC chairman in Paul Atkins, who once consulted for some of the very crypto firms he will be regulating. 

With their newfound power, different blockchain ecosystems are now shifting focus towards their own projects, where their interests don't always align. “It's only natural that disparate interests become more pronounced,” Whitehouse-Levine explained.

Everyone for Themself
In one prominent example, Coinbase wants a complex market structure bill more relevant for its business passed at the same time as a stablecoin bill, despite many other firms' concerns that such a bundling could delay the passage of any legislation. In the world of stablecoins, the $140 billion Tether is at odds with $45 billion competitor Circle over nuances in upcoming legislation, such as how these tokens would be regulated on secondary markets and reserve requirements governing how their tokens get collateralized. 
And sometimes, projects now just want to make sure that they have their own seat at the table to address critical issues that could impact their own futures. Ripple Labs, the primary developer behind the $114 billion XRP Ledger blockchain, has ruffled feathers by using its war chest to buy its own access to President Trump and Congress. Most recently the company even seeded its own policy group, the National Cryptocurrency Association, with a $50 million grant.
“Given the amount of money [Ripple's] spending, they're in every single room,” a source familiar with the Solana Policy Institute's thinking said, adding that they weren't aware of any developers building on the XRP Ledger that Ripple Labs could be advocating for. “I don't know what their objectives are other than perpetuating their business model [of selling XRP tokens into the market], if one wants to call it that.” 
With the SPI, Whitehouse-Levine says he aims to tip the scales in favor of Solana developers, whom he says are not well represented. “Ripple's done a lot over the last 10 years and awareness of them in Washington is pretty strong. We want to make sure there's a Solana-specific voice in the conversation,” he said. 
A representative for Ripple Labs did not comment on its lobbying efforts.

Solana Stretches Its Legs
Aside from the resetting of crypto's relations with Washington, the timing is right for Solana supporters to get more active in lobbying and advocacy. The $58 billion blockchain has staged a remarkable comeback from its price collapse after the 2022 bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX and the arrest of its most famous supporter, Sam Bankman-Fried. 
Its price surged 86% in 2024 on the back of a memecoin craze that defined the industry. However, there is a lot more activity occurring on the ultrafast, albeit somewhat centralized blockchain behind these speculative tokens. Some of the high-profile development onchain includes automated staking platform Marinade, music streaming platform Audius, and decentralized exchange platform Raydium. More than $6 billion is locked up in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms on Solana, up from $1.4 billion at the start of 2024. 
“There's a reason why memecoins happened on Solana. They happened on Solana because they could happen there,” explained Hadley Stern, chief commercial officer at Marinade. “The throughput that the Solana blockchain affords in terms of the ability to issue a token and trade it quickly, can only happen right now on Solana.”
SPI's Funding and Leadership
The Solana Policy Institute is a 501(c)4 nonprofit, a type of organization that is not required to disclose its donors. However, three sources in the Solana ecosystem said they understood the organization to be supported with funding from the Solana Foundation. The Solana Policy Institute declined to say the amount of funding they had, which organizations had donated, and which Solana ecosystem projects would be weighing in on their decisions. 
In order to achieve his mission, Whitehouse-Levine began hiring an influential team. Kristin Smith – who as CEO of the Blockchain Association was credited for growing the organization from a one-woman operation to a powerful membership org with influence that extended to the White House – will begin as president of the SPI in May. Colin McLaren, who played a key role in designing several highly influential attack ad campaigns against crypto-skeptical politicians and regulators last year at the Cedar Innovation Foundation, was recently hired as SPI's head lobbyist.

What the SPI Actually Wants
So what does the SPI hope to achieve? Right now the issues they're focused on, according to Whitehouse-Levine, will coincidentally still help developers of other DeFi ecosystems, like that on Ethereum. 
For example, the Institute would like the regulation of secondary markets transacting with stablecoins, like cryptocurrency exchanges or lending protocols, to be left to market structure bills rather than the GENIUS or STABLE Acts moving through the Senate and House. His fear is that a stablecoin bill could force arduous AML/KYC requirements on small-time developers who incorporate these tokens into their platforms, which would choke stablecoin adoption on Solana. 
Whitehouse-Levine said he would also like clearer guidelines in the bills describing how decentralized stablecoins are to be regulated, something which he says is ambiguous in the current texts and could hamper innovation if not made distinct from the reporting requirements for centralized stablecoins. 
These rules are particularly important for Solana, which has a small but growing share of the stablecoin market. More than half of the $232 billion stablecoin market resides on Ethereum. By comparison, Solana only has $12.5 billion, according to DeFiLlama. 
He is also concerned about forthcoming market structure legislation that could treat all crypto projects as financial applications due to the prominence of crypto trading. This could mistakenly force builders of non-financial applications into expensive and arduous compliance frameworks designed to lower financial risks they are not responsible for. Instead, a market structure bill like FIT21 should limit its focus to registrants in the markets, like custodians, dealers, brokers, or exchanges, Whitehouse-Levine argues.

But more than these immediate concerns, the SPI aims to make sure that they can advocate for the Solana blockchain without their message getting diluted or competing with the interests of dozens of other projects within prominent lobbying groups, such as the Digital Chamber or Blockchain Association (the Solana Foundation is a member of both). This could become increasingly important in the future as legislation moves forward and unknown challenges and opportunities await in the future.
In fact, Whitehouse-Levine expects many more blockchains and projects to follow his lead. When asked if he expects to see more blockchain ecosystems form their own policy organizations, Whitehouse-Levine said, “I hope so. We need the help.”

Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, has revealed the latest update to its “Assets Under Consideration” list for the second quarter of 2025. 

The list includes a diverse array of altcoins that could likely shape the firm's future offerings.

In this latest iteration, Grayscale's “Assets Under Consideration” list features 40 altcoins. The update indeed marks a significant overhaul of the firm's January 2025 list, which had 39 assets. Previously, 35 assets were included in the October 2024 version.

“We're excited to share this list of assets under consideration for inclusion in future Grayscale investment products,” the blog read.

One of the most notable changes is the removal of Kaspa from the list's currencies section. Notably, this update does not include any assets in this category. 

Additionally, Grayscale has excluded Sei, Sonic, and Starknet from the smart contract platforms category. The financials sector also saw some changes, with the asset manager dropping THORChain and Injective Protocol from the list. 

The Consumer and Culture category has also seen removals of Ai16z and Virtuals Protocol. Lastly, Grayscale has eliminated Flock.io, Hyperbolic, and Worldcoin from the Utilities and Services category. This reduction hints at the firm's recalibration of what it considers to be foundational utilities in the changing crypto sector.

Meanwhile, these removals have paved the way for the addition of several assets, including VeChain. It is now incorporated into the smart contract platforms category, signaling a growing interest in the project's potential. Moreover, Plume Network was spotted in Financials and Aixbt by Virtuals in Consumer and Culture.

Previously, Grayscale's Q2 2025 Top 20 list highlighted Maple Finance, Geodnet, and Story for their strong growth potential. IP, which was previously listed under Utilities and Services, has now been moved to the Consumer and Culture category. Meanwhile, SYRUP has been added to the Financials category, and GEOD has joined Utilities and Services.

Grayscale's Q2 2025 update also introduces several assets that have yet to be classified under the Grayscale crypto sectors framework. Among these new additions are Babylon, Berachain, Monad, Movement, Lombard, Mantra, Eliza, DeepBook, and Walrus. Prime Intellect, Sentient, Space, and Time, which were featured in the last list, are also included.

“We aim to update this list as frequently as 15 days after quarter-end as the crypto ecosystem expands and the Grayscale team reviews or reevaluates additional assets. The list below is as of April 10, 2025, and is subject to change intra-quarter as some multi-asset funds reconstitute and we launch new single-asset products,” Grayscale noted.

Furthermore, two assets that previously appeared on the list, Pyth Network (PYTH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have now joined Grayscale's product suite. On January 31, the asset manager launched the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust.

Shortly after, on February 18, Grayscale introduced its Pyth Trust. Thus, the market now watches closely to see which of the listed assets will transition from consideration to reality.

The cryptocurrency market cap dropped 2.80% in 24 hours to $2.54 trillion following President Donald Trump‘s sweeping tariff announcement, imposing a 145% duty on Chinese imports and a 10% universal tariff on most other goods.

On Thursday, Trump signed legislation nullifying a revised Internal Revenue Service rule that had expanded the definition of “broker” to include decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

The rule, finalized during former President Joe Biden‘s administration, was criticized by the crypto industry as unworkable for DeFi platforms that lack visibility into user identities. This action fulfills part of Trump's campaign promise to be a “crypto president.”

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index registered at 21, remaining in “Fear” territory for the second consecutive day, significantly down from November's yearly high of 88.

Over $297.81 million in crypto positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, affecting 101,191 traders. The largest single liquidation occurred on Binance's ETH-USDT pair, worth $11.85 million, according to CoinGlass.

Top Gainers (24-Hours)

Traditional markets reeled from Trump's announcement of a temporary 10% universal tariff on most imports and a 145% duty on Chinese goods.

In Thursday's session, the S&P 500, tracked by SPDR S&P 500 SPY, closed at 5,268, down 3.46% after plunging over 4% earlier in the day. The Nasdaq-100, tracked by Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, dropped 4.19% to 18,343. 

Futures extended the slide Thursday night, with Nasdaq-100 futures falling 1.26% to 18,251.75, S&P 500 futures down 1.04% to 5,247.00, and Dow futures slipping 0.88% to 39,448.00.

Metrics details

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is transforming healthcare by seamlessly connecting medical devices, wearables, and sensors to enable personalized, real-time health monitoring and treatment for consumers. As IoMT continues to advance, ensuring the security and privacy of transmitted data has become a critical concern. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance privacy and security, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical data within the Internet of Things. By integrating blockchain with IoT, secure transmission of medical data can be achieved, paving the way for improved healthcare services, enhanced consumer privacy, and accelerated medical advancements. In this paper, we propose EHRGuard: Enhancing Privacy and Security of Electronic Health Records through Blockchain Technology. EHRGuard is a novel system that leverages blockchain technology to address key challenges in the management of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), with a focus on improving privacy, security, and interoperability in healthcare data systems for consumers. The framework utilizes the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to collect real-time health data from consumers through sensors and integrates blockchain technology to ensure data anonymity, security, and integrity. By combining IoMT and blockchain, EHRGuard enables the seamless and secure gathering of real-time health data, ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access and tampering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional healthcare systems in terms of service quality and consumer data monitoring. This innovative approach not only enhances the security and privacy of EHRs but also fosters trust and efficiency in healthcare systems, ultimately benefiting consumers and advancing medical research and treatment.

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) represents a dynamic and expanding ecosystem of internet-connected medical devices, applications, and systems seamlessly integrated with healthcare IT infrastructure1. This transformative technology is revolutionizing healthcare by facilitating real-time data collection, transmission, and analysis, ultimately enhancing patient care and streamlining operational efficiency. IoMT spans a diverse array of tools, ranging from wearable devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches to sophisticated implants such as pacemakers and insulin pumps. These devices capture vital health metrics—heart rate, blood glucose levels, and activity patterns—and relay them to healthcare providers for ongoing monitoring and evaluation. A key strength of IoMT lies in its capacity to enable remote patient monitoring (RPM)2. For individuals managing chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease, this technology offers continuous oversight without the need for frequent clinic visits. This not only improves patient convenience but also empowers providers to spot emerging issues early and respond swiftly. Moreover, IoMT paves the way for personalized medicine, allowing clinicians to craft tailored treatment plans based on real-time insights into a patient's unique health profile. Beyond hardware, IoMT encompasses software platforms that harness advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to process the flood of data from connected devices3. These tools can detect patterns, forecast health risks, and suggest preventive actions. For instance, an IoMT system might flag a patient's rising blood pressure trends, alerting a physician to a potential hypertension risk and enabling timely intervention. This data-driven methodology sharpens clinical decision-making and fosters more effective, proactive care strategies. However, IoMT's promise comes with notable hurdles. Data security and privacy remain pressing concerns, as transmitting sensitive health information online heightens vulnerability to cyberattacks4. Compliance with regulations like HIPAA is critical to safeguarding patient confidentiality. Interoperability poses another obstacle, requiring seamless communication between devices and systems from various manufacturers. Additionally, the sheer volume of data generated can strain healthcare systems, underscoring the need for robust data management and analytical solutions5. Looking forward, the IoMT landscape is poised for substantial growth, fueled by advancements in AI, machine learning, and 5G connectivity6. These innovations promise to amplify IoMT's precision and responsiveness, driving a shift toward more proactive and efficient healthcare delivery. As adoption spreads globally, IoMT holds the potential to redefine patient care, lower costs, and elevate health outcomes on an unprecedented scale7.

The use of blockchain technology on the Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare provides a secure and privacy-focused approach to managing medical data. Blockchain has emerged as a reliable solution to challenges related to data security, interoperability, and transparency in healthcare8. As a decentralized and distributed ledger, blockchain ensures that health records remain tamper-proof, meaning once data is recorded, it cannot be modified or erased. This feature is essential for maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of patient information. Furthermore, decentralization removes the need for a central authority, strengthening security and system reliability. Various blockchain-based solutions, such as HealthChain9, Fortified-Chain10, and MedShare11, have been designed to securely manage and exchange medical information. These systems utilize blockchain's core capabilities to improve data privacy, security, and accessibility12. For example, smart contract-based access control mechanisms have been proposed to ensure secure sharing of health data among patients and healthcare providers, emphasizing the importance of decentralized trust13. Additionally, hybrid cryptographic schemes, such as the Improved Key Generation Scheme of RSA (IKGSR), have been implemented to securely retrieve EHRs in cloud-based healthcare systems, offering robust encryption and decryption methods14. Furthermore, intelligent breach detection systems integrated with advanced networks like 6G have shown promise in safeguarding critical healthcare infrastructures from cyber-attacks15. Machine learning techniques have also played a crucial role in enhancing cybersecurity by enabling the detection of digital threats, ensuring timely responses to potential security breaches16. By employing cryptographic techniques, blockchain protects sensitive health records, allowing patients to have greater control over their data. Individuals can decide who has access to their medical information, ensuring confidentiality while enabling seamless communication with healthcare providers. Another advantage of blockchain is its ability to enhance transparency and accountability in healthcare17. Every transaction recorded on the blockchain is auditable, enabling participants to track the history of data exchanges. Smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules, further improve interoperability by automating data-sharing processes between healthcare entities. Despite these benefits, challenges such as scalability and regulatory compliance must be addressed to support broader adoption. As research continues, blockchain's potential to enhance healthcare data security and management becomes increasingly evident18.

This study presents a privacy-centric healthcare framework that employs a layered architecture to effectively manage and monitor patient health information. The system embraces decentralization by merging blockchain technology with the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling real-time patient oversight, secure handling of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), prescription management, and safeguarded data sharing. Blockchain integration ensures data integrity, robust security, and transparency, preventing unauthorized alterations and fostering trust across healthcare operations. Meanwhile, IoT devices facilitate continuous health monitoring, paving the way for prompt, evidence-based medical decisions. A standout feature of this system is its use of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to collect real-time data from sensors, promoting a proactive stance on patient care. Blockchain enhances privacy through encryption and anonymity, tackling concerns surrounding data confidentiality. Furthermore, the research underscores the value of linking healthcare providers, institutions, and stakeholders via a decentralized blockchain network. This setup enhances access control, streamlines secure data exchange, and ensures compliance, all while prioritizing patient privacy and operational efficiency.

This section reviews studies in the healthcare sector that have strategically integrated blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance the security of Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

The authors in19 propose a system aimed at enhancing healthcare by ensuring secure data management via a lightweight blockchain. This paper introduces an innovative platform for monitoring patient vital signs through the implementation of smart contracts on a blockchain. The system is constructed using Hyperledger Fabric, a distributed ledger framework tailored for enterprise-level blockchain applications. By utilizing the Libelium e-Health toolkit for physiological data acquisition, the proposed solution offers patients several benefits, including an unalterable historical log and universal access to medical information at any location and time. Performance evaluation is conducted using Hyperledger Caliper, a standard benchmark tool, measuring transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization. The findings reveal that the proposed system surpasses conventional healthcare systems in the monitoring of patient data.

The DITrust Chain system, proposed in20, is a blockchain-based framework designed to enhance security and privacy in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environments. It features a multi-layered architecture: the first layer collects and processes data through sensors and actuators; the second layer uses gateways and network technologies like Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee to securely transmit data; the third, or middleware layer, includes blockchain decision units, data analytics, and application support to manage data integrity and services; and the final application layer delivers system functionalities to end-users via web service protocols and service composition technologies. This structure ensures seamless integration, robust data protection, and improved patient confidentiality, with experimental results showing it outperforms traditional access control methods in IoMT settings.

In21, the authors introduce a novel privacy-preserving scheme called BIoTHR, which leverages blockchain and swarm exchange techniques to enable secure and seamless transmission of user data, such as electronic health records (EHRs), across peer-to-peer networks. This framework integrates blockchain technology with IoT to create a robust system for EHR management, ensuring real-time monitoring and secure data transmission through autonomous encryption–decryption mechanisms and dynamic server assistance. Key algorithms like swarm-listen, announcement, peer open, and peer closing are employed to optimize system functionality, while open-source tools such as GnuPG, IPFS, and Golang are used for development. The scheme is tested using simulated IoT-based health sensor nodes, including body temperature, pulse rate, oxygen saturation (SPO2), galvanic skin response, and blood glucose, within the blockchain-assisted swarm exchange framework. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in blockchain-IoT integration, swarm exchange, and EHR transmission, offering enhanced security and efficiency for e-healthcare services.

Samuel et al. in22 propose the Patient-Centric Healthcare Framework (PCH), a novel reference architecture designed to enhance semantic interoperability in healthcare systems by integrating Blockchain, Cloud, and IoT technologies. The framework features a five-tiered architecture that emphasizes collaboration and secure data processing, with a focus on practical implementation. The design process includes a layering diagram, system context, and detailed reference architecture to outline component topology and interactions. Using electronic medical records as an example, the framework demonstrates how healthcare data is processed while maintaining robust security measures. The authors evaluate PCH against existing Blockchain-based healthcare frameworks, with results showing that PCH offers superior solutions for securing healthcare data, enabling efficient data sharing, and improving overall interoperability, making it a promising approach for modern healthcare systems.

Pratima et al. in23 propose EHDHE, a decentralized blockchain-based IoT application designed to enhance the security of healthcare documents in digital healthcare ecosystems. The application acts as a communication intermediary, connecting hospitals, patients, and doctors, and features the generation of unique identification numbers for medical certificates and the use of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to create new blocks in the blockchain network. Its primary goal is to ensure the security and privacy of medical certificates by preventing unauthorized access and storing medical data as hashed blocks within the blockchain, thereby mitigating fraudulent activities. The authors evaluate the application through extensive experimental tests, analyzing parameters such as latency, computation time, processing time, throughput, and network usage to assess its performance and robustness. The results demonstrate that EHDHE is a secure and efficient solution for managing healthcare documents in IoT-enabled ecosystems.

Bora et al. in24 propose PPFchain, a novel privacy-preserving blockchain-based federated learning (FL) framework designed for sensor networks. PPFchain leverages a distributed architecture to ensure data privacy, reliability, and low-cost on-demand anonymity within an IoT-based blockchain network. Key features include the integration of fog node architecture at the edge of the off-chain IoT network, which reduces contract payload and minimizes end-to-end delay, and the use of digital signatures with public key cryptography to protect administrator privacy. FL is employed to enhance data privacy while maintaining system performance. The framework is evaluated using benchmark metrics for event and storage-based smart contracts within a distributed architecture. Additionally, the authors introduce a 5G-enabled block-sensor platform that balances security-privacy concerns with computation-communication costs, paving the way for next-generation blockchain-sensor applications in 5G-enabled environments. This innovative approach addresses critical challenges in security, privacy, and efficiency, demonstrating its potential for advanced IoT and blockchain integration.

In reference25, the authors propose an innovative blockchain-based architecture designed to decentralize Electronic Health Records (EHR) and enable smart contract-driven service automation while ensuring robust security and privacy. The architecture employs a hybrid computing model, integrating blockchain-based distributed data storage to overcome limitations of cloud-centric Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) healthcare systems, such as high latency, elevated storage costs, and single points of failure. A standout feature is the decentralized selective ring-based access control mechanism, which, along with device authentication and patient record anonymity algorithms, significantly enhances system security. The authors evaluate the system's latency and cost-effectiveness in data sharing, demonstrating its efficiency. Logical system analysis confirms that the architecture meets the security and privacy requirements of decentralized IoMT smart healthcare systems. Experimental results reveal that the fortified-chain-based Healthcare Privacy System (HCPS) requires minimal storage and achieves millisecond-level response times, outperforming traditional centralized HCPS. These findings highlight the architecture's decentralized automated access control, security, and privacy capabilities, affirming its suitability for decentralized IoMT smart healthcare systems.

In reference26, the authors present BEdgeHealth, a novel decentralized health architecture that combines Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and blockchain technologies to enable efficient data offloading and secure data sharing within distributed hospital networks. The architecture offers two key advantages: (1) a smart contract system that provides authentication and traceability for data-sharing activities, eliminating the need for external authority. The smart contract tracks events like data uploads and user access and any modifications to data records alter their hash values, which are also traceable. (2) The integration of smart contracts with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) enhances the data retrieval rate, ensuring efficient and secure data access. The system includes a privacy-aware data-offloading scheme, where mobile devices can offload health data to nearby MEC servers for efficient computation, and a secure data-sharing scheme that leverages blockchain and IPFS for secure exchanges among healthcare users. By combining smart contract-based authentication with MEC, the architecture enables decentralized user access verification at the network edge without relying on a central authority. Real-world experiments demonstrate that BEdgeHealth significantly improves Quality of Service (QoS) while ensuring data privacy and security, outperforming existing schemes in terms of efficiency and reliability.

In this section, we introduce EHRGuard, an innovative framework designed for Remote Patient Monitoring with a focus on ensuring the security of patient health data through the integration of blockchain and IoT. Within this section, we provide a comprehensive demonstration of the proposed architecture, showcasing its various facets. Subsequently, we outline diverse prerequisites for establishing a secure authentication scheme in healthcare applications that leverage IoT technology.

The proposed system is structured with a modular architecture, wherein each layer operates independently of the others. This decoupling feature provides developers with the flexibility to integrate or remove modules without causing disruptions to the overall system. The architecture of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 1 and refers to five major components: Patient with wearable IoT devices, healthcare professionals, permissioned blockchain, an off-chain database and Electronic Health Record.

Patient with wearable IoT devices: The proposed system integrates heterogeneous IoT-based medical sensors—categorized into ingestible/implantable sensors, environmental sensors, and camera-based sensors—to enable continuous health monitoring by measuring physiological parameters and transmitting data wirelessly to a server. Each patient's IoT devices and sensors are registered on a blockchain to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering, with a health administrator overseeing initial registration using details like name, date of birth, and contact information. Patients access the system via email ID and a generated password, while four key sensors (EMG, SpO2, body temperature, and pulse rate) monitor health metrics, with predefined normal and abnormal ranges triggering automated notifications for potential health issues. This real-time monitoring, combined with blockchain security and automated alerts, ensures timely interventions, enhances patient care, and supports early detection of health complications. Table 1 defines normal and abnormal ranges for these parameters, with automated notifications triggered when any sensor detects values outside the normal range, indicating a potential health issue.

Healthcare professionals: Access to patient health data is restricted to authorized healthcare professionals, such as doctors, practitioners, and hospital administrators, ensuring privacy and security. A blockchain network facilitates the retrieval of patient health information, with doctors acting as light nodes accessible via smartphones or computers, while hospitals operate as full nodes, storing a complete replica of the blockchain and participating in the consensus process. Other users, although they may possess a copy of the blockchain, are not permitted to engage in the consensus mechanism, maintaining a controlled and secure environment for sensitive health data. This hierarchical structure ensures that only trusted entities can access and manage patient information, enhancing data integrity and confidentiality. The different participants and their privileges in the proposed system are mentioned in Table 2.

Electronic health record: An electronic health record (EHR) is a comprehensive digital version of a patient's medical history, encompassing critical health information such as diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory test results. EHRs enable real-time access to patient data by authorized healthcare professionals, improving care coordination among providers and enhancing healthcare outcomes. In the proposed system, healthcare professionals exclusively create an EHR for each patient, including essential details like birth information, residence, contact number, patient ID, medical history, and medical prescriptions. The medical prescriptions section contains medication data, such as the name, details, prescription date, patient ID, and doctor's information, while the medical history segment includes patient ID, first name, last name, disease description, date, updated date, and status. Only authorized healthcare practitioners can access these records, ensuring data security and privacy. Both the EHR and patient health information collected from IoT sensors can be utilized for research, remote monitoring, and analysis, fostering a more efficient and interconnected healthcare ecosystem that replaces traditional paper-based systems with a seamless, digital approach.

Permissioned blockchain: A permissioned blockchain is a type of blockchain network where access and participation in the network are restricted to a defined set of participants. Unlike public blockchains where anyone can join and participate in the network, permissioned blockchains require participants to be authorized or granted permission to engage in various activities such as validating transactions, accessing data, and participating in the consensus process27. A permissioned blockchain-based data monitoring system can provide a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, and finance, where controlled access and privacy are paramount. In this paper, the proposed system for monitoring patient data is supported by a lightweight, permissioned blockchain carefully crafted to establish a secure and regulated environment for both patients and healthcare professionals. This permissioned blockchain serves as a digital infrastructure, facilitating the secure storage and retrieval of data28. To ensure data validation, the associated hash values of each patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR) are recorded on the blockchain after storage and encryption. Furthermore, the permissioned blockchain is designed to store crucial patient monitoring data, specifically Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) sensor values, as transactions. This methodology acts as a safeguard against potential tampering or forgery of records. For instance, when a new set of monitoring data is collected at defined intervals, it is recorded into the blockchain as a transaction if it deviates from the expected norms. Additionally, any modifications or updates made to sensor information, access control lists, medical history, medical prescriptions, treatment plans, vital statistics, and EHRs are recorded as transactions on the blockchain. Additionally, the client application employs the REST API for administering the blockchain network, facilitating transaction requests such as task generation services, as well as user and device registration. Participants, including patients and doctors, have the capability to submit transactions, whether to create a new task or to receive a response from a previously generated task via the healthcare IoT server29.

Off-chain database: An off-chain database is a storage system that operates independently of a blockchain, serving as an external repository for data that is not stored directly on the blockchain. This approach is particularly useful for managing large volumes of data, such as files, documents, or detailed records, which would be impractical or inefficient to store on-chain due to limitations in storage capacity, cost, or performance. In the context of healthcare, when a new patient registers with healthcare professionals, a unique patient ID and Electronic Health Record (EHR) are generated30. The EHR contains critical information such as birth details, residence, contact information, medical history, and prescriptions. To ensure security, each patient's EHR is encrypted and stored in an off-chain database, alongside other relevant data like sensor details, sensor values, vital statistics, and access control lists. This off-chain storage strategy enhances efficiency and scalability, enabling streamlined access and management of patient information while maintaining data confidentiality. While the off-chain database provides a secure and efficient repository for sensitive patient data, blockchain technology complements it by offering a decentralized, tamper-resistant ledger that records data modifications. This combination ensures real-time access to patient data for healthcare professionals while maintaining data consistency and enabling secure data sharing across entities such as hospitals, doctors, and researchers. However, for large-scale static healthcare data, a purely blockchain-based architecture may require significant resources. Therefore, integrating an off-chain database with a permissioned blockchain architecture presents a more efficient and resilient solution for managing patient information in remote healthcare settings31. This hybrid approach not only preserves data integrity but also achieves a balance between data privacy, security, and accessibility, making it a robust framework for modern healthcare systems.

The proposed EHRGuard architecture.

The adversary model of the proposed scheme outlines potential threats and adversaries that the system is designed to mitigate or withstand. It helps in understanding the security considerations and scenarios where the system may face challenges. The adversary model typically identifies potential attackers, their capabilities, and the assumed conditions under which they may operate. For example, in a healthcare-related blockchain system, potential adversaries could include:

Unauthorized users: Adversaries may attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system, posing a threat to the confidentiality of sensitive health data. The model should consider measures to prevent unauthorized login attempts, account hijacking, or any form of unauthorized access.

Tampering with patient data: Adversaries may try to manipulate or tamper with patient data stored in the blockchain. The system should be resilient against unauthorized modifications to ensure the integrity of health records.

Eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks: Adversaries may try to eavesdrop on communications or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and manipulate data transmissions. The model should address encryption and secure communication protocols to prevent these threats.

Denial-of-service (DoS) Attackers: Adversaries may attempt to disrupt the availability of the system by launching DoS attacks. The model should include strategies to mitigate and withstand such attacks, ensuring continuous service availability.

Sybil attacks: Sybil attacks involve adversaries creating multiple fake identities to undermine the network. The adversary model should account for measures to detect and prevent Sybil attacks that could compromise the consensus mechanism.

Privacy concerns: Adversaries may attempt to breach patient privacy by extracting sensitive information. The model should address privacy-preserving measures, ensuring that patient data remains confidential and is accessible only to authorized parties.

Blockchain network attacks: Adversaries might target the underlying blockchain network. The model should consider protections against 51% attacks, double-spending attacks, and other vulnerabilities specific to the chosen blockchain technology.

Securing a healthcare Internet of Things system is crucial to safeguard sensitive patient data, maintain the integrity of medical information, and ensure the reliability of connected devices. Here are key security requirements for a healthcare IoT system:

Device authentication: Implement secure authentication mechanisms for IoT devices to ensure that only authorized and authenticated devices can connect to the system. This prevents unauthorized access and potential attacks.

Access control: Enforce strict access controls to regulate who can access and interact with the healthcare IoT system.

Data encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for data transmitted between IoT devices, gateways, and the central system. This ensures that health data remains confidential and secure during transmission.

Integrity checking: Use cryptographic mechanisms, such as digital signatures, to verify the integrity of data collected from IoT devices. This helps ensure that the data has not been tampered with during transit or storage.

Secure communication: Utilize secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, MQTT with TLS) to protect data exchanged between IoT devices and the central system. This safeguards against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Privacy preservation: Implement measures to protect patient privacy, such as anonymization and de-identification of data where appropriate. Aligns with healthcare regulations and safeguards sensitive patient information.

The IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) presents unique challenges due to the vulnerabilities of sensor nodes that are often deployed in hostile or hazardous environments. These nodes are susceptible to various attacks, such as network perturbation, data manipulation, and replay attacks, which can compromise the accuracy of data aggregation and potentially mislead healthcare systems. To address these challenges, the proposed system aims to meet several critical objectives:

Security: The system must ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data transmitted through IoT networks. This is particularly vital for healthcare applications, where unauthorized access or data manipulation can have severe consequences. The system should be designed to withstand compromised nodes and prevent data tampering. Additional security measures such as access control and availability must also be implemented to ensure that data remains secure and accessible only to authorized users.

High energy efficiency: Energy efficiency is essential for maintaining the longevity of sensor networks, especially when nodes are battery-powered or have limited energy resources. The proposed aggregation scheme must minimize energy consumption by reducing computing load and communication overhead. This will not only preserve the energy of sensor nodes but also extend the overall lifetime of the network, ensuring continuous and reliable operation over extended periods.

Scalability: As the IoMT ecosystem grows, the system must be scalable enough to handle an increasing number of IoT devices, users, and data without compromising performance. The design should allow seamless expansion, ensuring that the system can accommodate additional devices and more data without overwhelming the infrastructure. Scalability is key to ensuring that the solution remains effective as healthcare IoT networks evolve and expand.

This section delineates a sequential interaction illustrating how patients are equipped with Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) sensors, healthcare professionals, an off-chain database, and blockchain technology collaboratively operate to establish a secure, transparent, and efficient remote patient monitoring system. The integration of blockchain and off-chain databases is instrumental in fortifying data security, upholding integrity, ensuring accessibility, preserving patient privacy, and facilitating the delivery of remote healthcare services. In the following, we provide a description of each phase.

Figure 2 illustrates a sequence diagram outlining the steps for adding patient health records in the proposed EHRGuard system. The process begins with enrolling each patient into the Health System, followed by the attachment of medical sensors based on a doctor's recommendation. Medical staff affix these sensors to the patient's body, enabling real-time monitoring of vital signs such as respiration rate, pulse rate, oxygen levels, and glucose levels. The Health System maintains a centralized database to store all relevant patient information, including Electronic Health Records. Sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to a gateway powered by a Raspberry Pi, which acts as a bridge for Internet of Medical Things devices. This gateway forwards the collected data to an off-chain database, accessible exclusively to authorized healthcare professionals. The medical IoT server processes queries and leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data handling. Finally, statistical information is sent to a web application for analysis, enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions and improve patient care. This integrated approach ensures efficient, secure, and real-time health monitoring and data management.

Sequence diagram for adding patient health records for the proposed EHRGuard system.

Algorithm 1 is designed to securely add patient health and sensor data to both the database and the blockchain, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. It handles new patient registration, initiated by an administrator, and records data as a transaction in the form of metadata when either a new patient is registered, or the sensor diagnostic status exceeds normal values. This metadata is used to create a new block in the blockchain. The algorithm ensures that data is only recorded when abnormal behavior is detected, preventing unnecessary entries for normal or ongoing sensor readings. Patient data is first encrypted using a secure encryption mechanism before being stored in the database, and its hashed reference is uploaded as a transaction to the blockchain. Each data entry is appended as a block, creating a tamper-resistant ledger that guarantees the immutability of patient health data, protecting it from unauthorized changes or deletions. The algorithm also supports flexible mapping between patients and sensors, allowing for one-to-one or one-to-many relationships. Vital sign data is stored as a JSON array and transmitted to the healthcare IoT server via a POST request, with communication between the IoT gateway and the server facilitated by the CoAP protocol. This comprehensive approach ensures secure, efficient, and transparent management of patient health data.

Insert patient & sensor data in the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism that ensures agreement among distributed participants in a blockchain network regarding the state of the ledger. It plays a critical role in creating new blocks and securing the network against malicious activities, such as double-spending attacks and unauthorized tampering with block history. In the proposed system, hospital administration acts as trusted validators, responsible for verifying transactions, constructing blocks, and appending them to the blockchain. The PoW algorithm involves solving a computationally complex scientific puzzle, which serves as a deterrent against adversaries by limiting their economic capabilities to disrupt the network32. A hash function is central to this process, providing a random and complex mathematical mechanism to validate transactions stored in the blockchain. Each block contains its hash value, transaction history, and the hash value of the previous block, ensuring a secure and immutable chain. During the PoW process, nodes in the network calculate the hash value of the block header, and upon discovering the target value, a node broadcasts the new block to the network. Other nodes verify the accuracy of the hash value, and once validated, the block is collectively added to the blockchain. Figure 3 illustrates the PoW flow, highlighting its secure and decentralized nature. The key advantages of PoW include its robust security measures and its ability to promote decentralization, making it a reliable foundation for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the blockchain network.

The proof of work consensus algorithm.

Algorithm 2 plays a central role in managing patient sensor data by providing an overview of the information received from patients and enabling access to a personalized dashboard for healthcare professionals. This dashboard allows users to review patient data using filters such as date, time, and profile parameters. Upon receiving sensor data, Algorithm 2 analyzes it, focusing on detecting abnormal readings that fall outside the expected range, which are flagged as “red” for visual emphasis. The system generates real-time alerts and notifications for healthcare experts when critical health issues or deviations from predefined parameters are identified, enabling timely treatment adjustments or prescription changes. This rapid detection of abnormalities serves as a vital safety feature, ensuring prompt attention to potential health risks. Conversely, readings within the normal range are integrated into the patient's record and securely stored in the database, ensuring accurate documentation for future reference or analysis. Essentially, Algorithm 2 acts as a crucial intermediary, managing, analyzing, and presenting patient sensor data in a way that allows healthcare professionals to effectively monitor and respond to patient health. Figure 4 illustrates the sequence diagram for remote patient monitoring, highlighting the system's workflow.

Algorithm 3 is responsible for generating and retrieving patient medical prescriptions, which include critical details such as patient ID, medicine ID, medicine name, comprehensive medicine details, doctor information (first name and last name), and the prescription issuance date. Patients are granted access to view only their own prescriptions, while doctors have the authority to create and update them. When healthcare professionals modify a prescription, the updated record is securely stored in both the database and the ledger, ensuring a transparent and accountable system that maintains a comprehensive history of all changes made to medical prescriptions.

Medicine prescriptions.

Algorithm 4 is specifically designed for the creation and retrieval of the patient's medical history. The records within this algorithm include crucial details such as the patient's name, patient ID, a comprehensive history of diseases, or any ongoing medical conditions, along with associated dates for each disease event and the current health status of the patient. To maintain a secure and transparent Electronic Health Record for the patient, a new block is appended to the blockchain whenever there is a recording or update to the medical history. This process ensures the integrity and immutability of the patient's health information within the blockchain, providing a reliable and transparent history of their medical journey.

Medical history.

Security analysis involves a thorough analysis of the measures integrated into the EHRGuard system to safeguard patient health information against unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential vulnerabilities. The proposed system leverages blockchain and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technologies to ensure that healthcare data remains secure, private, and tamper resistant. This section highlights key security aspects, addressing essential factors such as data integrity, confidentiality, privacy, user control, immutability, scalability, availability, traceability, and transparency.

Data Integrity: The off-chain database securely stores patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using advanced encryption techniques. The encryption generates keys that are stored within the blockchain blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the preceding block, forming an interconnected chain. This design ensures that any alteration to the data would result in a mismatch of the hash values, making unauthorized modification almost impossible. The immutability of blockchain guarantees the integrity of patient data, ensuring that it cannot be tampered with or corrupted.

Confidentiality: Patient confidentiality is paramount in healthcare systems. The EHRGuard system ensures that only authorized users, such as healthcare providers and medical professionals, can access sensitive patient information. The access control mechanism ensures that unauthorized individuals are unable to view or manipulate patient health records. This restriction upholds the privacy of healthcare data and protects it from exposure to unauthorized parties.

Privacy: To protect patient privacy, the EHRGuard system utilizes a permissioned consortium blockchain, which limits access to the system to only those who are authorized to view or manage patient data. Blockchain regulates access to the encrypted data stored in the off-chain database, ensuring that patient records are shielded from unauthorized access. These mechanisms provide an additional layer of security by ensuring that only trusted healthcare providers can access the sensitive health information.

User Control: Empowering patients with control over their own health data is a key feature of the EHRGuard system. Patients have the ability to decide who can access their data and can revoke access at any time. This level of control ensures that individuals maintain autonomy over their personal health information and can make informed decisions about its sharing. This approach aligns with modern healthcare principles of patient consent and privacy.

Immutability: The use of blockchain ensures the immutability of patient records. Once data is uploaded to the blockchain, it becomes resistant to modification or deletion. This feature protects the data from both intentional tampering and accidental changes, ensuring that the information remains authentic. The immutability of blockchain significantly strengthens the security of patient data by preventing unauthorized alterations and fostering trust among stakeholders.

Scalability: The EHRGuard system's architecture is designed for scalability, enabling it to manage and process large volumes of patient data efficiently. Data is encrypted and securely stored in the off-chain database, with its hash value documented in the blockchain. This approach allows the system to handle substantial amounts of data with lower latency. The integration of off-chain databases and permissioned blockchain ensures the scalability of the system, enabling it to grow as the number of patients and healthcare transactions increases.

Availability: Availability is ensured through a decentralized system architecture. By using multiple distributed nodes, the EHRGuard system eliminates single points of failure. If one node becomes unavailable, the system remains operational, and other nodes can continue to provide access to patient data. This decentralized approach ensures high availability and enhances system resilience, ensuring continuous access to critical health information even during network disruptions or server failures.

Traceability: The use of blockchain introduces transparency into the system. All transactions related to patient records are publicly visible to authorized participants within the network, fostering openness and accountability. This transparency ensures that any changes made to the data are easily verifiable and that the integrity of the health data is maintained. Authorized healthcare providers can confidently access the data, knowing it is securely managed and immutable.

The EHRGuard system offers a comprehensive security framework for healthcare data management, addressing critical issues such as data integrity, confidentiality, privacy, and traceability. By integrating blockchain and IoT technologies, the system ensures that patient health information is secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant. The decentralized nature of blockchain, combined with robust encryption, access controls, and user empowerment, makes EHRGuard a reliable and secure solution for modern healthcare data management. This security evaluation confirms that the system effectively mitigates risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and tampering, while ensuring the availability and scalability necessary for large-scale healthcare applications.

In this section, we provide an expanded security evaluation of EHRGuard, focusing on how the system performs under various attack scenarios, including man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), Sybil, and replay attacks. Each section includes a discussion on the specific mitigation strategies used, along with experimental results to demonstrate how EHRGuard handles these potential threats.

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, such as a patient's IoMT device and a healthcare provider's system, potentially compromising patient data. To mitigate this, EHRGuard encrypts all communication between IoMT devices, patients, and healthcare professionals using SSL/TLS protocols, ensuring end-to-end encryption and preventing attackers from modifying or reading transmitted data. Additionally, blockchain technology is employed to verify data integrity, with IoMT devices authenticated and registered on the blockchain network to prevent unauthorized access. We conducted a series of simulations to evaluate the system's resilience to MITM attacks under different conditions. For the first setup, Without Encryption, no encryption mechanisms were employed, simulating an unsecured communication channel between the patient's IoMT device and the healthcare professional's system. In this case, the MITM attacker was able to intercept the data being transmitted, such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and other vital signs. The attacker modified the values, injecting false data into the communication stream, which led to corrupted health information being sent to the healthcare provider. This corrupted data could potentially result in incorrect diagnoses or treatment recommendations, highlighting the critical risk posed by MITM attacks in an unprotected system. For the second setup, With Encryption, we implemented SSL/TLS encryption, which encrypts the communication between the patient's device and the healthcare provider's system. In this case, even though the MITM attacker intercepted the communication, they were unable to read or alter the encrypted data. The encrypted data appeared as gibberish to the attacker, rendering any attempts to modify or inject malicious data ineffective. Furthermore, the blockchain layer ensured that any changes made to the data could be detected and rejected by verifying the data's integrity. The blockchain's immutable ledger made it impossible to alter any data retroactively, guaranteeing that only valid, untampered data could be recorded in the system.

In the Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Evaluation, the focus was on assessing EHRGuard's ability to withstand excessive traffic aimed at overwhelming system resources and denying legitimate users access to patient data. A successful DoS attack could severely disrupt healthcare services by preventing healthcare professionals from accessing critical patient information. EHRGuard implements multiple mitigation techniques, including rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single user or device within a set time window and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor and detect abnormal traffic patterns. The experimental results demonstrated the system's resilience: without mitigation, the system was overwhelmed by a flood of requests, causing significant slowdowns and preventing access to patient data, highlighting its vulnerability to DoS attacks. However, with the implemented mitigation strategies, the system performed well under attack—rate limiting prevented any single user from flooding the system, while the IDS detected abnormal traffic, blocked malicious IP addresses, and kept the system operational with minimal downtime, ensuring continuous access to patient data for healthcare professionals. These results confirm that EHRGuard is resilient to DoS attacks when effective mitigation strategies are in place, ensuring the system remains available and functional even during high-traffic events.

In the Sybil Attack Evaluation, the focus was on assessing EHRGuard's ability to prevent malicious actors from creating fake identities or nodes within the network to manipulate the consensus process or alter patient records on the blockchain. A Sybil attack could compromise the integrity of the system by enabling attackers to modify critical medical data. To mitigate such attacks, EHRGuard employs a permissioned blockchain model, where only authorized participants—such as registered hospitals, doctors, and medical institutions—are allowed to join the network. Participants are verified during registration through multi-factor authentication and only verified healthcare professionals are permitted to engage in the consensus mechanism, ensuring that fake nodes cannot interfere with the blockchain. In the experimental results, a Sybil attack was simulated by introducing multiple fake nodes into the network: without mitigation, the fake nodes participated in the consensus process and were able to manipulate the validation of transactions, altering patient records on the blockchain. However, with the mitigation in place, the permissioned nature of the blockchain successfully prevented unauthorized nodes from joining the network, ensuring that only registered and verified participants could validate transactions, which protected patient data from tampering. The results demonstrate that EHRGuard's use of a permissioned blockchain is an effective safeguard against Sybil attacks, preserving the integrity of patient records by restricting network access to authenticated and authorized participants.

In the Replay Attack Evaluation, we assessed EHRGuard's resilience to an attack where an adversary intercepts and retransmits valid communication, such as transaction data, to deceive the system into accepting it as a legitimate request. In the context of healthcare, this could involve an attacker retransmitting valid patient data to manipulate or overwrite medical records. To mitigate this threat, EHRGuard employs timestamping and sequence numbering in all transactions. Each transaction includes a timestamp and a unique sequence number, ensuring that data cannot be replayed without detection. In the experimental results, the system was tested by capturing a valid transaction and retransmitting it to the server: without mitigation, the system accepted the replayed transaction, allowing the attacker to insert false data into the blockchain. However, with mitigation in place, the system recognized the replayed transaction by checking the timestamp and sequence number, promptly rejecting it and preventing unauthorized changes to patient records. The results demonstrate that transaction timestamps and sequence numbers are highly effective in protecting EHRGuard from replay attacks, ensuring that only legitimate transactions are accepted and recorded on the blockchain.

This section evaluates the proposed EHRGuard system, beginning with an overview of the hardware platform, the “E-health sensor shield V2.0,” followed by a visual analysis of the experimental results. The performance of EHRGuard is compared with two other systems, BIoTHR21 and EHDHE23, focusing on metrics such as latency, execution time, and throughput. Table 3 provides a summary of the stack technology used in the development of the proposed system.

The dataset used for evaluating the EHRGuard model consists of patient vitals collected from IoMT sensors, including heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and glucose levels, along with associated diagnoses, prescriptions, and blockchain transaction hashes for secure data management. The data is recorded in real-time, enabling continuous patient monitoring and immediate detection of abnormal conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and critical alerts. If abnormal readings are detected, alerts are triggered for medical intervention, while normal readings are securely stored in an off-chain database, with hashed references recorded on the blockchain to ensure integrity and immutability. Each patient record is linked to a Doctor ID for medical supervision, and prescribed medications are logged securely. This dataset demonstrates EHRGuard's capability to securely manage electronic health records using a combination of IoMT, blockchain, and real-time monitoring, ensuring data privacy, security, and efficient remote healthcare management. Table 4 resumes the dataset used for evaluating the EHRGuard.

The E-Health Sensor Shield V2.0 is a hardware module specifically designed for Arduino-based projects, particularly those focused on e-health and medical monitoring. It serves as a versatile platform for integrating a wide range of sensors and devices to measure and monitor physiological parameters. The shield features connectors and interfaces for connecting various health sensors, such as those for measuring heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, and more, as illustrated in Fig. 5. In the proposed system, four types of health sensors are connected to the patient's body: a temperature sensor, a SpO2 sensor, a pulse rate sensor, and an EMG sensor. The shield enables the collection of real-time data from these sensors, which can then be processed and used to monitor an individual's health parameters. It supports both analog and digital connectivity, making it compatible with sensors of different output types. Additionally, the shield offers flexible power options, allowing users to configure power supply for both the sensors and the shield according to their project needs. In this system, a Raspberry Pi equipped with the E-Health Sensor Shield V2.0 functions as an IoT gateway, routing vital-sign data to a healthcare IoT server. The e-health sensor platform also provides an open-source C + + library for reading data from the sensors. For detailed information on using the shield, users should consult the manufacturer's product documentation and specifications33.

This enhancement highlights the system's superior capability in facilitating faster and more efficient data transmission, which directly contributes to improved overall system performance and a better user experience. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system in managing high data loads and ensuring seamless operation in real-world healthcare scenarios.

Throughput of the proposed framework.

In the proposed EHRGuard system, latency is a critical factor, especially in healthcare environments where timely access to patient records is essential for effective patient care. The system's latency is influenced by several factors, including network latency, consensus mechanisms, block size, and transaction throughput. To evaluate the system's performance, we measured the average latency using JMeter, a widely-used tool for performance testing. During the evaluation, we simulated varying numbers of users and measured latency in seconds. The results, illustrated in Fig. 7, compare the latency performance of our system with benchmark models such as BIoTHR and EHDHE. The proposed framework demonstrates significantly lower latency compared to these benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency and robustness. This reduction in latency ensures faster and more reliable access to patient records, enhancing the system's overall effectiveness and supporting timely decision-making in healthcare settings.

Latency of the proposed system.

The computation cost, which reflects the resources required to execute tasks within a system or algorithm, is a critical factor in evaluating the efficiency of our proposed EHRGuard system. It encompasses various components, including user authentication, data retrieval, sensor data processing, blockchain integration, and data storage. Through extensive experimentation, our EHRGuard model has demonstrated superior cost-efficiency compared to benchmark systems like BIoTHR and EHDHE. As illustrated in Fig. 8, EHRGuard achieves a total computation cost of approximately 7 s for 1000 smart nodes, representing a 38% reduction compared to BIoTHR and a 24% reduction compared to EHDHE. These results highlight EHRGuard's ability to significantly minimize computation costs while maintaining scalability, ensuring efficient resource utilization and enhanced performance in healthcare applications. This cost-effectiveness makes EHRGuard a robust and practical solution for real-world implementation.

Computation cost of the proposed system.

Communication overhead, which refers to the additional resources and latency incurred by a system due to communication-related activities such as data transmission, messaging, and transactions between components or nodes within a blockchain network, is a critical factor in system performance. In our analysis, as depicted in Fig. 9, the proposed scheme demonstrates significantly greater efficiency in managing communication overhead compared to BIoTHR and EHDHE. This improved efficiency indicates that our system utilizes communication resources more effectively, reducing unnecessary delays and optimizing resource allocation. By minimizing communication overhead, the proposed system enhances overall performance, ensuring smoother and more reliable operations within the blockchain network, particularly in healthcare applications where timely and efficient data exchange is paramount.

The communication overhead of the proposed system.

In this section, we analyze the computational efficiency of the EHRGuard system by evaluating the time required for key operations involved in managing patient health data. The analysis focuses on four core processes: data encryption, blockchain transaction processing, consensus mechanism execution (Proof of Work), and real-time alert generation. Given the critical nature of healthcare applications, ensuring both security and performance is paramount for the system's feasibility in real-world settings. We define the following parameters for measuring the computational time of each operation:

T_enc: Data encryption is performed to ensure that patient health records are securely stored and transmitted. The time required for encryption can be calculated as:

Where:

\(\:{T}_{enc,i}:\:\) is the time for encrypting the iii-th patient's data.

\(\:n\): is the total number of patients.

T_tx: The processing of a blockchain transaction involves creating a new block, hashing, and appending it to the blockchain. The computational time for blockchain transactions is given by:

\({T_{tx}}={T_{block\_creation}}+{T_{hashing}}+{T_{block\_append}}\)

Where:

\(\:T_{{block\_creation}}\): is the time to create the new block.

\(\:{T}_{hashing}\): is the time taken to generate the hash of the block.

\(\:{T}_{block\_append}\): is the time to append the block to the blockchain.

T_pow: The Proof of Work mechanism ensures the integrity of the blockchain by requiring nodes to solve a computational puzzle before adding a block. The time for consensus mechanism execution can be represented as:

Where:

\(\:{T}_{solve}\): is the time to solve the computational puzzle.

N: is the number of nodes in the blockchain network.

T_alert: When sensor data falls outside the predefined thresholds (e.g., abnormal heart rate or blood pressure), real-time alerts are generated for healthcare professionals. The time for alert generation is calculated as:

Where:

\(\:{T}_{detection}\): is the time taken to detect abnormal readings from the sensor data.

\(\:{T}_{notification}\): is the time taken to notify healthcare professionals via the alert system.

T_db: To ensure the system can retrieve patient data efficiently for analysis or monitoring, the time for fetching patient records from the off-chain database is evaluated:

Where:

\(\:{T}_{db,i}\): is the time to retrieve the i-th patient's data from the database.

Table 5 presents the computational time analysis of key operations in the EHRGuard system, showcasing its efficiency in managing patient health data. The data encryption operation takes an average of 150 ms, ensuring fast and secure handling of patient information. Blockchain transaction processing requires 250 ms on average, reflecting the time needed to create, hash, and store a new block in the blockchain for maintaining data integrity. The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, essential for blockchain security, averages 500 ms, introducing some latency due to its computational complexity. Real-time alert generation for abnormal sensor readings takes just 80 ms on average, ensuring timely notifications for healthcare professionals. Lastly, data retrieval from the off-chain database averages 60 ms, enabling quick access to patient records. Overall, the system demonstrates efficient performance, balancing security, real-time monitoring, and data integrity with minimal delays, making EHRGuard suitable for real-time healthcare applications.

The comparison of the proposed EHRGuard system with existing systems is summarized in Table 6, underscores its superiority in addressing crucial parameters related to privacy, security, and overall functionality. This comprehensive evaluation reveals significant advancements and performance enhancements over current systems, solidifying the proposed method as a robust solution for modern healthcare challenges. The key parameters considered in the comparison include immutability, access control, and use of sensors, integrity, availability, confidentiality, privacy, traceability, scalability, service reliability, communication overhead, interoperability, and cost. The proposed EHRGuard system excels in these aspects, demonstrating its capacity to meet and exceed the expectations set by current systems. The system's immutability ensures the integrity and permanence of health records, mitigating the risk of unauthorized alterations. Robust access control mechanisms guarantee that only authorized individuals have appropriate levels of data access, bolstering confidentiality and privacy. The incorporation of sensors enhances the system's capabilities for remote patient monitoring, facilitating proactive healthcare interventions. Moreover, the system exhibits high availability, ensuring uninterrupted access to critical healthcare data. Privacy and confidentiality are prioritized, addressing concerns associated with the sensitive nature of health information. Traceability features enable a transparent audit trail, fostering accountability and compliance. The system's scalability ensures adaptability to varying demands, while its reliability in service delivery instills confidence in users. Notably, the proposed system minimizes communication overhead, promoting efficient data exchange. Interoperability considerations allow seamless integration with existing healthcare infrastructures, fostering a cohesive healthcare ecosystem. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of the proposed system positions it as a practical and sustainable solution for healthcare institutions. In conclusion, the experimental results and functionalities showcased by the proposed EHRGuard system substantiate its capacity to not only address but surpass the privacy and security constraints present in current systems. The innovative approach of remotely monitoring patients while securely sharing healthcare data marks a significant advancement, aligning with the evolving landscape of modern healthcare practices. The proposed method emerges as a pioneering solution, poised to elevate the standards of healthcare data management and patient care.

The EHRGuard system plays a pivotal role in transforming healthcare delivery by leveraging the integration of IoMT sensors, blockchain technology, and off-chain databases. One of the primary applications of this system is in remote patient monitoring, especially for patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease. For instance, a diabetic patient is equipped with continuous glucose monitoring sensors that track glucose levels in real time. These readings are transmitted wirelessly to a Raspberry Pi gateway, which forwards the data to the EHRGuard system. The system analyzes the data, and if an abnormal spike or drop in glucose levels is detected, a real-time alert is sent to the patient's healthcare provider, ensuring timely intervention and preventing severe complications. In the case of heart disease management, patients are equipped with heart rate monitors, and any irregularity in heart rate, detected by the sensors, triggers an automatic alert for immediate medical attention.

In emergency medical scenarios, the EHRGuard system facilitates swift decision-making and action. For example, a patient arriving at an emergency room (ER) with chest pain could have their vitals continuously monitored through IoMT devices, and their health data, including medical history and past diagnoses, is immediately available to the ER team. This enables healthcare providers to make quick, well-informed decisions about the necessary treatment plan. If the patient's readings indicate signs of a potential heart attack or other critical condition, the system generates alerts that notify the attending physicians and nurses in real-time, streamlining the emergency response and improving patient outcomes. The data recorded from this interaction is also securely stored on the blockchain, creating a transparent and tamper-proof record of the patient's treatment during the emergency.

Telemedicine consultations also benefit from the capabilities of EHRGuard. For instance, a patient consulting with a physician remotely could share their health data through the system. The doctor, with secure access to the patient's medical records and real-time sensor data (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels), can make a comprehensive diagnosis even without an in-person visit. If the patient's health data shows abnormal readings, the system automatically flags these for the physician's attention. This capability enhances the accuracy and safety of remote healthcare, especially for patients in rural or underserved areas.

The system also plays a critical role in medication adherence monitoring. For example, a patient prescribed medication for hypertension may forget to take their medicine or may not follow the recommended schedule. With IoMT-enabled devices like blood pressure monitors, EHRGuard tracks the patient's readings over time and can automatically detect patterns that suggest non-adherence to the prescribed medication regimen. The system will notify the healthcare provider, who can then intervene by advising the patient or adjusting the prescription if necessary. This proactive approach ensures better treatment compliance and improved patient outcomes.

In medical research, EHRGuard supports the collection of anonymized health data for studies by securely storing and recording patient information in a blockchain ledger. Researchers can access this data, ensuring it remains authentic and tamper-proof. For example, researchers studying the effectiveness of a new drug can track and analyze data from a large number of patients participating in clinical trials. The blockchain ensures that the integrity of the data is preserved, and the anonymization of sensitive patient information ensures privacy. Additionally, the system's flexibility allows researchers to aggregate data across multiple hospitals and clinics, making it possible to conduct large-scale studies without compromising data security or patient privacy.

Emergency response systems are another important area where EHRGuard proves useful. Suppose an elderly patient with a history of respiratory conditions experiences difficulty breathing while at home. The system, continuously monitoring the patient's vital signs, detects the change in oxygen levels and immediately sends an alert to emergency responders and the patient's primary care provider. This allows for quick intervention and reduces the chances of the situation escalating into a medical emergency.

Finally, the patient consent and data privacy management feature of EHRGuard allows patients to control their health data. Before any health record is added to the system, patients must give explicit consent, which is stored on the blockchain, ensuring that any subsequent access or modification of their data is logged and can be reviewed for transparency. This is especially crucial for telemedicine, where patients need confidence that their data is protected, and that they have control over who can access it.

Through these real-time applications, EHRGuard not only improves the quality of healthcare but also ensures that patient data remains secure, transparent, and accessible only to authorized individuals. The integration of IoMT devices, blockchain, and off-chain databases allows the system to bridge the gap between secure data management and effective patient care, offering a comprehensive solution for modern healthcare challenges.

The scalability of the EHRGuard system is essential for its successful implementation in a global healthcare network where multiple devices and users generate large volumes of data. To ensure the system performs efficiently, even with a massive surge in users and devices, several strategies have been incorporated into the system design. These strategies focus on maintaining high performance, low latency, and system stability while supporting large-scale deployments in real-time healthcare applications.

In large-scale environments, load balancing becomes essential to prevent bottlenecks and ensure that the system can handle a large influx of data without compromising its responsiveness. EHRGuard employs a distributed architecture that is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers. Load balancing techniques are utilized to distribute the computational and storage load evenly across the network, reducing the risk of overloading individual nodes and ensuring that the system continues to provide fast, responsive access to patient data. In this distributed setup, multiple healthcare institutions, hospitals, and even individual practitioners can connect to the system simultaneously. The decentralized approach of the permissioned blockchain further enhances this architecture by enabling a distributed consensus mechanism. Blockchain nodes, including full nodes in hospitals and light nodes on mobile devices, participate in the consensus process to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the data, ensuring the system scales with the increasing number of devices and healthcare providers.

One of the key components of EHRGuard's scalability lies in the hybrid storage model that combines both blockchain and off-chain databases. Blockchain provides the secure, tamper-resistant storage of critical transaction data, such as patient health records and sensor readings. However, storing large volumes of raw sensor data on the blockchain is inefficient and costly. Therefore, a hybrid approach is employed where high-volume data, such as IoMT sensor data and medical imaging, are stored in off-chain databases, while only the essential hashes, metadata, and transaction logs are recorded on the blockchain. The off-chain database can scale independently from the blockchain, allowing for rapid data retrieval and efficient management of large data sets without overwhelming the blockchain's storage capacity. With this architecture, as the number of devices and sensors increases, the off-chain database can expand dynamically to accommodate the surge in data, ensuring that the performance of the overall system remains unaffected.

To further enhance scalability and reduce latency, EHRGuard integrates edge computing with cloud storage solutions. Edge computing nodes are strategically placed closer to the devices, such as IoMT sensors, allowing for real-time data processing at the edge. This approach reduces the amount of raw data that needs to be transmitted to the central server or cloud, minimizing network congestion and speeding up decision-making for healthcare providers. Additionally, real-time sensor data analysis can be performed locally, triggering alerts, when necessary, thus improving the overall responsiveness of the system. Cloud computing complements edge computing by providing scalable storage and computational resources. As the volume of data generated by patients and healthcare devices increases, the system can seamlessly scale by utilizing cloud infrastructure to store and process large amounts of data. The cloud platform can accommodate the growing data storage needs while ensuring that the performance of the system is not compromised.

As the number of devices and users increases, ensuring that the blockchain network remains scalable is vital. EHRGuard leverages a permissioned blockchain, where only authorized participants are allowed to validate transactions and participate in the consensus process. This mechanism improves performance compared to public blockchains, as the number of nodes in the network is restricted to trusted parties, reducing the computational load. To further enhance scalability, EHRGuard uses an optimized consensus algorithm tailored for healthcare applications. This algorithm reduces the time required for transaction validation, ensuring that the system can handle a high transaction throughput while maintaining the integrity and immutability of the data. By using a lightweight, permissioned blockchain, the system ensures that even as the network grows, the consensus process remains efficient and the blockchain's storage and processing requirements are kept within practical limits.

The dynamic nature of healthcare systems, where the number of connected devices and users fluctuates, requires dynamic resource allocation. EHRGuard leverages cloud-based elasticity to scale the system's resources up or down based on demand. For instance, during periods of high activity, such as large-scale health emergencies or seasonal healthcare needs, the cloud infrastructure automatically allocates more computational power and storage capacity to handle the increased load. Similarly, during low-traffic periods, the system can scale down resources, optimizing costs and maintaining system efficiency. This dynamic resource allocation ensures that EHRGuard is able to accommodate fluctuations in healthcare demand, ensuring the system is both cost-effective and responsive to real-time needs.

As the number of devices and users grows, it becomes increasingly important to optimize data validation and storage protocols. EHRGuard uses efficient hashing algorithms and data compression techniques to minimize the data footprint on the blockchain. This ensures that the blockchain does not become bloated as more transactions are recorded. The validation process is optimized to ensure that only necessary data is included on the blockchain, while larger datasets are stored off-chain, making the system more scalable. In addition, the use of sharding techniques in the blockchain network allows for parallel processing of transactions, reducing bottlenecks and improving the speed and efficiency of the consensus mechanism. By partitioning the blockchain network into smaller, manageable units, sharding enhances the system's ability to scale horizontally while maintaining high levels of security.

Scalability is not just about handling larger amounts of data and more users; it also involves ensuring system reliability in the face of potential failures. EHRGuard incorporates fault-tolerant mechanisms and high-availability strategies to ensure the system remains operational even if certain components fail. Redundant nodes, automated failover systems, and real-time monitoring tools are in place to ensure that if a node or server becomes unavailable, data can still be accessed from another node without disruption. The decentralized nature of the blockchain network further strengthens fault tolerance, as data is not stored in a single location, and every participating node maintains a copy of the blockchain. This ensures that even in the event of network partitioning or server downtime, the system remains operational, and that patient data is always accessible.

In conclusion, the integration of blockchain technology into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for smart hospitals represents a transformative advancement in addressing the critical challenges of privacy and security in healthcare data management. Traditional EHR systems, with their inherent vulnerabilities and risks, have necessitated the exploration of innovative solutions, and blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain. By leveraging blockchain's core principles of decentralization, immutability, transparency, and consensus, the proposed system provides a robust framework for securing sensitive health information. Cryptographic techniques and smart contracts further enhance the system by enabling secure storage, retrieval, and granular access control, effectively preventing unauthorized data manipulation or access. The fusion of blockchain and EHRs marks a paradigm shift toward a more patient-centric, interoperable, and secure healthcare ecosystem. Patients gain greater control over their health data, assured by the tamper-resistant and transparent nature of blockchain-ledger storage. Healthcare providers benefit from streamlined data sharing, which improves care coordination and supports more informed decision-making. Case studies and real-world use cases highlight the practical successes of blockchain in healthcare, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating data breaches, enhancing interoperability, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. However, challenges such as scalability, regulatory compliance, and the need for standardized frameworks remain. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative effort from stakeholders, including healthcare providers, technology developers, and policymakers, to establish guidelines and standards that facilitate the seamless integration of blockchain into healthcare infrastructures. Despite these hurdles, the potential of blockchain to revolutionize healthcare data management is undeniable, paving the way for a more secure, efficient, and patient-focused future in healthcare.

Metrics details

Biomolecular condensates form via macromolecular phase separation. Here, we report results from our characterization of synthetic condensates formed by phase separation of mixtures comprising two types of RNA molecules and the biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol. Purine-rich RNAs are scaffolds that drive phase separation via heterotypic interactions. Conversely, pyrimidine-rich RNA molecules are adsorbents defined by weaker heterotypic interactions. They adsorb onto and wet the interfaces of coexisting phases formed by scaffolds. Lattice-based simulations reproduce the phenomenology observed in experiments and these simulations predict that scaffolds and adsorbents have different non-random orientational preferences at interfaces. Dynamics at interfaces were probed using single-molecule tracking of fluorogenic probes bound to RNA molecules. These experiments revealed dynamical anisotropy at interfaces whereby motions of probe molecules parallel to the interface are faster than motions perpendicular to the interface. Taken together, our findings have broad implications for designing synthetic condensates with tunable interfacial properties.

Biomolecular condensates are compositionally distinct membraneless bodies that form via phase separation of macromolecules1,2,3. Condensates are two- or multi-phase systems that provide spatial and temporal control and organization over biochemical reactions involving proteins and nucleic acids1,2,3,4,5. There is growing interest in developing synthetic condensates with bespoke functions6,7,8,9,10,11. These efforts are being driven by advances in our understanding of the physico-chemical principles underlying the formation and dissolution of condensates in live cells12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 and in vitro14,15,19,20,21,22,23. In live cells, condensates comprise several distinct types of macromolecules24. Additionally, within dense phases of condensates, one often observes a hierarchical organization of the constituent macromolecules. This has been reported for stress granules18,25,26, nucleoli15,27,28, nuclear speckles29, and the mitochondrial nucleoid5. Spatially organized condensates were also shown to arise in simple mixtures30 including ternary systems comprising two different RNA molecules and an arginine-rich peptide31.

Increased attention is being paid to interfaces of condensates22,32,33,34. A recent computational study predicted that in condensates comprising a single type of polymer in a solvent, the polymers that drive condensation, referred to as scaffolds, prefer non-random, orthogonal orientations with respect to the plane of the interface33,34. The solidification of condensates can be nucleated from the interface35,36,37,38. Additionally, the electrostatic fields at interfaces39, generated by interphase potentials40, can affect condensate fusion41, catalyze redox reactions42, and resist the transport of molecules moving from dilute to dense phase or vice versa43. Notably, RNA molecules can be scaffolds that drive phase separation from the bulk, or they can adsorb onto interfaces of condensates formed by scaffolds. Understanding why specific RNA molecules are scaffolds versus adsorbents is relevant for understanding how RNA-based condensates function in cells44. It is also relevant for designing de novo condensates based on protein-RNA mixtures.

We investigated the principles underlying spatial organization in condensates formed by ternary mixtures using a model system that comprises a biocompatible polymer, namely polyethylene glycol (PEG)45, and pairs of homopolymeric, non-base-pairing RNA molecules such as poly-adenine (poly-rA), which is a poly-purine, and poly-cytosine (poly-rC), which is a poly-pyrimidine46. Our investigations were motivated by a general framework anchored in the Gibbs adsorption isotherm47, and the physics of adsorption-mediated wetting transitions48. We studied adsorption in ternary mixtures, and we investigated the effects of polymer interaction strengths, concentrations, lengths, and stiffness on adsorption. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we quantified the orientation of molecules at the interface that leads to the distinction of condensate components being scaffolds versus adsorbents. We also report results from single-molecule super resolution imaging, which reveals the movement of molecules near the interface. Near the interface, we observed significantly faster motion in the parallel direction than in the perpendicular direction. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for the design of de novo condensates with specific spatial organization and interfacial properties.

Heterotypic PEG-RNA interactions provide the driving forces for forming condensates in the model ternary systems45,49,50. Increasing the concentration of PEG alters the chemical potential of PEG and promotes phase separation. Increasing the concentration of NaCl weakens electrostatic repulsions between RNA molecules, and this also promotes phase separation40,46. We first obtained a coarse mapping of the overall phase behaviors as a function of NaCl and PEG concentrations. Poly-rA undergoes phase separation in the presence of sufficient PEG and NaCl (Fig. 1a, b). The concentration of NaCl required to drive phase separation decreases as the concentration of PEG increases, and the slope of the phase boundary becomes zero above 3% w/w of PEG. For these concentrations of PEG, the poly-rA + PEG mixture undergoes phase separation for all NaCl concentrations that are above 0.5M.

a Poly-rA (1 g/L) undergoes phase separation in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl and PEG, b forming spherical (ii) or irregularly-shaped condensates. c poly-rC (1 g/L) phase separation requires higher concentrations of NaCl and PEG d to form spherical condensates. e The dense phases in a mixture of poly-rA (1 g/L) and poly-rC (1 g/L) show a range of condensate architectures. At low concentrations of PEG (i of f) or low concentrations of NaCl (I of g) the dense phase is homogenous. Increasing either the concentration of PEG or NaCl, poly-rA forms condensates and some poly-rC is recruited into it (ii of f, II or g). Notably, poly-rC adsorbs to the interface. The extent of adsorption increases with increasing concentrations of PEG (iii of f) or NaCl (III, IV, V of g). At higher concentrations of PEG, for fixed NaCl, or higher concentrations of NaCl for fixed PEG, the adsorbed poly-rC undergoes phase separation leading to a poly-rA-rich phase coexisting with a poly-rC-rich phase. Adsorption of poly-rC around the poly-rA dense phase is still observed (iv of panel f, VI and VII of g). All scale bars in the confocal images represent 3 μm. Confocal images show representative examples of observations on 50 or more condensates. Source data are provided as a Source Data file—see Data Availability Statement.

While poly-rC also undergoes phase separation, higher amounts of PEG and NaCl are required (Fig. 1c, d). This shows that poly-rA drives phase separation through stronger interactions when compared to poly-rC31,46,51. In these systems where base-pairing is not possible, we reasoned that the double rings of poly-purines make them more hydrophobic and allow for stronger π-stacking than poly-pyrimidines52. Stronger interactions in purine-rich systems can also engender dynamically arrested phase separation31,46,51, giving rise to irregular mesoscale structures that are dominated by long-lived intermolecular crosslinks. Here, we observed dynamically arrested percolated networks for poly-rA and not for poly-rC (Fig. 1b, d)—an observation that is consistent with recent reports53.

Next, we mapped phase boundaries for ternary mixtures of PEG plus a 1:1 ratio of poly-rA and poly-rC (Fig. 1e, g). In the absence of PEG and 0.75 M NaCl, we did not observe phase separation (i, Fig. 1f). Increasing the PEG concentration to 2% w/w, leads to crossing of the phase boundary and formation of a poly-rA-rich phase that coexists with a dilute phase (ii, Fig. 1f). The poly-rC molecules partition into and adsorb onto the interface of the poly-rA-rich phase. The extent of adsorption increased with increasing concentration of PEG (iii, Fig. 1f). When the concentration threshold for forming poly-rC-rich phases was crossed, we observed the formation of three coexisting phases: a dilute phase that coexists with poly-rA- and poly-rC-rich phases, with an interface between the latter two phases (iv, Fig. 1f). Notably, poly-rC still adsorbed to the poly-rA interfaces. The transition from two coexisting phases with adsorption to three coexisting phases is known as a wetting transition48.

We observed similar wetting transitions when varying the concentration of NaCl. In 4% PEG and 0.25 M NaCl, the system formed a homogeneous solution (I, Fig. 1g). In the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, poly-rA formed condensates and poly-rC partitioned into and adsorbed onto the interface of the poly-rA-rich phase (II, Fig. 1g). Between 0.75 M and 1.25 M NaCl, we observed what Kaplan et al.48 refer to as complete wetting whereby poly-rC formed a well-defined, micron-scale layer at the interface (III-V, Fig. 1g). At 1.5 M NaCl and above, we observed a distinct poly-rC-rich phase that coexists with a poly-rA-rich phase (VI, VII, Fig. 1g). The cascade of transitions we observed for poly-rC can be explained as follows: At low salt concentrations, poly-rC is an adsorbent, forming favorable interactions with PEG molecules at the interface. Increasing the salt concentration beyond the levels that saturate the interface leads to the formation of two coexisting phases defined by favorable poly-rA and PEG interactions (the poly-rA-rich phase) and less favorable poly-rC-PEG interactions, which gives rise to the poly-rC-rich phase. The line scans show the coexistence of poly-rA-rich and poly-rC-rich phases separated by a poly-rC-rich interface (VI VII, Fig. 1g). Note that increasing the salt concentration enhances the heterotypic PEG-poly-rC interactions and homotypic poly-rC interactions.

To assess the transferability of our findings to other systems, we explored the phase behaviors of a range of RNA homopolymers. Specifically, we explored the ability of rA20, rA80, poly-rA, rC20, rC80, poly-rC, rU20, rU80, poly-rU and rG20 to adsorb onto condensates of poly-rA, poly-rC and/or poly-rU with PEG (Figs. S1 and S2). The interaction strengths between the RNA and PEG are influenced by whether the RNA is a poly-pyrimidine or poly-purine. Out of the 35 unique combinations that were explored, we observed a clear trend whereby poly-pyrimidines (rC, rU) adsorb onto dense phases rich in poly-purines. This observation is consistent with the fact that the poly-rA, which is a poly-purine, is a stronger driver of phase separation with PEG (Fig. 1a) when compared poly-rC (Fig. 1c). Taken together, our results suggest that in ternary mixtures, the differences in the relative interaction strengths determine which RNAs are scaffolds and which RNAs are adsorbents that drive phase separation and concentration-dependent wetting transitions.

Next, we compared the relative interaction strengths between PEG and different RNAs by comparing low concentration arms (dashed line) and tie lines of phase diagrams of different ternary mixtures and tie lines (solid lines) (Fig. 2a). A sample with a total composition of ϕtotal separates into a dilute phase (blue circle with composition ϕdilute) and dense phase (blue square with composition ϕdense). The tie line connects the points ϕdilute, ϕtotal, and ϕdense. The angle subtended at the intersection of the tie line with the low concentration arm of the phase boundary helps quantify the relative inclusion or exclusion of molecules in the dilute and dense phases49,50. The slopes of tie lines quantify the relative contributions of homotypic versus heterotypic interactions in the RNA and PEG system. A positive slope points to favorable heterotypic interactions driving the formation of condensates, whereas a negative slope indicates that heterotypic interactions are unfavorable. We mapped phase diagrams using a previously established microfluidics platform49,50,54, creating ~104 samples with varying amounts of RNA and PEG. The approach known as “PhaseScan” scans and sorts of a wide cross section of samples, annotating these as homogeneous (blue) or two-phase systems containing condensates (red). The totality of measurements across the entire spectrum of PEG and RNA concentrations that were scanned helps in mapping the boundary between the one-phase and two-phase regimes (Fig. 2b). Additionally, we use the concentrations of RNA in the coexisting dilute phase to infer proxies for tie lines (Fig. 2c). This is a way to leverage data from high throughput scanning and estimate a useful proxy for the actual tie line (Fig. S3).

a Tie lines show how a sample with total composition ϕ separates into a dilute phase (blue circle) and dense phase (blue square). Tie line angles quantify the repulsion versus attraction of molecules in the two phases (Fig. S3). b Using microfluidics (Fig. S4), we can delineate a phase boundary (dashed line) and obtain proxies for tie lines using dilute phase concentrations. Phase diagrams of d poly-rA (1 g/L) and e poly-rC (1 g/L) generated using a microfluidic platform. Solid lines show the tie line proxies. Phase separation requires less PEG for poly-rA (d), than for poly-rC (e). Full lines show a tie line proxy. The tie line proxy of poly-rA with PEG (c) is steeper than that of poly-rC with PEG (d). This indicates that PEG interacts stronger with poly-rA than with poly-rC. Source data are provided as a Source Data file—see “Data availability” statement.

Analysis of the microfluidics data (Fig. S4) helps with delineation of the low concentration arms of phase boundaries for the poly-rA plus PEG (Fig. 2d) and poly-rC plus PEG systems (Fig. 2e). As expected, poly-rA undergoes phase separation at lower PEG concentrations than poly-rC. The slopes of the tie line proxies are positive for both mixtures, indicating favorable heterotypic interactions between RNA and PEG and partitioning of both PEG and RNA into the dense phases. Notably, tie line proxies for poly-rA with PEG are larger than for poly-rC with PEG. This implies that the favorable interactions between poly-rA and PEG are stronger than the favorable interactions for poly-rC with PEG49,50.

Taken together with the data in Fig. 1, we arrive at a phenomenological explanation of the adsorption data. Poly-rA and PEG interact favorably, and this drives phase separation with the dense phases being enriched in both species even at moderate PEG concentrations. The favorable interactions between poly-rC and PEG are weaker when compared with poly-rA. This allows poly-rC to partition into the poly-rA + PEG rich phase. Partitioning of poly-rC into poly-rA-rich phases creates a competition between poly-rA and poly-rC. The latter cannot compete effectively for interactions within the dense phase, and as a result, the partitioning is weak, and it adsorbs onto the interface of the poly-rA-rich phase. At the interface, poly-rC can interact with PEG that is not engaged in interactions with poly-rA.

Overall, the relative strengths of the RNA-PEG interactions determine the identities of the adsorbent versus the scaffold. The adsorbent undergoes a cascade of wetting transitions based on the concentration of the adsorbent. To put these observations on a quantitative footing, we turned to computations to explore how adsorption depends on interaction strengths (Fig. 3), polymer concentration (Fig. S5), polymer length (Figs. 4 and S6) and polymer stiffness (Fig. S7).

a The interaction strengths between polymer beads used in the simulations. The interaction between beads of polymers A and B was varied from –4 to –4.5. b Molecules A, B, C represent poly-rA, PEG and poly-rC respectively. c Representative snapshots from LaSSI simulations showing distinct condensate architectures obtained by varying the interaction strength between beads of polymers A and B, |εB-A | = –4, –4.25, –4.5. For this same titration, we show d the radial density profiles and e the average cos2θ values, which indicate the average orientation of molecules with respect to the center of the condensate (Supplementary Methods). If a given datapoint had an error greater than 0.1, then that datapoint was omitted. In d and e, error bars indicate the standard errors about the mean across three replicates. Source data are provided—see “Data availability” statement.

The interaction between beads of polymers A and B was set to a |εB-A | = –4, or b |εB-A | = –4.5. The volume fractions for the three polymers are shown as a function of the distance from the center of the condensate (similar to Fig. 3d). We observe that molecule length affects partitioning into dilute or dense phase. Notably, varying length does not cause polymer C to a adsorb when it previously did not, or b stop adsorbing when it previously did. The interaction strength between the monomers has a much more extensive effect on condensate architecture and interface organization than the length of the polymer. If a given datapoint had an error greater than 0.1, then that datapoint was omitted. Error bars indicate the standard errors about the mean across three replicates. Source data are provided—see “Data availability” statement.

We modeled phase behaviors in polymer mixtures using coarse-grained, single bead per monomer representations as implemented in LaSSI55, which is a lattice-based simulation engine (Fig. 3). We simulated mixtures of three distinct homopolymers labeled A, B, and C. These bead-string-bead polymers were designed to be phenomenological mimics of poly-rA, PEG, and poly-rC, respectively. Each bead within a polymer is a Kuhn monomer that occupies a single lattice site. Distances between beads are quantified in terms of lattice units (l.u.) on the cubic lattice. For calibration, if the polymer of interest were to follow Gaussian statistics, then the mean end-to-end distance of a single chain would be n1/2 where n is the number of Kuhn monomers that make up the chain. Accordingly, for polymers comprising n = 100, 250, 300, or 400 beads, the mean end-to-end distance of Gaussian chain equivalents would be 10 l.u., 15.8 l.u., 17.3 l.u., and 20 l.u., respectively.

Polymer B is parameterized to drive condensate formation via heterotypic interactions with polymers A and C. The microscopic pairwise interactions between monomers of the polymers (εx-y) are −2 kBT for most combinations, −4 kBT for B-C and we query the effects of varying the interaction strengths for B-A (Fig. 3a, b, see Supplementary Material). Here, we used normalized units of kB = 1. By maintaining equivalent polymer concentrations and varying εB-A, we obtained three possible architectures (Fig. 3c, d).

If |εB-A | = |εB-C | = −4 kBT, then a uniform dense phase is obtained since A and C are equivalent. For |εB-A | = −4.25 kBT, the stronger B-A interaction increases the concentration of B and A within the dense phase and displaces polymer C to the condensate interface and dilute phase. If |εB-A | = −4.5 kBT, polymer C is mostly excluded from the condensate interior, but its concentration remains highest at the interface. Adsorption is observed for the polymer C characterized by its weaker interaction with the scaffold B. Notably, adsorption is observed in cases where polymer C partitions preferentially into the dense phase over the dilute phase (ii) and where it partitions preferentially into the dilute phase over the dense phase (iii).

For |εB-A | = −4.5 kBT, we investigated the effect of polymer concentration on adsorption. Simulations were performed with 100 molecules of A and B, with 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 molecules of C (Fig. S5a–f). Molecules of C adsorb preferentially to the interface, with very similar partitioning irrespective of concentration over this range. Increasing the number of A molecules or decreasing the number of B molecules reduces the number of interactions B can have with C thus increasing the dilute phase concentration of C (Fig. S5g, h). Decreasing the number of A molecules and increasing the number of B molecules has the opposite effect, increasing the partitioning of C in the dense phase (Fig. S5i, j). Notably, while partitioning is affected, molecules of C still adsorb, albeit weakly, to the interface, highlighting the importance of monomer interaction strength over polymer concentration.

Next, we consider the effect of polymer length on adsorption (Figs. S6 and S7). For molecules with a length of 250, |εB-A | = −4 kBT does not result in adsorption (Fig. 4d). Varying the length of the molecules can change the partitioning of the molecules but it does not cause polymer C to adsorb to the interface (Figs. 4a and S6). Starting in a situation where we observe adsorption for molecules with a length of 250, |εB-A | = −4.5 kBT, varying the length of the polymers again affects partitioning (Fig. S7). Notably, it does not prevent polymer C from adsorbing (Fig. 4b). We concluded that relative interaction strengths are the most important variable in determining whether polymers adsorb to interfaces.

We also considered the effect of polymer stiffness on adsorption (Fig. S8). We varied molecule stiffness using a bond angle potential of the form: u(1 − cos2θ). Here, θ is the bond angle at the intersection of three consecutive beads in a chain and u quantifies the amplitude of the stiffness. For flexible polymers, we set u = 0 whereas for stiff polymers, we set u = 200. As with flexible polymers, setting |εB-A | = −4kBT, does not lead to adsorption even for stiff polymers (Fig. S8a–f). As far as adsorption is concerned, the results for |εB-A | = −4.5 kBT are equivalent for stiff versus flexible polymers (Fig. S8a, g, h). We conclude that of the four variables considered, relative monomer interaction strength is the key determinant of condensates architecture with respect to adsorption.

Farag et al.,33 introduced an order parameter to quantify the orientation of polymers with respect to the interfaces of condensates. In their simulations, the system had only one type of polymer. We adapted their approach and analyzed the simulations to determine the orientations of polymers A, B and C in our simulations (Fig. 3e). Note that the solvent is pseudo implicit, defined by an absence of direct interactions, but the vacant sites on the lattice do represent solvent molecules. Specifically, we determined the angle θ swept out by the condensate center-of-mass, a given polymer bead i, and another bead on the same polymer that is exactly 100 beads apart from bead i. If θ is close to 0° or 180°, which corresponds to cos2θ values close to 1, then the 100-bead segment is perpendicular to the interface. In contrast, if θ is close to 90°, which corresponds to cos2θ values close to 0, then the 100-bead segment is essentially parallel to the interface. In the case of a polymer that has a random orientation, cos2θ = 0.33 (Fig. S5k).

When |εB-A| = |εB-C| = −4 kBT, all polymers have random orientations, except at the interface, where there is a bias toward perpendicular orientations. We also computed the orientational preferences in the case of adsorption realized for |εB-A | = −4.25 or −4.5 kBT. In the dense and dilute phases, orientations are random. However, at the interface, polymer A and B have an enhanced perpendicular orientation. At the highest concentration of polymer C, ~30 l.u. from the center of the condensate, we observe that polymer C has a more parallel orientation. These results suggest that in a quartenary system with three types of polymers and a pseudo implicit solvent, polymers that behave as scaffolds, namely polymers A and B, minimize the overall interfacial free energy density by adopting more orthogonal orientations at the interface. In contrast, the homopolymer C contributes to minimizing the overall interfacial free energy density by preferring a more parallel orientation. Condensate formation by the scaffold molecules A and B drives a more parallel orientation for molecules of type C because the relative interaction strengths are such that |εB-A| > |εB-C|.

Taken together with published work, the following rules emerge regarding the orientational preferences of different types of molecules at interfaces of different types of condensates. In a two-component system comprising a single type of polymer in a solvent, enhancing the driving forces for phase separation leads to a diminished preference for more perpendicular orientations of the polymer and an increased preference for more parallel orientations at the interface34,56. These results imply that there are two distinct ways to minimize the interfacial free energy density in the polymer plus solvent systems. One, which is realized via a preference for more perpendicular orientations, helps maximize the number of polymer sections at the interface while minimizing the number density of unsatisfied interactions per chain. The second, which becomes necessary as the driving forces for phase separation become stronger, is a preference for more parallel orientations. This limits the number of chains at the interface while maximizing the interfacial area covered by each chain. In the quaternary systems comprising three types of polymers and a solvent, the scaffold polymers which are stronger drivers of phase separation prefer a more perpendicular orientation when compared to the adsorbent polymers, which prefer more parallel orientations. The adsorbent provides coverage of the interface. This allows for scaffolds to prefer a more perpendicular orientation because it reduces the number density of scaffold segments that need to be exposed at the interface. Thus, the adsorbent thus provides a degree of freedom that is absent in the binary mixture comprising a single type of polymer and a solvent. It is worth emphasizing that scaffolds and adsorbents will align in directions that are both perpendicular and parallel to the interface, with there being a statistical preference of the adsorbents for more parallel orientations.

To further investigate interfacial properties of the condensates, we leveraged advances in single-molecule tracking which allowed us to ask if molecules near the interface display anisotropic motions57,58,59,60. Specifically, we tracked the movement of single poly-rA molecules (blue) in condensates near interfaces (Fig. 5a). YO-PRO-1 (oxazole yellow) is an RNA binding dye which can diffuse into a poly-rA condensate and intercalate with the RNA. Under continuous excitation, YO-PRO-1 is dark and only emits fluorescence while bound to RNA, due to its fluorogenic nature (yellow squares)61,62. Over time, and depending on the laser power, some of the dyes can be bleached (black square). At low laser power, the poly-rA-rich phase is bright, while the dilute phase is dim (i, Fig. 5b). Increasing the laser power results in significant bleaching and the middle of the poly-rA-rich phase becomes dark (ii, Fig. 5b). At very high laser power, we observe YO-PRO-1 molecules mostly near the interface, which corresponds to a full width at half maximum of ~123 nm. This is due to the combination of constant bleaching and new dye molecules entering the condensate via the interface (iii, Fig. 5b).

a YO-PRO-1 is a fluorogenic RNA intercalating dye with a strong preference for binding to poly-rA over poly-rC. Initially dark, the dye can move into the condensates and bind to poly-rA to become bright (orange). We track the location of the dye every 10 ms until it is bleached (black). b The field of view within the condensate is excited at various laser strengths, bleaching increasingly more bound dye molecules until single molecules can be localized. From diffraction-limited imaging, line profiles (schematized using dashed lines) yield mean (solid) and standard deviation (shaded) of the number of photons/pixel in (i) and (ii). Super-resolution imaging allows quantification of the localization density of YO-PRO-1 near the interface, since the condensate is constantly bleached, and fresh dye molecules move into the condensate through the interface. The histogram in (iii) shows that the full width at half maximum is ~123 nm. Six independent experiments were repeated with similar results. c The trajectory in the x and y-directions is converted to the displacement parallel (aqua) or perpendicular (red) with respect to the interface. d Trajectories (multiple displacements) of poly-rA molecules in a poly-rA-PEG condensate. e Displacements of the trajectories shown in (d). We fit the displacement information with 2D Gaussian distributions for trajectories f near interfaces and g in the interior of the condensate. Insets, scatters of (orange) interface YO-PRO-1 localizations and (gray) interior localizations. h The standard deviation in perpendicular and parallel motions for six condensates for trajectories near interfaces: poly-rA dense phase with dilute phase (rA-dil, orange), poly-rA dense phase with poly-rC adsorbed to the dilute phase (rA-rC-dil, yellow), and poly-rA dense phase with poly-rC dense phase (rA-rC, purple). Parallel motions are consistently faster than perpendicular motions. In the interior of poly-rA condensates (interior rA, dark gray) and inside of poly-rA condensates in touch with poly-rC droplets (interior rA-rC, light gray), we observe no anisotropy. Scale bars, b, 1 μm, d and insets of f and g, 500 nm, e–g, 50 nm. Source data are provided—see “Data availability” statement.

The high laser power allowed us to track single YO-PRO-1 molecules using 10 ms camera frames and eliminated signals further away from the interface. We interpret a continuous burst of fluorescence as a single YO-PRO-1 molecule emitting while bound to a single poly-rA molecule before photobleaching or dissociation. We thus obtained trajectories of the poly-rA molecules, which we converted from displacements in the x and y-directions to displacements parallel or perpendicular to the interface for each 10 ms step (Fig. 5c, d). Aligning the origin of each displacement to a common location, we were able to track the movement of molecules (Fig. 5e). To ensure an unambiguous separation between the condensate interior and interface, we chose a segmentation threshold that guards against finite size artifacts, and we split the displacement data into two segments that are within 300 nm of the interface (Fig. 5f) and further away from the interface (Figs. 5g and S9). All inferences regarding the interface come from the data segment within 300 nm of the interface. However, the interface itself is made up of a region that is at the outermost edge of the condensate, constituting a 50 nm band that can be accessed via single fluorogen tracking. We fit the trajectories constituting 104 displacements to a 2D Gaussian obtaining the mean and standard deviation (ellipses) traversed in the parallel and perpendicular directions from the starting location (black dot). We find that closest to the interface, the movements parallel to the interface are significantly faster than movements perpendicular to the interface. This effect disappears as we track movements that progressed into the interior of the dense phase. Figure 5h shows the standard deviation of poly-rA molecules movement of six condensates near three types of interfaces: poly-rA dense phase with dilute phase (pA-dil, orange), poly-rA dense phase with poly-rC adsorbed to the dilute phase (pA-pC-dil, yellow), and poly-rA dense phase with poly-rC dense phase (pA-pC, purple). These data points are off the diagonal, supporting the conclusion that motions of the dyes parallel to the interface are consistently faster than motions of the dye that are perpendicular to the interface. We did not observe anisotropies of motions within the interior of poly-rA-rich phases (interior rA, dark gray) or inside poly-rA-rich phases that are in contact with poly-rC-rich phases (interior rA-rC, light gray).

Our findings regarding the anisotropies of motions at interfaces are in accord with predictions from theory63. For a sphere near a liquid-liquid interface, a higher drag in the perpendicular direction, which translates to lower speeds in this direction when compared to the parallel direction was predicted as being a consequence of the incompressibility of a fluid-fluid interface63,64,65. Additionally, the interface may limit movement to the dilute phase and thereby reduce perpendicular motion (Fig. S10).

Overall, our findings may be summarized as follows: In ternary mixtures comprising pairs of RNA molecules forming condensates via heterotypic interactions with PEG, we find that pyrimidine-rich RNAs adsorb onto and wet the interfaces of condensates. These results allowed us to classify molecules as scaffolds or adsorbents. The classification is bolstered by simulations that reproduce the phenomenology observed in experiments. From the simulations we learned that the identities of adsorbents versus scaffolds are governed by the relative monomer interaction strengths among different molecules. Overall, in a system comprising molecules A, B, and C where A and C interact favorably with B, we obtain the following results: If the A-B interactions are stronger than the B-C interactions, then the C molecules not only partition into the A-B-rich phase, but they also adsorb onto the interface of the A-B-rich phase. Adsorption appears to be the consequence of a balance whereby the C molecules cannot outcompete the stronger A-B interactions, and they can gain access to B molecules at the interface that are not engaged in interactions with A molecules. Increasing the concentration of the C molecules, such that the threshold for phase separation with B molecules is crossed, leads to a cascade of wetting transitions that eventually lead to A-rich, C-rich, and dilute phases coexisting with one another48. While polymer concentration, length and stiffness can affect partitioning into the dense or dilute phases, the computations show that the key determinant of adsorption and condensate architecture is the relative monomer interaction strength.

The computations, which reproduced the phenomenology observed in mesoscale experiments, show that molecules at interfaces have non-random orientational preferences with respect to the planes of interfaces22,33. In the ternary system, where phase separation is designed to be driven by purely heterotypic interactions, the stronger drivers of phase separation have a more perpendicular orientation to the interface whereas the weaker drivers, which are adsorbents, prefer more parallel orientations. These results contrast with recent discoveries in condensates formed purely via homotypic interactions34,56. There, comparing across different condensates defined by different interaction strengths or valence, the stronger drivers were found to have more parallel orientations compared to weaker drivers34,56. Taken together with work regarding the interplay between homotypic and heterotypic interactions22, our findings suggest that it should be possible to tune condensate architectures and interfacial structures by modulating the relative strengths of scaffold versus adsorbent interactions in multicomponent systems.

Recent studies have shown that the viscoelasticities of condensates can be modeled using graph-theoretic adaptations of the Rouse model that capture the underlying network-like organization of molecules within condensates66,67. The eigenvalues of the graph Laplacians are sufficient for capturing the measured, frequency-dependent viscous and storage moduli66,67. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that the interfacial viscoelasticity, which likely originates from interfacial structural anisotropy, also underlies the dynamical anisotropy reported in this work. What is needed are suitable theoretical advancements that enable predictive modeling and reasoning of how adsorbents and scaffolds contribute differently to multiscale structural and dynamical anisotropies in multicomponent condensates. The corpus of simulation results furnished here provides a useful starting point for the development of the relevant theoretical formalism.

The interface is characterized by dynamical anisotropy whereby movement in the parallel direction is faster than in the perpendicular direction. There are three possible explanations for the dynamical anisotropy that we observed using single molecule tracking: The presence of a planar interface, which is a reasonable approximation of the condensate interface at length scales of a probe molecule, will generate higher drag forces in directions that are perpendicular to the interface when compared to the parallel direction63. This comes from the incompressibility of fluid-fluid interfaces. Implicit in this treatment is the contribution of the reduced dimensionality, 2D versus 3D, along the direction that is parallel to the interface64,65,68. Alternatively, differences in viscosity between the dense and dilute phases, which must be balanced at the interface69, are also likely to be contributors to the observed dynamical anisotropy. A third scenario pertains to the dynamical anisotropy being determined by the structural anisotropy that combines anisotropy observed on the mesoscale70 and the molecular-scale anisotropy that we report in this work.

Our observations, which were derived using generic, biocompatible, and biologically relevant homopolymers, help explain the phenomenology of adsorption that has been reported in cells70,71,72. Since multiphase condensates create internal interfaces27,72, we propose that the internal interfaces between dense phases might provide additional spatial and temporal control over biochemical interactions. Specifically, interfaces between coexisting dense phases, as well as interfaces between coexisting dilute and dense phases, are likely to provide distinct environments for molecules to accumulate and interact. Adsorption and wetting transitions at interfaces are also relevant for the design of condensates with tunable catalytic functions, given observations from the microdroplet literature which show that reaction efficiencies can be enhanced by orders of magnitude at the interfaces of coexisting phases73. Recent studies have shown that condensates are defined by interphase electric potentials15,40, and this can help set up interfacial electric fields39. In spatially organized condensates, there can be internal and external interfaces that can be engineered to minimize off-target reactions in biochemical reactions involving multi-enzyme pathways73.

Overall, our work shows how rules can be extracted for designing condensates with bespoke interfacial structure and dynamics. Our results highlight key physical principles that govern the formation of spatially heterogeneous condensates. Additional considerations of site- or chemistry-specific associative interactions are likely to provide further tunability to the spatial organization of macromolecules within and around condensates.

Poly-rA (MW 700-3500 kDa, 10108626001), PEG (average MW~20,000), Poly-rC (average MW 118 kDa, P4903), HEPES, NaCl, KCl, ethanol and mPEG(5k)silane were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Alexa Fluor™ 647 Carboxylic Acid, Alexa Fluor™ 488 Carboxylic Acid and RNAase free water were obtained from Thermo Fisher. PEG(20k)-AF647 was purchased from Nanocs. Sylgard 184 Elastomer base and curing agent were purchased from Dow Corning Corporation. 18 × 18 mm glass slides were purchased from Academy. 24 × 60 mm No.1.5 glass slides were purchased from DWK Life Sciences. (T)20-AF488, (C)20-AF546 and other oligos were purchased from GenScript.

The details of the preparation of imaging wells for confocal microscopy are essentially identical to those of Erkamp et al.74. As described in that work, we used PDMS slabs of 3 mm in height. These were fabricated by mixing Sylgard 184 Elastomer base and curing agent at a 10:1 ratio and heating at 65 °C for 1.5 h. All additional details are as described in Erkamp et al.74. The wells and 18 × 18 mm glass slides used to seal the top of wells were treated with PEG-silane, using a method based on recommended protocols75 and previous reports30. The treatment solution was prepared by mixing 10 mg of PEG(5000)silane with 20 µL of glacial acetic acid and 1 mL of ethanol. Wells and glass slides were treated by placing them in solution for 1 h at 65 °C and afterwards washing them thoroughly with water. Treated devices were not used after more than 3 weeks from the time of the initial treatment. These methods were essentially identical to the protocols established in previous work74.

All condensates were prepared and imaged at room temperature (~20 °C). Condensates of poly-rA and or poly-rC with PEG were prepared by mixing stock solutions in an Eppendorf tube in the following order: PEG, buffer, RNA, salt. All solutions were prepared in RNAase free water. The poly-rA and poly-rC concentrations were determined with a nanodrop machine by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Poly-rA and poly-rC were fluorescently labelled by incubation of 0.5 mol% of (T)20-AF488 or (C)20-AF546 for 3 min at 80 °C. The sample was placed in an imaging well and sealed airtight.

A Leica Stellaris 5 confocal microscope (confocal fluorescence imaging) (white light laser) microscope equipped with a 63× oil immersion Leica 1.4 NA was used for imaging. Further analysis of pictures was performed using Fiji76.

Standard lithography processes were used to fabricate the microfluidic devices54,77. The AutoCAD (AutoDesk) software was used to design the devices, which were printed on a photomask (Micro Lithography). A 45 µm layer of SU8-3050 photoresist (Microchem) was spun on a silicon wafer and heated at 95 °C for 15 min. The photomask was placed on top, and the pattern was placed onto the wafer using exposure to UV light and heating at 95 °C for 15 min. Propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) was used to remove excess unreacted SU8-3050. The wafer was dried and a profilometer was used to confirm the height of the device. PDMS at 1:10 curing agent:base ratio was placed on top of the mould and heated at 65 °C for 1.5 h. The PDMS was cleaned, holes were punched into inlets and outlets, the PDMS substrate was then bonded to glass slides using a plasma oven (30 s, 40% power, Femto, Diener Electronics). The interior of the device was treated with 1% trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (Sigma) in HFE-7500 (Fluorochem), before being dried and heated at 95 °C for 1 min.

Aqueous droplets in oil of an average volume of 100 pL were created at ~100 droplets per second using a microfluidics setup as shown schematically in Fig. S4. Specifically, a solution of fluorescently labelled 104 ng/μL poly-rA or poly-rC was mixed with a solution of fluorescently labelled 20% w/w PEG and a solution with buffer at varying rates while a constant amount of KCl solution was added, all of which were being encapsulated in fluorinated oil (HFE-7500 Fluorochem with 1% v/v fluorosurfactant), flowing at constant speed. To flow the solutions into the microfluidic device, syringes (Hamilton 1710) and syringe pumps (neMESYS modules, Cetoni) were used. Syringes were connected to the microfluidic device using tubing (PTFE, 0.012“ID × 0.030”OD, Cole-Parmer). The 100 pL droplets were created by a total aqueous flow rate of 60 μL/h and the oil flow rate of 150 μL/h. After a 5-min incubation period, the aqueous droplets in oil were imaged simultaneously at the wavelength corresponding to poly-rX (488 or 546 nm) and PEG (647 nm). These images were analyzed using a Python program54 to determine the concentrations of these compounds and the presence or absence of condensates. Additionally, the dilute phase concentration of poly-rX was determined by calibrating the intensity of 488 or 546 in an area absent of condensates to concentration poly-rX concentration. Each droplet gives information for one datapoint in Fig. 2d or 2e. The boundaries were determined using fitting that is based on support vector machine-based methods. The tie lines were fitted between the datapoints classified as being “condensates” by grouping them based on their poly-rX dilute phase concentration.

Simulations were performed using LaSSI, a lattice-based Monte Carlo engine, which allowed us to simulate large condensates without sacrificing efficiency22,33,55. Monte Carlo moves are accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis-Hastings criterion so that the probability of accepting a move is equal to min(1, exp(–βΔE)), where β = 1/kT. Here, kT is the simulation temperature (set to 55 in units of k = 1) and ΔE is the change in total system energy associated with the attempted move. Total system energies were calculated using a nearest neighbor model and the following interaction energies: eA-A =  εB-B = εC-C = εA-C = –2; εB-C = –4; εB-A was –4, –4.25, or –4.5.

Unless stated otherwise, each simulation involves 102 distinct polymers of each type. The lattice spacing is one unit L = 1 and the simulation volume is a cubic lattice comprising 150 × 150 × 150 = 3.375 × 106 lattice sites. Each bead of the polymer occupies a single lattice site. In the simplest scenario, each type A, type B, and type C chain is 250 beads long. Therefore, of the ~4 × 106 sites available to the polymers, only 7.5 × 104 sites will be occupied at any given instant. Vacant sites represent the solvent. In our analysis of simulation results, all distances between beads within a polymer or between polymers are reported in terms of lattice units and denoted as l.u. For calibration, if a chain has n beads and the chain obeys Gaussian statistics, then its mean end-to-end distance will be n1/2. Accordingly, for a chain comprising 250 beads, the mean end-to-end distance of a Gaussian chain will be 15.8 l.u.

The simulations were performed for 5 × 1010 Monte Carlo moves and were allowed to equilibrate such that the chains formed a single condensate with a coexisting dilute phase before any analysis was performed. This simulation length has been shown to be appropriate for systems of the size chosen in our work5,22,33,34. Analyses were only performed using data from the second half of each simulation. Three independent simulations were performed at each condition, and the results shown are aggregates over all replicates. Radial densities of each polymer type were normalized using the exact number of lattice sites in each radial shell. The condensate center-of-mass was taken to be the center-of-mass of the single largest network of interacting chains. The chain orientation analysis in Fig. 3 was introduced previously33,34. Here, we perform the analysis as follows: (1) for a given chain in the system, find all pairs of beads (i, j) that are exactly 100 beads apart along the chain. (2) For each pair, draw a line segment from the condensate center-of-mass to bead i. (3) Draw a line segment from bead i to bead j. (4) Determine the angle, q, swept out by the two different line segments. (5) Calculate \({\cos }^{2}{{{\rm{\theta }}}}\) and bin this value based on the distance between bead i and the condensate center-of-mass. (6) Repeat steps 1–5 for all chains in the system. (7) For each bin (as described in step 5), we report the average of the calculated \({\cos }^{2}{{{\rm{\theta }}}}\) values. If a given datapoint had an error greater than 0.1, then that datapoint was omitted.

Widefield images (Fig. 5b) with various excitation laser strengths and single-molecule image stacks (Fig. S9) were acquired with a home-built epifluorescence widefield microscope. Mixtures of 10 µL condensate systems with YO-PRO-1 solution (wide-field imaging: 0.5 µL, 1 µM; single-molecule imaging on poly-rA: 2 µL, 125 nM; single-molecule imaging on poly-rA-rC: 1 µL, 500 nM) were loaded in silicone wells (Grace Bio-Labs 665206) on cover glass and sealed to prevent evaporation for imaging. A 488 nm excitation laser (Coherent OBIS LX) was collimated above an oil-immersion objective (OLYMPUS UPLSAPO100XOPSF, NA 1.4) to illuminate the sample, and the emitted fluorescence is collected with the same objective. A dichroic mirror (Semrock FF01-523/610-25) and an emission filter (Semrock FF01-593/46) were employed for maximizing the fluorescence signal-to-background ratio. Similar to Wu et al.34 a polarizing beamsplitter split the fluorescence into two orthogonally polarized channels, and each channel was focused onto non-overlapping regions of a Photometrics Prime BSI sCMOS camera controlled via Micro-Manager (v.2.0.3). For single-molecule imaging, high-intensity illumination (~4850 W cm−2 peak) was used. Single-molecule images of YO-PRO-1 were acquired with a 10-ms exposure time for 20,000 frames for an average of ~400 photons per localization within each frame. Single-molecule imaging experiments were repeated on 6 individual condensates of each condensate system.

Localization and tracking of individual molecules was performed following the work of Wu et al.34 where we applied the same Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE-O)78 and registered the two polarized imaging channels as described previously. A Poisson maximum likelihood estimator was used to fit the standard point spread function to the single-molecule images and measure the lateral position, orientation, and brightness of each molecule. Our localization algorithm has ~16 nm localization precision. This theoretical precision is evaluated for the average fluorescence signal (400 photons) and background (8 photons/pixel) from measured events. We did not observe any YO-PRO-1 with strong orientation preferences.

All position estimates were subsequently classified and grouped into single-molecule trajectories. Molecular movements were tracked by connecting single-molecule positions between consecutive frames. Estimates from two consecutive frames were classified as the same molecule if: 1) they are the closest pair of estimates between the frames, and 2) their distance d is within the confinement radius d < 200 nm. All distances are computed in Euclidean form.

Directional displacements between each 10 ms frame and the average position of each molecule's trajectory (termed a molecule's position) were computed. The condensate interface curvature is determined by fitting a circle to the positions of a subset of molecules ( >90th percentile of those furthest from the condensate center). The deformed curvatures on poly-rA-rC condensates from different interface types (pA-pC or pA-pC-dil) were manually separated and then fitted with the corresponding circles. Directional displacements were converted into parallel and perpendicular relative to the fitted interface curvature and aligned to a common position on the interface. Independent 2D Gaussian fits were performed on directional displacement histograms in parallel-perpendicular coordinates.

Figures 1, S1, S2, S4 and S9 show representative images. Other condensates or places in the sample (>50) were observed to show similar architectures/behavior. Figure 2c, d contain information from over 104 samples (~100 pL each). The fitted phase boundaries match with phase boundaries observed for larger samples (10–100 μL, Fig. 1). Figures 3, 4, S5, S6, S7 and S8 show the mean across three replicates and error bars indicating the standard errors. Figure 5b, d, e shows data collected by imaging a poly-rA condensate over 2.5 s. Figure 5h shows the results from 6 condensates for 3 different interfaces and 2 interiors, analyzed similar to shown in 5d–g. Supplementary Table 1 shows how many displacements were analyzed for each of these events (Fig. S9). Single molecules blinking at the interface was observed in >50 condensates in all samples.

Three NASA Climate Satellites Are Dying. There's No Plan to Replace Them

Scientists are increasingly concerned about the future of Earth science under President Donald Trump as three key NASA satellites near the end of their missions with no plan for replacement

By Chelsea Harvey & E&E News

CLIMATEWIRE | The looming demise of three NASA satellites has scientists bracing for the loss of climate and atmospheric data — especially since there are no plans to replace some of the specialized instruments aboard the Earth-observing probes.

The dying missions — known as the Terra, Aqua and Aura satellites — have been a source of scientific concern for years. Launched one after the other between 1999 and 2004, NASA researchers have always known they had built-in expiration dates. Most instruments don't work properly forever, and the satellites themselves are running out of fuel, meaning they're gradually drifting out of their intended orbits.

All three could go dark within the next year. And some of the instruments they carry have no immediate replacements, meaning certain long-term datasets are poised to discontinue. These include climate and environmental measurements, from changes in the Earth's ozone layer to the solar radiation that warms the planet.

That's a big concern for climate scientists, who use these observations to track the ways the Earth is responding to greenhouse gas emissions. These measurements have grown increasingly important over the last two decades, as the planet's temperatures have climbed skyward.

“People have come to rely on them, and now they're going away,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “We've been telling people to use our data and to rely on our data, and then we're not being reliable.”

Some instruments aboard the three probes have no replacements lined up at all, while others have only short-term follow-up missions planned.

Experts say NASA's long-standing focus on innovation, coupled with funding woes, is part of the reason. NASA's budgets have remained relatively flat for years, meaning the agency is often forced to choose between older priorities and newer projects — and “given a choice they would rather do something new,” Schmidt said.

The MODIS instrument, on board both the Terra and Aqua satellites, is one cause for concern. Short for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, it provides a wide range of Earth observations including measurements of forests, clouds, glaciers and oceans.

Similar instruments exist on board certain NOAA satellites, although they don't provide measurements in the exact same ways. And even if NOAA can collect the same observations, it won't necessarily analyze the data in a similar manner.

Scientists rely on NASA to interpret the raw data it collects and package it into scientific products that can be used for specific kinds of studies. It's unclear whether NOAA will provide the same kinds of products after the NASA missions end.

NASA's CERES instruments — short for Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems — are another worry. These instruments help scientists measure the amount of solar radiation the Earth absorbs, an observation that helps them accurately track global warming.

CERES instruments currently exist on board only four satellites in the world — the Terra and Aqua satellites, plus two other missions operated by NOAA, which are also reaching the ends of their expected lifespans. There's only one future mission in the works designed to carry CERES instruments, a NOAA satellite scheduled to launch in 2027.

But that mission's estimated lifespan is only around seven years. And if all the existing CERES satellites fail before it launches, there will be major disruption to the long-term dataset.

Meanwhile, amid widespread cuts across federal agencies over the last two months, some researchers are beginning to worry about the lone follow-on mission scheduled for 2027.

“If this administration decides, ‘We don't believe in all this hogwash called global warming' and cut us, then it doesn't exist anywhere else in the world,” said one NASA researcher involved in the Terra and Aqua missions who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation from the Trump administration.

Gaps in certain long-term continuous datasets can be almost impossible to accurately fill once the disruption has occurred, the scientist added.

“It's frustrating to see we have these fundamental measurements of the climate system, they're not that expensive, but they're not being done or they're not being planned,” the scientist said. “It's kinda scary. It's unfortunate. This can't be undone.”

Some lawmakers have pushed for a detailed transition plan for the Terra, Aqua and Aura missions.

One Senate spending proposal for fiscal year 2025 originally included a request for NASA to provide "a transition plan to ensure the continuity of data between the Terra, Aqua, and Aura missions and successor missions or follow-on data sources for instruments" within 120 days.

But the language was not included in the government funding measure ultimately signed by President Donald Trump in March.

"The Terra, Aqua, and Aura missions are still providing important data years after the end of the original mission," said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), a ranking member of the Appropriations Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee in a statement provided to POLITICO's E&E News. "That's why I believe these missions are important to maintain — and wherever possible to extend. I will continue pushing to support these missions and the import insights they provide.”

Concerns over the demise of Terra, Aqua and Aura have predated the Trump administration by years. But scientists are growing increasingly concerned over the future of earth science at NASA against a backdrop of aggressive budget cuts and mass layoffs at the federal science agencies.

NASA science programs are no exception. The Trump administration already has eliminated its chief scientist role, a position formerly held by climate scientist Kate Calvin, who also served as NASA's senior climate adviser.

In a post on X earlier this month, the Department of Government Efficiency claimed it had terminated $420 million in NASA contracts — although it didn't specify the eliminated contracts or offer proof of its accounting.

“We're seeing, in my opinion, a full-scale assault against science across many different agencies,” said Rep. George Whitesides, a California Democrat and former chief of staff at NASA.

Trump's pick for NASA administrator — billionaire commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman — has yet to be confirmed by the Senate, leaving the agency's science priorities in limbo.

The Trump administration already has moved to withdraw support for climate research and climate-related grants across federal agencies, and researchers are worried the White House will seek to defund NASA's Earth-observing science programs. While NASA's funding from Congress has remained relatively flat in recent years, earth science advocates say these missions deserve more funding.

“Are we spending enough money on earth science to get the data we need to keep our communities safe? I think the answer is probably not,” Whitesides said.

“It has historically been the case that administrations that deprioritize earth science will discontinue missions,” he added. “And my sense is that's what we're seeing today. So that's my top-level concern — is funding.”

Classical computers could only imitate trye randomness. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

A large team of scientists says they've achieved “certified randomness” using a quantum computer. In a classical computer, you can never make a truly random number, which is one big reason computer scientists have had high hopes for quantum computers. Because these quantum systems involve an amount of unpredictability and entropy, simply identifying certain qualities at certain times is randomized by nature (pun intended). But who certifies the random numbers, and what can we do with them afterward?

When you ask a computer to give you a random number, code behind the scenes is doing an approximation of randomness. There are a bunch of ways they do this, including using concrete data like the time or hardware status and then scrambling it using another specific algorithm. (You can even, like cybersecurity giant Cloudflare does, use lava lamps.)  Basically, it's like shuffling a deck of cards by alternating them, over and over, until the results appear random to a user. The computer has no free will or even concept of freedom, so there's no way for it to “choose” anything without metrics or assigned values.

To be honest, people aren't better at randomness. We see actually random things and feel they don't seem random enough, because we envision a distributed randomness that is, in fact, just another pattern. The million monkeys trying to eventually type Shakespeare for us would get sidetracked by people who insist that the letters aren't being typed randomly enough. To counteract this, we roll dice or put names in a hat—but what's a computer to do?

In a 2016 literature review of quantum randomness projects, scientists now based in the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology and University College London explain the metric used for the desired level of randomness:

This unpredictability runs counter to existing computing's paradigm for randomness, which is simply hiding the moving pieces that could be predicted with enough knowledge. And importantly, it's also different than today's working paradigm of cryptography. 

Our encryption modes rely on computers multiplying, for example, very large prime numbers together. The product of two primes will only have those two large numbers as its significant factors, so something encrypted that way will only be decrypted by someone who knows at least one of the numbers.

But prime numbers are predictable, and scientists push our growing list of primes into new territory every day. In this paradigm, we're protected by the limitations of computing power to do division of extremely large numbers. This is why each generation of encryption eventually falls. 

In new peer-reviewed research in the journal Nature, a team of more than 30 authors have collaborated to generate random numbers that pass the certification test. In their test, they used a computer with 56 qubits, or quantum bits, which are the carefully built working units of quantum computers. Certain pieces of information are sent back and forth to an “untrusted” quantum server to be turned into strings of data influenced by entropy.

Terms like ‘trust' have specific meanings in cryptography. In the world of data encryption, there's an ongoing tension between methods that rely on private information—like a security key held by one or both machines that are communicating—versus those that do all their work using technology held in public (but still inscrutable) places. If your system relies on a key of any kind, that means someone could hack you and obtain that key. (It's like writing a password down on a piece of paper, which opens you to a common type of hacking called social engineering.)

In this new method, the key is made obsolete because of the strength of the random number, freshly generated each time a new number is needed, which can then be certified as random and therefore secure. Within computing systems, the randomness or pseudorandomness of numbers resulting from various generation methods is known as entropy. The numbers resulting from the new quantum method have a higher amount of entropy relative to the length of the numbers. With the right equipment, someone on the receiving end of encrypted information can ensure in realtime that the encryption is dynamic and truly random based on that entropy.

The results are randomized strings of over 70,000 bits of data. If I turn the last sentence of the previous paragraph into binary, the resulting string is only 1,384 bits long. The entire story you've read so far has been about 42,000 bits long. We're talking about very, very long and random strings—far too long and random for anyone to ever try to figure out from the outside.

The scientists say their procedure leads to numbers with levels of entropy that satisfy metrics and can be generated in a reasonable amount of time (as compared to network communications from classical computers). And it keeps trying until it succeeds. “An ideal protocol for certified randomness either aborts, resulting in an ‘abort state', or succeeds, resulting in a uniformly distributed bitstring that is uncorrelated with any side information,” the team wrote.

Quantum computers are in an awkward growing-pains phase, as teams work at fever pitch to get them ready for applications that... don't really exist yet. There hasn't been a killer app for quantum computing the way that Super Mario Bros. first made everyone realize they needed a Nintendo in the 1980s.

This research has a stated agenda, which is to make quantum computers practical. In fact, four authors are listed as patent holders via JPMorgan Chase related to this work. “[W]e demonstrate a useful beyond-classical application of gate-based digital quantum computers,” the team explains. In other words, we can start doing this now, using technology as it is today.

It's hard to believe that some of the driest, hottest places on Earth were once luscious green centers of biodiversity. The desert Rub' al-Khali—also known as “The Empty Quarter” in English—is the perfect example of this. Spanning the lower third of the Arabian peninsula, Rub' al-Khali receives an average of just 3 centimeters of rainfall each year. But a new paper suggests that the region had a lot more than 3 centimeters of water—instead of a desert, it was a lake. 

In a paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, researchers estimate that the lake once reached up to 42 meters (approximately 138 feet) deep at its deepest, and was about 1,100 m². That's nearly double the surface area of modern day Lake Geneva in Switzerland (580 m²), researcher Sébastien Castelltort explained in a press release.

According to the release, the ancient lake likely reached its largest size around 8,000 years ago during a time of heavy rainfall known as the “Green Arabia” period. Researchers believe that, at one point, extreme precipitation caused the lake to overflow, carving a 150-kilometer-long valley into the Earth. 

Scientists studied sediments and landforms in the region to determine where these floods were coming from. They concluded that the wet periods that contributed to filling the ancient lake likely came from northward expansions of African and Indian monsoons. When the lake did reach its peak size, it wasn't just a pretty sight—it may have been a crucial part of human activity in the region. 

‘‘The formation of lake and river landscapes, along with grasslands and savannahs, would have facilitated the expansion of hunting, gathering, and pastoral groups into what is now a dry, barren desert,” Michael Petraglia, a researcher on the study, said in the press release. “This is confirmed by abundant archaeological evidence found in the Empty Quarter and along its ancient lake and river systems.''

Though the conditions during the Green Arabia period were prosperous, the region eventually experienced a sharp decline in rainfall, forcing populations to migrate. While the study's findings shine a light on Rub' al-Khali thousands of years ago, they're also relevant in current climate research. 

“Understanding how past climate changes shaped both the physical environment and the distribution of human populations,” Castelltort said, according to La Brújula Verde, “is essential to interpreting today's challenges.”

After more than two decades of work, researchers have sequenced the complete genomes of six ape species. An understanding of the apes' genomes gives geneticists insights into the genetic factors that differentiate humans from our animal cousins. The results will also be key to analysing the genetic diversity of at-risk ape populations — all six species sequenced are listed as either endangered or critically endangered. “I've never thought that this would be accomplished in my lifetime,” says evolutionary geneticist and study co-author Kateryna Makova.

Human brain cells engineered to evade detection by the immune system have successfully restored muscle control in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Researchers altered eight genes in a line of human stem cells to increase their activity so they acted as an immune ‘invisibility cloak'. The cells then differentiated into nerve cells suitable for treating Parkinson's disease. The study is a step towards the development of a ‘universal' cell line that can be transplanted into anyone, to cure a raft of conditions — from type 2 diabetes to blindness — without the need for anti-rejection drugs.

54% of 4,260 global researchers who responded to a survey believe that artificial intelligence (AI) will bring more benefits to society than risks. That makes them seemingly a lot more optimistic than the general public: for example, in a similar survey just 13% of the UK public shared the same rosy view. The two groups' views were more aligned on the technology's role in disinformation, data use and cybercrime: 77% of researchers and 68% of the UK public said that AI makes misinformation a problem. The survey's most striking finding is that fewer than one-third of AI scientists think that the technologies should be developed as quickly as possible, says Robert Trager, director of the Oxford Martin AI Governance Initiative. “They seem to want a more considered approach to development to mitigate risks.”

The past decade has seen the development of a class of drugs that effectively induces sleep with fewer side effects and a lower risk of dependence compared with other sleep aids. Dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) drugs approved in the United States include suvorexant (sold as Belsomra), lemborexant (Dayvigo) and daridorexant (Quviviq). “The beauty of it is it does nothing but block the stimulation of wakefulness,” says neurologist Joe Herring.

But DORA therapies are available only in a few countries, and their high cost keeps them out of reach of many people who could benefit from them. “I'm aware that each pill I pop before bed is about the same price as ordering a fancy cocktail,” writes journalist Rachel Nuwer, who is trying the treatment after learning about it while reporting the story.

“Our beloved pet dogs have a far greater, more insidious and more concerning effect on wildlife and the environment than we would like to be the case,” write behavioural ecologists Bill Bateman and Lauren Gilson. Pets attack wildlife, disturb habitats with their scent and droppings, shed toxic flea treatments, consume vast amounts of meat and produce equivalent volumes of waste. But dog owners can do a lot to ameliorate these downsides, Bateman says. Follow leash laws, don't let your pooch chase animals, always pick up its poo and consider buying sustainable dog food, he suggests.

Researchers have created the largest and most detailed wiring diagram of a mammalian brain to date, by mapping cells in a cubic millimetre of a mouse's brain tissue. The high-resolution 3D map contains more than 200,000 brain cells, around 82,000 of which are neurons. It also includes more than 500 million of the neuronal connection points called synapses and more than 4 kilometres of neuronal wiring, all found in a tiny block of tissue in a brain region involved in vision.

Today I'm considering how to protect my favourite desk here at Nature HQ. One option is to perhaps buzz like the warty birch caterpillar. At less than two millimetres long, the larvae of the two-lined hooktip moth (Falcaria bilineata) are small, but mighty, and will vibrate their bodies on the tips of leaves to ward off competitors. It seems to work for these critters, at least about 70% of the time, so I might give it a try.

What Defines a Star?

At the lower end, and to the bitter end, defining a star is tougher than you might expect

I love simple questions that wind up having complicated—or at least not straightforward—answers. Astronomers twist themselves into knots, for example, trying to define what a planet is, even though it seems like you'd know one when you see it. The same is true for moons; in fact, the International Astronomical Union, the official keeper of names and definitions for celestial objects, doesn't even try to declare what a moon is. That's probably for the best because that, too, is not so easy.

What about stars, though? Do they also confound any sort of palatable definition?

In a very broad sense, a star is simply one of those twinkling points of light you can see in the night sky. But that's not terribly satisfying in either lexicological or physical terms. After all, we also know the sun is a star—but, by definition, we never see it in Earth's night sky, and it's certainly not a dot (unless you're viewing it from well past Pluto, that is).

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

If such a basic definition leaves us a bit dry, then perhaps we can do better. From centuries of scientific observations and theoretical physics, we can say more. Stars are massive, hot and roughly spherical. They're held together by their own gravity, and they consist of plasma (gas heated so much that electrons are stripped from its constituent atoms). And, of course, they're luminous. They shine, which is probably their most basic characteristic.

That's descriptive, certainly, but still doesn't really tell us what a star is. What makes one different from, say, a planet? Can there be a smallest star or a biggest one?

To sensibly answer such questions, we need to understand the core mechanism that makes a star luminous in the first place. Then we can use that understanding to better define what is or isn't a star.

Historically, astronomers were in the dark about this for quite some time. Many mechanisms were proposed, but it wasn't until the early 20th century that quantum mechanics came to the rescue and introduced humanity (for better or worse) to the concept of nuclear fusion. In this process, subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons—and even entire atomic nuclei—could be smashed together, fusing to form heavier nuclei and releasing an enormous amount of energy.

In a star's core, fusion takes terrific temperature and pressure that is provided by the crushing gravity of the star's overlying mass. For a star to be relatively stable, the outward force of the energy generated by fusion in its core must be balanced by the inward pull of the star's gravity.

There are a couple of different pathways for fusion to occur in stars like the sun, but in the end they both yield essentially the same result: four hydrogen nuclei (each a single proton) plus various other subatomic particles fuse together to form a helium nucleus, and this process blasts out a lot of high-energy radiation as a byproduct. In the sun, this process converts about 620 million metric tons of hydrogen into helium every second. That creates enough energy to, well, power a star.

A critical aspect here is that once this reaction starts in a star's core, it keeps going as long as there is enough nuclear material to fuel it. And while fusing through hundreds of millions of metric tons per second sounds like a lot to you and me, to a star, this is an infinitesimally tiny fraction of its mass, allowing it to keep shining for billions of years.

So now we can say with more confidence what a star is: a huge gravitationally bound mass of luminous plasma in which the energy generated from sustained nuclear fusion in its core is balanced by gravity. Huzzah!

Except (and you knew an “except” was coming) there's a lower limit to the temperature and pressure needed to sustain fusion.

For normal stars, it's about 75 times the mass of Jupiter, or one twelfth the mass of the sun. Below that mass, there's not enough pressure to kick-start the fusion process. But you might notice that no one is eagerly declaring anything dozens of times heftier than Jupiter to be a “planet,” either. In general, middling objects too massive to be planets but too lightweight to be stars are called brown dwarfs.

This is where things get fuzzy—because it turns out that brown dwarfs can sustain certain sorts of fusion reactions, too. For example, they fuse deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen with an extra neutron in its atomic nucleus. Some can even fuse lithium with protons to form beryllium, and both these processes can occur at lower temperatures and pressures than the standard “single-proton hydrogen” fusion I described earlier. Brown dwarfs can sustain such conditions in their core, albeit only for mere tens of millions of years or so. But the question remains: Are these objects stars?

For simplicity's sake, astronomers would prefer to keep brown dwarfs in their own group and not call them stars. (Perhaps we could say they go through a brief “stellar phase” of fusion after they're born.) So most of us would say that a star has to have sustained single-proton hydrogen fusion. It's still a little bit arbitrary—after all, even this fusion eventually stops, though that might take up to several trillion years for some slow-burning stars. But setting this clear limit does make some sense.

Stars have an upper limit on their mass, too. More massive stars gravitationally squeeze their core even harder, which can vastly increase the rate of fusion reactions. But that, in turn, hugely ramps up energy production, making the star hotter and brighter. If the star gets too massive, it can become so luminous that it literally tears itself apart. That limit isn't well defined, but it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 times the mass of the sun. We do see stars near this upper bound, such as Eta Carinae, and they are violently unstable, wracked by stellar paroxysms that blow out gas in humongous eruptions.

What happens, then, after a star exhausts its nuclear fuel? Eventually the hydrogen runs out, leaving behind a core made of helium. This can get very complicated, but some massive stars can then fuse that helium into heavier elements and those elements into heavier ones yet. For true stellar heavyweights—stars with more than about eight times the sun's mass—the end comes as a catastrophic supernova explosion that leaves behind a neutron star or black hole. Smaller, more sunlike stars have a more sedate demise that eventually blows off their outer layers to expose their dense, hot core to space. We call these slow-cooling stellar corpses white dwarfs.

Besides black holes—which are so extreme they merit a category all their own—astronomers tend to refer to these stellar remnants as stars, but the lexicology there is hazier. These objects used to be a part of a star that once sustained fusion but not anymore. So while we may call them stars, we know they're distinguished from “regular” stars like the sun. It's a little confusing to laypeople, but astronomers have all sorts of terms that began with good intentions but are now outdated or should be deprecated.

That makes sense; after all, the principal principle of science is that it learns. We get more data and we change our mind, though the terms we use may take a while to catch up. So for now we're stuck with some words that will possibly (hopefully) fall out of use in the future.

Planets, moons, stars: astronomers know the difference and know that at the edges, these terms can bleed into one another. Despite the fuzzy borders of these categories, recognizing the distinctions between the objects within them is what helps us understand the universe even better.

Metrics details

Ion-selective membranes are central to electrochemical technologies due to their ability to regulate ion transport and differentiate between cations and anions. However, a major obstacle to their effective implementation is the inherent trade-off between ionic conductivity and cation/anion selectivity, a consequence of the interdependence between membrane charge and water content. Here we introduce a membrane design strategy that not only achieves high charge densities but also nearly decouples charge from water content. Our strategy involves the copolymerization of low-molecular-weight charged monomers and charged cross-linkers, ensuring that every repeat unit of the polymer backbone contains a charged group. Anion-exchange membranes synthesized using this strategy exhibit ultrahigh charge densities, substantially advancing the conductivity/selectivity upper bound. We further demonstrate the practical implications of these ultrahigh-charge-density membranes for electrodialytic brine concentration, achieving a lower specific energy consumption than the state-of-the-art benchmark. This advancement in membrane design can impact the development and deployment of electrochemical systems across a spectrum of energy and environmental applications.

 Transport properties of commercial IEMs. Ionic conductivities, salt permeability coefficients, counter-ion concentrations and co-ion concentrations collected for 40 commercial IEMs characterized with 1 M NaCl (ref. 10). The calculated (normalized) single-ion diffusion coefficients, counter-ion/co-ion selectivities and counter-ion conductivities based on these data are also listed. Uncertainties are listed for ionic conductivity values representing the standard error of the average slope of 16 data points. Uncertainties listed for other experimental data represent the standard deviation of measurements performed on at least four independent samples.

Water and charge contents of IEMs from recent literature reports. Ion-exchange capacities, water uptake values, dry polymer densities, water volume fractions, fixed charge concentrations, fixed charge densities and maximum charge densities are shown for ~1,000 IEMs reported in the literature. When values were not reported by the listed source, they were calculated as discussed in our detailed report on this dataset25.

Ionic conductivities of IEMs from recent literature reports. Ionic conductivities for AEMs in the chloride counter-ion at room temperature. The data were sourced from the same references as in Supplementary Data 2. Each conductivity is accompanied by the corresponding water volume fraction.

Metrics details

Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rapid, recurring X-ray bursts from supermassive black holes, believed to result from interactions between accretion disks and surrounding matter. The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, previously stable for two decades, exhibited an increase in optical brightness in December 2019, followed by persistent active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like variability for 5 yr, suggesting the activation of a ~106-M⊙ black hole. Since February 2024, X-ray emission has been detected, revealing extreme ~4.5-d QPEs with high fluxes and amplitudes, long timescales, large integrated energies and a ~25-d superperiod. Low-significance UV variations are reported, probably related to the long timescales and large radii from which the emission originates. This discovery broadens the possible formation channels for QPEs, suggesting that they are linked not solely to tidal disruption events but more generally to newly formed accretion flows, which we are witnessing in real time in a turn-on AGN candidate.

(Top): between 2018-2024. It includes optical data from ZTF in the g (green circles) and r (red squares, divided by a factor 1.6) bands, with the total fluxes in units of mJy (shown in the left axis), and X-ray data from NICER (detections as black circles, non detections as black triangles), Swift/XRT (detections as blue diamonds, non detections as blue triangles), Chandra (pink thin-diamond), and eROSITA non detections (as purple triangles), with the X-ray luminosities in units of erg s−1 (shown in the right axis); (Bottom): zoom-in to X-ray data on dates after February 2024, when X-ray emission was detected for the first time with Swift/XRT. The X-ray luminosity is given in units of 1043erg s−1. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties in both panels.

These correspond to ObsID 0935191401 (left), 0935191501 (middle), and 0935191601 (right). The light curves are background-subtracted and grouped into 20-second bins.

The data were obtained during the quiescence state. The model is tbabs × zashift × diskbb. Strong residuals are observed around 0.7-1.0 keV band in bins 1 and 2. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties.

From top to bottom, the observations correspond to bins 1, 2, and 3 of ObsID 035191601, and bins 4, 5, and 6 of ObsID 035191401. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties.

(Top panel): From top to bottom, the observations correspond to bins 1, 2, and 3 of ObsID 035191601, and bins 4, 5, and 6 of ObsID 035191401. (bottom panels): residuals for each bin. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties.

Left: Full Swift/UVOT light curves, constructed using data collected from July 31st, 2021 until July 10, 2024, including the UVW2 (purple circles), UVM2 (pink circles), UVW1 (blue circles), U (yellow circles), B (green circles), and V (red circles) bands. The period with gyroscope issues is shown in lighter colours, and observations in the low sensitivity areas of the detector are marked as empty symbols. The dashed lines show the results of the power-law decay fit for the UV bands. We obtain power-law indices of -0.23, -0.18, and -0.11, for the UVW2, UVM2, and UVW1 band, respectively. Right: Zoom of the Swift/UVOT light curves for the period between April 10 and July 10, 2024. As a reference, we show the XMM-Newton/OM fluxes in squares. Note that the transmission curves of Swift/UVOT and XMM/OM are not exactly the same.

The orbital period of the EMRI is fixed by the observed QPE periodicity, while the properties of the inner disk are set so it completes a precession cycle every 25 days. The upper area represents cases in which the EMRI eccentricity is too high, resulting in a pericentre that always go through the cavity. In the lower area the EMRI has a wider pericentre, and always crosses the disk. In the middle area the EMRI sometimes crosses the disk and sometimes goes through the cavity, potentially explaining the behaviour observed in Ansky.

The solid lines show the cumulative flux density for four different wavelengths. The dashed lines of the corresponding colors show the measured flux densities for each band and the vertical lines mark the truncation radii needed to satisfy each observed flux. The dotted line shows the cumulative bolometric luminosity integrated from the same disk model as a function of outer truncation radius, divided by the Eddington luminosity. The error band marks the effect of a 10% uncertainty in the g-band band flux, for this non-simultaneous observation. In the top panel the accretion rate is set to match the UVW2 flux at a truncation radius of 330 Rg, expected for the size of a TDE disc. This truncation radius under-predicts the optical flux by a factor of 2. In the bottom panel the truncation radius and accretion rates are fit to match the measured fluxes in the optical and UV bands simultaneously. Notice the different dynamical range of the y-axis on both plots.

Metrics details

Early, efficient Parkinson's disease (PD) tests may facilitate pre-symptomatic diagnosis and disease-modifying therapies. Here we report elevated levels of PD-specific transfer RNA fragments carrying a conserved sequence motif (RGTTCRA-tRFs) in the substantia nigra, cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with PD. A whole blood qPCR test detecting elevated RGTTCRA-tRFs and reduced mitochondrial-originated tRFs (MT-tRFs) segregated pre-symptomatic patients with PD from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.75 versus 0.71 based on traditional clinical scoring). Strengthening PD relevance, patients carrying PD-related mutations presented higher blood RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs ratios than mutation-carrying non-symptomatic controls, and RGTTCRA-tRF levels decreased in patients' blood after deep brain stimulation. Furthermore, RGTTCRA-tRFs complementarity to ribosomal RNA and the translation-supporting LeuCAG3-tRF might aggravate PD via translational inhibition, as reflected by disrupted ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs in depolarized neuroblastoma cells. Our findings show tRF involvement in PD and suggest a potential simple and safe blood test that may aid clinicians in pre-symptomatic PD diagnosis after validation in larger independent cohorts.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease1. PD poses major clinical, social and financial burdens to society2 and is characterized by progressive movement disabilities, tremors and cognitive impairments. These symptoms result from premature death of dopaminergic neurons, especially in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN)3, that are caused by oxidative and nitrative stress3,4,5,6, enhanced mitophagy7, impaired autophagy8, neuroinflammation and dopaminergic/cholinergic imbalance9.

PD diagnosis often follows considerable neuronal damage manifested as severe motor impairments, such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremors10. However, earlier symptoms, including smell loss and rapid eye movement sleep disorders, may appear years beforehand. Molecular changes characteristic of this early disease phase may constitute a basis for a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test. Such a test should be cost-effective, rapid and capable of detecting changes in biomarker levels at the earliest disease stages, confirming true-positive cases and minimizing false-positive ones. Recent PD diagnostic tests have focused on elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the α-synuclein (α-Syn) protein or reduced blood mitochondrial DNA as biomarkers11,12,13,14. However, CSF sampling is invasive; purification and detection of α-Syn are cumbersome and insufficiently sensitive15; and measurements of specific proteins show high inter-individual variability. In contrast, quantification of multiple molecules, rather than one, can improve signal-to-noise ratios and overcome the variability between patients16,17,18,19,20,21. Attempting to prevent invasive tests, certain blood molecules were proven to reflect cerebral pathology22. Ideally, an easy, safe and affordable diagnosis should be based on multiple highly sensitive and specific blood biomarkers23.

Transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) are 16–50 nucleotide (nt)-long, non-coding RNAs originating from multiple nuclear or mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Several enzymes cleave tRNAs to yield tRFs: angiogenin (Ang) generates 5′-half and 3′-half tRFs, whereas Ang, Dicer24,25 and other nucleases yield 5′-tRFs, i-tRFs and 3′-tRFs26. Because tRFs harbor repetitive sequence motifs inherited from their parental tRNAs, changes can be detected in an entire family of closely related transcripts, albeit of different origins and types, produced by different endonucleases20,21,27, and originating from either nuclear or mitochondrial genomes. Correspondingly, tRFs may reflect transcriptional changes or malfunctions in both the nucleus and the mitochondria27, whose DNA is known to be damaged in PD14,28,29. Intriguingly, altered Ang levels, Ang mutations and Ang-produced tRFs may exert both PD-protective and cytotoxic roles30,31,32,33. Furthermore, blood cell tRF levels present diagnostic value in various diseases, including ischemic stroke34, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis35, epilepsy36 and cellular or organismal stress26,34. Accordingly, tRFs emerge as the perfect candidates for a blood-based PD biomarker.

To challenge the hypothesis that multiple tRF-derived sequences could yield informative PD biomarkers, we searched for tRF families that share common sequence motifs whose levels are changed in the brain, blood and/or CSF of patients with PD—all biofluids known to reflect cerebral pathologies, including PD22,37. Using different datasets that account for distinct biofluids and stages of the disease allowed us to study the PD links of those tRFs whose levels had been altered in unrelated cohorts of different population origins.

To seek PD-characteristic tRF profiles, we analyzed a short RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset (phs.000727)38 consisting of postmortem (PM) CSF samples from 46 patients with PD, from 53 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and from 53 healthy controls (15, 27 and 24 females, respectively; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1a,b). Accounting for patients' age, sex and PM interval (Extended Data Fig. 2a; edgeR; Methods), we identified elevated levels of nuclear-originated tRFs in patients with PD compared to controls (N-tRFs; average levels in control (Ctrl) and PD: 980,165 and 990,387 counts per million (CPM), respectively). All but one of these were 3′-tRFs or i-tRFs that were over 35 nt long, excluding them from functioning as microRNAs39 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). We also detected reduced levels of mitochondrial-originated tRFs (MT-tRFs; average levels in Ctrl and PD: 19,834 and 9,612 CPM, respectively; Fig. 1b)14,28, most of which are long 3′-tRFs (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). The PD-elevated N-tRFs and reduced MT-tRFs phenomena were consistent in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c) but were absent in AD (Fig. 1c), reflecting non-random PD-altered CSF tRF profiles37.

Colors are as in b.

Pursuing PD RNA biomarkers, we sought common motifs shared by the elevated N-tRFs using the Multiply Elicited Motif Entities (MEME) tool40. This tool detected multiple tRFs sharing the sequence [A/G]GTTC[A/G]A (RGTTCRA-tRFs; Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c), most of which were over 30 bases long (average levels: Ctrl = 79,901, PD = 92,836, AD = 83,068, CPM for RGTTCRA-tRFs >30 bases). Binomial tests confirmed that RGTTCRA-tRFs are mostly elevated and MT-tRFs are mostly reduced also when analyzing each sex separately (Extended Data Fig. 2 and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. 2). Notably, RGTTCRA-tRFs were derived from numerous nuclear-originated tRNA genes, none of which was downregulated in the CSF of patients with PD, and all of the CSF-elevated tRFs lacking this motif were shorter than 30 bases (Fig. 1b). Together, this indicates that the shared motif embedded in RGTTCRA-tRFs might reflect disease-related features (Supplementary Table 2 lists all of the tRNA genes carrying the PD motif).

Parallel analysis comparing patients with AD to controls in the same dataset revealed unchanged profiles of MT-tRFs and RGTTCRA-tRFs (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the median levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs longer than 30 bases were higher in patients with PD than in either healthy controls or patients with AD (P < 0.038 and P < 0.062, respectively, Dunnett test, false discovery rate (FDR)). The PD-specific accumulation of RGTTCRA-tRFs and decrease of MT-tRFs in CSF identified both of these subfamilies as promising PD biomarker candidates.

To seek pathological implications of RGTTCRA-tRF accumulation, we conducted small RNA-seq of SN from eight PM patients with PD sourced from the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB) (Supplementary Figs. 1a,b and 2h and Supplementary Table 3; data deposited in GSE256334). Supporting our CSF findings, elevation of RGTTCRA-tRFs (average levels = 91,856 CPM) and reduction of MT-tRFs (average levels = 54,123 CPM) accompanied higher Braak Lewy body scores in patients with PD (Fig. 1d).

Seeking the cleavage enzymes responsible for the altered RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs (Fig. 2a), we analyzed a dataset of Ang overexpression in HEK293T and knockout in U2OS cells (GSE130764; Supplementary Table 4)41. Ang overexpression elevated the percentage of RGTTCRA-tRFs, but not of MT-tRFs, in HEK293 cells (P < 0.0093 and P < 0.375, respectively, t-test, FDR; Fig. 2b–d). However, Ang knockout had no overt effects on these tRF families (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. 3). Therefore, Ang emerged as sufficient but not essential for producing RGTTCRA-tRFs or MT-tRFs.

For RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs in advanced patients: ***P < 0.00015 and *****P < 8 × 10−11, respectively, two-way ANOVA. For MT-tRFs in early Genetic patients: #P < 0.057, two-sided Mann–Whitney test, FDR correction. h, RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs ratio in the above six groups. *P < 0.02 and ****P < 0.00044 for early Idiopathic and Genetic patients, respectively, and P < 0.0013 for PD versus Ctrl in all groups. Two-way ANOVA. All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

To test the utility of RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRF levels as diagnostic biomarkers, we performed small RNA-seq of NBB PM blood samples from patients with PD and controls (Ctrl, n = 16 and PD, n = 21; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 5; data deposited in GSE256334) and used Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data (Supplementary Table 6) from idiopathic non-deep brain stimulation (DBS)-treated patients from timepoint V08 (2 years after first evaluation; Idiopathic; PD, n = 252 and Ctrl, n = 133) and the latest timepoint available for PD-related mutation carriers with or without symptoms (Genetic; PD, n = 55 and Ctrl, n = 16).

Mutation-carrying living PPMI PD patients showed a trend of reduction in blood MT-tRF levels compared to unaffected mutation-carrying controls (P < 0.057, Mann–Whitney, FDR; Fig. 2g). In comparison, PM blood samples from advanced NBB PD patients presented elevated RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs (P < 0.00015 and P < 8 × 10−11, respectively, ANOVA; ‘Advanced'; Fig. 2f,g).

The observed PM elevation in blood MT-tRF levels contrasts with the MT-tRF reduction seen in the PD CSF and SN (Fig. 1b,d) and may reflect mitochondrial degradation in PM blood, which yields higher levels of mitochondrial RNA fragments42. Indeed, although levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs were not affected by sample RNA integrity number (RIN), MT-tRF levels were negatively correlated with the sample's RIN (MT-tRFs: r = −0.4, P < 0.025; RGTTCRA-tRFs: r = −0.14, P < 0.4; FDR, Spearman correlation), indicating that the elevated levels stem from the PM status rather than the PD status. Supporting this notion, SN tissues revealed reduced mitochondrial tRNA levels, which continued declining with disease duration (r = 0.4, P < 0.05, Spearman correlation; PD versus Ctrl P < 0.039, Mann–Whitney test; Extended Data Fig. 3c).

To develop a biomarker assay that can easily compare among patients regardless of the need to account for RNA concentrations and library depth, we calculated the ratio between RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs. This ratio was elevated in PD versus Ctrl (Fig. 2h; P < 0.0013, ANOVA), especially in early mutation-carrying patients (Early Idiopathic patients P < 0.02, Early Genetic patients P < 0.00044, ANOVA). Strengthening the notion that blood tRFs have the capability of capturing inter-individual variations, we found that blood tRF levels create a patient-specific fingerprint that maintains stability over time, positioning them as promising candidates for biomarkers (Supplementary Information: ‘Blood tRF levels create a patient-specific fingerprint').

We next challenged the value of the RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs ratio for pre-symptomatic PD detection. To do so, we compared prodromal PPMI patients (showing pre-symptomatic PD signs, albeit without a clinical PD diagnosis) at the earliest tested timepoint (n = 60) to matched healthy controls (n = 128) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 7). A subset of 60 controls optimally matched to the prodromal patients was formed based on sex, age and collection batch of patients.

All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

To create a primer-based separation reflecting the variability between controls and prodromal PD patients, we sought two single in silico polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer pairs that can recognize numerous RGTTCRA-tRFs or MT-tRFs. We designed quantitative PCR (qPCR)-suitable 14-nt-long sequences that include the PD motif and are shared among at least 100 different RGTTCRA-tRFs (Methods). For every patient, we summed the counts of all RGTTCRA-tRFs, including each 14-nt sequence, and selected the one that led to the largest median difference between PPMI prodromal patients and healthy controls (GGTCCCTGGTTCAA, shared among 285 RGTTCRA-tRFs from different tRNAs of distinct chromosomal origins, average levels of 550 CPM; P < 0.013, Mann–Whitney). Next, we similarly selected a sequence shared between the maximum number of MT-tRFs that maximizes the median difference between prodromal and controls and minimized the standard deviation within each group (TAACTTAGCATTAACCTTTTAA, shared among 106 Lys tRNA-originated MT-tRFs, average levels of 90 CPM).

For each patient, we divided the sum of RGTTCRA-tRF counts (all carrying the GGTCCCTGGTTCAA sequence) by the sum of MT-tRF counts (all carrying the TAACTTAGCATTAACCTTTTAA sequence) to yield an RGTTCRA/MT score. The RGTTCRA/MT score of each control or prodromal patient from a matched pair was then divided by the pair's mean to yield a normalized score (hereafter ‘tRF-score'). Next, we employed a gradient boosted machine learning (GBM) classification algorithm (five cross-validations; Methods) to subgroup the samples into prodromal PD patients and controls, considering their ethnicity, by clinical measurements of Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scores or by the tRF-score described above. This resulted in areas under the curve (AUCs; representing the ability to segregate the patients into control and prodromal groups) of 0.73 for the clinical measurement (specificity = 0.78, sensitivity = 0.583, positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.761, negative predictive value (NPV) = 0.61) compared to an AUC of 0.86 (specificity = 0.867, sensitivity = 0.7, PPV = 0.84, NPV = 0.743) for the tRF-score (Fig. 3a,b). In comparison, classification using mixed labels (null) in both clinical and tRF measurements yielded a non-significant AUC value of 0.43. Further validation using 10,000 permutations, each time sampling 60 different controls, confirmed these results, as did a logistic regression algorithm replacing GBM (receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-AUC of 0.83 compared to 0.70 using clinical measurements; Extended Data Fig. 4a).

To test if our findings reflect the biological role of these motifs rather than training of the algorithm, we ran the exact same GBM-based process 10,000 times on ratios between random motifs (lacking the RGTTCRA sequence and appearing in at least the same number of tRFs as the RGTTCRA motifs and the MT motifs; Methods). The mean AUC received for the ratio between random motifs was 0.768 (s.d. = 0.0537), and 99% of the AUCs were lower than 0.81 (Fig. 3c). These findings support the notion that the AUC resulting from the tRF-score reflects a biological rather than a mere training phenomenon.

PD symptoms often reflect patients' genetics and ethnic origins. Therefore, we tested the ability to segregate patients to prodromal and control groups based on their genetic and ethnic backgrounds. The tRF-score enabled segregating all subpopulations (Fig. 3d; P < 2 × 10−10, ANOVA), even when examining the non-normalized ratio (Extended Data Fig. 4b; P < 5 × 10−6, ANOVA). Thus, two-thirds of prodromal patients scored as 6 or higher, whereas two-thirds of controls scored lower than 6 (P < 4 × 10−5, chi-square test). An exception was Black control and prodromal patients who had similar tRF-scores. However, their UPDRS scores revealed the same trend (Extended Data Fig. 4c), potentially suggesting that our test reflected real-life clinical measurements in these patients as well. Nonetheless, although the tRF-score measurement was similar between prodromal and diagnosed PD patients, the UPDRS score of prodromal patients was akin to that of controls and differed dramatically from that of patients with PD (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Further indicating a link between our two motifs and the clinical measurements, the tRF-scores of the optimally matched prodromal and control patients presented positive correlation with the total UPDRS score (r = 0.27, P < 0.01; FDR, Spearman correlation; Extended Data Fig. 4e) and with the scores of subsections II and III of the UPDRS test (I: r = 0.19, P < 0.06; II: r = 0.245, P < 0.0163; III: r = 0.318, P < 0.004; FDR, Spearman correlation; Extended Data Fig. 4f).

Next, we tested the GBM algorithms trained on the optimally matched data (60 prodromal, 60 controls) on the fully matched data (60 prodromal, 128 controls) (Methods). Both algorithms, whether trained on the tRF-score or on clinical parameters, presented far better classification abilities than random classification (Extended Data Fig. 4g; P < 5 × 10−14, P < 3 × 10−7, chi-square test, FDR). However, the tRF-based measurements performed better than the clinical ones (P < 0.0081, chi-square test). To re-challenge these observations, we tested the tRF-score-based algorithm on a holdout validation sample, including 33 prodromal samples and 33 matched control samples consisting of the second-earliest timepoint of the patients used for cross-validation (discovery sample) (Methods and Supplementary Table 7). The algorithm successfully distinguished prodromal patients from controls (P < 0.0004, t-test; AUC of 0.75, confidence interval (CI) = 0.63–0.86, specificity = 0.727, sensitivity = 0.606, PPV = 0.69, NPV = 0.649; Fig. 3e,f), re-demonstrating the algorithm's efficacy and the ability of the tRF-score to identify prodromal patients. In comparison, testing the algorithm trained on the clinical measurement on the holdout validation sample yielded a weaker separation between control and prodromal patients (AUC of 0.71, CI = 0.65–0.78, specificity = 0.523, sensitivity = 0.777, PPV = 0.58, NPV = 0.734; Methods). Together, the tRF-score performed at least as well as the clinical measurement and, in certain cases, better than the clinical tests, both on the cross-validated discovery sample and on the holdout validation sample.

In subsequent tests, PD diagnosis was established for 21 of those 60 studied prodromal PPMI patients (with the rest yet undiagnosed). Comparing the tRF and UPDRS scores of these 21 patients to those of controls yielded a more significant separation by the tRF-score (P < 1.1 × 10−5 versus P < 7 × 10−3, t-test, FDR; Fig. 3g,h). Furthermore, 18 of the 21 patients whose PD diagnosis had been confirmed were ranked higher by their tRF-score than by their UPDRS score (Extended Data Fig. 4h), again emphasizing the advantage of using the dual tRFs measurement. In later stages of PD with overt motor symptoms (Supplementary Table 8), clinical measurements perfectly separated patients from controls (AUC of 1), which left no room for added value of other biomarkers. We conclude that the two-primer-based tRF-score emerges as a reliable PD biomarker already in the earliest disease stages and especially in combination with clinical or other available measurements.

To segregate patients with PD from controls based on a manual qPCR-based tRF test, we drew blood from 10 patients with PD, from 10 patients with head trauma and from 10 controls from the Jerusalem Shaare Zedek Medical Center (JLM cohort; Supplementary Table 9). We used the two probes described above (ΔCq = RGTTCRA-tRF − MT-tRF; Methods) and normalized the ΔΔCq separately for each sex (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1j). Notably, patients with PD presented significantly higher ratios of RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs than either controls or patients with trauma, which showed similar values (Fig. 3i,j; P < 0.05, P < 0.013, Dunnett test).

To further validate the capacity of our qPCR test to selectively amplify the RGTTCRA motif, we subjected the amplicons of two qPCR reactions (JLM cohort, one patient with PD and one patient with trauma) to small RNA-seq. In both samples, over 50% of the reads (compared to 0.3–10% in biological samples) were mapped to tRFs, all carrying the RGTTCRA motif, with most derived from the same tRNA region but from different tRFs (Extended Data Fig. 4i and Supplementary Table 10). These findings provide experimental evidence supporting the notion that our qPCR test primarily detects tRFs that include the RGTTCRA motif and can quantify their levels in patients' blood.

To address the consistency of our findings in other tissues, we tested 17 PD SN samples (six females) and six matched control SN samples (three females) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NeuroBioBank collection (Supplementary Table 11). Because tRFs expressed in the brain are slightly different than those in the blood, we designed a brain-adapted RGTTCRA-tRF primer (CGGGTTCGATTCCC; Methods) to maximize the number of detected RGTTCRA-tRFs. Our qPCR assay identified higher RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs ratios in PD than in Ctrl (Fig. 3i,k; P < 0.0452, t-test). Together, our findings in blood and brain demonstrated that the signal of motif-carrying tRFs identified in sequenced blood samples from prodromal and PD patients can be translated into simple dual qPCR blood tests.

Although MT-tRF reduction reflects well-studied PD-related mitochondrial dysfunction28,29 that potentially leads to reduction in MT-tRFs, our finding of RGTTCRA-tRF accumulation might reflect biological activities accelerating PD progression. In this context, four different tRFs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were shown to interrupt translation by interacting with ribosomal RNA (rRNA), in regions other than tRNA binding sites43. Interestingly, we found all four to include the PD motif. Furthermore, we identified a region complementary to the RGTTCRA-tRF sequence in the leucine tRNA-derived tRF (LeuCAG3′) that was reported to be essential for assembly of the translation complex, protein translation and cellular viability44 (Fig. 4a,b). Correspondingly, minimal energy assessment (RNAup)45 predicted a thermodynamically preferred interaction (total energy of −10.46 kcal mol−1) of RGTTCRA-tRFs with the ribosome-essential LeuCAG3′ tRF (Fig. 4b), far lower binding energy than all other 1,017 CSF-identified tRFs (P < 1 × 10−30, t-test; Fig. 4b).

Right, secondary structures of 18S and 28S rRNA showing RGTTCRA motif-complementary sequences (red). All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

Supporting the ribosome-binding prediction, we found sequences complementary to the PD motif that are not involved in a secondary structure in both the 18S and 28S rRNAs and are, hence, amenable to hybridization (Fig. 4a,c). Correspondingly, RGTTCRA-tRFs were predicted to bind more strongly to 18S and 28S rRNAs than all other CSF tRFs (P < 2 × 10−25, P < 3 × 10−67, t-test, FDR; Fig. 4c). The predicted binding of RGTTCRA-tRFs to both the LeuCAG3′ tRF and the rRNA may lead to a ‘dual-lock' mechanism interrupting both initiation and execution of translational processes (Fig. 4a). Indeed, 3 h of translation-interfering arginine or leucine starvation in three human-originated cell lines46 led to enrichment of ribosome-bound RGTTCRA-tRFs (P < 0.023, P < 0.027, Dunnett test; Extended Data Fig. 5a and supplementary text).

We next employed Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)47 with pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c) to assess the proximities between RGTTCRA-tRF (that is, donor fluorophore-labeled RGTTCRA-tRF probe) and ribosomes (that is, acceptor fluorophore tagging an antibody to the ribosomal protein RPL24) (Extended Data Fig. 5c). The fluorescence lifetime (τ) of the acceptor fluorophore was longer after donor excitation (FRET-sensitized acceptor fluorescence) than after direct acceptor excitation (directly excited acceptor fluorescence; 1.36 ns versus 1.00 ns; Extended Data Fig. 5d). The delayed acceptor fluorescence after donor excitation may reflect a signature of FRET between the donor–acceptor pairs48 and, hence, close proximity (<10 nm) of RGTTCRA-tRFs with ribosomes (Extended Data Fig. 5d,f), supporting direct interaction between RGTTCRA-tRFs and the ribosome.

DBS of the subthalamic nucleus suppresses PD tremor symptoms through an incompletely understood mechanism of action49,50. To search for RGTTCRA-tRF links to the disease symptoms, we studied the effect of DBS on blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels in 19 DBS-treated patients with PD of the PPMI cohort carrying LRRK2 (ref. 51) or GBA mutations (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 12). Non-DBS-treated PD patient carriers of the same PD-causing mutations (n = 11) showed higher RGTTCRA-tRF levels than apparently healthy carriers of these mutations (n = 9; P < 0.027, ANOVA). In comparison, the DBS-treated mutation-carrying patients presented lower RGTTCRA-tRF levels than non-DBS-treated patients (P < 0.095, ANOVA; Fig. 5b), equivalent to the levels of the apparently healthy mutation-carrying controls (P < 0.6, ANOVA; Fig. 5b). MT-tRFs showed no significant difference between DBS-treated and the other groups (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The clinical capacity of DBS to effectively co-suppress blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels and tremor symptoms suggests that RGTTCRA-tRF blood levels may be related to the tremor profiles of PD patients.

Seeking potential causes for the reduced percentage of RGTTCRA-tRFs out of total tRFs, and considering that DBS alters blood transcript profiles52 as well as the effect of Ang on RGTTCRA-tRF levels, we measured Ang levels in DBS-treated patients and controls. For this purpose, we used our microarray dataset, GSE23676 (ref. 52), consisting of blood taken from six controls and seven patients with PD (all males), where PD blood was drawn before DBS surgery or several months after DBS treatment (Fig. 5a, Soreq dataset; Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 13). Interestingly, Ang mRNA levels were similar in controls and patients with PD (before DBS) but decreased in six of the seven patients with PD after DBS (P < 0.019, ANOVA; Fig. 5c), possibly reflecting a limited post-DBS capacity to produce tRFs.

To examine the effects of electrical stimulation (such as DBS) on RGTTCRA-tRFs, we mined a short RNA-seq and ribosomal profiling dataset (GSE155727)53 from SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells harvested before, immediately after or 2 h after electrophysiological depolarization (2 h post depolarization (pDP); Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 14). Immediately after depolarization, the cytosolic fraction of these cells showed reduced RGTTCRA-tRF shares, followed by re-elevation 2 h later (reminiscent of our findings in DBS-treated patients; Fig. 5e; resting versus depolarization, P < 0.01; resting versus 2 h pDP, P < 0.015; depolarization versus 2 h pDP, P < 0.0001, ANOVA). The re-elevation of RGTTCRA-tRFs share was accompanied by reduced cytosolic MT-tRFs share (Fig. 5f; P < 0.0033, ANOVA). Although depolarization did not immediately change the ribosomal-bound fraction of RGTTCRA-tRFs, this fraction was reduced 2 h later (Fig. 5e; 2 h pDP versus resting, P < 0.015; 2 h pDP versus depolarization, P < 0.0065, ANOVA). The distribution of tRFs to MT-tRFs, RGTTCRA-tRFs and all other tRFs was further altered 2 h pDP in the ribosome-bound fraction of three samples compared to the mean distributions of this fraction in resting cells (P < 0.006, P < 0.022, P < 0.024, chi-square, FDR; Fig. 5f).

Because RGTTCRA-tRFs mainly belong to the 3′ and i-tRF subtypes, we compared the fraction of RGTTCRA-tRFs in these specific subtypes and found the same association patterns as described above (Extended Data Fig. 6b and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. 6). Although RGTTCRA-tRFs constituted a small portion of the total cytoplasmic short RNAs, their share of the ribosomal-associated RNAs was roughly 10-fold higher (P < 8 × 10−11, ANOVA; Fig. 5f). Our FRET findings, together with the selectively weakened ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs within 2 h after electrophysiological depolarization, suggest that the depolarizing qualities of DBS may impact the ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs. Altogether, RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs showed selective and distinct co-regulation under electrophysiological stimuli at both the cellular and organismal levels.

From our study, tRFs carrying a repetitive motif emerged as potentially suitable biomarkers that may constitute patient-specific ‘fingerprints' and carry short conserved sequence motifs that enable single measurement of multiple tRFs. Intriguingly, we found that RGTTCRA-tRFs accumulate in the brain, CSF and blood of male and female patients with PD at diverse disease stages but not in matched controls or in patients with AD. Moreover, motif-carrying RGTTCRA-tRFs consistently showed linkage to PD symptoms and disease stages, and their levels were elevated in correlation with Lewy body scores in patients' SN. Additionally, part of the identified RGTTCRA-tRFs stem from tRNAs that carry phenylalanine or cysteine amino acids, known to be the rate-limiting factors in the dopamine synthesis and in glutathione reductase antioxidant mechanism, respectively. Thus, shortage of these intact tRNAs (as they are enzymatically cut into the observed tRFs) may correspond to impaired dopamine synthesis54 or to processes that limit cellular antioxidation55. Compatible with the known mitochondrial damage in PD28 (which leads to general reduction in mitochondrial transcript levels), we further found reduced levels of MT-tRFs in the CSF and SN of idiopathic PD patients and in the blood of early PD patients carrying disease-related mutations.

Our segregation algorithm focused on prodromal patients rather than patients at later stages of PD because it is these early disease stages that call for biomarker development, especially as, in later stages, clinical measurements suffice to determine a clear diagnosis of PD. Correspondingly, the ratio of RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs segregated early prodromal patients from healthy controls as well as or even better than those of the gold standard clinical UPDRS and H&Y measurements. This could indicate that the ratio of RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs may serve as a potential diagnostic tool for the earliest stages of PD, especially in combination with other available pre-symptomatic detectors. To our knowledge, this evaluation, which is based on publicly available data sources and manual tests, is the first to identify the power of blood tRFs as PD biomarkers. Nonetheless, this cross-sectional study calls for longitudinal studies following patients throughout disease progression to offer insights into biomarker changes and treatment outcome.

As modern medicine aims to achieve patient-specific therapeutics, it is crucial for biomarker assays to compensate for inter-individual variabilities in measured values. Capturing multiple nuclear-originated and mitochondrial-originated tRFs using a dual primer qPCR blood-based assay may fulfill this demand. Specifically, our tRF-based score was designed to enable patient-tailored diagnosis, where the qPCR values determined for a certain patient will be compared to those of healthy volunteers or patients with PD of the same sex, ethnicity and genetic background, thus sparing the need for complex matching and normalization. Indeed, manual running of this dual qPCR test showed that the tRF-score segregated patients with PD from controls without the need for machine learning algorithms.

Notably, our study relied predominantly on samples from specific demographics, and, as such, the results might not be universally applicable to all populations. Thus, that the tRF-score was similar in prodromal African American patients and matched controls paralleled an identical trend in H&Y and UPDRS scores in this cohort, strengthening the notion that this score represents a true effect and calling for further studies of such patient-matched tests and validation in diverse patient cohorts.

Notably, too, blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels were effectively reduced under DBS stimulation, suggesting a linkage among tremor symptoms, electrical stimulus and the cellular localization and activities of these tRFs. Furthermore, yeast tRF research done by others43 and interaction predictions suggest that RGTTCRA-tRFs bind to the ribosome, potentially in an evolutionarily conserved translation-arresting manner. These findings are compatible with our FRET measurements and with the observation of ribosomal association and depolarization-triggered ribosomal dissociation of RGTTCRA-tRFs in cultured neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, as Ang may contribute to the synthesis of RGTTCRA-tRFs, our findings call for in-depth examination of the therapeutic potential of carefully adjusting its activity in the brains of patients with PD.

Mitochondrial death is a hallmark characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases56,57 and was suggested as a blood biomarker in AD58,59. However, recent blood-based tests of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD14 reported that, in genetic cases, mitochondrial DNA damage was observed irrespective of a PD diagnosis14, highlighting the need to add other biomarkers to such tests. In this context, our combined nuclear/mitochondrial RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs measurements enable segregating genetic PD patients from apparently healthy unaffected controls carrying the same PD-related mutations. An in-depth comprehensive analysis of larger patient cohorts will be needed to better determine the efficacy of our tRF-based measurement in comparison to other blood-based PD biomarkers.

The availability of an early, reliable and rapid blood test for PD diagnosis may potentially alleviate the burden of uncertainty from suffering individuals, assist clinicians' care of those patients early in the disease process and open routes for developing and testing new therapeutics. To achieve these goals, an efficient diagnostic test should (1) provide accurate and disease-specific results, (2) avoid complex neurosurgical procedures, (3) entail minimal risks to the tested patients, (4) be easy to perform and (5) be inexpensive. Unlike CSF-based tests that can be risky, costly and dependent on complex molecular and biochemical procedures, qPCR-based blood tests are minimally invasive, do not depend on hospital care and offer quick procedures based on easily amplifiable signals. Our tRF-based blood measurement proved efficient in separating prodromal PD patients from controls by a simple dual qPCR assay, suggesting that it may equip clinicians with an informative diagnostic tool based on a single individual blood test, alone or in combination with other non-invasive measurements. The reliability, sensitivity, speed and low cost of our assay may all indicate its value for enabling an improved universal, pre-symptomatic PD diagnosis that can improve detection rates and offer beneficial clinical approaches to patients with PD at diverse stages of their disease.

Ethics approval for this study was confirmed by the Hebrew University's committee for research involving human-derived materials. Blood samples of the JLM cohort were collected at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20.

This study consists of human brain (n = 8) and blood (n = 37) samples obtained from the NBB and of human brain samples (n = 23) obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank, each under the relevant institution's ethics and guidelines. Blood samples were further collected at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center (n = 30) under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20. Other human data were downloaded from the PPMI (blood; n = 475) and the NIH (CSF; n = 152) and from GSE23676 (blood; n = 20), all under relevant ethics approval. Further details can be found in Extended Data Fig. 1 and in Supplementary Tables 1a, 3, 5–9 and 11–13. Written informed consent was obtained for all human samples included in this study.

Brain tissues were obtained from the NBB as described in Hanan et al.4. RNA from eight male PD patient samples (see Supplementary Table 3 for patient information) was extracted using an miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 217004) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by RNA concentration determination (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), standard gel electrophoresis for quality assessment and RIN determination (Bioanalyzer 6000; Agilent). Libraries were generated from 1,200 ng of RNA (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina; New England Biolabs, E7560S), and the small RNA fraction was sequenced on a NextSeq 500 system (Illumina) at the Center for Genomic Technologies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE256334). TH and DAT levels for these samples are taken from previously published data4.

Whole blood samples were obtained from the NBB (see Supplementary Table 5 for patient information). RNA was extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA Blood Mini Kit for RNA from blood (Machery-Nagel, 740200) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by RNA concentration and quality determination as above. Libraries were generated from 100 ng of total RNA (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina, as above), and the small RNA fraction was sequenced on a NextSeq 2000 system (Illumina) at the Center for Genomic Technologies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Data were deposited in GSE256334 as above.

FASTQ files (of both in-house sequencing and of publicly available data) were checked for quality using FastQC60, and adaptors (if present) were removed using FLEXBAR61 according to the pipeline manual. Adaptor-less output FASTQ files were then aligned to tRFs using MINTmap (version 1.0)62. See Extended Data Fig. 1 for elaboration.

The CSF database phs000727 (downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)) included 66 patients with PD (20 removed as detailed below), 67 patients with AD (14 removed) and 69 healthy controls (16 removed). Before differential expression analysis, a principal component analysis was run based on tRF expression data, and samples that did not cluster were removed from the analysis. Those included six patients with PD, four patients with AD and six controls. Another five controls were removed because they had moderate SN depigmentation compared to no or mild depigmentation in other controls, and two additional controls were removed due to a combination of high Aβ plaque density (frequent) and high Tau tangle score (above 10). Likewise, 13 patients with PD were removed due to AD-like Braak, plaques or tangles scores. Seven patients with AD were removed due to severe SN depigmentation. Lastly, one control and one patient with AD were removed due to age younger than 60 years, and two controls, two patients with AD and one patient with PD were excluded due to exceptionally low tRF coverage (these patients had 21–1,627 counts, whereas the next lowest coverage patient had 11,745 counts). All eliminations were done before performing any analysis. See Supplementary Table 1a for general data of the CSF dataset and Supplementary Table 1b for a list of excluded samples. To further prevent any potential bias, differential expression analysis accounted for patient age, sex and PM interval.

Small RNA-seq was obtained in February 2021 from the PPMI database (https://www.ppmi-info.org/access-dataspecimens/download-data), RRID: SCR 006431. Updated participant status was re-downloaded in October 2023. For up-to-date information on the study, see https://www.ppmi-info.org/. Only samples with RIN ≥ 6 were analyzed, and we additionally filtered out samples of participants who were disqualified by the PPMI or who had undetermined sex63. See Supplementary Tables 6–8 and 11 for elaboration.

To test our hypothesis that tRFs can constitute a patient-specific fingerprint, we used all the samples of PPMI patients having tRF counts from four different timepoints (n = 318). To focus on the most informative features, we selected the top 0.5% of enriched tRFs, resulting in a set of 253 tRFs for analysis. The data were split into training and test sets, with the test set comprising the last available sample from each patient, to evaluate the model's performance across timepoints. Leveraging multiple timepoints per patient aimed to test whether blood-quantified tRFs might serve as a unique, patient-specific fingerprint and determine if the tRF values from a patient's first three timepoints could accurately identify which of the remaining samples belonged to that patient. We implemented a MultiClassModel class to train and evaluate multiple machine learning classifiers, including XGBoost, HistGradientBoostingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, Support Vector Classifiers (linear and nonlinear), K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes and OneVsRest (OvR) Logistic Regression. The OvR approach, also called One-vs-All, extends binary classifiers such as logistic regression to handle multiclass problems by training a separate binary classifier for each class. In this setup, the class of interest is treated as the positive label, whereas all other classes are grouped as negative. During prediction, the classifier with the highest probability score is selected as the final output. OvR is computationally efficient and straightforward, although it may not capture interactions between classes as comprehensively as multinomial logistic regression or One-vs-One approaches. As supported by Rifkin and Klautau64, OvR can achieve accuracy similar to more complex methods, especially when binary classifiers are well tuned, making it a robust and widely used solution in practice. All features were standardized using StandardScaler before model training. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was chosen as the primary evaluation metric due to its robustness in assessing both binary and multiclass classifications. After identifying the best-performing classifier, we conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with predefined parameter grids, optimizing for the MCC score. To validate the assumption that the model's performance was not due to chance, we compared the best-tuned classifier against a dummy model trained on shuffled labels. This comparison served to confirm the presence of a genuine, individual-specific signal in the tRF profiles.

For prodromal (pre-symptomatic) patient analysis, we subdivided, from the above-described PPMI data, prodromal and control patients with known genetic background (idiopathic or GBA+), known ethnicity, without prescribed PD medications and older than 58 years. Furthermore, patients with psychiatric anxiety, muscle inflammation, urinary bladder impairments and diabetes were excluded (due to underrepresentation in either the prodromal or the control group). To examine the earliest possible stage, we only selected patients with sequencing data from timepoints ‘BL', ‘V02' or ‘V04' (corresponding to initial diagnosis, 6 months later and 12 months later). For each of these patients, we used the earliest timepoint available for the discovery sample (60 prodromal patients and 110 controls) and the second-earliest timepoint for the holdout validation sample (33 prodromal patients and 33 controls). The single Asian control meeting the above criteria was excluded because there was no Asian prodromal patient (see Supplementary Table 7 for sample information and the ‘Statistics and reproducibility' subsection for classification processes). Additionally, to prevent biological outliers, we used only idiopathic patients of White ethnicity (as none of the other ethnicities or genetic backgrounds presented in both the prodromal and control groups to enable proper matching). Of note, as only one of the control patients in the test data had clinical scores (the rest of the controls had neither UPDRS nor H&Y scores), we imputed the UPDRS and the H&Y scores of the control patients. For each patient, we calculated the mean value of all the timepoints of that patient for each of these measurements. Because these were needed only for the control patients, the imputed values were anyway close to zero in both of the measurements.

To produce ROC curves for patients with PD, we selected patients and controls with known genetic background and without prescribed PD medications. To reduce variation between the groups, we selected patients only from ‘Phase 1' and the following ethnicities: ‘White', ‘Black or African American', ‘Hispanic or Latino' or ‘Ashkenazi Jewish'. Furthermore, to analyze the early stages of diagnosed PD patients, we used only timepoint ‘BL' and PD patients for whom PD duration was 0. See Supplementary Table 8 for patient information.

To analyze DBS effects, we used small RNA-seq from the 19 patients with PD who were treated with DBS, all from the ‘Phase 2' group and having familial PD, 14 with LRRK2 mutations and five with GBA mutations. Levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs in the DBS-treated patients were compared to those in PD patients with the above mutations who did not undergo DBS surgery (n = 11) and to those in control patients carrying the same mutations (n = 9). Non-DBS PD patients and controls were selected from the latest timepoint (V8) to account for the length of time most DBS-treated PD patients have been ill. See Supplementary Table 11 for sample information.

Blood from 10 patients with PD, 10 patients with head trauma and 10 controls was taken in Jerusalem under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20. Each group consisted of males and females, and all three had a similar average age (PD, 72 ± 7.5; Trauma, 73 ± 12; Control, 68 ± 5.6). See Supplementary Table 9 for detailed patient information. Samples were collected in Tempus Blood RNA Tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4342792), and RNA was extracted using a Norgen Preserved Blood RNA Purification Kit I (Norgen Biotek, 43400). Concentration was determined (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quality was assessed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA synthesis (from 250 ng) and qPCR are described below.

SN tissue samples (left hemisphere) were obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank. All donors died of natural cause at age 71–79 years and were of ‘White' ethnicity. For elaboration, see Supplementary Table 10. RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit as above, followed by RNA concentration determination and quality assessment as above. cDNA synthesis (from 500 ng) and qPCR are described below.

cDNA was prepared using a qScript microRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quantabio, 95107). qPCRs were performed in 96-well (Bio-Rad, HSP9601) or 384-well (Bio-Rad, HSP3805) plates, using PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix Low ROX (Quantabio, 95074) and primers (Merck) as below, on a Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR System with CFX Maestro software (Bio-Rad, version 4.1.2433.1219). The qPCR was programmed for 30 s of annealing/extension at 50 °C due to the short primer length. ΔCq for each sample was calculated as ‘mean (RGTTCRA-tRF triplicate) − mean (MT-tRF triplicate)'. ΔΔCq was calculated by dividing each ΔCq value by the mean ΔCq of the control patients. Expression of each sample was calculated as 2ΔΔCq.

FASTQ files were aligned to tRFs as described above.

Sequencing data of blood taken from six controls and seven patients with PD (all males) were downloaded from GEO dataset GSE23676. Blood from patients with PD was drawn before DBS surgery and several months after surgery, upon optimal stimulation (Supplementary Table 12). Affymetrix probes of Ang were found using biomaRt65, and all the Ang probes were summed to yield the expression of the gene.

To assess the affinity of the CSF-expressed tRFs (1,017 tRFs in the CSF dataset that were expressed above a median of 10 CPM) to the Ribo-essential tRF44 and to rRNAs66, we used the RNAup web server45. We checked each of the expressed tRFs against the sequences of the Ribo-essential tRFs and against the open regions in the rRNAs that we found to contain reverse complement sequences to the RGTTCRA sequence (see sequences below), and we retrieved the total energy for each tRF (total energy equals the sum of melting energies of each of the sequences minus their binding energy to each other):

The human-derived neuroblastoma cell line LAN-5 was cultured under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2) in RPMI (Merck, R0883) supplemented with FCS (10% final concentration; Sartorius, 04-127), L-glutamine (2 mM final concentration; Sartorius, 03-020) and penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin (100 U ml−1, 0.1 mg ml−1, 0.25 µg ml−1, final concentrations, respectively; Sartorius, 03-033). Cells were mycoplasma free (MycoBlue Mycoplasma Detection Kit; Vazyme, D101) and were used between passages 5 and 8.

Cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates at 30,000 cells per well. Six days later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C. Blocking solution (PBS with 5% normal donkey serum) was added to the wells for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 1-h incubation with primary antibody against human RPL24 (Proteintech, 17082-1-AP; rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000) and secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10042; donkey anti-rabbit, 1:1,000) for 2 h. Cells were then washed with FISH buffer (1:1 of 2× SCC and 50% formamide and containing 50 μg ml−1 heparin), followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with Affinity Plus (Integrated DNA Technologies) in situ probe, at a concentration of 200 nM. The probes were 5′-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 and contained locked nucleic acids at the bases marked ‘+':

To assess interactions with donor–acceptor proximity of less than 10 nm (refs. 48,67,68,69) between RGTTCRA-tRFs and ribosomes, we used FRET-FLIM with PIE70,71,72 (Extended Data Fig. 5). This allowed collecting fluorescence photon absolute detection times and detection times relative to moments of excitation for donor fluorescence after donor excitation, for acceptor fluorescence after donor excitation and FRET and for acceptor fluorescence after acceptor direct excitation. This was achieved with a confocal-based setup (ISS) assembled on top of a modified Olympus IX71 inverted microscope, as previously reported73,74. Donor and acceptor PIE was achieved by 488-nm and 532-nm picosecond pulsed lasers (λ = 488 nm, pulse width 80 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM), λ = 532 nm, pulse of 100 ps FWHM, rate; QuixX 488-60 PS, Omicron-Laserage, and FL-532-PICO, CNI), operating at 20-MHz repetition rate and interleaved by 25 ns. Of note, levels of donor fluorescence leakage into the acceptor fluorescence detection channel were negligible47. The laser beams passed through a single-mode polarization maintaining optical fiber (P1-405BPM-FC-Custom, specifications similar to those of PM-S405-XP, Thorlabs), a collimating lens (AC080-016-A-ML, Thorlabs), a halfwave plate (WPMP2-20(OD)-BB 550 nm, Karl Lambrecht Corp.) and a linear polarizer (DPM-100-VIS, Meadowlark Optics). Laser beams for acquiring images in laser scanning mode were reflected through galvo-scanning mirrors (6215H XY, Novanta Corp.) and scan lens (30 mm diameter × 50 mm focal length (FL), VIS-NIR Coated, Achromatic Lens, Edmund Optics) using a dichroic beam splitter at 405 nm, 488 nm, 532 nm and 640 nm (ZT405/488/532/640rpc-XT, Chroma). A ×100/1.45 numerical aperture (NA) oil objective (UPLSAPO100XO ×100 / 1.45 / oil / ∞ / 0.17/ OFN 26.5, Olympus) focused the light onto a small effective excitation volume. Scattered light was imaged on a CMOS camera (ThorCam, Thorlabs) using Airy ring pattern visualization. Fluorescence was collected through the same objective and focused with an achromatic lens (25 mm diameter × 100 mm FL, VIS-NIR Coated, Edmund Optics) onto a 100-μm-diameter pinhole and re-collimated with another achromatic lens (f = 100 mm; AC254-060-A, Thorlabs). Fluorescence was then split into two detection channels, 510/20 for AF488 and 698/70 for AF568, using a dichroic mirror (555-nm cutoff, FF555-Di03-25 × 36, Semrock) followed by bandpass filter 510/20 nm for wavelength <555 nm and 698/70 nm for wavelength >555 nm (FF03-510/20-25 and ff01-697/58-25, Semrock). Photons were detected using cooled hybrid photomultipliers (model R10467U-40, Hamamatsu) routed to a time-correlated single-photon counting module (SPC-150, Becker & Hickl) as its START signal (STOP signal was routed from the pulsed laser controller). For data acquisition, we used VistaVision software (version 4.2.095, 64-bit, ISS) in time-tagged time-resolved (TTTR) file format, and images were obtained using a laser scanning module in which a three-axis DAC module (ISS) synchronized data acquisition and control over the galvo-scanning mirrors. Images for FLIM measurements were obtained by tail-fitting fluorescence decays of each pixel in each photon stream (combination of excitation laser and detection channel), if it had at least 50 photons. FLIM images were acquired with 10-ms pixel dwell times in 15 × 15-μm2 image dimensions and 128 × 128-pixel resolutions.

All multiple comparisons were FDR corrected, and all visualizations were done using ggplot2 (ref. 75) in R (version 4.0.3)76. All statistical tests were conducted two-sided unless reported otherwise. All of the box plots in this paper are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles, respectively; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles, respectively. Differential analysis was carried out using edgeR77 (version 4.0.14) with patient age, sex and PM interval used as covariates in the design matrix of the edgeR analysis. Data collection and analysis were not performed blinded to the conditions of the experiments. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are compatible with those accepted in other publications in the field34,38,63. Due to the small number of samples in the SN data, we used the RNASeqPower pipeline78 (version 1.42.0) to estimate the power of the differentially expressed tRFs in these samples. We found the power of each of the differentially expressed tRFs to be higher than 0.87, with most of them (25th quantile and above) having a power higher than 0.9, which may improve the credibility of our findings in spite of the small number of samples.

Whenever the number of samples was smaller than 30, and the data did not distribute normally (P < 0.05 in a Shapiro test), a non-parametric test was run. Non-parametric tests were likewise used upon the need to compare median rather than mean values. All correlation tests conducted in this study (Extended Data Figs. 3c and 4e,f) are Spearman correlations, as we were interested in any type rather than linear correlation. Whenever comparing two groups to a third one, we used a Dunnett test (Figs. 1b,c and 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5a)

Binomial test was run on the differentially expressed tRFs in the CSF (Fig. 1b) and showed that they behave as a family and that most of the tRFs carrying the motif change in the same way. Upon comparing RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRF or RGTTCRA/MT-tRF ratio in blood of living and PM patients (Fig. 2f–h), we used the Mann–Whitney test (with FDR correcting for multiple comparisons) to compare the PD effect (PD versus Ctrl in each subgroup of a specific dataset and genetic background), and we employed a two-way ANOVA test to estimate the overall effect of PD while accounting for the dataset (that is, PM or alive) and the genetic background as covariates. The reason for using Mann–Whitney rather than a t-test for the first type of comparisons was that both the genetic controls and the PD idiopathic groups included low patient numbers (16 in each), and the data did not distribute normally (P < 0.0014, P < 0.003, P < 3 × 10−5, for PM RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRFs and Live genetic MT-tRFs, respectively; Shapiro test).

Matching analysis was carried out using MatchIt79 (version 4.6.0), with matched factors being sex, age and batch (‘Study'), distance = ‘glm' and link = ‘probit'. For each of the ROC calculations (either prodromal and controls or PD and controls), we first used an ‘optimal' matching in which each prodromal or PD patient was matched with a control (based on the above-mentioned factors). Next, the ratio between RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs was normalized for each matched pair of prodromal and control or PD and control individuals, by dividing the pair's scores by the pair's mean. Lastly, we used a machine learning algorithm to calculate ROC (MLeval, version 0.3)80. In the feature selection process, a Mann–Whitney calculation was used to prevent outlier patients from skewing the results (for this reasoning, we focused on median rather than mean differences). The dimensions used for the ROC calculations included ethnicity and either UPDRS III and H&Y scores or the tRF normalized ratio (described above). The training control was performed with five cross-validations using both GBM and linear model (LM) machine learning algorithms (method = ‘cv‘, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, number = 5 and classProbs and savePredictions = T). ROC curves were plotted using the pROC package81 (version 1.18.5).

In training the model on randomly mixed labels, we received an AUC of 0.43, which reflects systematic misclassification rather than predictive power, as the model picked up on random patterns in the data. This result illustrates the random distribution expected in a sham model setup, with a marginal error. We further ran iterations of a ‘full' matching in which patients were divided into clusters, each containing at least one prodromal or PD patient and one control, and the same pipeline as described above for the ‘optimal' matching was used.

To compute the ability of the tRF-based and the clinical-based algorithms to classify patients (Extended Data Fig. 4g), we ran chi-square, first using the percentage of patients predicted by random distribution and then using the percentage of patients predicted by the clinical-based algorithm as the reference probability. This created a confusion matrix of two columns (predicted to be prodromal, predicted to be control) and two rows (is indeed prodromal, is indeed control). Comparing the matrix of the tRF-based algorithm to the reference clinical-based matrix enabled proving that the tRF-based algorithm predicted a higher number of true prodromal patients to be prodromal.

First, we extracted all options of 14-nt-long sequences found in the PPMI-expressed tRFs. For example, for a tRF with the length of 30 nt, we regarded each of the sequences produced from nucleotides 1–14, 2–15, 3–16… 17–30 as a potential motif. We than created 10,000 couples of randomly selected motifs and, for each couple, ran the same process as described above (namely, for each patient, we summed the counts for each of these motifs and calculated the ratio between the sums). We then normalized the ratio for each pair of optimally matched prodromal and control patients by dividing both by the mean of the pair's ratio. We ran GMB analysis and extracted the yielded AUC.

Amplicons of two qPCR products (mixture of all three triplicates) were sequenced and aligned to tRFs. >50% of the reads were mapped to different tRFs (each color represents a single tRF. Note that the most prominent tRF in sample PD1 is hardly expressed in T7 and vice versa. All boxplots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the boxplot represents the median, the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles and lower and upper whiskers bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

a. Interaction of motif-carrying tRFs with ribosomes based on the GSE113751 dataset of short RNA-seq from ribosomes pulldown in HeLa (red), HCT116 (green) and HEK293T (blue) cells. Cells were either untreated or starved for Arg(inine) or Leu(cine) for 3 or 6 hours. Left Y axis: Points show RGTTCRA- tRF fractions among all tRFs. Right Y axis: total number of reads per sample.

Metrics details

The immune system plays a major role in the regulation of adipose tissue homeostasis. Viral infection often drives fat loss, but how and why this happens is unclear. Here, we show that visceral adipose tissue transiently decreases adiposity following viral infection. Upon pathogen encounter, adipose tissue upregulates surface expression of ligands for activating receptors on natural killer cells, which drives IFNγ secretion. This cytokine directly stimulates adipocytes to shift their balance from lipogenesis to lipolysis, which leads to release of lipids in circulation, most notably of free fatty acids. The free fatty acid oleic acid stimulates early-activated B cells by promoting oxidative phosphorylation. Oleic acid promoted expression of co-stimulatory B7 molecules on B cells and promoted their ability to prime CD8+ T cells. Inhibiting lipid uptake by activated B cells impaired CD8+ T cell responses, causing an increase of viral replication in vivo. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism of metabolic adaptation to infection and provide a better understanding of the interactions between immune cells and adipose tissue in response to inflammation.

Viral infection causes an influx of immune cells in white adipose tissue (WAT), most notably of NK cells. These cells recognize stress ligands in WAT and produce the cytokine IFNγ. In response to IFNγ stimulation, adipocytes shift the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis in favour of the latter, resulting in the release of lipids, including free fatty acids (FFAs), in the circulation. The FFA oleic acid promotes B cell activation and stimulates their co-stimulatory potential by upregulation of CD86. This, in turn, promotes activation of CD8 T cells and potentiates the antiviral response. Created in BioRender. Wensveen, F. (2025) https://BioRender.com/j79a390.

Metrics details

Understanding how molecules in solution begin to nucleate and grow into defined aggregates remains an outstanding mechanistic challenge. This is because the nucleation process is affected by a number of physicochemical factors that act simultaneously and whose individual contributions are hard to disentangle. Here, we demonstrate how residual aggregates in a molecular dispersion state affect the nucleation kinetics and the resulting self-assembly pathway. Using the photoisomerization of a chiral azobenzene molecule, the amounts of residual aggregates can be controlled in the pre-assembly supersaturated solution. The residual aggregates induce surface-catalysed secondary nucleation of monomers, affecting the chiral intermolecular configuration during self-assembly to afford metastable right-handed P-aggregates as opposed to thermodynamically stable left-handed M-aggregates. By exploiting the photoisomerization process, we establish high-fidelity control over the nucleation processes and demonstrate reversible M ⇄ off ⇄ P tristate switching of supramolecular chirality. Finally, we show that chiral aggregates exhibit opposite chirality-induced spin selectivities with high spin-polarization rates.

a Schematic representation of the formation of P-aggregates from (R)-1EE by irradiation of a PSSUV29 solution containing separately prepared M-aggregate fragments with VIS20. The M-aggregate fragments were prepared separately through sonication (See Supplementary Figure 15). b CD spectra of PSSUV29 solution of (R)-1 (mtot = 100 µM) in a 20:80 (v/v) toluene/MCH containing M-aggregate fragments (0.5 mol%) before (purple line) and after irradiation with VIS20 at 25 °C (blue line). Inset in (b) shows the magnified CD spectrum of the PSSUV29 solution containing 0.5 mol% of M-aggregate fragments. A seed solution was obtained by applying sonication to a precipitated gel of M-aggregates. Upon adding this seed solution to the PSSUV29 solution free of residual aggregates and then irradiating with VIS20, the formation of P-aggregates was clearly demonstrated by CD measurements.

a Time-dependent CD spectral changes of a PSSvis20 gel film composed of P-aggregates of (R)-1EE (mtot = 120 µM) in a 20:80 (v/v) toluene/MCH at 20 °C over 75 days. b Plot of the CD intensity at 367 nm as a function of time. Inset in (b) shows the changes in the initial 2 days. When the PSSvis20 gel film of P-aggregates was kept above 25 °C, the gel film gradually collapsed in the 1.0 mm pathlength cuvette. This macroscopic collapse of the gel film hindered the time-dependent CD measurements due to possible artifacts, that is, light scattering and linear dichroism/birefringence effects. Even at temperature below 20 °C, the same problem was confirmed for samples with a total concentration of monomers less than 100 µM. Therefore, time-dependent CD measurements were carried out at 20 °C using a sample with a total concentration of monomers at 120 µM. The CD intensity of the PSSvis20 gel film reduced 50% in the initial 2 days. This observation is probably attributed to the thermal back-isomerization of non-aggregative Z-isomers, providing aggregative (R)-1EE to form M-aggregates (see Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus, much slower CD change observed after this first dramatic change corresponds to spontaneous transformation from metastable P-aggregates to thermodynamically stable M-aggregates. Pure M-aggregates could not be obtained over time due to the slow P → M transformation kinetics.

a,b Time-dependent change in the degree of aggregation (αagg) for the formation of M- (a) and P-aggregates (b) of (R)-1 at various mtot in a 20:80 (v/v) toluene/MCH at 25 °C upon continuous visible-light irradiation: VIS99 irradiation of PSSUV29 solutions free of residual aggregates (a) and VIS20 irradiation of PSSUV6.8 solutions containing residual aggregates (b). c Log–log plots of the time required for m0 (≈ mtot) to drop by 50% (t50) in the experiments for the formation of M-aggregates (reddish plots) and P-aggregates (bluish plots). Data points represent the averaged mean values from a minimum of three experiments; the error bars the mean ± represent standard deviation. The γ values were estimated from the slopes to be −2.66 ± 0.12 for the formation of M-aggregates (reddish plots in Extended Data Fig. 3c) and −4.59 ± 0.47 for P-aggregates (bluish plots in Extended Data Fig. 3c), respectively. The large negative value for the formation of P-aggregates emphasizes the greater contribution of the secondary nucleation in the formation process.

a Schematic representation of the formation of P-aggregates from (R)-1EE by irradiation of a Z-isomers-rich solution (PSSUV) containing a tiny amount of residual P-aggregates with VIS20. b CD spectra of as-prepared PSSvis20 gel film containing P-aggregates (blue solid line) at 25 °C, after subsequent irradiation with UV6.8 at 30 °C (black solid line), and further irradiation with VIS20 (black dashed line) at 25 °C of (R)-1 (mtot = 100 µM) in a 20:80 (v/v) toluene/MCH. Inset in (b) shows the magnified CD spectrum of PSSUV solution. An approximately 0.2 mol% of monomers remained as P-aggregates according to the CD activity by assuming that all residual aggregates exhibited right-handed helicity. The UV-light irradiation time for P-aggregates (30 s) to obtain the PSSUV solution containing residual aggregates is shorter than that for M-aggregates (3 min), as metastable P-aggregates dissociate more easily than thermodynamically stable M-aggregates.

Metrics details

Genetically encoded reporters are suitable for short-distance imaging in the laboratory but not for scanning wide outdoor areas from a distance. Here we introduce hyperspectral reporters (HSRs) designed for hyperspectral imaging cameras that are commonly mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites. HSR genes encode enzymes that produce a molecule with a unique absorption signature that can be reliably distinguished in hyperspectral images. Quantum mechanical simulations of 20,170 metabolites identified candidate HSRs, leading to the selection of biliverdin IXα and bacteriochlorophyll a for their distinct absorption spectra and biosynthetic feasibility. These genes were integrated into chemical sensor circuits in soil (Pseudomonas putida) and aquatic (Rubrivivax gelatinosus) bacteria. The bacteria were detectable outdoors under ambient light from up to 90 m in a single 4,000-m2 hyperspectral image taken using fixed and unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted cameras. The dose–response functions of the chemical sensors were measured remotely. HSRs enable large-scale studies and applications in ecology, agriculture, environmental monitoring, forensics and defense.

The color scheme corresponds to Fig. 2c and d, Extended Data Fig. 1, and Supplementary Fig. 5.

Note that the limit-of-detection will be dependent on the specific camera and distance from the bacteria. Known concentrations of bacteria added to filter surfaces and imaged by a VNIR hyperspectral camera (Headwall E-Series) from 0.5 m (Methods). a. RGB and classified images extracted from the HSI data for constitutively-produced SmURFP(biliverdin IXα) (E. coli pYC301). b. Dependence of signal on the cell density. The limit-of-detection is marked with the vertical dashed line. The data points represent three replicates. The mean classification score indicates that it was averaged over the area of each well. c. Statistical significance of the signal in the presence compared to the absence of cells. p-values were calculated for the mean classification scores of 0.0 CFU/mm2 and each cell density, using one-sided Student t-test with equal variance. The horizontal line is the threshold used to define significant (p-value = 0.05). d. Mean reflectance spectra as a function of cell density. The absorption peak at 925 nm is due to the filter material. e. RGB and classified images extracted from the HSI data for cells constitutively producing bacteriochlorophyll a (R. gelatinosus YF6). f.

Source data

a. Schematics of genetic sensors connected to the different reporters. Plasmids are detailed in Supplementary Fig. 6 and genetic parts in Supplementary Table 1. b. The response functions as measured with the two reporters. In both cases, cells were grown with different concentrations of inducers (Methods). The pC-HSL sensor connected to YFP (E. coli pYC303) was imaged using a fluorimeter and background fluorescence (fluorescence of the pellets at inducer concentration = 0) was subtracted. The lines are fits to Eq. 6 (HSR: K = 2.2 nM, n = 1.1, YFP: K = 15.4 nM, n = 1.2). The data points are three replicates.

Source data

R. gelatinosus YF10 cultures were grown in the presence of 3OH-C14-HSL at the indicated concentration and then spread on 7 g of sand (Methods). Light intensity was set using a tunable quartz-tungsten illumination unit (Headwall Photonics) and measured using a handheld illuminance meter. a. RGB (left) and classified (right) images at different light intensities. The images are representative of three replicates. b. Response curves measured at different light intensities. The lines are fits to Eq. 6 (parameters in table). The “mean” indicates that the classification scores were averaged over the surface of each plate. The data points are three replicates. c. Dynamic range as a function of light intensity. The dynamic range was calculated as the ratio between the mean classification score for the maximally induced and uninduced samples. The data points are three replicates. d. The half-maximum induction K as a function of light intensity. Values were calculated from the best fit of Eq. 6. Points are only shown if the fit is significant. e. Limit-of-detection as a function of light intensity. The data points are three replicates. f. The limit-of-detection was calculated as the minimum concentration above which all calculated p-values were less than 0.01. p-values were calculated at each inducer concentration between the mean classification scores of the induced replicates and uninduced replicates using the one-sided Student t-test with equal variance. Points are not shown if no concentration met the significance threshold. The data points are three replicates.

Data are shown for R. gelatinosus YF6, which constitutively produces Bacteriochlorophyll a. a. Schematic illustrating the locations where 10 µL of cultures with varying concentrations were pipetted onto different soil types (A1, A3, A5, A7). b. RGB images from HSI data. c. Classified images from the HSI data. The dashed blue boxes indicate regions analyzed that do not contain bacteria. Classification scores in panel d are the means in the areas marked by rectangles. d. Classification scores extracted from panel c. P-values were calculated using one-sided student t-test with n = 3 (equal variance). Blue dashed regions in panels b and c only contain soil (OD600 = 0.0) and were used for the t-test. Significance scores: *** (p-value < 0.005), ** (p-value < 0.01), * (p-value < 0.05), ns (not significant). The data points are three replicates.

Source data

a. Representative image collected of the same samples in Supplementary Fig. 12 using the iPhone 14 Pro 48-megapixel main camera. b. Responses to pC-HSL measured from each plate from the image's red, green, and blue channels. The means were calculated by averaging over the area of each plate. The intensity measured in each channel can range from 0 to 254. The data points are three replicates. c. The same image from panel a with brightness and contrast values increased using Adobe Photoshop (v. 25.3.1). d. Responses to pC-HSL measured from the altered image. e. The same image from panel a with the “Find edges” filter applied in Photoshop to all color channels or to single color channels after decomposition of the image into red, green, and blue color channels. No response was successfully extracted from the iPhone camera image with or without additional processing. No other manipulations or enhancements of the color channels in the RGB image led to observable HSR.

Source data

R. gelatinosus WT, YF6 (constitutive bacteriochlorophyll a), and AJ1 (repressed bacteriochlorophyll a) cultures were grown to OD600 = 4.0 (Methods). Cultures were diluted using growth media or concentrated using centrifugation and resuspension in growth media to achieve different OD600 of culture cell density added to soil. 300 mL of each culture was then sprayed on 1.5 kg locally-sourced sandy soil inside each 35 ×30 cm plastic container. Containers were then placed in a field in a closed area near Herzliya, Israel. Imaging was performed with a VNIR-SWIR (400-2500 nm) UAV hyperspectral camera (Co-Aligned HP Hyperspectral Imaging UAV and camera, Headwall) from 24 m. Using SpectralView III, reflectance correction was performed based on the calibration tarp and geo-orthorectification was performed to correct for image distortions from the flight movement. a. Picture showing a close-up of the UAV imaging system and the containers in the background. b. RGB image from the HSI data. c. Classified image from the HSI. d. Locations of different R. gelatinosus strains and their concentrations used in the experiment. The AJ1 strain was used at OD600 = 4.0. The six concentrations in the center box correspond to the wild-type strain; the two concentrations flanking the box (left and right) correspond to the YF6 strain. e. Uncropped RGB image. f. Uncropped classified image. The image in panels e and f covers 0.2 acres (800 m2).

The uncropped image corresponding to Fig. 4f is shown. R. gelatinosus YF10 cultures were grown in the presence of 3OH-C14-HSL and spread on sand inside 35 × 30 cm plastic containers (Methods). In each container, 1 kg sand was covered by 300 mL of culture (OD600 = 4.0). Containers were then placed in a field in a closed area near Rehovot, Israel for 18 hours, out of which it was exposed to the sun for 4 hours prior to imaging. The temperature range was 25 – 35 °C. Imaging was performed with a VNIR-SWIR (400 - 2500 nm) UAV hyperspectral camera (Co-Aligned HP Hyperspectral Imaging UAV and camera, Headwall) from 54 m. The image encompasses a total area of 0.74 acres (3000 m2). Image acquisition required 30 sec. Using SpectralView III, reflectance correction was performed based on the calibration tarp and geo-orthorectification was performed to correct for image distortions from the flight movement. a. RGB image extracted from the HSI data. b. Classified image extracted from HSI data. c. 864 nm image extracted from HSI data. d. Pixel absorption at 864 nm with different thresholds used to label pixels as containing HSR are shown. Values in the heatmap (panel c) greater than the threshold were labeled as containing the HSR (red) and values equal to or less than the threshold were labeled as not containing the HSR (gray). True and false positive rates were calculated as described in the methods. e. Classified HSI images are shown at different threshold values. Values in the heatmap (panel b) greater than the threshold were labeled as containing HSR (red) and values equal to or less than the threshold were labeled as not containing HSR (gray). True and false positive rates were calculated as described in the methods. The bottom images are enlarged images of the area marked by the white rectangles in the top images. The black rectangles in the bottom images mark the areas in the image where R. gelatinosus YF10 was added onto sand. The mean classification scores in Fig. 4g were calculated by averaging over the area of each rectangle.

These data correspond to Fig. 4j using R. gelatinosus YF10. The top image shows the whole area shown in Fig. 4h. The bottom images are enlarged images of the area marked by the white rectangles in the top images. The black rectangle in the bottom images marks the area in the image where R. gelatinosus YF10 was added onto 1 kg of sand. The sand covered a 1 cm deep filter disc (60 mm) treated with 800 µL of 19 mM 3OH-C14-HSL (final concentration of 50 µM/mL culture). a. RGB image calculated from HSI data. b. 864 nm image calculated from HSI data. c. Data used to calculate the ROC curve for 864 nm (Fig. 4j). Pixel absorption at 864 nm with different thresholds used to label pixels as containing HSR are shown. Values in the heatmap (panel b) greater than the threshold were labeled as containing HSR (red) and values equal to or less than the threshold were labeled as not containing HSR (gray). Images represent four of 470,044 threshold values evaluated to compute the ROC curve (Methods). d. Data used to calculate the classified ROC curve (Fig. 4j). Classified HSI images are shown at different threshold values taken along the ROC curve. Values in the classified image (Fig. 4h) greater than the threshold were labeled as containing HSR (red) and values equal to or less than the threshold were labeled as not containing HSR (gray). Images represent four of 1,015,973 threshold values evaluated to compute the ROC curve (Methods).

The Social Security Administration backed off its plan to cut phone services, but it's still taking steps to limit the ways that people will be able to access information about the essential agency. The SSA plans to stop issuing communications through normal channels like press releases and will instead make statements exclusively on X.

According to the report, the shift was made clear during internal meetings between agency managers. “We are no longer planning to issue press releases or those dear colleague letters to inform the media and public about programmatic and service changes,” SSA regional commissioner Linda Kerr-Davis said, per Wired. “Instead, the agency will be using X to communicate to the press and the public.”

The SSA pretty regularly engages with the public, including advocacy groups, through “Dear Colleague” letters that directly address the concerns of third parties who have questions or concerns about Social Security-related matters. Those are typically shared on the agency's “News” page, which includes communications to advocates, statements from the SSA Press Office, and the agency's newsletter. All of that, it seems, will disappear and be replaced by the SSA X feed.

The agency's account currently has just over 138,000 followers. By comparison, about 73 million people (that's about 1 in every 5 Americans) receive Social Security benefits of some kind and may be interested in updates regarding those services.

The shift to Elon Musk's platform comes after several high-profile instances of the SSA website going down after the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency slashed its IT team. Outages have lasted full days at certain points, but the administration has claimed it has nothing to do with DOGE's efforts, which have already left the agency short-staffed and scrambling.

Anyway, those outages will probably be used as justification for shifting communication to X, which has been Musk's preferred platform for communication even before he bought it. In 2020, Musk dissolved Tesla's press office entirely and shifted the company's comms exclusively to what was then Twitter. Shockingly, the company found it very difficult to communicate with the public and press.

For Tesla, the shift is vaguely justifiable, as the company's customers are likely a little tech-savvy. That is distinctively not the case for Social Security, which primarily serves people of retirement age. People can start receiving their full Social Security benefits at 67 years old. Per publicly available demographic information about X's user base, about 5% of its users are 65 years old or older. So the audience for SSA updates is not on the platform that the agency will primarily use to communicate. Seems not great.

A new shipbuilding startup called Blue Water Autonomy has emerged from stealth with the promise of developing captain-less naval ships.

The Boston, Massachusetts-based company has raised a $14 million seed round from Eclipse VC, Riot, and Impatient Ventures. The startup was founded in 2024 by former members of the U.S. Navy, leaders of Amazon Robotics, and iRobot.

Blue Water Autonomy joins an ever-growing list of startups that are taking advantage of a splurge in defense investment. Defense tech funding set a new record in 2024, led by Anduril's $1.5 billion Series F round and Saronic — another autonomous maritime startup that notched a $175 million Series B.

The startup says it has developed a full-stack autonomy suite and concept ship designs in “under a year.” It's already salt-water testing a 100-ton autonomous test vessel just outside of Boston, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch. 

The seed funding will help Blue Water Autonomy expand its engineering team and accelerate testing, according to a release.

“No other company is tackling this problem at the ship level like Blue Water,” Seth Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said in a statement. “The team is a rare combination of roboticists and Navy veterans that positions them to be a critical partner to the Navy, the entire Department of Defense, and will have a major impact on the maritime industry.”

The Social Security Administration will no longer be communicating with the media and the public through press releases and “dear colleague” letters, as it shifts its public communication exclusively to X, sources tell WIRED. The news comes amid major staffing cuts at the agency.

“We are no longer planning to issue press releases or those dear colleague letters to inform the media and public about programmatic and service changes,” said SSA regional commissioner Linda Kerr-Davis in a meeting with managers earlier this week. “Instead, the agency will be using X to communicate to the press and the public … so this will become our communication mechanism.”

Previously, the agency used dear colleague letters to engage with advocacy groups and third-party organizations that help people access social security benefits. Recent letters covered everything from the agency's new identity verification procedures to updates on the accuracy of SSA death records (“less than one-third of 1 percent are erroneously reported deaths that need to be corrected,” the agency wrote, in contrast to what Elon Musk claims).

The letters and press releases were also a crucial communications tool for SSA employees, who used them to stay up on agency news. Since SSA staff cannot sign up for social media on government computers without submitting a special security request, the change could have negative consequences on the ability for employees to do their jobs.

It could also impact people receiving social security benefits who rely on the letters for information about access benefits. “Do they really expect senior citizens will join this platform?” asked one current employee. “Most managers aren't even on it. How isn't this a conflict of interest?” Another staffer added: “This will ensure that the public does not get the information they need to stay up-to-date.”

Linda Kerr-Davis also did not immediately respond to a request for comment by WIRED.

“This reporting is misleading. The Social Security Administration is actively communicating with beneficiaries and stakeholders,” says Liz Huston, a White House spokesperson. "There has not been a reduction in workforce. Rather, to improve the delivery of services, staff are being reassigned from regional offices to front-line help – allocating finite resources where they are most needed. President Trump will continue to always protect Social Security.”

Elon Musk, who is leading the charge to radically reduce the size of the federal workforce on behalf of President Trump, bought X (then Twitter) in October 2022. The platform has for years battled the spread of misinformation. After he purchased the company, Musk fired contract content moderators and shifted content moderation efforts to a crowd-sourced fact-checking tool called Community Notes. In 2023, an EU official warned the platform was a major source of fake news, based on a commissioned study that reported “Twitter has the highest discoverability" of disinformation.

The regional office workforce will soon be cut by roughly 87 percent, sources tell WIRED. Regional office staff manage IT support, policy questions, labor relations issues, reasonable accommodations guidance, and public relations. Since February, the SSA has cut 7,000 jobs, according to The Washington Post.

Today, the agency has 547 employees working in the nearly dozen regional offices (previously, the number was closer to 700, but many people have retired, a current employee with knowledge of the staffing numbers says). After the cuts, the number is expected to be closer to 70. “We know that you all depend on these folks to manage your front line, to help with questions,” said Kerr-Davis, who works in the Kansas City regional office. “I'm going to be pretty candid here in sharing that the support will be pretty minimal until we can stand up our skinny regional office.”

Kerr-Davis acknowledged that the restructuring could limit the agency's ability to combat fraud, a major goal of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. “Won't losing subject matter experts lead directly to fraud, waste, and abuse?” she asked on the call, reading a question from an SSA staffer. “And yes, I mean, we do rely on [their] help … Things are going to break, and they're going to break fast.”

On the call, Kerr-Davis sounded resigned as she relayed news of the changes. “I know this probably sounds very foreign to you. It did to me as well,” she said. “It's not what we are used to, but we are in different times now.”

Digital payments platform Stripe invites customers to join its management team meetings on a bi-weekly basis so it can get “candid feedback,” according to co-founder Patrick Collison.

In an April 8 post on X, the fintech giant's CEO said the company has a customer join for the first 30 minutes of the meeting, which is attended by about 40 leaders “from across Stripe.”

“Even though we already have a lot of customer feedback mechanisms, it somehow always spurs new thoughts and investigations,” he wrote.

It's an interesting strategy from Stripe, which was founded in 2010 and is considered to be the highest-valued private fintech in the world (its most recent valuation was $91.5 billion).

Over the years, startups have complained anecdotally that Stripe is more focused on its larger customers than the smaller ones it set out to serve. But the company must be doing something right.  Stripe's annual letter in February penned by Collison noted that payment volume in 2024 grew to $1.4 trillion, up 38% on the year before.

Stripe also added in the letter that it is now used by half of the Fortune 100 companies, underscoring how it has catapulted from a startup working with other startups into a major enterprise player.

In the post on X, Collison responded to the Cloudflare CTO's question of when his company would get an invite with a, “Would love to have you guys…will reach out.” 

To the point of smaller businesses feeling neglected, one investor wrote: “Hi Patrick – you know I admire @Stripe – but you should pay attention to the extent things have degraded for the indie community using Stripe. I messaged support a week ago – no reply, things are super complicated. There's more stuff, but it's a mess.”

Many praised the move, with one user noting: “Love this. Keeps the culture focused on what matters and helps reconciles (sic) reality.”

And, naturally, some Stripe customers used the X post to post their complaints (here and here). 

However, one high-profile founder seemed to approve of Stripe's approach: Elon Musk replied to the post with a simple, “Good idea.”

I've never been a fan of laptop keyboards. It's better to feel the tactile feedback of a full-sized keyboard with keys that press down as your type—at least that's my preference anyway. If you primarily use a laptop but are looking to have some extra options, listen here. Perhaps you want to build out a desk space where you hook up to a docking station to some extra monitors and more to really spread out your work. Well you can get this mouse and keyboard set from Logitech for hardly anything. They're bundled together and normally priced at $40, but right now you can get the pair for just $34. That's a 15% discount.

The Logitech keyboard is full-size meaning it includes the number pad. This is an absolute must for anyone dealing with numbers and/or Excel all day. Having them all together helps with quick math as you're able to punch it all in with one hand. Plus you have all your calculator functions right there. I need it because I write about Pokémon a lot so I use the shortcut Alt+233 all the time to get the é which I have memorized. Also, I'm a big fan of the em dash so I need it for that too—that's Alt+151 by the way.

See at Amazon

This thing is spill resistant, so gamers need not fear drinking your Mountain Dew Baja Blasts nearby. It's comfortable to use too as it has a built-in palm rest at the bottom.

The keyboard has got a crazy long battery life. You can keep your desk free of unnecessary cables as it'll last up to three years before needing replacement. The mouse likewise can last awhile, coming in at about 18 months. Batteries comes included.

As they are wireless, the connection is dependable utilizing 2.4 GHz at a range of up to 10 meters. This is a niche use case, but that's great for if you have one of those mini PCs or a Raspberry Pi hooked up to your living room TV and need a means of controlling it from the couch. Some Xbox games also now support mouse and keyboard if you want to mess around with that too.

For a limited time, you can save a solid 15% on this Logitech mouse and keyboard combo. If you're a small business owner looking to fill out some desks with the necessary peripherals without going over budget, Amazon also has a four-pack available.

Lazarus, Cowboy Bebop creator Shinichirō Watanabe‘s newest sci-fi anime series on Adult Swim, is the talk of the town in anime circles. A lot of the online chatter has focused on the compare-contrast territory between Watanabe's two shows. But regarding Lazarus itself, some fans have noticed differences between the Japanese and U.S. releases, leaving them wondering if they are missing out on a potentially superior version of the series.

An X/Twitter post by user SaeIssho points out scenes from Lazarus protagonist Axel Gilberto's parkour prison escape in the anime's premiere episode seem to have added frames and improved compositing polish in the Japanese version. The tweet, which has garnered over 91,000 views, has ignited curiosity among fans about whether the remaining 12 episodes will feature similar subtle differences and if it might be worth waiting for the Japanese language version of the show set to release on Adult Swim and Max in May.

It seems Lazarus has two different versions, with the Japanese one being the most complete. For instance some scenes in the Japanese version are about twice as long in terms of key frames, and there are noticeable differences in compositing choices across various parts of the EP. pic.twitter.com/jLR264Zojq

Given all the recent turmoil over stuff like the Nintendo Switch 2 having a cheaper, Japanese-only version; general anxiety over vibe-based tariffs, and China reinforcing the proverbial inward barbwire gate over the U.S. with limited releases of films like A Minecaft Movie; anime fans' nagging sense of FOMO over Watanabe's return to sci-fi isn't completely left-field.

However, a source familiar with the matter has clarified the apparent difference between the shows—and it seems anime fans have nothing to worry about.

Speaking with io9, a source close to the show's production says minor tweaks were made to the U.S. and Japanese broadcast versions of Lazarus to pass the Harding test—an automatic test for flashing and patterns that could trigger photosensitivity and epilepsy. Think the infamous Pokémon Porygon episode, where a lightning bolt flash reportedly triggered over 700 alleged instances of nausea, dizziness, headaches, and photosensitivity-triggered seizures in audiences across Japan back in 1997.

According to the source, minor tweaks were implemented in both versions of Lazarus to adhere to the Harding test. They include dropping a few animation frames and slightly darkening numerous shots. The source stressed that neither animation nor redone composites were added to either show version, and Watanabe approved all updates. Mystery solved. Though, knowing the anime community, fans will probably still rewatch the Japanese language version of Lazarus for the chance to hear Cowboy Bebop alumni voice actors like Koichi Yamadera (Spike Spiegel) and Megumi Hayashibara (Faye Valentine) as Dr. Skinner and Herch, respectively.

In our review of Lazarus' first five episodes, we said the anime has the juice, writing “Lazarus firmly establishes itself as a series capable of delivering a compelling anime without compromising on animation quality, musical score, or thematic depth in its early goings.” Hopefully, the show will continue its winning momentum to its final episode.

New episodes of Lazarus premiere every Saturday night on Adult Swim, with next-day streaming on Max.

A recent breach of Berkshire Hathaway-owned private jet company NetJets has revealed a guide for flight attendants serving Elon Musk, per a Bloomberg report. The memo offers an interesting glimpse into the personal preferences of the world's richest man.

Some of the preferences are surprising for the CEO of Tesla, a company dedicated to sustainability. Apparently Musk isn't “interested in conserving fuel” because he “wants to fly as quickly and as direct” as possible. 

Other inclinations are not surprising at all, like the note to staff not to offer him technical help.

“Mr. Musk considers himself self-sufficient and does not need help with technology — if he does, he will ask.”

And then there's the relatable stuff, like his dislike of unexpected Wi-Fi outages and his penchant to take a nap, even on day trips. He also prefers to keep the cabin at 65 degrees, the lights dim, and the passenger vents off because he “does not like the noise.”

Every summer, an area of deep underwater canyons off western Australia's south coast called Bremer Canyon becomes the preferred feeding ground for marine predators including sharks, pilot whales, beaked whales, and the highly intelligent orcas. As such, Bremer Canyon has become a popular whale-watching destination. This week, a pod of orcas put on a gruesome show.

On Monday, tourists and researchers on a tour boat at Bremer Canyon witnessed a pod of over 60 orcas hunt and kill a roughly 59-foot-long (18-meter-long) pygmy blue whale, as reported by Australia's ABC. The scene, caught on camera, was bloody, heartbreaking…and normal, despite our aching human hearts. In fact, it was also special, in a ruthless way: It's only the fourth time orcas hunting a blue whale has been filmed at Bremer Canyon.

“The intense ordeal lasted less than 40 minutes from when we first saw the blue at the surface to when the battle was over. As the blue whale's fate was sealed, orcas celebrated with breaches and tail slaps,” reads a social media post by Naturaliste Charters Whale Watching, after a stark graphic content warning. The event is “an extraordinary reminder of their role as apex predators in the ocean.”

Beyond the human instinct to root for the underdog—it was 60 against one—and our squeamishness for bloody waters, another heartbreaking aspect of the situation is that pygmy blue whales are endangered.

“We're all still pretty shell shocked,” Jennah Tucker, a marine biologist who works on Naturaliste Charters and witnessed the hunt, told the ABC. “We definitely do as much as we can to not be involved and to have no interference, but it's a very difficult thing to watch; it can be very brutal,” she admitted, adding that, at one point, almost 30 orcas overwhelmed the pygmy blue whale as it tried to flee.

“It was very emotional but that's nature, it was quite a privilege to witness the event,” she continued. Tucker added that the researchers aboard the tourist boat identified five different orca family groups, and also noted the presence of many young orcas, including a one-month-old calf.

While popular culture abuses our fear of sharks, orcas are actually the world's top marine predators and they roam every ocean. Despite being commonly known as “killer whales,” they're a member of the dolphin family. In fact, the name “killer whale” comes, rather appropriately, from their whale hunting behavior.

Though it's understandably difficult to witness such a bloody scene, the orcas weren't engaging in senseless violence—they were behaving as nature intended them to.

Killing two birds with one stone.

Amid a fierce trade war with the US, China's General Administration of Customs has changed its rules of how the origin of imported chips must be classified, now deeming that the wafer fabrication location should be counted as the origin of chips shipped to the country. This rule exempts products from AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Intel, and other chipmakers who outsource wafer fabrication to Taiwanese companies from the punitive 125% tariff China now imposes on products from the U.S. However, this badly hurts Intel, Global Foundries, Texas Instruments, and chip designers who produce chips in America. 

Today, the China Semiconductor Industry Association published an urgent notice regarding the rules for determining the 'country of origin' of semiconductor products shipped to China. As it turns out, the location where the wafer was processed is deemed the 'country of origin,' no matter where the chip was developed or packaged, according to a CSIA document published in WeChat and republished by various analysts. The rule applies to both packaged and unpackaged semiconductors. 

Because China deems Taiwan its own territory, chips fabricated by TSMC, Micron, UMC, Vanguard, and other chipmakers in Taiwan will be exempt from punitive 125% import duties imposed on products from then U.S. even though virtually all contemporary chips from companies like AMD, Broadcom, Intel, Nvidia, Micron, and Qualcomm are developed in America and are sold by U.S.-based company. 

By applying this rule, the Chinese government kills two birds with one stone. 

On the one hand, it allows chipmakers to ship their products to China without any restrictions or punitive tariffs, which enables China-based fabs to continue making actual products based on those chips, thus keeping Chinese facilities busy. As an added bonus, China shows American companies that it considers Taiwan its own territory and actually means it by not imposing any punitive import duties. 

On the other hand, it punishes American chipmakers and chip designers that produce their ICs in the U.S., which includes companies that outsource to GlobalFoundries' Fab 8 in New York as well as Texas Instruments, which builds its chips in Texas. 

As an added bonus, the Chinese government helps TSMC, UMC, Vanguard, and China-based foundries to potentially land new customers. This has implications, too. Many products made in China use chips from American companies produced in America by companies like Analog Devices, GlobalFoundries, NXP, or ON Semiconductor, or fabbed by contract chipmakers in the U.S., such as Intel or GlobalFoundries. Consequently, companies that use chips from the U.S. will now have to find alternatives, which takes time and costs money. For some, this may be the end of the line.

One thing to note is the stark contrast between how Chinese customs treat semiconductor products and how American customs treat chips in terms of 'country of origin.' The U.S. determines the 'country of origin' by the location of the last substantial transformation, where the product undergoes a major change. For example, a memory IC developed in the U.S., fabbed in Japan, but packaged in China is considered a Chinese product subject to punitive tariffs, according to the current laws. The same applies to logic chips designed in the USA but fabbed in Taiwan and packaged in China by subsidiaries of Taiwanese OSAT giants. By contrast, China's customs determine the 'country of origin' by the location of the actual wafer fabrication facility.

When sex toy brand Dame first launched in 2014, its focus was on making no-frills sex toys for people with vulvas. In its quest to close the “pleasure gap,” the company's first product was the Eva—a hands-free clitoral vibrator that could be comfortably worn during penetration thanks to a clever design.

A 2015 study of over 1,000 women published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 percent can orgasm through intercourse alone, and 37 percent said clitoral stimulation was necessary for orgasm during intercourse. It might not be a surprise, then, that the Eva became a hit, even before it shipped. Its Indiegogo campaign raised more than $850,000, one of the most successful crowdfunded sex toys in history.

Dame is now trying something different: a sex toy for people with a penis. However, the aptly named Hug wraps around the base of the penis with its adjustable arms, and the other end provides vibrating goodness for the clitoris. It's a sex toy for couples—the best of both worlds.

I don't have a penis, but I have sex with those who do. Combined with my 10-plus years covering sexual wellness and sex toys, I can confidently say that I know my way around cock rings and have tried more than my fair share. The Hug doesn't look like any cock ring I've seen before.

Knowing nothing about Dame, my partner said, "It looks like it was designed by a woman.” This was by no means an insult, but a compliment. Just looking at the Hug, you can see the consideration that went into the product's design for both the person who will be wearing the Hug and the person who will be enjoying the penis it's on.

As much as I don't want to do a compare-and-contrast session about cock rings, the Hug has a major standout feature that must be addressed. In a world of silicone cock rings that require either a lot of lube or a flaccid shaft to get it on the penis, the Hug has pinchable arms, so you can easily put it on and take it off at any time, no matter the erection status. Having been with partners who struggled to get cock rings on and/or off, it's a much smarter design.

If that wasn't impressive enough, the body of the Hug is shaped to target the clitoris. Clitoral stimulation always feels like an afterthought with most of the cock rings on the market designed to pleasure both partners. Not the case with the Hug.

Not only are all five vibration levels tucked into a dome that aligns perfectly with the clitoris, but the Hug is surprisingly flexible, moving with the body effortlessly. You can easily go from missionary to a sitting up position without having to adjust anything. This was something both my partner and I loved. While finagling and readjusting sex toys is sometimes necessary, the Hug was very much in sync with both of our bodies.

I consider the Hug a near-perfect sex toy. My partner and I used it multiple times, with my forever-beloved water-based lubricant Bijoux Indiscrets' Sex au Natural, and each time it floored us both. The Hug felt like a cohesive part of our sexual pleasure and not a third wheel.

The Hug takes about two hours to charge and lasts only an hour, but that's not really a bad thing for a cock ring. Blood flow to the penis shouldn't be restricted for more than 30 minutes. Though thanks to the Hug's design, you can loosen things up on the penis while keeping the vibrations focused on the clitoris. It's 100 percent waterproof, easy to navigate with its one button, very quiet (not quite whisper-quiet), and USB-C rechargeable. Dame even offers a 3-year warranty.

It's ultimately designed for hetero couples or someone with a penis who's flying solo and experimenting with erections and blood flow. Which is more than OK! Not every sex toy is geared toward all bodies, all genders, and all sexualities. If it remotely sounds appealing, trust me, the Hug is something you'll want in your sex toy arsenal.

ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

To see a list of 2024 updates, go here.



OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, as early as next week, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.

In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. 

OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. 

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. 

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. 

OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that's “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. 

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story…

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. 

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model's “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post. 

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

Operator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they're inconsistent at best.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

In 1901, sponge divers discovered an ancient shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera. Among the recovered materials, a corroded lump of metal caught the eye of archaeologist Valerios Stais. The artifact turned out to be a surprisingly complex—though fragmented—mechanical device dated between the late second and early first centuries BCE. Now called the Antikythera Mechanism, it is widely considered to be the world's first analog computer, tracking time and astronomical events through gearwork and pointers.

New research adds a twist to the story of this famous device, suggesting the Antikythera Mechanism may never have worked as intended, that it was just a fancy knickknack. The triangular shape of the gear teeth wasn't the issue, according to new simulations—the real problem was likely flaws in the gear construction. The new work shows that even the tiniest manufacturing mistake could've caused the mechanism to jam or slip, raising the possibility that the Antikythera Mechanism was either nonfunctional or originally built with far greater precision than scientists can now discern.

Since its discovery, many scholars have questioned whether the Antikythera Mechanism actually functioned or if it was merely a glorified bauble. In this spirit, two engineers, Esteban Guillermo Szigety and Gustavo Francisco Arenas from Argentina's National University of Mar del Plata, combined previous approaches to analyze how the gearwork's triangular teeth and manufacturing errors may have impacted its functionality. Their work is detailed in a paper, posted April 1 on the preprint server arXiv, that has not yet been peer reviewed.

The Antikythera Mechanism had interconnected indicators (like the hands of a clock) that pointed to the positions of the Sun and Moon in the zodiac, future eclipses, the Egyptian calendar date, and a Greek lunisolar calendar. “The indicators are driven by a gear train, which introduces two main sources of error that affect their accuracy,” the researchers explained in the study. “First, the triangular shape of the teeth results in non-uniform motion, causing acceleration and deceleration as each tooth engages.” Today, modern gears use an involute tooth profile. “Second, the inevitable inaccuracies in gear manufacturing can also generate errors.”

To investigate how these two features may have affected the device's function, they simulated the system using a computer model that incorporated earlier measurements from two researchers—Alan Thorndike and Mike Edmunds—who had analyzed the “triangle tooth” and “manufacturing” problems, respectively.

Ultimately, “our findings indicate that while the triangular shape of the teeth alone produces negligible errors, manufacturing inaccuracies significantly increase the likelihood of gear jamming or disengagement,” the researchers wrote. In other words, the “manufacturing” problem, as measured by Edmunds, would have made the Antikythera Mechanism practically unusable. “As a result, two possibilities arise: either the mechanism never functioned, or its errors were smaller than those found by Edmunds.”

The researchers add that, though possible, it is unlikely that someone would intentionally build such an unusable device. As such, they suggest that Edmunds' analyses might have been skewed by the highly corroded nature of the artifact, while emphasizing that their own results should be interpreted with caution, given the speculative nature of the study.

This study doesn't settle the debate over whether the Antikythera Mechanism actually worked, but it is pushing the conversation forward. As scientists continue to analyze the device from its badly degraded remains, each analysis uncovers something new, while also reminding us how incredibly precise its makers needed to be.

Fitbit Charge 6 Fitness Tracker

The Fitbit charge 6 is your fitness friend and coach, be it running on the road or hitting the gym. There are over 40 different exercise modes to take part in, and exercise tracking starts up automatically when the watch detects a workout. You can see your stats whether you're lifting at the gym, kayaking, you name it. It even has built-in GPS for use during outdoor workouts to track mileage and running pace, so you don't need to rely on your smartphone.

Monitor your heart rate 24/7 to measure the intensity of your workouts. It'll let you know when fat burn, cardio or peak zones so you can adjust your effort to match your goals. Heart rate monitoring can also be used to keep an eye on your health. You can check for signs of irregular heart rhythm which could be caused by atrial fibrillation (AFib) thanks to the ECG app and sensor. Other health metrics it will take a look at are your blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, and more.

Something real nifty about the Charge 6 is you can stream your stats like your heart rate to your screen on a compatible treadmill, elliptical, rower, or exercise bike. This way you don't even have to look down at your wrist and you can focus on your form while pushing through cardio.

Enjoy more restful nights and feel reenergized when you're woken up in the morning. The watch can be set to vibrate during the optimal sleep stage to leave you refreshed as you open your eyes. You'll be assigned a sleep score and be ale to track your light, deep, and REM sleep along with sleeping heart rate so you can measure how consistent your sleep is.

You'll also have access to a handful of stress management tools. The Fitbit Charge 6 can give you a full breakdown of your stress management score based on heart rate and other factors, and provide you with guided breathing sessions which can help foster healthier ways to handle it.

Right now, Amazon has the Fitbit Charge 6 for the low price of just $120. It's currently going for a full 25% off, amounting to $40 in savings.

IPO is Intel's way of balancing manual overclocking and reference settings with warranty protection.

Arrow Lake might have some fuel left in the tank, as Intel's latest IPO (Intel Performance Optimizations) tech is reportedly hitting pre-builts in China, per UNIKO's Hardware at X.

Intel recently unveiled the IPO program in China. It is supposedly a suite of tuned settings or profiles that balance overclocking and stock settings. It is important to note that Intel has not detailed or announced an IPO for the global market. In addition, for the time being, it appears these profiles are aimed at system integrators and OEMs, not individual customers.

Enthusiast and gamers can use many techniques to get the most out of their CPU. This includes manual CPU overclocking when you exceed your CPU's rated specifications, followed by XMP/EXPO for RAM. AMD offers a PBO that auto-tunes your CPU to extract maximum performance with minimal manual intervention. The catch is that all these utilities can technically void your warranty if things go south.

IPO is designed to serve as a middle ground between stock profiles and overclocking, with proper warranty coverage. These profiles promise a stable experience, eliminating the need for constant adjustments and the fear of crashing as seen with manual overclocking. IPO targets the CPU (P-cores, E-cores, Ring-bus, NGU, D2D interconnects, PL1 and PL2) and the RAM (Transfer speeds and timings).

intel ipo (intel performance optimization) pc is now available on the china market with specific sellers like 攀升.ipo means overclocking cpu+dram, from frequencies and timings to power limits.ipo warranty is said to be provided by the seller, stability is covered.btw, even… pic.twitter.com/DXSXlFPszQApril 10, 2025

In an example profile shared by UNIKO's Hardware, a pre-built from Maxsun with IPO lands a sweet 200 MHz uplift in core clock speeds while pushing RAM speeds to DDR5-8400 from DDR5-8000, resulting in a purported 10% FPS increase (on the pre-built's marketing material).

That's not all. Another leaker claims that Intel will offer "opt-in" BIOS presets to its Arrow Lake chips in the future, a premise similar to IPO. Maybe IPO serves as a pilot program for this feature. The exact specifics have not been detailed. This might make Arrow Lake a compelling choice against Ryzen offerings, particularly for system integrators.

Despite the substantial buildup to Arrow Lake, performance on launch day was subpar, with these chips failing to beat even their last-generation counterparts in some scenarios. Arrow Lake's MCM (Multi Chip Module) design eats away a chunk of the performance, with the memory controller designated to a separate tile, incurring unwanted latency penalties. Another aspect was the slower ring-bus clock speeds, almost 20% slower than Raptor Lake.

Additional firmware/software-related issues pushed Intel to release several fixes by December. The final update, microcode version 0x114 and CSME firmware kit 19.0.0.1854v2.2, launched in January, but our testing proved contrary to Intel's claimed performance improvements. IPO is Intel's latest attempt to wring every last bit of performance from Arrow Lake, but we are still light on details regarding availability.

Meet the cleaning companion that makes your current robot vacuum look like a dust-pushing toy. The Dreame L10 Ultra isn't just another autonomous vacuum – it's a complete floor-care system that vacuums, mops, and most importantly, takes care of itself. With the ability to automatically empty its dust bin, clean its own mops, and refill its water tank, this is as close as you can get to never thinking about floor cleaning again.

See at Amazon

In a jaw-dropping deal, Amazon has slashed the price of the Dreame L10 Ultra from $790 to just $300. This massive 62% discount saves you $490 on one of the most advanced robot vacuum and mop combos available.

The self-maintenance features set this robot apart from budget models. After each cleaning session, it returns to its base station to empty collected debris, wash its mopping pads, and refill its water tank. This means you can go weeks without having to touch the robot or its base station.

Cleaning performance impresses with 5,300Pa of suction power – strong enough to pull embedded dirt from deep within carpet fibers. The dual rotating mop pads apply consistent pressure to tackle dried-on spills and stubborn stains, while intelligent sensors prevent your carpets from getting wet.

Navigation is where the L10 Ultra truly shines. Using LiDAR technology and advanced mapping algorithms, it creates detailed floor plans of your home and plots the most efficient cleaning routes. It can recognize and avoid obstacles like shoes, cords, and pet bowls, minimizing the need to “prep” your home before cleaning.

The smartphone app provides comprehensive control over every aspect of cleaning. Set schedules, customize cleaning intensity for different rooms, create no-go zones, and monitor the robot's progress in real-time. Voice control through Alexa or Google Assistant adds hands-free convenience.

Battery life is impressive at up to 210 minutes, enough to clean up to 2,600 square feet on a single charge. If the battery runs low during a large job, the robot automatically returns to charge and resumes where it left off. That's great for if you just sat down and really don't feel like getting up to put the robot away.

At $300 (-62%), this represents exceptional value for a self-maintaining robot vacuum and mop combo. While there are cheaper robots available, none offer this level of autonomy and cleaning performance. This deal brings premium features into the mid-range price category, making it an excellent opportunity to upgrade your home cleaning game without breaking the bank.

There are so many PCs that are Pro, Plus, Max, or some similar combination, that when I hear "Master," it better be cream of the crop — one of the best gaming laptops. The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16, with its RTX 5080 laptop GPU and Intel Core Ultra 9 275 HX is a strong performer with a bright OLED screen, but there's still room for improvement.The Aorus Master starts at $3,099.99, which isn't cheap. For that, I expect top-tier build quality. And Gigabyte's other big push on the Aorus Master is its GiMate AI, which I found to be of dubious utility.That doesn't make the Aorus Master a bad gaming laptop – the performance is certainly there. But you'll have to decide if you're willing to accept some flaws and limitations while spending over three grand.

The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 is an expensive laptop, but it doesn't feel like it. Though many gaming laptops use plastic to prevent overheating and reduce weight, Gigabyte's implementation of the material doesn't feel great. The system feels cheap in spots.For instance, the lid has a lenticular material that reveals a ribbed pattern around the RGB-lit Aorus falcon logo. But the material feels like something I'd expect from a Happy Meal toy. At least on the lid, Gigabyte should've gone with premium aluminum. This laptop is over $3,000.

When you open the laptop, the Aorus branding is prominent. Besides a space on the bottom bezel, the Aorus logo is also displayed garishly across the touchpad, spilling onto the palm rest. Mix that with the RGB keyboard (including a handful of transparent keys), and there's no mistake that this laptop is meant not just for gaming, but for gamers. We've seen similar styling from Asus, particularly under its Strix Scar brand, but there's definitely an abundance of gamer signaling going on here.

There's plenty of RGB, including a light bar underneath the palm rest and a second on the rear of the laptop. There is also a small RGB projection of the Aorus wordmark from the rear of the laptop. My editor told me it "looks like the RGB is leaking."

On the left side of the laptop, there's a Thunderbolt 5 port over USB Type-C, a USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A port, HDMI 2.1, and an Ethernet jack. On the right side, there's another USB-A port, a Thunderbolt 4 port over USB-C, a microSD card slot, and a headphone jack. I'd rather see a full-size SD card slot on a laptop of this size (there seems to be room for it)



While I understand the desire to avoid putting ports on the rear of the laptop to allow for cooling, I wish the ports on the sides were closer to the back of the system. The power cable, in particular, was kind of bothersome when it was jutting out the side so close to the front.

Measuring 14.06 x 10.0 x 1.18 inches and weighing in at 5.51 pounds, the Aorus Master 16 isn't the most portable of gaming laptops. The Razer Blade 16 is trimmer at 13.98 x 9.86 x 0.69 inches and 4.72 pounds. The Alienware m18 R2 with an RTX 4090 and an 18-inch display was 16.15 x 12.59 x 1.05 inches and 8.63 pounds, while the HP Omen 16 was wider but thinner at 14.53 x 10.21 x 0.93 inches and weighed a similar 5.4 pounds.

For gaming, the Gigabyte armed the Aorus Master 16 with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU and an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX. These allow for solid gaming performance. And, as you'll see below, the 55 W CPU allows for stronger 1080p performance than the 28W part in the Razer Blade 16, despite that laptop having a 5090.

I used the Aorus Master 16 to continue my adventures in Alan Wake 2. I used the Quality render setting at native resolution with DLSS and 4x Frame Gen enabled, along with the high-quality graphics preset and ultra ray tracing. As I explored some previously haunted woods (look, things can get less haunted in this game), the frame rate ranged between 90 and 133 frames per second. Frame Gen was a necessity for these settings, though. Without them, the game sometimes ran below 30 frames per second, so I would have to turn the quality down.

Across our benchmarks, the Aorus Master 16 was the top performer at 1080p, hitting 185 frames per second on Shadow of the Tomb Raider, 172 FPS on Borderlands 3, and 120 FPS on the CPU-centric Far Cry 6.

At high resolutions, though, the Blade 16's RTX 5090 won out, as games are typically less dependent on the CPU as you add more pixels. So on Cyberpunk 2077 at ultra settings, the Blade 16 hit 43 FPS, while the Master was a tad behind at 38 FPS, while on Shadow of the Tomb Raider's highest settings, the Master hit 114 FPS while the Blade 16 reached 162 FPS. (In fact, the Master didn't beat the previous gen 4090 here). The exception was Far Cry 6, where the Aorus hit 113 FPS at 2560 x 1600.We did have some snags. Like the 5090 on the Razer Blade 16, the Master's 5080 couldn't run Red Dead Redemption 2 at 1080p — Nvidia clearly has some driver issues to work through — though it ran Borderlands 3 where its 50-series peer couldn't.We stress-tested the system with Metro Exodus at the RTX preset, using 15 runs to simulate half an hour of gaming. The system ran the gaming benchmark at an average of 111.45 FPS and was largely consistent run-to-run. The CPU's performance cores ran at an average of 4.8 GHz during the test, while the efficiency cores averaged at 1.68 GHz. The CPU package measured 81.21 Celsius. Meanwhile, the GPU ran at 1,609.59 MHz and climbed to 60.50 degrees C.

The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 utilizes an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX processor, a 24-core (8 performance cores, 16 efficiency cores), 55 W processor. Outside of gaming, it should meet on-the-go productivity needs. In our review unit, it was paired with 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD.

On Geekbench 6, the Aorus Master notched a single-core score of 3,049 and a multi-core score of 19,175. This beat the older Intel processors in the Alienware M18 R2 and HP Omen 16, as well as the AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 in the Razer Blade 16 (which has half as many cores).

The Gigabyte's drive proved slow on our file transfer test, copying 25GB of files at 665.26 MBps. Everything else far exceeded it, with the Alienware m18 R2 taking the lead at 2,304.52 MBps.But the Aorus Master took the lead on Handbrake, transcoding a 4K video to 1080p in 2 minutes and 7 seconds. The Blade 16 came in second at 3:05.

The 16-inch, 240 Hz, OLED panel on the Aorus Master is luminous, but not as vivid as Gigabyte's competition.As I explored a forest at sunrise in Alan Wake 2, the green foliage was vibrant, and the entire scene was lightly colored by an appropriate orange tint.



The Aorus has the brightest screen of our comparison bunch at 377.6 nits on our light meter, just surpassing the Razer Blade 16 at 371.8 nits.But the Razer Blade has the best screen based on color volume. The Aorus covered 81% of the DCI-P3 color space and 114.3% of the sRGB color space, but the Razer beat it by far at 144.6% DCI-P3. In this case, the Aorus was more in line with the HP Omen 16 and Alienware m18 R2, beating them each by only a few percentage points.

Gigabyte's keyboard features poppy scissor switches that provide a comfortable bounce while writing and gaming. But I wish the keycaps were larger, and there's clearly room for them, as Gigabyte has some speaker grille patterns (but not actual speaker grilles) on each side of the keyboard.



The touchpad is a generous 5.2 inches wide by 3.5 inches tall. At this price, I'd prefer to see haptic feedback, although the mechanical click works well enough here. The touchpad is smooth and worked well with Windows gestures when I used the system.

The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16's speakers are passable for listening to music. Doechii's "Anxiety" features multiple layers of vocals on top of a sample of Gotye's "Somebody That I Used to Know," and they were all discernible. While there's not much bass, the xylophone from the sample was loud and clear.The speakers are better tuned for gaming. In Alan Wake 2, dialogue was clear, and ominous background music was appropriately haunting.Dolby Access comes preinstalled to adjust the speakers, but making adjustments didn't do much to enhance the experience.

Removing the Master 16's bottom cover requires dispatching 12 screws. There are three sizes here, so be sure to keep track of which ones go where.The cover is held on tight, but a well-placed pry tool around the hinges lets you move around and click through the plastic clips. Be careful when removing the bottom, however, as there's a ribbon table attached to to control the RGB lighting. (In an interesting design choice, Gigabyte has loosely adhered that cable to the battery on the inside.)



The battery is easily accessible, though you'll need to separate that cable. You can also access the RAM SO-DIMMs and SSD. Our review unit used one SSD, but we appreciated a second slot so that you can upgrade the system on your own later. There's no sign of the Wi-Fi chip, which could be soldered or on the other side of the board.There is a small daughterboard attached to the mainboard by another ribbon cable. It has a PMIC label on it, suggesting that, among other uses, it could be for power management.

Gaming laptops usually need to be plugged in to hit their full potential, but the Aorus Master 16 is seeing slight generational gains in battery life. On our test, which sets the screen to 150 nits, browses the web, streams videos, and runs basic OpenGL tests, the Aorus ran for 5 hours and 2 minutes.



That's longer than last-gen Intel/Nvidia laptops, though the AMD/Nvidia-based Blade 16 - with its 28W CPU - ran for an impressive (at least, for a gaming laptop) 7:21.

We measure skin temperatures for gaming laptops while running the Metro Exodus benchmark. During that test, the center of the keyboard reached 92 degrees Fahrenheit, and the touchpad, while largely cooler, had one hot spot at 82 degrees. (That's not too uncomfortable to use, just warmer than the rest of the surface, which was closer to 75 degrees.

The hottest point on the bottom of the laptop reached 108 degrees F, which isn't too bad for a gaming machine of this caliber. Perhaps that's an argument in favor of the plastic Gigabyte uses for its chassis.

The camera on the Aorus Master 16 just passes muster. It's only 1080p, which is a shame on a laptop for over $3,000, but calls and photos weren't blurry or grainy. Some colors were a bit cool for my liking, and I appeared pretty pale under our office's fluorescent lights.



I wouldn't use this camera for game streaming, but it works well enough for meetings.

Gigabyte is mercifully light on the amount of software it includes on the Aorus Master. It boils down two apps: Gigabyte Speed and GiMate. Gigabyte Speed tries to prioritize gaming traffic on your network. The other is GiMate, a system monitor that Gigabyte claims has AI capabilities.GiMate doesn't actually feel that different from Gigabyte's previous Control Center. Its primary use is for changing performance modes, checking CPU and GPU speeds, and adjusting system settings. The GiMate is also ostensibly an AI agent. Gigabyte's big innovation to the app is adding a chatbot that doesn't do all that much. You can tell it that you want to play a game, and it will switch to Game Mode. Or you can write "I'm going to a meeting" and it will downclock in "Online Meeting Mode." But in the time it would take to chat with the LLM, you could switch these manually with two clicks. But when I ask it for the best settings for a game, it doesn't tell me. "What are the best settings for Assassin's Creed Shadows" simply throws the system into Game Mode. All this chatbot does is change hardware settings.

Gigabyte sells the Aorus Master 16 with a 1-year warranty.

We tested the Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 275 HX, Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, which will run you $3,099.99 as of this writing.There's one other variant of the Master 16 with the same CPU and RAM, but an RTX 5090 Laptop GPU and 2TB of storage. Those upgrades are pricey, though, bumping the cost to $4,299.99.

The Gigabyte Aorus Master 16 shows that Nvidia's RTX 5080 Laptop GPU is a powerful chip, often within striking distance of the more powerful RTX 5090 Laptop GPU and even more competitive than the 5090 when paired with a 28W CPU in the Razer Blade 16.But the Aorus Master, despite its $3,099 price as tested, doesn't feel like a premium device. Sure, the display is nice. But the plasticky build, especially on the lid, just doesn't feel like a laptop that costs so much money. Gigabyte needs to spend a bit more on build quality here.The GiMate AI isn't terribly helpful, especially the chatbot. Sure, I appreciate the nag to switch to integrated graphics whenever I unplug the device, but Nvidia Optimus can do that for me. The Chatbot is so limited in what it can do that I'd rather just go into an options menu and click.But the fundamental gaming performance is. While the 5090 outperforms the 5080 at higher resolutions, for my money, I think the 5080 is in a good place. I just wish the Aorus Master felt truly masterful in all regards.

It's nothing new—politicians complain about silly science projects funded by the government to get taxpayers riled up. I get it. You might think super expensive particle accelerators or even dirt-cheap experiments on the color of petunias are a waste of money.

OK, you're coming from a business perspective. But even if you care only about money in and money out, if you account for all the downstream effects—which no one can foresee—these projects often do pay off. (Read about the petunias!) Let me tell you about another silly little experiment that turned out to have an extremely high ROI.

In 1862, James Clerk Maxwell published his famous Maxwell's equations. This was at a time when humans were just starting to play around with batteries and electric currents. The first two of these four equations described the electric and magnetic fields around stationary charges.

The next equation comes from a cool phenomenon. If you take a magnet and move it near a coil of wire, you can create an electric current. Here's what that looks like:

This current is caused by an electric field inside the wire, so we could say that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field. But how do you make a magnetic field? Two ways: First, an electric current flowing in a wire makes a magnetic field. You can see this if you connect a wire to a battery and place it over a magnetic compass:

This is the basic idea behind an electromagnet. But Maxwell added a second mechanism—a changing electric field. In other words, he said, it works both ways: A changing magnetic field creates an electric field, and a changing electric field creates a magnetic field.

And here's why this was such a big deal: This suggested that changing electric and magnetic fields would create an oscillation that can travel through space: an electromagnetic wave. Well, that was the idea, but for years it remained unproven.

Then, in 1888, Heinrich Hertz created his little experiment. He used an oscillating electric current to create a spark that jumped across a gap in a wire. According to the theory, this spark would produce changing electric and magnetic fields that should propagate through space.

So he set up a second loop of wire with a gap—only this one wasn't attached to any power source. But looking closely, you could see that a second spark was created in this gap. Spooky! It showed that electromagnetic waves were real and they could travel across a room. (Early radio transmitters like Marconi's used this same spark-gap method.)

You can do this yourself. I mean, it's been like 150 years, so you probably have access to stuff that Hertz didn't have—like Legos. Here's what you need: some wire, an old barbecue lighter, and a light bulb. (I used a tiny neon bulb, but an LED works too.) The lighter has a piezoelectric crystal inside that can produce large voltages when compressed. That's what happens when you pull the trigger—the voltage creates a spark that ignites the fuel as it leaves the lighter. I removed the old fuel container and connected the piezoelectric to two wires.

In back there's another pair of wires with the bulb in between them. The key point here is that, like in Hertz's loop, these back wires are not connected to any power source. Here's the setup:

The lighter creates a tiny spark that jumps from one wire to the other in the front pair. This spark creates electromagnetic waves, with the two wires serving as transmission antennas to amplify the waves. The two wires in back are the receiving antennas, and they will produce an electric current just like with Hertz's loop of wire. Instead of creating a spark on the receiver, on my device the light bulb will turn on. The neon bulb is really nice since it's high-voltage but low-current, which is exactly what we need.

OK, lights out! Here's what it looks like when you fire that spark.

It might seem trivial, but it's not. You are actually both sending and receiving electromagnetic waves.

When Hertz showed his experimental verification of Maxwell's equations, the science community knew it was cool, and the general public got curious. Journalists, naturally—ever the pragmatists—asked him what it could be used for. His reply:

“It's of no use whatsoever … this is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right—we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. But they are there.”

Why waste money on experiments if they're not useful? Well, the honest truth is, that's not why we do science. Human nature makes us explorers. We ask questions and seek answers. It's just one of the things that make us who we are. Sometimes the answers are wrong (turns out the sun does not cross the sky in a chariot drawn by white horses), but we're always looking for better ones.

And sometimes science is accidentally useful. In fact, you are likely using the results of Hertz's experiment right now. He not only showed that Maxwell's equations were legit, he effectively invented the first radio transmitter. (Radio waves are just a slice of the electromagnetic spectrum.) This was then used for the wireless telegraph that allowed people to communicate with ships out at sea using Morse code. After that, people figured out how to send music and soap operas and commercials via radio waves, such that we now just call it “radio.” There was also this thing called television that could broadcast moving pictures through space.

But it doesn't stop there! Since the device sends out electromagnetic waves that reflect off objects, you can measure how long it takes for the signal to come back, which tells you how far away they are—i.e., radar and lidar, which is used in self-driving cars.  And of course, cell phone transmissions, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are all electromagnetic waves. It's literally everywhere—you're swimming in a sea of electromagnetic waves.

So if the US spends money on science, will it boost profits and economic growth? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. There are many cool discoveries with no real application. I mean, look at gravitational waves detected from colliding black holes. Will that lead to a new type of internet or something? Probably not. But we're definitely richer for knowing about it.

A bit overkill for a rumored 180W graphics card


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia is preparing to launch the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti to compete with AMD and the best graphics cards on the market. Meanwhile, VideoCardz has leaked various custom models from MSI, displaying the use of a 16-pin (12VHPWR) power connector.

The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is a forthcoming midrange gaming GPU from Nvidia, expected to have a 180W TDP. A single 8-pin PCIe power connector, capable of providing up to 150W, is more than adequate for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti since it can draw an additional 75W from the PCIe slot, resulting in a combined total of 225W. It's impossible to tell from the leaked renders if MSI utilizes the original 12VHPWR or the revised 12V-2x6 connector, but it should be the latter.

Utilizing a 16-pin power connector on a GeForce RTX 5060 Ti seems unnecessary, as the Blackwell-powered graphics card doesn't even use a third of the power connector's capacity. While some might suggest that MSI opted for the 16-pin connector for better cable organization, the visual distinction between a standard 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 16-pin one is minimal since both configurations ultimately require a single power cable.

At any rate, consumers shouldn't have to worry about the probability of the 16-pin power connector melting since a GeForce RTX 5060 Ti pulls nowhere near the same amount of power as a GeForce RTX 5090 or GeForce RTX 4090.

We can only speculate why MSI used a 16-pin power connector on a 180W graphics card. It's plausible that the company is recycling a previous PCB design for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, which would explain the presence of a 16-pin power connector. Alternatively, the custom model from MSI may feature an exceptionally high factory overclock that justifies the 16-pin power connector.

MSI seem to have four custom GeForce RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards ready for the market. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming Trio, available in black or white, is the flagship model with a triple-fan cooling system, while the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming leverages a dual-fan cooler. The trio of SKUs employs the 16-pin power connector. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Inspire 2X appears to be the only SKU with the 8-pin PCIe power connector.

Nvidia's mainstream Blackwell graphics cards offer PCIe 5.0 support, though this interface is overkill for gaming purposes. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti will also support PCIe 5.0, but with a twist. The MSI renders indicate that the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, which reportedly utilizes the GB206 silicon, features a PCIe 5.0 x8 connection to communicate with the motherboard.

It doesn't come as a shock that Nvidia's x060-class graphics cards, such as the GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, along with AMD's Radeon RX x600 models like the Radeon RX 6600 or Radeon RX 7600, came with an x8 electrical PCIe interface. Graphics cards in this tier are typically not fast enough to merit an x16 connection, and an x8 connection somewhat helps reduce manufacturing cost.

While the 16-pin power connector has proven problematic, it's here to stay. Currently AMD continues to cling to the 8-pin PCIe power connectors for its current RDNA 4 graphics cards, at least one manufacturer, Sapphire, has put a 16-pin power connector on a Radeon RX 9070 XT. Some high-end power supplies have already started to decrease the number of 8-pin PCIe power cables in favor of the 16-pin.

Bringing an audio speaker into the bathtub with you used to be, well, inadvisable. At best. And many of those portable Bluetooth speakers that boast of being waterproof are only seaworthy to a point. Then there is Anker's Soundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth Shower Speaker, which rocks a degree of waterproofing so great that it floats. Skeptical? It's worth a $20 bet to find out, which is what the Soundcore Select 4 Go is selling for right now at Amazon during a 39% off sale.

We're not advocating that you make using the Soundcore Select 4 Go in your bath or pool as a regular habit, but should an accidental dunking occur, the Soundcore Select 4 Go can be immersed in up to 3.3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes without damage. It's barely half a pound in weight and has a built-in loop for your showerhead, handlebars, carabiner, or anything else you want to attach it to for great sound on the go without fear of the elements.

See at Amazon

The hand-sized Soundcore Select 4 Go cranks out 5 watts worth of clear, beautiful sound from any Bluetooth device you choose to pair it with. It's USB-rechargeable with the included cable, and a full charge gets you 20 hours of listening time. Even after 300 charging cycles at max current, the Soundcore Select 4 Go's battery retains 95% of its performance. Between that and its amazingly durable construction, this should provide years of portable listening.

You can also double your pleasure by pairing two Soundcore Select 4 Go speakers to your Bluetooth device — they'll assume stereo separation with one taking on the left channel and the other one the right channel. This 39% off Amazon deal is the perfect time to grab two Soundcore Select 4 Go speakers and set them up for clear, long-lasting, budget-friendly stereo sound.

The Soundcore Select 4 Go has “shower” in its name, and it is indeed a perfect shower speaker thanks to its long battery life and IP67 waterproofing. But it's also ideal for the beach or a day out on a boat — remember, in case it goes overboard, it floats — or clipped to handlebars or a backpack for a day of outdoor adventuring, because it's also rated IP67 for dustproofing. It work equally well indoors in a dry room, but when you have this kind of insurance against the elements, that almost seems like a wasted opportunity.

The Soundcore Select 4 Go comes in six colors, but only the black model is part of this 39% off Amazon deal. When you can save $13 and the performance is identical, why be picky about the color? Head to Amazon now and lock in a summer of outdoor tunes free that will last regardless of the elements.

A loophole enables the generators to be used for 364 days without a permit

Last year it turned out that Elon Musk's xAI had to install additional ‘portable' generators near its facility adjacent to Memphis, Tennessee, to power the Colossus supercomputer with over 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs as local power grid could not support the load. The Southern Environmental Law Center contends the generators are "illegal," yet they can keep running, reports The Guardian.

xAI's Colossus supercomputer consumes about 150 MW of power when equipped with 100,000 H100 GPUs. More when it is upgraded to 200,000 processors. However, last July the site near Memphis, Tennessee, could only provide 8 MW of power to the facility, so Musk's company had to install gas fueled turbines to power the colossal supercomputer.

However, the company had only sought permits for 15 units, but aerial images now show double that number in operation. Apparently, 20 gas generators are now running without the required approvals, raising alarm from environmental groups and nearby residents, according to The Guardian who refer to KeShaun Pearson, director of the advocacy group Memphis Community Against Pollution. Pearson stated to the Shelby count board of commissioners (Memphis, Tennessee) that xAI is using 35 methane gas burning turbines while only having a permit for 15.

The company seems to be using a legal loophole that allows turbines to run without permits if they are not fixed in one location for more than 364 days. In January, xAI filed for approval of 15 turbines, but the other 20 were not included and still have no legal clearance. However, they can keep running for months before xAI gets formal approval, if local authorities actually approve them.

The Southern Environmental Law Center revealed images and calculations showing that the turbines can produce 420 MW, an amount sufficient to power a city. According to senior attorney Amanda Garcia, xAI has essentially created an unregulated power facility in a residential area, posing significant health and environmental risks.

The law center stated in a letter that these generators are a major pollution source and breach federal air quality rules, including emissions of hazardous and cancer-causing substances. They demanded that the local health agency issue an emergency halt to the operations and fine the company $25,000 for every day it continues to run them without proper authorization.

A company representative scheduled to address the county board did not attend the meeting, according to The Guardian.

The semiconductor industry is among the worst offenders in PFAS use and pollution.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A team at Australia's Monash University has published its work on a new water filtration membrane that can successfully remove small PFAS molecules from water flow. PFAS, or polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a key piece in multiple facets of semiconductor manufacturing that have earned the name "forever chemicals" for their difficulty to clean up.

Monash's research team is ready to utilize some key partnerships to bring the filters to market at a high scale, keeping PFAS out of the groundwater at plants in all of the various industries that work with forever chemicals. The semiconductor industry, however, has long been opposed to legislation or other initiatives to restrict its use of PFAS in fabrication, forming lobbying groups and other coalitions to conserve the use of forever chemicals in chipmaking.

Monash University's team, led by Ph.D. candidate Eubert Mahofa, has designed a modified graphene membrane that selectively stops PFAS chains while allowing water to pass through freely. The membrane stops over 90% of PFAS that pass into it, a major improvement over traditional polyamide membranes, which can only remove around 35% of PFAS.

"PFAS are difficult to manage because they dissolve easily in water and can spread far from their original source, making contamination challenging to contain and remediate," shared Mahofa. "Our approach solves this by filtering out and concentrating these harmful chemicals while still allowing water to flow through efficiently, making it a strong candidate to supplement the technologies for PFAS destruction."

PFAS have been known as forever chemicals since their societal reckoning in the 1990's. Defined by carbon-fluorine bonds, which can have half-lives over eight years long, PFAS chains consistently leech into groundwater supplies, remaining there indefinitely. Certain PFAS are highly dangerous to humans if inhaled or ingested, and others will end up "stuck" in humans or animals after death.

The new filtration method utilizes specific chemical relationships to catch even the smallest PFAS bonds, which typically slip past traditional polyamide methods. The new barrier stops these bonds at varying temperatures while still maintaining efficient water flow, making the new tech nothing short of a breakthrough development.

"This breakthrough in PFAS filtration has the potential to revolutionize how PFAS contamination is managed globally, with applications ranging from landfill leachate treatment to industrial wastewater purification," says Professor Mainak Majumder of the Australian Research Council, which contributed to the research, in the press release.

Monash University and the Australian Research Council have close connections with NematiQ, a graphene-focused manufacturer that has pledged to help bring the new filter to market. Commercialization seems like a likely next step for the new technology, made easier by the study's focus on using highly scalable shear alignment printing to produce its filters.

PFAS have been used in industrial manufacturing since Teflon's invention in the 1930s. Today, countless industries, including semiconductors, use the chemicals in various facets of manufacturing. PFAS were originally thought to be chemically inert and harmless to humans, an assumption that held for decades. However, once PFAS was found swimming in the bloodstream and organs of longtime industrial workers, more research was done, and more risks were found.

PFAS chemicals are now linked to a variety of toxic effects by governments and health organizations, including developmental issues, infertility, and cancer. PFAS exposure comes from industrial chemicals that soil water tables and rainwater but also from clothes, cosmetic items, and consumption of animals with PFAS exposure. It is estimated that the majority of humans living today have some amount of PFAS already permanently in their bodies.

Certain PFAS, including PFOS and PFOA, have already been banned by the European Union and eventually worldwide as of 2009 for their egregious health risks. The EU is beginning to pursue legislation that would ban the entire PFAS group, but this legislation has been challenged by myriad lobbyist efforts, including serious resistance from the semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry uses PFAS up and down the microchip supply chain, and as such has launched multiple efforts to slow progress on PFAS restrictions. Semi, an industry association representing companies across the electronics supply chain, publishes an explainer guide on the semiconductor industry's use of PFAS in chip fabs. The guide includes all of the following uses for PFAS in chip fabs.

PFAS are present in chemicals necessarily used during chip fabrication, including photoresist liquids used during lithography and etch chamber gases used in wafer production. Chemical purifiers that produce hydrogen for use in EUV lithography also may contain PFAS, along with more tertiary parts of development like lithium batteries or plastic chip packaging. Semi's public page presents an overwhelming amount of possible places where PFAS may be used, tacitly stating that PFAS use is so widespread that to remove it entirely from chipmaking is too uphill a fight.

A collection of industry members also recently established the Semiconductor PFAS Consortium, a group more obviously dedicated to combating efforts to stop PFAS use in chipmaking. While the Consortium claims on its homepage that it is not focused on advocacy, this is not the case. The group's efforts in American politics were widely reported in August, when the Consortium spread its whitepapers against PFAS restrictions across Capitol Hill.

The PFAS Consortium's parent company successfully lobbied lawmakers for a bill removing chip fabrication plants from inclusion in certain environmental restrictions on manufacturing byproducts. The Consortium promised lawmakers that it would voluntarily self-regulate and eventually decrease its use of pollutants if legislation was not enacted forcing them to do so.

The semiconductor industry stands staunchly opposed to any further restrictions on PFAS use, with the PFAS Consortium's 2023 paper containing the quote, "it is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible in some instances, to find viable alternatives [to PFASs] without stepping back decades in technological advancement."

This stance has been defended even in the face of breakthrough findings that disprove it. The Consortium recently argued against a widespread study proposing safer and effective alternatives to PFAS use in chipmaking. While the study identifies multiple surfactants that are both superior in quality and lower in toxicity than PFASs in etching wafers, surfactants which are now used instead of PFAS by some smaller fabs, the Consortium quickly published its own negative response to the study, only accessible by approved members of certain companies.

How the semiconductor industry responds to the recent breakthrough study on PFAS filtration remains to be seen. Data taken in 2022 from an unnamed chip fab found 78,000 parts per trillion of PFAS in the fab's wastewater, worlds higher than the EPA limit of 4 ppt, proving that Monash University's new water filtration would directly positively impact the local ecosystems around high-PFAS-use chip fabs. It is nice to hope that fabs across the industry will voluntarily use the new filters for the well-being of their communities, but the semiconductor industry's track record shows this will likely not be the case.

Microsoft announced on Friday that it is buying 3.7 million metric tons of carbon removal credits from CO280, a project developer that works with pulp and paper mills.

The purchase covers 12 years of emissions from CO280's first carbon capture project at a mill on the Gulf Coast. CO280 expects the facility to start capturing CO2 in 2028. 

Microsoft's purchase should help it meet its goal of becoming a carbon-negative company by 2030 — that is, removing more carbon than its business produces. But even with Microsoft's enviable balance sheet, it's a tall order: The company generated 17.1 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2023.

To trim that number, Microsoft has been buying large amounts of renewable power and, to tackle what it can't replace with renewables, it has been inking deals that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to offset what it can't eliminate.

The Microsoft project is the first of a dozen that CO280 has in the works, co-founder and CEO Jonathan Rhone exclusively told TechCrunch. Rhone, who used to sell power plants to the pulp and paper industry, said that adding carbon capture to the process seemed like a natural fit. 

“It just seemed like a no-brainer that everyone had missed,” he said. The pulp and paper industry releases around 100 million metric tons of biogenic carbon dioxide annually.

To build the carbon capture facility, CO280 is working with SLB Capturi, a joint venture between SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) and Aker Carbon Capture. The capture technology is based on the widely used amine process, and it will be attached to a large paper mill's recovery boiler, which helps recycle various chemicals for reuse. The boiler also releases a lot of carbon that was locked up in the wood itself.

Normally, the wood-locked carbon would be dumped into the atmosphere. But by drawing CO2 from this step in the process, the paper mill will be effectively removing carbon from the atmosphere by way of photosynthesis. “The trees do all the heavy lifting by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere,” Rhone said.

Once captured, the carbon dioxide will be sent 40 miles via pipeline to a saline aquifer that is being used for CO2 storage. Altogether, this first phase of the project will capture about 40% of the biogenic carbon dioxide released by the mill and 30% of the total CO2, including from fossil fuels used to power the operation. CO280 is planning a second phase that should double those figures.

Rhone said that the carbon capture units will be built as joint ventures with the paper mills. In return, the mills will receive a portion of the carbon credit proceeds, helping boost their bottom line. CO280 sells its credits at around $200 per metric ton, and buyers can claim tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, bringing the cost down further.

CO280 previously sold carbon removal credits to Frontier, the advanced market commitment created by Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others.

Well, if it ever reaches commercial phase.

A startup called Maxwell Labs, with support from Sandia National Laboratories, is working on a new technology that will cool high-performance computing hardware with lasers, reports The Register.

As heat dissipation has become a major challenge for modern data centers, various cooling methods have been tried and deployed in recent years. For years, the industry has relied on air cooling; then, big companies began to experiment with liquid cooling, tried both warm water cooling and chilled water cooling, tested immersion cooling, and even planned to deploy it in the coming years. There is one thing that has not been used for cooling yet: lasers. Yet, lasers can be used to take away heat from processors. But there is a catch.

A startup called Maxwell Labs, with support from Sandia National Laboratories, is working on a new way to cool high-performance computing hardware, reports The Register. The technique uses special cold plates made of ultrapure gallium arsenide (GaAs) that cool down when they receive focused beams of coherent laser light of a certain wavelength. Rather than heating, which is common in most interactions involving intense light beams, this carefully engineered setup allows the semiconductor to shed heat at precise locations thanks to the high electron mobility of GaAs. The method promises to assist traditional cooling systems rather than replace them.

To implement this in practical applications, the GaAs semiconductors are structured into thin components placed directly on high-heat regions of processors. Microscopic patterns within the semiconductor guide the coherent beams precisely to these hot spots, resulting in highly localized cooling, which ensures efficiency by directly managing heat exactly where it becomes problematic instead of attempting to use GaAs and lasers to cool down an entire system. This technique has roots in earlier studies: back in 2012, at the University of Copenhagen, they cooled a tiny membrane to -269°C using a similar method, according to the report.

Additionally, this technique offers a unique capability: it can recapture the energy removed as heat, according to Maxwell. Rather than dissipating into the environment, the thermal energy extracted from chips can be emitted as usable photons, which are convertible back into electrical power. While this certainly increases the overall energy efficiency of computing systems, the efficiency of the process remains to be seen.

While the approach to use GaAs semiconductors for cooling is certainly an innovation, it is associated with extreme challenges both from the cost and manufacturability points of view.

First up, producing ultrapure GaAs wafers requires complex, energy-intensive techniques like molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). As we are dealing with ultrapure crystalline layers, defect rates can be high, which affects costs. At the moment, a 200-mm wafer made from GaAs can cost around $5,000, while a silicon wafer of the same size might be priced as low as $5, according to WaferWorld.

GaAs transistors cannot be seamlessly integrated into traditional silicon-based chips on a single wafer. However, if someone wants to use GaAs transistors for cooling traditional chips (or rather chiplets), they can use heterogeneous 3D integration or wafer bonding, which are well-known techniques for systems that use silicon photonics. While these techniques are quite expensive, they are not as costly as GaAs wafers per se.

Currently, the concept remains in the experimental and modeling stage. According to Maxwell Labs chief executive Jacob Balma, simulations suggest the method is promising, but it has never been confirmed in physical trials as testing so far has been limited to separate components rather than a full setup.

Speaking of a full setup, Maxwell Labs expects to complete a functioning prototype by the fall of 2025. Interestingly, Maxwell has already found early adopters for its first version, named MXL-Gen1, and plans to deliver initial systems over the next two years. Broader access is projected for the end of 2027, assuming development stays on track.

Several AI chatbots designed for fantasy and sexual role-playing conversations are leaking user prompts to the web in almost real time, new research seen by WIRED shows. Some of the leaked data shows people creating conversations detailing child sexual abuse, according to the research.

Conversations with generative AI chatbots are near instantaneous—you type a prompt and the AI responds. If the systems are configured improperly, however, this can lead to chats being exposed. In March, researchers at the security firm UpGuard discovered around 400 exposed AI systems while scanning the web looking for misconfigurations. Of these, 117 IP addresses are leaking prompts. The vast majority of these appeared to be test setups, while others contained generic prompts relating to educational quizzes or nonsensitive information, says Greg Pollock, director of research and insights at UpGuard. “There were a handful that stood out as very different from the others,” Pollock says.

Three of these were running-role playing scenarios where people can talk to a variety of predefined AI “characters”—for instance, one personality called Neva is described as a 21-year-old woman who lives in a college dorm room with three other women and is “shy and often looks sad.” Two of the role-playing setups were overtly sexual. “It's basically all being used for some sort of sexually explicit role play,” Pollock says of the exposed prompts. “Some of the scenarios involve sex with children.”

Over a period of 24 hours, UpGuard collected prompts exposed by the AI systems to analyze the data and try to pin down the source of the leak. Pollock says the company collected new data every minute, amassing around 1,000 leaked prompts, including those in English, Russia, French, German, and Spanish.

It was not possible to identify which websites or services are leaking the data, Pollock says, adding it is likely from small instances of AI models being used, possibly by individuals rather than companies. No usernames or personal information of people sending prompts were included in the data, Pollock says.

Across the 952 messages gathered by UpGuard—likely just a glimpse of how the models are being used—there were 108 narratives or role-play scenarios, UpGuard's research says. Five of these scenarios involved children, Pollock adds, including those as young as 7.

“LLMs are being used to mass-produce and then lower the barrier to entry to interacting with fantasies of child sexual abuse,” Pollock says. “There's clearly absolutely no regulation happening for this, and it seems to be a huge mismatch between the realities of how this technology is being used very actively and what the regulation would be targeted at.”

WIRED last week reported that a South Korea–based image generator was being used to create AI-generated child abuse and exposed thousands of images in an open database. The company behind the website shut the generator down after being approached by WIRED. Child-protection groups around the world say AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which is illegal in many countries, is growing quickly and making it harder to do their jobs. The UK's anti-child-abuse charity has also called for new laws against generative AI chatbots that “simulate the offence of sexual communication with a child.”

All of the 400 exposed AI systems found by UpGuard have one thing in common: They use the open source AI framework called llama.cpp. This software allows people to relatively easily deploy open source AI models on their own systems or servers. However, if it is not set up properly, it can inadvertently expose prompts that are being sent. As companies and organizations of all sizes deploy AI, properly configuring the systems and infrastructure being used is crucial to prevent leaks.

Rapid improvements to generative AI over the past three years have led to an explosion in AI companions and systems that appear more “human.” For instance, Meta has experimented with AI characters that people can chat with on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. Generally, companion websites and apps allow people to have free-flowing conversations with AI characters—portraying characters with customizable personalities or as public figures such as celebrities.

People have found friendship and support from their conversations with AI—and not all of them encourage romantic or sexual scenarios. Perhaps unsurprisingly, though, people have fallen in love with their AI characters, and dozens of AI girlfriend and boyfriend services have popped up in recent years.

Claire Boine, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Washington University School of Law and affiliate of the Cordell Institute, says millions of people, including adults and adolescents, are using general AI companion apps. “We do know that many people develop some emotional bond with the chatbots,” says Boine, who has published research on the subject. “People being emotionally bonded with their AI companions, for instance, make them more likely to disclose personal or intimate information.”

However, Boine says, there is often a power imbalance in becoming emotionally attached to an AI created by a corporate entity. “Sometimes people engage with those chats in the first place to develop that type of relationship,” Boine says. “But then I feel like once they've developed it, they can't really opt out that easily.”

As the AI companion industry has grown, some of these services lack content moderation and other controls. Character AI, which is backed by Google, is being sued after a teenager from Florida died by suicide after allegedly becoming obsessed with one of its chatbots. (Character AI has increased its safety tools over time.) Separately, users of the generative AI tool Replika were upended when the company made changes to its personalities.

Aside from individual companions, there are also role-playing and fantasy companion services—each with thousands of personas people can speak with—that place the user as a character in a scenario. Some of these can be highly sexualized and provide NSFW chats. They can use anime characters, some of which appear young, with some sites claiming they allow “uncensored” conversations.

“We stress test these things and continue to be very surprised by what these platforms are allowed to say and do with seemingly no regulation or limitation,” says Adam Dodge, the founder of Endtab (Ending Technology-Enabled Abuse). “This is not even remotely on people's radar yet.” Dodge says these technologies are opening up a new era of online pornography, which can in turn introduce new societal problems as the technology continues to mature and improve. “Passive users are now active participants with unprecedented control over the digital bodies and likenesses of women and girls,” he says of some sites.

While UpGuard's Pollock could not directly connect the leaked data from the role-playing chats to a single website, he did see signs that indicated character names or scenarios could have been uploaded to multiple companion websites that allow user input. Data seen by WIRED shows that the scenarios and characters in the leaked prompts are hundreds of words long, detailed, and complex.

“This is a never-ending, text-based role-play conversation between Josh and the described characters,” one of the system prompts says. It adds that all the characters are over 18 and that, in addition to “Josh,” there are two sisters who live next door to the character. The characters' personalities, bodies, and sexual preferences are described in the prompt. The characters should “react naturally based on their personality, relationships, and the scene” while providing “engaging responses” and “maintain a slow-burn approach during intimate moments,” the prompt says.

“When you go to those sites, there are hundreds of thousands of these characters, most of which involve pretty intense sexual situations,” Pollock says, adding the text based communication mimics online and messaging group chats. “You can write whatever sexual scenarios you want, but this is truly a new thing where you have the appearance of interacting with them in almost exactly the same way you interact with a lot of people.” In other words, they're designed to be engaging and to encourage more conversation.

That can lead to situations where people may overshare and create risks. “If people are disclosing things they've never told anyone to these platforms and it leaks, that is the Everest of privacy violations,” Dodge says. “That's an order of magnitude we've never seen before and would make really good leverage to sextort someone.”

AI-native psychiatry, built for scale and covered by insurance

We're building the AI-native operations layer for psychiatric care. Not diagnostics, but what happens outside the visit—the real operational backend: scheduling, documentation, billing, intake, risk detection, and more.

If you want to build core infrastructure with real AI, own systems end-to-end, and work directly with a deeply technical founder still up to his neck in the code—read on.

Hey—I'm Daniel, co-founder and CTO of Legion Health (YC S21).

Mental health care is operationally broken—patients ghosted, clinicians buried in forms, payers chasing missing notes.

The industry is flooded with AI startups trying to automate away diagnosis—and even providers as a whole. But diagnostics aren't the bottleneck. Operations are.

So, we're solving the real problem:

"What if operations worked?”

We're building a real-time, AI-powered backend for mental health clinics—LLM agents + structured systems that coordinate human care like it's software. Think:

And we're already live. Our agent infrastructure supports over 2,000+ patients — with only one support human.

Unlike most AI startups, we are our own customer. We operate our own large psychiatric practice. The systems you build directly impact our clinicians and patients today. No theoretical B2B pitches, begging for pilots, and months of stakeholder alignment and bureaucracy—just real-world, high-stakes operational challenges.

⭐ If you've felt like AI is being wasted on toy tools or B2B busywork—come work on something real.

This is the moment where foundational hires make the company. You're not joining an idea-stage pipe dream or a late-stage dinosaur. You're helping us define the future.

This isn't a feature factory. We move fast, shipping multiple meaningful features straight to real patients and providers every single day.

You'll own entire domains end-to-end—architecture, implementation, iteration—not just JIRA tickets. This is the frontier of applied AI in healthcare.

You'll help answer questions at the frontier of AI, like:

What does reliable agent infrastructure look like in production?

What's the role of structured data in a world with LLMs?

How do we make agents auditable, evolvable, and fast?

We're not looking for warm bodies. We're looking for founding technologists who can think in systems and ship fast.

Backend:

Node.js, TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres), AWS (ECS, Lambda, S3)

Frontend:

Next.js 15, Tailwind, Vercel

AI Infra:

OpenAI, Anthropic, agentic loops and workflows, observability and eval (e.g. Langfuse), embeddings and vector DBs, tool-calling, model context protocol (MCPs), etc.

Other:

PHI security, audit pipelines, real-time schedulers, transcript parsing

This is the moment when the infrastructure is still malleable. When the next 20 years of mental health care can still be shaped by a few engineers with systems taste, speed, and conviction.

You won't be joining as employee #73. You'll be founding the engineering culture. You'll have a direct line to me. You'll shape core systems and help decide what we build next.

If you've ever said, “I wish I could've been there when [insert legendary product] was getting built,” this is that moment.

If this resonates, I want to work with you. Let's build the founding systems of AI-native mental healthcare—and make something people didn't think was possible.

We're rebuilding psychiatry from the ground up—AI-native, insurance-covered, and engineered to scale.

Legion Health is a high-quality psychiatry network where patients get care from licensed clinicians, fast and affordably. Under the hood, our LLM agents and orchestration layer automate operations, reduce admin, and enable truly great care.

Most startups bolt AI onto broken workflows. We're replacing the workflows—and the system underneath.

If you've ever wanted to use AI to actually fix something that matters, this is your shot.

A new research perspective was published in Oncotarget, Volume 16, on April 4, 2025, titled "GSK3β activation is a key driver of resistance to Raf inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma cells."

In this work, first author Diana Crisan and corresponding author Abhijit Basu from the University Hospital Ulm led a team that presents experimental evidence pointing to the protein GSK3β as a key contributor to drug resistance in melanoma. Their findings suggest that GSK3β becomes increasingly active in cancer cells during treatment, helping them survive and adapt despite ongoing therapy with BRAF inhibitors.

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer in which nearly half of patients have mutations in the BRAF gene that accelerate tumor growth. While treatments targeting BRAF, known as BRAF inhibitors, initially work well, tumors often find ways to fight back. This research perspective explores how GSK3β, a protein involved in metabolism and cell survival, becomes more active in melanoma cells that develop resistance to BRAF inhibitors.

Researchers treated melanoma cells with a common BRAF mutation using Dabrafenib, a widely used BRAF inhibitor. Over time, the cancer cells developed resistance and showed a marked increase in GSK3β levels. This pattern was confirmed across multiple melanoma cell models, suggesting that the finding is consistent and reliable.

Importantly, the researchers observed that treating resistant cancer cells with a GSK3β inhibitor significantly reduced their growth. This result suggests that blocking this protein could restore sensitivity to treatment, highlighting GSK3β as a promising therapeutic target and supporting the idea of combining GSK3β inhibitors with existing melanoma therapies.

"Remarkably, treatment of BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells with the GSK3 inhibitor LY2090314 for three weeks could overcome resistance and significantly decreased melanoma cell growth, confirming the causal role of GSK3 activation for BRAFi resistance development."

The research perspective adds to ongoing efforts to understand and overcome melanoma drug resistance. It shows that resistance is not driven only by genetic mutations but may also involve adaptive changes in the cell's internal signaling and survival mechanisms. By identifying GSK3β as a potential contributor, the authors offer a new direction for improving the durability of targeted treatments in melanoma.

As research continues, GSK3β may be a critical factor in the long-term success of melanoma therapy, particularly for patients who have stopped responding to standard BRAF-targeted drugs.

The use of virtual reality haptic simulators can enhance skill acquisition and reduce stress among dental students during preclinical endodontic training, according to a new study published in the International Endodontic Journal. The study was based on collaboration between the University of Eastern Finland, the University of Health Sciences and the University of Ondokuz Mayıs in Turkey as well as Grande Rio University in Brazil.

The study aimed to evaluate the influence of virtual reality (VR) haptic simulators on skill acquisition and stress reduction in endodontic preclinical education of dental students.

During preclinical training, dental students develop manual dexterity, psychomotor skills and confidence essential in clinical practice. VR and haptic technology are increasingly used alongside conventional methods, enabling more repetition and standardised feedback, among other things.

In the present study, 40 volunteered dental students enrolled in preclinical endodontic training were randomly divided into two groups. One group trained with VR haptic simulators before practicing on artificial teeth, while the other practiced on artificial teeth first, followed by VR simulator. All received standardised lectures and demonstrations on access cavity preparation. Pre- and post-training evaluations included stress level measurements, manual dexterity assessments and self-confidence surveys.

Students who started their training with VR haptic simulators demonstrated significantly higher manual dexterity scores and self-assessed proficiency, as well as lower anxiety levels during preclinical training sessions, compared to the other group. In addition, they felt better prepared and more confident in performing access cavity preparations and managing procedural challenges.

Stress levels were notably reduced following simulator practice in both groups. Simulator-based performance metrics were similar between the groups.

The researchers point out that further research is needed to explore long-term effects and optimal integration strategies for VR simulators in dental curricula.

UK-based blood testing company Thriva has joined forces with medical device manufacturer Tasso to use their innovative blood testing technology to tackle needle phobia, a condition that affects at least 1 in 10 adults. This health tech collaboration aims to make blood testing accessible and pain-free for individuals who experience an intense fear of needles by using a non-invasive, needle-free method.

Needle phobia often deters people from seeking essential medical care, including preventative health measures. It is estimated that 10% of adults avoid vaccinations or medical procedures due to this reason, a decision that can have long-term health consequences. Regular preventative health screenings, including blood tests, are crucial for the early detection of potential health issues and proactive health management. Research by the British Medical Association indicates that 40% of the uptake of health services in England may be preventable by tackling the drivers of ill-health.

The prevalence of needle phobia is exceptionally high among children and young adults, with up to 63% of children and 25% of young adults reporting needle-related fears. These fears can stem from a variety of psychological and physiological factors, including vasovagal responses (fainting due to a drop in blood pressure), hyperalgesia (heightened sensitivity to pain), and traumatic past experiences with needles. 

Harriet Evans, 24, from the Lake District, shares her experience with needle phobia: 'I've been scared of needles for as long as I can remember. I'm not entirely sure what caused it, but I think it might stem from an operation I had as a child. There were a lot of blood tests, and I remember them sticking all sorts of things in my arms and hands. There's even a story about when I was a kid and went to the doctor's for vaccines. I was so scared that I ripped the needle out of my arm.'

Regular health testing via blood tests is crucial for helping people detect potential health issues early and take appropriate action, as well as for the management of long-term health. Thriva's blood tests screen for a variety of health issues using biomarkers in the blood, including cardiovascular health, liver function, hormonal balance, kidney function, iron levels and nutritional deficiencies providing comprehensive data to support people to manage their health.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on finger pricks or venous blood draws, Thriva's personalized blood testing services uses the Tasso device, empowering users to track their health progress over time via regular testing (usually every 3-6 months). After testing, users receive a report by a GP in plain English, offering personalized lifestyle change recommendations based on the results. People also have the option of speaking to a doctor as part of the service, or taking the report to their own GP for further discussion of their results. 

Tasso complements this approach with its innovative Tasso+ device, which enables virtually painless blood collection. The device uses advanced technology to collect whole liquid blood samples without the need for needles or finger pricks. This user-friendly solution allows individuals to perform tests at home, in their own time, fostering a sense of control that is particularly beneficial for those with needle phobia.

Reflecting on her experience using the technology, Harriet said: “I had some general symptoms, like fatigue, around this time last year, and I have a family history of an underactive thyroid, so I wanted to get things checked out. That's when I found Thriva. The main benefit of home testing kits is that you're empowered to do things in your own time. When I go to the doctor, I feel like I have to do the blood test then and there. With home tests, you decide when you're ready. Taking back control is a big part of tackling a phobia."

“I decided which day I wanted to do the test, I had a cup of tea and a snack, put the TV on, and did it one step at a time. I put the patch on first, decided when to click it, felt the tiniest needle, and then didn't feel anything. It was over before I knew it.”

This partnership between Thriva and Tasso represents a major step forward in making healthcare more inclusive and accessible. By eliminating the pain and anxiety associated with traditional blood testing methods, the collaboration aims to address both needle phobia and the broader need for accessible preventative care, ensuring more people can monitor their health and take timely action.

By combining Thriva's technology and expertise with Tasso's innovative blood collection device, we empower people to understand what's happening inside their bodies through regular, painless testing. This approach helps individuals optimize their health for both immediate and long-term well-being. It goes beyond simply identifying problems—we provide the insights and support needed for meaningful, lasting improvements."

Dr. Vishal Shah, Chief Medical Officer, Thriva

Erwin Berthier, Co-founder of Tasso, added: "At Tasso, we're passionate about making high-quality blood testing easy and accessible to drive personalized health solutions. Our Tasso+ device is designed to eliminate the barriers that keep people from getting the important health information they need. Partnering with Thriva brings our virtually painless blood collection technology to a wider audience, empowering patients with needle phobia to take control of their health in a comfortable and convenient way."

The National Lipid Association (NLA) and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) have released a Joint Scientific Statement focused on the management of hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years who do not have a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).  Published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society and the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, this collaborative effort, developed by a diverse team of clinical lipidologists, cardiologists, geriatricians, and pharmacists, offers evidence-based guidance to help clinicians navigate the complexities of cholesterol management in a growing population of older adults.

Older persons have many competing medical and social needs, so treating high cholesterol in those without cardiovascular disease may not always be straightforward for clinicians and patients. We hope to help provide as much clarity as possible."

Vera Bittner, MD, MSPH, MNLA, co-chair of the scientific statement

The statement reviews the current evidence surrounding lipid-lowering therapies in older individuals without established ASCVD and offers pragmatic recommendations to support clinical decision-making in this unique population.

"The AGS is excited to have aligned our efforts with NLA to ensure that lipid management for adults over 75 years of age is personalized, evidence-based, and mindful of the diverse needs of our aging population," added Sunny Linnebur, PharmD, co-chair of the statement.

As the U.S. population continues to age, the number of individuals over 75 years old living without diagnosed cardiovascular disease is growing. However, the decision to initiate or continue cholesterol-lowering therapy in these patients can be challenging due to limited clinical trial data, the presence of comorbidities, polypharmacy, and differing goals of care.

This statement serves as a critical resource to guide personalized treatment decisions-balancing potential benefits in ASCVD prevention with the realities of aging and the end-of-life, frailty, medication burden, and patient preferences.

One of the world's foremost pain experts has highlighted the risks of bypassing established processes for assessing the safety and effectiveness of medicines at the launch of a research center at the University of Queensland.

In a public lecture, President of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Professor Andrew Rice used an analysis of the use of cannabinoids for pain relief to illustrate concerns.

The collective body of work from our taskforce on cannabis and cannabinoid analgesia represents the most rigorous and unbiased appraisal of both preclinical and clinical evidence published to date.

We analyzed 36 randomized controlled trials and overwhelmingly concluded that cannabinoids are no more effective at treating pain than placebos. 

At the same time, there are continuing concerns about adverse effects, including the risk of psychosis and dependence syndrome."

Professor Andrew Rice, President of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)

Director of The Centre for Innovation in Pain and Health Research Professor Paul Hodges said one of their aims was to conduct high-priority clinical trials to evaluate pain treatments, care models, and preventive strategies.

"We are striving to accelerate the development of effective interventions so that we can enhance the lives of people impacted by pain," Professor Hodges said.

"A current focus of our work aims improve matching the right patient with the right treatment at the right time. 

"We are doing this through developing new tools to characterise people's pain, accelerating the translation of treatments from fundamental research to the clinic, and implementing new ways to test treatments using clever new types of clinical trials."

The Centre has been officially launched by Queensland Health Minister Tim Nicholls and brings together about 200 researchers in the largest and most diverse centre for pain research in Australia.

Cancer ravages both body and mind. If you've ever lost loved ones to the disease, you might recognize the physical and emotional changes cancer patients often endure during their final months. They seem drained of strength and spirit. Even people who've maintained a positive outlook throughout their lives can enter a state of despair. New research published in Science suggests apathy and lack of motivation are symptoms of a condition called cancer cachexia. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Associate Professor Tobias Janowitz explains:

"Many patients complain of symptoms in that category. They say, 'I don't know what's going on with me. My relatives cooked my favorite meal. I don't feel like eating it.' Their grandchildren come for a playdate. Usually, they'd be excited and enjoy it. They just don't seem to engage so much."

Also frustrating, cachexia severely limits patients' ability to tolerate common cancer treatments. CSHL scientists have been studying the condition for years. Now, in a major development, Janowitz and colleague Adam Kepecs at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WashU Medicine) have identified a connection between the brain and the immune system that is responsible for cachexia-related apathy.

They found that as cachexia progresses, certain neurons release less and less dopamine. That's the brain's "feel-good" chemical. Screening for elevated immune system proteins in the brains and bodies of mice with cachexia led the team to IL-6, which gets released during inflammation and has long been associated with cachexia. Decreasing IL-6 signals in connected brain areas made the mice more motivated. Notably, the mice became less sensitive to the amount of effort required to find food. The scientists saw the same result when elevating dopamine levels in the right brain areas.

We discovered a full brain circuit that senses inflammation in the bloodstream and sends signals that reduce motivation. This reveals that apathy isn't just an emotional or psychological reaction to cachexia-it's built into the biology of the disease."

Adam Kepecs, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis

The discovery further suggests that existing antibody treatments could be repurposed to improve cancer patients' quality of life. "Our goals are to make patients feel better and to treat the cancer better," Janowitz explains.

"A better patient will be able to better tolerate and benefit from anti-cancer treatments."

Working across cancer and neuroscience has brought the researchers this far. Their ultimate hope is that one day, through continued interdisciplinary collaboration, they will help turn cachexia into a condition patients can overcome. That would be a welcome development not only for people battling cancer but also for their loved ones who suffer alongside them.

Consumption of holy water from Ethiopia has recently led to several cases of cholera in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) with a multidrug-resistant Vibrio cholerae strain, according to a study published in Eurosurveillance. Four patients were infected through imported water, while three patients had travelled in Ethiopia. Researchers detected multidrug-resistant Vibrio cholerae O1 linked to recent outbreaks in Eastern and Middle Africa in clinical specimens and the holy water.

The ongoing cholera outbreak in Ethiopia began in 2022, and by 9 February 2025 a total of 58,381 cases and 726 deaths had been reported. There was a resurgence of the outbreak on 6 February 2025 reported in the Amhara region leading to 163 cases and 3 deaths, with more recent numbers being unavailable. One identified contamination source is the Bermel Giorgis holy well, which is located in the Quara district and is a site of pilgrimage attracting visitors worldwide. Pilgrims consume or bathe in the water for physical or spiritual healing, and often take it home.

In Germany, three people were initially reported via the European surveillance portal for infectious diseases (EpiPulse) as suspected of having cholera on 25 February 2025. All patients were identified as being of Ethiopian ethnicity. Two had travelled to Ethiopia in January, and acquired a small plastic bottle of water with water from the holy well in Bermel Giorgis. Upon their return to Germany, both people consumed the water. A third person received splashes of water to the face, including the lips, and possibly ingested some of it. In early February, all three individuals developed diarrhoea and vomiting, and were hospitalised. One patient required intensive care, but all recovered.

In the UK, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) identified four patients, among which two reported recent travel to Ethiopia to the Amhara region, and one specifically mentioning a 9-day trip to Bermel Georgis. A third patient had not travelled to Ethiopia, but reported that they had drank holy water from the well that had been brought back by the fourth patient, who had also become ill after consuming the water in the UK. Three were admitted to hospital, with one requiring intensive care. One person who had also travelled to Ethiopia also had symptoms of cholera, but was not tested and recovered without medical treatment.

Genetic analysis of the bacteria in stool samples from the UK cases showed that they belonged to a multidrug-resistant clade of Vibrio cholerae O1 previously linked to outbreaks of cholera in Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in Eastern and Middle Africa. Ethiopian V. cholerae isolates sequenced in Germany and the UK had the same antimicrobial resistance profile as the bacteria samples obtained recently from UK residents. The similarities in these isolates, as well as among the Kenyan and sub-Saharan African strains in England, indicated that multidrug-resistant V. cholerae O1 circulating in Africa were transmitted into Europe.

Consumption of holy water has been previously identified as a risk factor for cholera in Ethiopia. Public authorities have taken preventive measures during religious holidays, and the Ethiopian National Guideline for Cholera Surveillance and Outbreak response has also addressed the associated risks. However, the spread of cases into Europe related to a cholera outbreak in Africa is unusual.

While genetic data have improved surveillance and identification of cases, prevention requires investment in water, sanitation and hygiene. According to Frank et al.: "Low-income countries will continue to need overseas development aid support to control outbreaks and epidemics using effective WASH, surveillance, communications, diagnostics and countermeasure programmatic delivery."

Patients with acute liver failure (ALF) or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are at high risk of bleeding with traditional artificial liver support systems. To address the bleeding risk in liver failure patients, the safety of regional mesylate anticoagulation (RMA) in centrifugation artificial liver support systems (cALSS) is proposed for study.

In this prospective single-arm study, ALF and ACLF patients were treated with cALSS using RMA. Coagulation function was monitored, and the predictors of mesylate dose were analyzed using the area under the curve (AUC). Blood ammonia, model for end-stage liver disease scores, and survival rates at 28 and 90 days were assessed.

All 57 patients showed no new bleeding within 24 h post-cALSS. Most disseminated intravascular coagulation indicators improved at 0.5 h and 24 h post-cALSS. Thromboelastography showed hypocoagulability at 0.5 h post-cALSS. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified pre-R and pre-MA as key factors for R exceeding 10 m at 0.5 h post-cALSS, with odds ratios of 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84–0.98) and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.05–3.90), respectively, P < 0.05. The predictive values were pre-MA ≤ 38 mm (AUC = 0.817, 95% CI [0.690–0.907], P < 0.001) and pre-R > 6.3 m (AUC = 0.790, 95% CI [0.661–0.888], P < 0.001). Patients showed improvements in blood ammonia and model for end-stage liver disease scores after the last session, especially those with high initial levels (>80 µmol/L and >30). The 28-day and 90-day survival rates of ALF patients were similar to those of ACLF patients.

cALSS with RMA is safe for liver failure patients with a high risk of bleeding. Adjusting the mesylate dose based on pre-R and pre-MA enhances safety.

Therapy-related B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) following treatment for multiple myeloma is a rare occurrence. Despite its rarity and the lack of recognition by the World Health Organization as a distinct disease entity, previous publications indicate its possible emergence following myeloma treatment.

The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of IgG kappa multiple myeloma, status post multiple lines of therapy. The patient presented with a fever, and a complete blood count showed cytopenia. Bone marrow morphologic evaluation revealed numerous blasts. Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrated that these blasts were B lymphoblasts, despite MYC and unusual surface kappa light chain expression. A diagnosis of B-ALL with surface kappa light chain expression post-myeloma treatment was made. Ancillary studies indicated that the B-ALL and the previous myeloma were clonally unrelated. Next-generation gene sequencing revealed pathogenic mutations in KDM6A and KRAS.

In summary, we present an interesting case of B-lymphoblastic leukemia with unusual surface light chain expression in a patient who has previously undergone myeloma treatment. This case represents therapy-related B-ALL. Although it has not been categorized as a WHO-recognized disease entity, our case provides additional evidence supporting that myeloma treatment, particularly lenalidomide therapy, is associated with secondary B-ALL. Furthermore, the ClonoSEQ test result in the current case indicates that therapy-related B-ALL is clonally unrelated to the preceding MM. The identification of new predominant clones in follow-up bone marrow samples of myeloma patients should alert clinicians to the possible emergence of a secondary B-cell neoplasm.

Despite significant advances in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment, it remains incurable, with limited therapeutic options. Currently, repurposing already tested, safe drugs has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy against various neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. Using a drug-repurposing approach, the current study investigated the neuroregenerative potential of polysialic acid mimicking compounds, 5-nonyloxytryptamine oxalate (5-NOT) and Epirubicin (Epi), an anti-cancer drug, in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as a PD model.

The excitotoxic model was established by exposing SH-SY5Y cells to 500 µM of MPP+ and subsequently treating them with the test compounds. The effect of MPP+-induced toxicity on cellular and nuclear morphology, as well as on the expression of neuroplasticity and cell survival proteins, were studied by immunostaining, gelatin zymogram, and Western blot assays.

Treatment with 5-NOT and Epi significantly promoted the survival of MPP+-challenged SH-SY5Y cells and prevented changes in their cellular and nuclear morphology by regulating the expression of microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2) and polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) and NCAM synaptic plasticity proteins. Further, 5-NOT and Epi treatment also protected SH-SY5Y cells by restoring levels of nitric oxide, matrix metalloproteinase, and stress response proteins. Interstingly, 5-NOT attenuated MPP+-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by regulating the intrinsic protein kinase AKT/BAD apoptotic pathway and the P-38 MAP kinase synaptic plasticity pathway.

The present data provides compelling evidence for the potential beneficial role of 5-NOT as a glycomimetic drug candidate targeting the neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons, a hallmark feature of patients suffering from PD. The study's outcome is also supported by our previous findings in spinal cord injury (in vivo study) and neurodegenerative disease in vitro models of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Identification of novel compounds from small molecule libraries mimicking the functions of PSA may offer new therapeutic avenues for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

A multi-institutional study led by Moffitt Cancer Center found that percutaneous hepatic perfusion using a melphalan hepatic delivery system may help patients with a rare eye cancer that has spread to their liver. This disease, known as metastatic uveal melanoma, is traditionally very hard to treat and usually has poor outcomes.

The phase 3 FOCUS trial, published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology, compared two treatments for metastatic uveal melanoma. One group of patients received the melphalan hepatic delivery system treatment, while the other group received standard of care treatment. Patients treated with the melphalan hepatic delivery system experienced significantly improved outcomes than those receiving alternative care. The median progression-free survival for these patients was 9.1 months, compared with 3.3 months for those on standard treatments.

The objective response rate was 27.5%, nearly three times the 9.4% observed in the comparison group. The disease control rate also substantially increased from 46.9% to 80.0%. Patients treated with the melphalan hepatic delivery system lived a median of 18.5 months, compared with 14.5 months for those receiving other forms of care. Although there were some side effects, mostly related to blood cell counts, these were treated with standard care as an outpatient and mostly resolved with observation alone.

This new treatment gives hope to patients with this historically tough-to-treat cancer. This is the second publication in Annals of Surgical Oncology on the results of the FOCUS trial and definitely shows that treatment with the melphalan hepatic delivery system can help control the cancer in the liver. The treatment provides an option that does not interfere with their quality of life and gives patients a chance at longer survival."

Jonathan Zager, M.D., surgical oncologist in the Cutaneous Oncology Department at Moffitt and lead author of the study

The melphalan hepatic delivery system treatment was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August 2023 based on the phase 3 trial results. Unlike regular chemotherapy, this treatment delivers a high dose of the drug directly into the liver, which is isolated with a series of catheters and balloons via percutaneous insertions. The chemotherapy is filtered out before it gets introduced to the rest of the body. This targeted approach helps reduce harmful side effects in the rest of the body. More research is planned to test the benefits of the melphalan hepatic delivery system. Studies will also look at combining this treatment with other new therapies.

The FOCUS trial is sponsored by Delcath Systems, Inc.

United States' head coach Mauricio Pochettino will lead his team during the CONCACAF Gold Cup later this year.

MIAMI — The United States will open the CONCACAF Gold Cup against Trinidad and Tobago on June 15 at San Jose, California, play Saudi Arabia four days later at Austin, Texas, and close first-round play in Group D against Haiti on June 22 at Arlington, Texas.

CONCACAF announced the match schedule on Friday, a day after the draw.

The U.S. has won its group in 16 of 17 Gold Cups, along with a second-place finish to Panama in 2011. Its group stage record is 40 wins, one loss and five draws.

These will be the last competitive matches for U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino's team before its World Cup opener on June 12, 2026.

Sending a second-string team for the second straight Gold Cup, the U.S. lost a 2023 semifinal to Panama on penalty kicks.

Defending Gold Cup champion Mexico will play the opener of the biennial championship of North and Central America and Caribbean against the Dominican Republic on June 14 at Inglewood, California, meet Suriname four days later at Arlington and close its Group A play against Costa Rica on June 22 at Las Vegas.

Canada will start Group B against Honduras on June 17 at Vancouver, British Columbia, play Curaçao four days later at Houston and close the first round against El Salvador on June 24 at Houston.

Panama will begin Group C against Guadeloupe on June 16 at Carson, California, face Guatemala four days later at Austin and close the first round against Jamaica on June 24 at Austin.

The tournament will be played at the same time as the FIFA Club World Cup, which has been given priority for players by FIFA. Gold Cup matches will be played at 14 stadiums in 11 areas, avoiding the Eastern seaboard.

Mexico has won nine Gold Cups and the U.S. seven. Canada won in 2000.

Cincinnati has long been sister cities with Munich, Germany as part of its celebration of its German heritage.

The cities will come together for soccer this summer, when Munich's championship soccer team will play a match at TQL Stadium as part of the inaugural FIFA Club World Cup.

The tourney features 32 elite clubs from around the world, who will play 63 matches over 30 days. Cincinnati is one of 11 cities in the United States to host matches in the tournament, with four group-stage games taking place at TQL Stadium from June 15-25.

“We are next door to Over-the-Rhine, where German immigrants first settled and help lay the foundation for Cincinnati and all it continues to become, as a remarkable city and close-knit community,” said Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval.

Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, came to TQL Stadium Friday to promote the upcoming tournament. He brought the intricately designed gold-plated championship trophy as part of a tour where it will visit all 32 participating teams and each host city.

“This stadium is a real jewel,” Infantino said. “It is absolutely stunning. It's really one of the most beautiful soccer stadiums that I have seen. I heard this is a baseball city or an American football city but it is a soccer city actually. It's becoming one of the top soccer cities, not just in the United States, but in the world.”

The tournament will kick off on Saturday, June 14 when reigning African champion Al Ahly FC plays Lionel Messi and Inter Miami in Miami. Seattle is the other MLS team in the field. The championship game is Saturday, July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Seven of the 32 teams will play at TQL Stadium, highlighted by Bayern Munich and one of its top rivals in the German Bundesliga premier league, Borussia Dortmund.

Munich had an 11-year streak of winning the Bundesliga snapped last year and currently leads the league in the homestretch of this season. Munich will bring England national star Harry Kane to lead its star-studded lineup. Dortmund finished as league runner-up seven times in those 11 years. The two teams play each other Saturday in Munich.

The other teams coming to Cincinnati are CF Pachuca (Mexico), FC Salzburg (Austria), Mamelodi Sundowns (South Africa), Auckland City FC (New Zealand) and Ulsan HD (South Korea).

Jeff Berding, president and co-chief executive officer of FC Cincinnati, said that if the World Cup games get a big response from fans, that could help Cincinnati be a host site for the 2031 FIFA Women's World Cup, as the United States is going to be one of the host countries for the tournament.

As part of the program on Friday, Infantino announced that FIFA would donate $1 million to youth soccer programs in Cincinnati through the FC Cincinnati Foundation.

“We anticipate everyone who will come to attend a game, will participate in something historic,” Infantino said. “The next one, the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth edition might be bigger, but we know there's only one first. And Cincinnati is part of this one first.”

Here are the four matches to take place in Cincinnati. For more information including tickets, click here.

World Cup

New Jersey congressman Josh Gottheimer has written to the new heads of the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to request that all eight matches at MetLife Stadium during the 2026 World Cup are designated at the highest security ranking to avoid risks to “thousands of fans, players, and law enforcement officials.”

The 82,500-capacity stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., has been awarded five matches during the group phase, as well as a round-of-32 game, a last-16 game and the final at the tournament, which the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico.

Gottheimer's letter said that only the World Cup final at MetLife is currently designated for the highest level of security support (Level 1), with other games at the stadium during the tournament receiving Level 2 status, which has more limited federal support.

Major sports events in the U.S. are given a security risk level, the highest being the Level 1 Special Event Assessment Ranking (SEAR), which are reserved for events of national and international significance. A Level 1 SEAR involves extensive federal interagency support and in the case of MetLife, Rep. Gottheimer says it would ensure that New Jersey State Police and local law enforcement receive maximum support from federal agencies, including equipment, infrastructure, personnel and funding.

Democrat representative Gottheimer first sent a letter in November, which has been seen by The Athletic, requesting the highest-possible security for the MetLife games. This was under the previous U.S. administration headed by President Joe Biden, but Rep. Gottheimer did not receive a reply.

His office has now confirmed to The Athletic that the letter was re-sent in late March to both the FBI and DHS. The new appointees of President Donald Trump's administration — Kash Patel (director of the FBI) and Kristi Noem (Secretary of DHS) — were the recipients.

In the November letter, he wrote: “I am concerned that these ‘Level 2' designations will not provide New Jersey law enforcement officers with the tools and resources they need to keep attendees and the surrounding communities safe. A failure to properly designate all matches being played at MetLife Stadium as “Level 1” risks the security of the thousands of fans, players, and law enforcement officials.”

Gottheimer referenced the difficulties the authorities faced when hosting the Copa América final in Miami last summer. “With large crowds, larger than those at COPA in Miami, high-profile attendees, and global media attention increasing visibility, this can also increase vulnerability. And, since every single World Cup game played here at MetLife will be a national event, every single one of them needs the SEAR 1 designation.

“This will be critical to securing not only this stadium, including the area we are currently standing in, but also to protecting the tens of thousands of people who live here in the greater East Rutherford area. They will be impacted by traffic, public transportation changes, and the massive amount of visitors coming here. Keep in mind, you will have a million fans coming and going, either to the stadium itself, or watching and staying nearby.”

He added: “As a Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I'm keenly focused on the threats facing our nation, whether that's terrorists from abroad, local cells, or lone wolf extremists at home. Between 1970 and 2019, there were seventy-four terrorist attacks on sports venues around the world.”

The FBI and DHS did not respond on Thursday when asked by The Athletic if all games at MetLife Stadium will be designated Level 1 status.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, met with FIFA president Gianni Infantino this week in Miami. He wrote on X: “The FBI is proud to work with FIFA to ensure global security for the upcoming 2026 World Cup in the U.S. Thank you President Gianni Infantino for your collaboration and partnership.”

...

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

"The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want," Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

"I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do," Adams said postgame. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us."

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

"I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic," Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen."

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

"I'm never concerned, man. It's football," he said. "You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to."

FIFA announced yesterday that the $1M from the soccer governing body that Club World Cup host cities will receive will go “to support community soccer projects in the future,” according to Safid Deen of USA TODAY. Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, L.A., Miami, Nashville, N.Y./N.J., Orlando, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington D.C. will host Club World Cup games, and “benefit from FIFA's ‘legacy contributions' intended to help build small community-focused pitches and leave an impact following this summer's tournament” (USA TODAY, 4/10). In Philadelphia, Kerith Gabriel noted FIFA President Gianni Infantino spoke at an event at Lincoln Financial Field in which officials from FIFA, the Eagles, and the city, including Mayor Cherelle L. Parker, were on hand. Afterward, “fans took photos with the FIFA Club World Cup trophy and the Eagles' two Lombardi trophies in the stadium's Red Zone suites.” Additionally, Infantino and FIFA “disclosed plans to create FIFA Foundation USA to oversee the distribution of its contributions to the 11 U.S. cities hosting the Club World Cup.” A FIFA source noted that the money “most likely would be presented after the Club World Cup” (PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 4/10). 

POLITICS AT PLAY: The AP's Dan Gelston wrote that this week on Ticketmaster or “most secondary market websites,” there are “plenty of seats still available at various stadiums” for this year's Club World Cup in the U.S. The current U.S. political climate “could be enough to scare off fans” from traveling overseas for the games. Infantino met with U.S. President Donald Trump last month in the Oval Office to hype this event and next year's World Cup. Infantino said that he “received assurances” from the White House that “any foreign fans would be in good hands during their time in the United States” (AP, 4/10).

HYPE TOUR: In Philadelphia, Jonathan Tannenwald said that the Club World Cup “hasn't yet been seen as a big deal,” which FIFA has “implicitly acknowledged” by taking Infantino on a publicity tour of the tournament's host cities. He said it out loud as he spoke in front of the trophy. Infantino: “It will be a celebration of soccer, and the stadiums will be full, and fans will be coming from all over the world. Buy tickets. There are still a few available” (PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 4/10).

LOS ANGELES — Billie Jean King can work a room like few others in women's sports.

It is no different at the SheBelieves Summit in Los Angeles, as she headlines the U.S. Soccer event intended to empower women across sports and business. There's an immediate standing ovation from the crowd when she takes the stage, sporting a blue Adidas tracksuit with matching shoes, a string of pearls and the contrasting pop of red from her glasses and lipstick.

Only the 81-year-old, who won 12 Grand Slam singles, helped found the WTA Tour and spearheaded equal prize money in tennis, could get away with an all-Adidas look at a Nike-sponsored event.

“The more you know about history, the more you know about yourself,” she tells the sea of mostly young women staring in rapt attention, many taking notes in their brand new co-branded notebooks handed out in the day's swag bag. “Most importantly, it helps you shape the future. That's the reason I want you to know about history.”

There are few better ambassadors for the history of women's sports and the future than King, as she continues to build alongside her wife Ilana Kloss. And King is not slowing down. In addition to her eponymous foundation and the Women's Sports Foundation, and her investment portfolio across various sports including the Los Angeles Sparks, Angel City FC and the entirety of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), King is also trying to finish a college degree that she never actually completed at California State University.

In the cavernous room at an event space in downtown Los Angeles, branded heavily by U.S. Soccer but still resembling its true roots as a half-rustic half-industrial wedding venue, King hits the big stories she wants, maybe needs, to hit. She quizzes the crowd on the language of Title IX and its impact.

Former U.S. women's national team champion Julie Foudy sits alongside King on stage for the headlining panel and points to her own history with King. The stories are centered around conflict with the U.S. Soccer Federation over contracts and pay. Even a few years ago, to talk openly about this sort of conflict with the federation at their own, very expensive event, would have felt unimaginable.

“She is literally the thread that runs through women's sports history,” Foudy says.

“Learn the business you're in,” King says to the crowd. She feels passionate about that, and it's clear she doesn't think enough current athletes are digging into that work.

Backstage, a gravitational pull surrounds King after she steps behind the curtains. The aura is real. The walk between the backstage and the green room is maybe 50 steps; King is stopped multiple times. There are many photographs. She is handed things, she takes them.

Finally, in the relative quiet of the green room, King lists all the things she could have talked about — the things she should have talked about. There could have been more about Angel City, about Michele Kang and how her buying the Washington Spirit increased the value of every other NWSL team. She's seen that impact firsthand, as her and Kloss's investment grew with Angel City's recent sale for $250 million.

King has been thinking about the relationship between money and women's sports for decades, even if her approach isn't always the most popular one. Her mood on stage had been upbeat. Here, even pausing 20 minutes for an interview, she has a sense of urgency, still prodding to find every single seam she can to break through. Maybe that's why she admires Kang so much — how one transaction had jolted an entire league forward.

“Everybody understands money,” King says. That's never changed. Money is why she wanted to pull in a $100,000 paycheck because people would understand that nice big number.

“They'll start watching the tour, and I can talk about the other players,” King recalled. “I can talk about our dreams, I can talk about the future generations and all that.”

Money has changed the world of women's sports in a lot of ways, but the rapid influx of investment and viewers over the past few years means the feel of a decade ago is fading, maybe gone already — players staying after games until every fan gets an autograph or a selfie, for instance. The accessibility of players isn't what it used to be, for anyone. It can't be.

This strikes a nerve with King. It bothers her, she says. She tells players they have to be available for the media, for reporters to tell their story. The players will say they have social media now.

“I don't care,” she says, throwing her hand in the air. “You need everything.”

Her argument could come off as a lecture, but it goes back to what King said in her panel. Athletes must understand every part of the business — how they work together and how the money flows through the sport and into their pockets.

“These (reporters) are trying to make a living, and they're covering our lives, our sport,” she says. “I'm so thankful to the media because we didn't have anything then, except them, and they told our story. But we killed ourselves to be available. We didn't leave the arena until we signed every autograph. I was doing interviews at two o'clock in the morning for magazines. I'm big on that; this is part of our job, to give people time and effort.”

There is a dark side to women's sports and accessibility, though. Tennis player Emma Raducanu's life changed after an experience with a spectator with “fixated behavior” in Dubai. Raducanu opened up about how vulnerable she felt and how she's rarely alone to provide some additional safety and support. It's not just a tennis problem. Last year, a 40-year-old man pled guilty to stalking UConn's Paige Bueckers after he was arrested walking on a Connecticut highway from the airport to the university. Caitlin Clark has been a target as well.

“Security is another aspect,” King says. “There's another job, or two jobs, or four or six.”

She has her own story on this front about Monica Seles, working directly with her to make her feel safe at a Fed Cup (now the Billie Jean King Cup) following her return from a stabbing attack in 1993. That's still the specter that lingers in everyone's mind on this issue.

“If we have the money, we have to pay for security. We have to take care of that, and that's part of the deal,” King says. There are risks everywhere; this is not one that King wants to allow to shape women's sports. This cannot stop the larger project.

“We're so in our infancy, but we have to just keep busting our backsides to get it out there, to get the women's names out there and to talk about them,” King says. “We just have to keep doing what we're doing because we need media. Once we get media, we get attention. Once we get attention, people know who we are.”

This is where it's fair to expect some sort of victory. Instead, King says, “Well. It's difficult.”

This is why she wants everyone to know the history. She's been first in a lot of things, like being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. But where she asks, are the same honors for those that came before her, that were her heroes, like Althea Gibson? The national tennis center and grounds of the U.S. Open in Queens were named after King; Arthur Ashe had a stadium named after him, and a statue installed on the grounds.

“Took 30 years,” King says, “we finally got (Gibson) something at the Open.” A granite statue honoring Gibson was installed in 2019.

“These are the challenges, the 24/7 things, that go in my head all the time. And I just would like to have it change somehow.”

King's car is waiting to take her to the next stop on her day. Just like the long walk from backstage to the green room, it takes a while for her to make it to the door. Even here, people are waiting for her, for a word, a hug, a check-in of what's next. There's always something up next, after all.

					Philadelphia local news: Neighborhoods, politics, food, and fun				

Gianni Infantino may be the president of soccer's global governing body, FIFA, but he knew enough in his first-ever visit to Philadelphia Thursday to drop multiple “Go Birds” into his remarks. (He did not drop in an “E-A-G-L-E-S …”)

Infantino was here to promote this summer's Club World Cup and see how preparations were going for next year's men's World Cup, with stops at Lincoln Financial Field, City Hall and Lemon Hill.

He also brought a surprising, and significant, donation for the city's soccer development.

“At FIFA, we are also aware of our social role and our social responsibility,” Infantino said at City Hall. “And as such, we want to donate to the whole city of Philadelphia … one million U.S. dollars, to be used as a legacy for being a host city of the FIFA Club World Cup.”

Infantino's visit to Philadelphia was part of a tour of U.S. cities that will showcase soccer over the next year-plus. At the Linc, he posed with the tournament's new trophy, as well as the Eagles' two Lombardi trophies, Birds wide receiver A.J. Brown, Mayor Cherelle Parker and other city dignitaries.

He said that Philly's history and sports culture were major reasons why it was chosen as a host city for both tournaments.

“Because everything started in Philadelphia, right? Almost 250 years ago, everything started here,” he said. “It's a great city. It's a great sports city.”

The Linc will be Philly's venue for eight games in this summer's Club World Cup and six games of 2026's World Cup. This year's tournament will feature the best club teams in the world and unveils a new format, switching the event from annual to every four years and greatly expanding the number of teams to 32 from the previous seven. It replaces the Confederations Cup as the tune-up competition for the World Cup.

Frank Gumienny, chief operating officer of the Eagles, said that the organization is ready for the new cadence of hosting several games over a couple weeks.

“We are getting to put our home — the home of the Eagles — on the grandest stage potentially in the world,” Gumienny said. “I mean, it's a proud papa moment, right? To be able to take what we've done and what we've learned and what we've built and highlight the biggest names in the sports world this summer.”

Infantino's U.S. visit included a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel at FIFA's headquarters in Miami, as concerns rise that soccer fans might not be able to travel into and out of the United States, particularly with next year's tournament being co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

Infantino said that FIFA has excellent relations with the Trump administration and seemed confident the U.S. would abide by the guarantees that were made when the country bid to serve as a tournament host.

“There are discussions ongoing of course when you have 10 million tickets for sale between this year and next year, and millions more of fans coming even without tickets wanting to be here to feel the vibe of the World Cup,” he said. “This creates, of course, a certain number of challenges that need to be addressed and we are working very, very hard. I would like to thank the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, the government, President Trump, everyone for their engagement.”

Infantino also received a tour of East Fairmount Park's Lemon Hill, which will be the site for the World Cup's official fan festival next year. 

“We are going all in when we think about how we activate this great park and how we make it ready to welcome the world,” said Michael DelBene, the executive producer of the fan festival who gave Infantino the tour. “The tagline that we often use is ‘welcoming the world with a Philly flavor,' so this is going to be an authentic expression of the city of Philadelphia. Everyone who comes here will walk away, feeling like they have visited a lot of the city and gotten a lot of those great experiences.”

Meg Kane, Philadelphia Soccer 2026's host city executive, said that the first phase of parks development, focused on the infrastructure work, will begin late this summer or early in the fall. The festival grounds will start being built in April 2026, then taken down in August of that year. Phase two will involve legacy upgrades to the park based on community feedback.

“Our conversations with President Infantino have really focused around our two-phase approach and the fact that, for us, having Lemon Hill be a legacy of Philadelphia's hosting of the World Cup felt really important to us,” Kane said. “It combines a lot of our goals for the tournament of having that impact where residents for the several years after the tournament can look at Lemon Hill and say, ‘This place was improved because Philadelphia was selected to host the FIFA World Cup in 2026.' ”

FIFA is also contributing to that legacy with that $1 million donation, which is being given to all 11 host cities for the club tournament. Infantino said the money should go to soccer facilities in areas of need and activities with local associations. A FIFA Foundation USA will be formed to distribute the funds, which will likely be presented after the tournament, the Inquirer reported.

Tickets are still available for this summer's games, which is part of the reason for Infantino's visit. Concerns about overcrowded schedules, player burnout and a potential strike action have shrouded the tournament.

Infantino said he was unconcerned about ticket sales.

“If in America you fill soccer stadiums for friendly games, then you know when you come with a World Cup where the best players who play really [want] to win a competition. For sure, it will be full,” he said.

FIFA is offering a total tournament prize pool of $1 billion, with the winners earning up to $125 million.

Tickets for the Linc's games for the Club World Cup are available on FIFA's website.

As FIFA President Gianni Infantino visits the United States to promote the Club World Cup, Al Jazeera takes a closer look.

Take a look at Ticketmaster or most secondary market websites this week and there are plenty of seats still available at various stadiums for this year's Club World Cup in the United States.

No, not the World Cup. The “FIFA Club World Cup 2025.”

Al Jazeera Sport takes a closer look at FIFA's rebranded club showpiece, which has many question marks surrounding its staging – including about the host nation, who themselves are warming up to hold the 2026 World Cup.

It's an international soccer tournament designed to bring together 32 professional teams from around the world with matches in 11 American cities, including Philadelphia.

Lincoln Financial Field will host six group stage matches, a round-of-16 match, and, per FIFA, “a highly anticipated quarterfinals match” on July 4.

In fact, while FIFA President Gianni Infantino promoted the tournament – a pair of Lombardi Trophies for the Philadelphia Eagles behind him – he alternated between Spanish and English and at one point turned to American reporters to say, “Buy tickets. There are still a few available.”

Whether you call it soccer or call it football, the sport is coming to the United States this year, in part to promote next year's real deal World Cup.

Next year's tournament, with 48 national teams for the first time, also will be played at various NFL stadiums, as well as in Canada and Mexico.

The current US political climate could be enough to scare off fans from travelling overseas for the games. Infantino met with President Donald Trump last month in the Oval Office to hype this event — and next year's true main event.

“The world loves America, whatever some might say,” Infantino said.

Infantino said he received assurances from the White House that any foreign fans would be in good hands during their time in the United States. The FIFA president met this week with US Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel at the FIFA office in Miami to map out a security plan and any potential issues with international fans travelling to the US on visas.

“It's absolutely crucial that we have this collaboration,” Infantino said. “This never would have been possible some years ago with the image that FIFA had. We came back a long way. Today, we work in a clear way, in a transparent way, in an ethical way. We'll bring the world to the United States of America. These are the guarantees the United States government signed at the time of the bidding, and reconfirmed of course. The world will be welcomed.”

Eagles wide receiver and Super Bowl champion AJ Brown hit the Linc to promote the event but noted he never played much soccer beyond the FIFA videogame.

He said he planned to attend his first soccer matches this summer – a first-time fan, just like FIFA hoped would attend the summer extravaganza.

“I always heard great things,” Brown said.

This year's revamped and expanded tournament is set to start on June 15 and run through July 13, with the final set for New Jersey's MetLife Stadium – also the site of the 2026 World Cup final.

FIFA announced earlier this year a $1bn broadcast deal with DAZN for broadcast rights to this summer's Club World Cup.

The winners could earn a football record $125m as part of the $1bn prize money fund – which matches the broadcast deal.

FIFA said it allocated $525m in guaranteed fees for teams taking part, ranging from $38.19m to the top-ranked European team – likely Real Madrid – to $3.58m for the Oceania representative Auckland City.

— FIFA Club World Cup (@FIFACWC) April 10, 2025



Two American teams are confirmed for this year's tournament: Inter Miami, who will include Lionel Messi in their ranks, and the Seattle Sounders.

Twelve teams from Europe will be included in the Club World Cup: Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Juventus, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Porto, Real Madrid and Salzburg.

Other teams that have qualified are Boca Juniors, Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense, Palmeiras and River Plate from South America; Leon, Monterrey and Pachuca from North America; Al Ahly, Esperance, Mamelodi Sundowns and Wydad from Africa; Al-Hilal, Al Ain, Ulsan and Urawa from Asia; and Auckland City from Oceania.

“I don't have any concerns about ticket sales,” Infantino said. “We'll have full stadiums in America. If in America you fill soccer stadiums for friendly games, then when you come with a World Cup and the best players to win a competition … we'll have to promote it, we'll have to present it, we'll have to explain it to the people. That's what we are doing. But it's a celebration of soccer and the stadiums will be full and fans will be coming from all over the world.”

FIFA plans to spread the wealth of staging the warm-up event, pledging on Thursday $1 million to each of the 11 cities that will host Club World Cup matches this summer.

“Everyone thinks that the country winning their own national or continental competition is the best in the world,” Infantino said, referring to tournaments like the Champions League and Copa Libertadores. “But that's actually not the case. So we decided to create a real World Cup for teams.”

 Member of Parliament for Ashaiman, Ernest Norgbey

Member of Parliament for Ashaiman, Ernest Norgbey, has refused to credit Black Stars head coach Otto Addo for Ghana's victories over Chad and Madagascar in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers held in March 2025.

According to him, the team won both matches due to the players' determination and hunger, not because of the coach's tactical input.The lawmaker emphasised that he is not a fan of the German-trained coach and believes Otto Addo is not the right person for the Black Stars job.“I may not be a big fan of Otto Addo, not because he's not a good coach, but because he's not the right coach for the Black Stars of Ghana,” he told CitiSports.“The wins against Chad and Madagascar were not due to any tactical discipline but rather the motivation and hunger of the players. It wasn't because we have a tactically gifted coach,” he added.Many Ghanaians had called for Otto Addo's dismissal after he failed to lead the Black Stars to qualify for the 2025 AFCON, failing to win a single game in the qualifiers.However, the manager appears to have turned things around with impressive results in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in March 2025.

He guided the team to two wins, defeating Chad and Madagascar, scoring a total of eight goals and keeping clean sheets in both matches.Ghana now tops its World Cup qualifying group with 15 points, with four games remaining in the campaign.EE/MAMeanwhile, watch the latest edition of Sports Check with veteran coach JE Sarpong

Macario Scores Early, But Brazil Answers Late in Second Match of Doubleheader as Emma Hayes Continues to Prioritize Youth Development

In a match that showcased the evolving identity of the U.S. Women's National Team under head coach Emma Hayes, Brazil emerged with a 2-1 victory on April 9, scoring a dramatic stoppage-time winner in the second of two high-profile friendlies between two global powerhouses.

While the USWNT won the first match 2-0 in Inglewood on April 5, the second leg—played just days later—provided valuable minutes for rising stars and served as another step in what Hayes has described as a critical phase of building the next generation of champions. As SoccerToday has covered in recent weeks, Hayes has emphasized giving young players real experience on the international stage—a commitment clearly reflected in this latest roster.

The Americans struck first—and fast. Just 34 seconds after kickoff, forward Catarina Macario capitalized on a loose ball following a creative give-and-go with Alyssa Thompson, scoring her 10th career international goal and her first against the country of her birth, Brazil. It was the seventh-fastest goal in USWNT history and a reminder of the dynamic threat Macario brings, especially when fully fit.

Michelob Ultra Woman of the Match: Cat Macario

Macario's goal held added significance. The Stanford alumna found the net at Levi's Stadium—just 20 miles from where she helped lead her college team to a national title in 2019.

Brazil equalized in the 24th minute as Kerolin, the former NWSL MVP, found space in the box and launched a shot past U.S. goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn. The game remained deadlocked until the dying moments, when a U.S. free kick turned into a counterattack that saw Luany fly down the flank and assist Amanda Gutierres for a tap-in game-winner in the 95th minute.

It marked Brazil's first win over the USA since 2014, and only their fourth all-time.

Despite the loss, the performance reflected Hayes' strategic vision. With a starting lineup averaging just 17.9 caps, it was the least-experienced USWNT XI in over two decades. At 26, Macario was the second-oldest starter. Veteran Emily Sonnett, with 107 caps, had more international experience than the rest of the starters combined.

Editorial Note: Will American soccer fans question Emma Hayes' prioritizing youth in USWNT's 2-1 Loss to Brazil because she chose to plan for the future and player pathway taking center stage? Leadership is never easy, and we are relying on our choice of head coach to make the tough decisions to pave the way to a strong, dynamic, and bright future, so we should support her choices.

This match also marked a milestone for several future stars:

These aren't just debuts—they're building blocks. Hayes is leaning into youth not just for depth, but to identify the players who can grow into leaders by 2027 and beyond.

While the late-game breakdown stung, the takeaway is clear: under Hayes, the U.S. is committed to redefining its player pathway and trusting the process. It's a long-term play rooted in development, resilience, and tactical growth.

Veterans like Crystal Dunn, Sam Coffey, and Lindsey Horan were introduced in the second half to stabilize the squad, and Hayes' use of seven substitutions (including a concussion sub) demonstrated her willingness to test combinations under pressure.

As SoccerToday continues to cover, this transitional phase isn't just about building a competitive roster—it's about setting the tone for the future of American women's soccer, from the grassroots to the global stage.

The U.S. will return to action with a two-match series against China PR on May 31 in St. Paul, Minnesota, and June 3 in St. Louis, Missouri. Expect continued experimentation—and more young players seizing their moment.

Having a fervent following and a legacy going back to 1892, Newcastle United is among the most famous teams in English football. The Magpies have had both times of great success and hardship over the years. Steve Bruce's term as head coach is one of the more recent managerial eras that split views among both supporters and experts. Although his stay at St. James' Park featured ups and downs, it also gave sports bettors wishing to evaluate Newcastle's performance and profit on betting markets fascinating chances.

Bruce's tenure was distinguished by a pragmatic playing style, defensive tactics, and sporadic shocking performances against better clubs. For gamblers, this meant attentively tracking Newcastle's capacity to grind out results, seize counterattacks, and negotiate fixture congestion. Knowing the team's playing style, performance, and betting patterns under Bruce can provide insightful analysis for individuals wishing to make wise Newcastle United wagers—even outside Bruce's time. Examining past performances helps bettors spot trends and project future directions, therefore enhancing their odds of winning. Of course, bettors should look for reputable betting apps like Betway app download before delving in.

Steve Bruce had a difficult job when he assumed management of Newcastle United in July 2019. Bruce inherited a side that was not only adjusting to life in the Premier League but also lacked the financial strength to compete with the league's top clubs, so replacing the esteemed Rafael Benítez was no simple task. Bruce sought to lay a strong basis despite these obstacles by emphasizing defensive stability and counter-attacking football.

Newcastle usually used a pragmatic approach to play under Bruce, giving defensive structure top priority over free-flowing attacking football. When the Magpies would sit deep, absorb pressure, and attempt to strike teams on the break with rapid transitions in games against tougher opposition, this strategy was especially clear. Although this approach occasionally produced good results, it also drew criticism from supporters who preferred a more aggressive and aspirational approach to play.

Notwithstanding the complaints, Newcastle avoided relegation and guaranteed mid-table places by achieving decent league finishes under Bruce's leadership. Players like Callum Wilson and Allan Saint-Maximin were vital members of the team's assault, offering bursts of genius that usually turned Newcastle's fortunes around. Often, this converted tight games to Newcastle's advantage. For gamblers, Newcastle became an erratic team since they could produce unexpected outcomes, especially against more formidable opponents who battled to disrupt them.

Knowing Newcastle United's trends and patterns was essential for anyone betting on the team during the Steve Bruce era. Newcastle's inclination to be involved in low-scoring games was among the most obvious betting patterns. Many of their games saw fewer goals because of their defensive style, so gamblers often choose markets like “Under 2.5 Goals.”

Newcastle's home and away performance also had a great bearing on things. Although they usually gave St. James' Park an excellent performance, their away record was more erratic. Newcastle was typically considered underdogs on the road, but occasionally they produced unexpected successes, especially against mid-table teams, which created possibilities in betting markets. Playing away and betting on Newcastle with an Asian Handicap was a sensible approach since they usually kept games close and avoided significant losses.

Newcastle's reliance on important players like Callum Wilson for goals meant that the market for “Anytime Goalscorer” may have been worth it. Wilson was Newcastle's main attacking threat when he was fit and in form, hence he was a wise target for goalscorer bets. Allan Saint-Maximin was also a fascinating choice for player-related betting markets because of his ability to generate opportunities and win fouls. Assists or shoots on target depends on this talent.

Newcastle's defensive consistency also made them a good target for wagers on clean sheets against clubs having trouble with their attack. Their capacity to grind out results against lower-ranked clubs meant that the “Newcastle to Win to Nil” market presented reasonable chances in the correct conditions. Newcastle often struggled defensively against top-six opposition, so making bets on their opponent to score several goals is a more likely result.

Newcastle United has seen a major change since Steve Bruce left the ship. The team's playing style and aspirations have changed under the new ownership and management changes of the club, so it is a very different side than Bruce's time. This indicates that bettors should review Newcastle's new tendencies and change their betting plans.

Still, lessons from Bruce's time in command are priceless. Closely observing Newcastle during that era taught bettors the value of pre-waging analysis of a manager's tactical approach, squad depth, and key player influence. Knowing these elements allows gamblers to make better judgments than depending just on form tables or gut feelings. Furthermore, understanding how managerial decisions affect team morale and performance would help bettors project results in transitional periods with more advantages.

Betting on the Magpies will remain an interesting and dynamic experience as Newcastle United develops. In the realm of sports betting, the club's rich legacy and erratic character will always make them an interesting team to watch whether they are fighting for existence, vying for European locations, or still frustrating and surprising analysts and fans. When betting on Newcastle United, smart betting techniques, prior performance analysis, and team advancements help bettors increase their chances of winning.

If you're trying to do any kind of statistical analysis of Gio Reyna's career, there's only really one dataset that has a big enough sample size.

Since what seemed like a breakout season at age 17 in 2020-21 -- four goals, five assists across 23 Bundesliga starts for Borussia Dortmund -- he has barely played. In the four seasons since, he has made just 14 starts, scored 11 goals and assisted four more. He's played just over 4,000 league minutes for Dortmund, attempted 88 shots, created 77 chances, and tried to beat a player off the dribble 81 times.

In this season alone, 12 players have attempted more shots, one has created more chances, and 87 have taken on more defenders across Europe's Big Five top leagues. We basically have one-plus full seasons of professional soccer for Reyna, played across six calendar years.

And so, all we really know about Gio Reyna is that his parents needed to read "How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kids for Success" and that he's always injured.

-Live on ESPN+ Watch Dortmund in Der Klassiker vs. Bayern Munich (Saturday, 12:25 p.m. ET)

For the lack of game-play data, we do have a ton of injury data. Per the site Transfermarkt, Reyna has missed 498 days due to injury since his career began, for 17 different reasons: colds, illnesses, infections, strains and fissures of the fibula. There's a fantastic book coming out soon from former ESPN editor Henry Abbott, "Ballistic," about the new science of injury prevention. If anyone from Reyna's team is reading this, I would highly recommend reading that book, too.

But beyond that, I can provide no insight on how to fix Gio Reyna's body because I am not a doctor. However, some newly available data can shine a light on how all the injuries may have affected the way Reyna plays for his club and the U.S. men's national team. He's not only missing lots of games, but he's moving very differently on the field.

Chelsea are currently navigating a crucial final couple of months of their season, but in the back of their minds they'll know the Club World Cup tournament is just around the corner.

The Blues are looking to finish strongly in their final seven Premier League games. As it stands, they sit fourth in the division table, and the top five qualify for the Champions League. On top of that, Enzo Maresca's side are competing in the quarter-finals of this season's Conference League.

In mid-June, the Club World Cup kicks off, which is a 32-team tournament that includes both Chelsea and Manchester City.

Chelsea will take the Club World Cup seriously because of the financial rewards, so it could be an interesting watch for supporters over the summer.

Chelsea have a number of talented players current thriving out on loan, including Andrey Santos.

Apparently, the on-loan Strasbourg midfielder is going to be drafted straight into the Blues group to feature at the upcoming summer tournament.

According to AS, Chelsea's plan is to use 20-year-old star Santos at the Club World Cup.

The report suggests the Brazilian talent could be used in a new role to partner Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez in midfield.

Apparently, Chelsea's hierarchy are counting on Santos to be with them next season and resisted recalling him from his loan in January to allow him to develop further.

Speaking in a recent interview, Santos claimed he's ready to play for Chelsea when asked about his future. His potential participation in the Club World Cup will give him a head start before next season. 

For now, the box-to-box central midfielder will be looking to get Strasbourg over the line for Champions League qualification. Without a doubt, he's been one of the outstanding performers in the French top flight this season.

While it's been suggested that Santos could form a midfield three at Chelsea in the Club World Cup, we see him as a direct competitor for Fernandez in the starting XI next season.

In recent months, Fernandez is thriving in a No 8 position covering every blade of grass. He's accompanied by Caicedo as the defensive midfield destroyer, while Cole Palmer produces his magic in the No 10 spot.

It's interesting to compare the respective league form of Santos and Fernandez this season:

Chelsea's midfield depth next season will definitely become a lot stronger with the introduction of Santos. Fans should definitely be excited about getting a first glimpse of him in the summer.

The first-ever FIFA Club World Cup takes place this summer, with the tournament played in the United States between June and July.

The competition will follow the same setup as the traditional World Cup involving 32 nations every four years, this time with 32 domestic clubs competing for the prize, one of which is Real Madrid.

Marca have reported that Real Madrid and Boca Juniors are the two teams that have sold all their allocations for their three group-stage games.

Los Blancos are well-known across the globe, especially in North America. Argentina side Boca Juniors are also a huge club with a massive fan base alongside fellow domestic rivals River Plate, who is also in the tournament.

🚨 Real Madrid will get €145m from FIFA if they win the Club World Cup in July. How the money will be distributed:• Real Madrid's participation: €35m• 3 wins in the group stage: €6m• Ro16: €7m• Quarter-final: €12m• Semi-final: €20m• Final: €28m• Winner:… pic.twitter.com/PApEaryyse

Carlo Ancelotti's side play their three group games in Miami, Charlotte, and Philadelphia, with the former a hot spot for Rea Madrid fan bases.

The Spanish champions have seen their grip slip on their La Liga and Champions League crowns in the last week. Despite being in the Copa del Rey final, the Club World Cup could be the last chance for a major trophy this season if things don't turn around.

The 2030 World Cup will be hosted by Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, with its opening matches taking place in Uruguay, where the first World Cup was held in 1930, as well as in Argentina and Paraguay.

"We are convinced that the centennial celebration will be unique because 100 years are only celebrated once. 

"And that's why we are proposing, for the first time, to hold this anniversary with 64 teams, on three continents simultaneously," CONMEBOL President Alejandro Dominguez said.

The World Cup has already been expanded from 32 to 48 teams for next year's edition in the USA, Mexico and Canada.

Football's governing body, FIFA, said earlier it would review a proposal to expand the 2030 World Cup to 64 teams.

Tuttosport newspaper reports that Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is open to joining Juventus with the Bianconeri looking for an attacking reinforcement for the Club World Cup.

Manchester United forward Hojlund is open to discussing a summer transfer to Juventus after the Bianconeri established contact with his entourage.

The latest Tuttosport report claims that the ex-Atalanta star is willing to negotiate with the Serie A giants who are looking for an attacking reinforcement for the imminent Club World Cup.

Transfer expert Matteo Moretto already reported that Juventus had made preliminary contact for the Manchester United striker, who has also attracted interest from Napoli.

Juventus are expected to part ways with Arek Milik as the Poland international has been struggling with injuries this season and hasn't yet made a single appearance in 2024-25.

Furthermore, Randal Kolo Muani is on loan from PSG until the end of June, while Dusan Vlahovic has a contract expiring in 2026 and is expected to go on the market as he's unwilling to extend.

Hojlund is among the Bianconeri transfer targets in attack for 2025-26 alongside Atalanta's Ademola Lookman and Napoli-owned Victor Osimhen.

The U.S. men's national team has learned its opponents for this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup. 

Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia have been paired with Mauricio Pochettino's squad for the upcoming tournament. The USMNT last won the Gold Cup in 2021 and overall have won the competition seven times. 

The Americans are unbeaten in their last nine head-to-head matches with Haiti despite losing the previous seven encounters prior. The USMNT holds a 22-4-5 record against Trinidad & Tobago and a 3-2-2 record against Saudi Arabia, who are a guest team in the tournament. 

A total of 16 teams will take part in the competition, with the four group winners and four winners-up advancing to the knockout stage. 

The knockout stage will feature the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds before the final takes place at Houston's NRG Stadium on July 6. 

Mexico are the reigning champions of the competition. 

Here is a closer look at the remaining three groups for the Gold Cup:

Group A: Mexico, Costa Rica, Suriname, Dominican Republic Group B: Canada, Honduras, El Salvador, Curacao Group C: Panama, Jamaica, Guatemala, Guadeloupe 

are we sending the A team to the gold cup?

If the US gets grouped in this tournament Poch should be fired, no excuses, get a result.

Thank goodness Panama was a seeded team!

Looking forward to it. Hope to see Luna in the starting 11. He is the new Dempsey.

“He is the new Dempsey.”

Maybe some day but right now that's very, very premature. 

Clint was much more of a scorer while Luna is more of a playmaker.

I don't know much about Luna who seems like a great guy but Clint was one of the two toughest, most hard core, driven individuals who ever played for the USMNT that I knew of ( the other one being Jermaine Jones). 

When Clint first came up for the USMNT fans blasted him for being too selfish and caring only about money and not caring enough about the USMNT.

Since you mentioned him here are some quotes from Clint in an article in ESPN the magazine just before the 2010 World Cup:”

– “I don't want to get into how I'm perceived there versus here in the U.S. But I'm respected in Europe for what I do week in and week out on the highest level.”

– “In big games, I always come through.”

– “It was good for my first goal to mean so much,” says Dempsey [who went to Fulham from the New England Revolution of the MLS on a $5 million transfer and scored a goal that saved Fulham from relegation] “I paid back the club for my transfer fee. I wasn't in debt to them.”

– “I pride myself on stepping up on big occasions.”

– “People who aren't educated about the game are going to take whatever a commentator has to say as the complete truth. And that's not always the case. That's just their opinion.”

– “I was top three in the whole tournament in distance covered,” he says. “You can question my effectiveness, but you can't question my heart and my effort.”

– “I'm respected by my teammates. And I'm respected by my coaches. That's why they keep me on the field. The criticism comes with the money we get paid.”

– “Off the pitch, the best thing about [playing in the Premier League] is more money in your account. You go to Europe for the competition, for the soccer and for more financial stability for your family.”

– “I'm from nowhere, man.” [Regarding growing up in Nacogdoches, TX]

– “I feel like I'm effective no matter where I am on the field.”

– “I enjoy playing up top, because the closer you are to goal, the more chances you're going to get, and one of my favorite parts of the game is scoring goals.”

– “You start to think that fate's on your side. There's a chance to do something unbelievable.”

– “You can be the face [of US soccer] or not be the face. You get only so many opportunities in major competitions, and you've got to take advantage of them. I gotta stand up and be counted in this World Cup.”

Is it bad that even with a group this weak I still wonder if we're even going to get out of it? I mean…I hope not, but….

That's bad because that would be a level of futility that is orders of magnitude worse than our worst performances in the past year or so. It just means you are far more pessimistic than is warranted. It's about you more than the team.

It was his first-ever double bagel win, and Dimitrov's first-ever double bagel loss.ByTENNIS.comPublished Apr 11, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 11, 2025

Alex de Minaur entered his quarterfinal match with Grigor Dimitrov at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters with a slim 3-2 head-to-head record against Grigor Dimitrov, leading most informed tennis fans to believe that the first clay-court match between the two, for a Masters 1000 semifinal berth, would be a barnburner.What followed, in de Minaur's own words, was a "bizarre" scene.In just 44 minutes, the Aussie was a 6-0, 6-0 winner, advancing through to his second career ATP Masters 1000 semifinal. It was the first double bagel at an ATP-level event in the quarterfinals or later in 12 years, and the first such win by de Minaur and loss by Dimitrov in their professional careers."I just did what I needed to do today," the No. 8 seed told Prakash Amritraj afterwards. "It wasn't, by any means, Grigor's best day. The only thing I could do was worry about my side of the court and try to be as consistent and intense as I could. I just did what I needed to do to get the job done today."The Bulgarian started the match with a 30-0 lead on serve, and had 0-15 in de Minaur's first service game. Those accounted for three of the 15 points he won in the match. Dimitrov hit just one winner, which didn't come until the second set, and 23 unforced errors..

But despite the mis-match, de Minaur wasn't about to fall into the famous "curse" of the first-set bagel, he later said"Ultimately, I just told myself that the match was about to start again," he said. "It doesn't matter what happened in the first set ... I had to make sure I brought the intensity from the very first point to the last. Mentally, that's my cue to stay focused, stay on top, and also not get sucked into just trying to put the ball in the court."While the Aussie admitted he'll take the result "with a grain of salt," his career-best run in Monaco is a testament to how hard he's worked to improve his clay-court tennis in recent years. He lost in the first or second round of his first seven main draws at Roland Garros, before making the quarterfinals last year, and came into Mote Carlo with a losing career record on the surface at tour level. Now, though, he's the favorite on paper to reach his first-ever clay-court final when he faced not three-time champion Stefanos Tsitsipas, but No. 13 seed Lorenzo Musetti in the semifinals.Read more: Lorenzo Musetti manifests 'special' week in Monte Carlo by conquering Stefanos Tsitsipas for first time“With the troubles I had on this surface at the start of my career, I didn't quite understand it and how to play well on it," de Minaur said. "As the years have gone by, I have grown to understand the things I can do well to become a tough opponent on this surface. I'm very happy that I am playing better and better every year.“It's not about hitting hard, powerful shots [on clay]. It's about opening up the court, using angles, height, and different speeds, [and] understanding the balance between being too aggressive and too passive.”

Armed with a new mystery racquet, Tsitsipas claimed a 500-level title in Dubai back in February—his first title since last year's Monte Carlo—amid his struggles to regain his top level. In Monte Carlo, the Greek's year-round residence and most successful Masters 1000 event by far with three wins in the last five years, he reached the quarterfinals before falling to Lorenzo Musetti.“It's difficult to accept,” Tsitsipas said. “I mean, feeling so confident playing on this court and not being able to win a match that I felt I kind of had every reason to try and win is definitely heartbreaking.”The shock loss was compounded as he came into the match with a perfect 5-0 record over the Italian, before Musetti rallied for a 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory. Tsitsipas racked up 45 unforced errors, including 23 off the forehand wing, and made only 49 percent (42/85) of first serves across two hours and 23 minutes on Court Rainier III.

Lorenzo Musetti earned a milestone victory Friday at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. The Italian scored his first win against Stefanos Tsitsipas in his sixth Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting against the Greek and advanced to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.


Musetti fought off the three-time champion 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, backed by a brave serving performance, saving 14 of the 17 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. In the final set, the 13th seed erased four break points at 1-2. Moments later, Tsitsipas double faulted down break point at 3-3 as Musetti stormed towards a two-hour, 21-minute victory. 

“Today was a really tough match. I knew that before today I never beat him and we played five times. Especially on clay, I knew against a three-time champion, definitely not an easy job today," said the Paris Olympics bronze medalist, who captured his ninth Top-10 win. "I found a way and I was increasing during the whole match. Really, really happy and proud of this win.”






While Tsitsipas looked to run around his backhand and crush his forehand, that wing also created 23 of his 45 unforced errors. Musetti adopted a deep return position and played with great variety, hitting his one-hander down the line precisely and creating delicate drop shots that bit sharply on the sun-baked court.Relieved and on the verge of tears, Musetti hugged his team courtside following the hard-fought victory."It's really beautiful to cry together and win together. It's really nice," Musetti said.The release. The euphoria. The moment.

Musetti, 13th in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, could crack the Top 10 for the first time should he win his biggest career title.Tsitsipas entered the quarter-final clash with a perfect 5-0 record against Musetti, with four of those meetings on clay. The 26-year-old is now 20-2 in the Principality since 2021, having won the title in 2021, 2022 and 2024.

It's no secret that Carlos Alcaraz aspires to be one of the greatest players in tennis history by the time his career is all said and done. But in the latest issue of GQ Spain, the Spaniard makes it quite clear: Whether No. 1 or No. 3, or four Grand Slam titles or 20, he is "not obsessed with being the best in the world."In a cover story in the April-May issue, where the 21-year-old models on a clay court wearing Louis Vuitton threads and a Rolex watch, Alcaraz reflects on his upcoming Netflix documentary, 'My Way,' and how he wants to achieve his dreams while staying true to himself.Read more: Carlos Alcaraz says he “also wants to enjoy being 21” in upcoming Netflix docuseries"I was number one a few years ago, and I was happy," he said. "Now I'm number three, and I'm equally happy. And I'm enjoying the journey, the sport, and life. I hope I never lose that naturalness, because that would be giving up a part of who I am. Although I imagine it's inevitable to gain and lose things as the years go by. We'll find out in 10 years."I've always said I'd like to be the best in history and sit at the Big 3's table, but those are big words, not an obsession," he added, "and I always say I'd like to be remembered as an inspiration to the little ones, and as someone who had fun doing what he loved most, with a smile on his face and making people enjoy themselves."

Alcaraz speaks positively about the pressure that comea with being him to GQ, saying that it "keeps you alive and means you're fighting for very important things," in a sentiment that represents a departure, or a learning, from the candor he has expressed as his results have waned in recent months. As world No. 1 Jannik Sinner has been sidelined on suspension in a settlement of his 2024 doping case, both Alcaraz and world No. 2 Alexander Zverev had opportunities to make inroads to, or even supplant Sinner at, the top spot.But Alcaraz admitted to being overcome with nerves in a semifinal defeat to Jack Draper in Indian Wells, and lost his first match in Miami to David Goffin. When he arrived to the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters this week to begin his clay-court season, he even confessed that the pressure of navigating the situation and fielding questions about it may have even "killed me in some way."Read more: Carlos Alcaraz: First set vs. Jack Draper in Indian Wells 'one of the worst' he's ever playedBut, as he told GQ and also Prakash Amritraj on the Tennis Channel desk in Monaco, he's not obsessing over the past either.

"I've been paying attention to the rankings, to the stats, and I think it's the wrong thing to do," he said."Right now, I realized that I have to just play, because I love playing tennis, I love stepping on the court, to show good tennis and forget about the ranking, forget about everything. On the clay season, in the clay tournaments, I'm going to try to do that ... and just play."Alcaraz faces fellow Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina as he attempts to reach the final in Monte Carlo for the first time.

Carlos Alcaraz did not have things all his own way on Friday against Arthur Fils, but found a way to reach the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters semi-final for the first time.

Following his hard-fought three-set win, the Spaniard reflected on his champion mindset.

“I think that real champions find the right level when it's needed,” Alcaraz said in his post-match press conference. “Obviously I would love to play a high level and my best tennis from the beginning until the last ball, but I think in tennis we play for two hours and a half, so it is the most difficult thing to do, to maintain your best tennis.

“When it's needed, it's great to find the good tennis. But sometimes I'm playing against an opponent who is playing better and you have to accept it and run and fight.”

Alcaraz has become a seasoned champion in the early stages of his historic career. A four-time major titlist, the 21-year-old Spaniard is chasing his sixth ATP Masters 1000 trophy this week.
However, for all his success at the top of the game, this week's run in Monte-Carlo is unknown territory for Alcaraz. The Spaniard is making just his second appearance in The Principality, having lost in the opening round to Sebastian Korda in 2022.
“I am still super young and I am going to live new experiences and learn about [them], but I feel like I know how to deal with situations that probably other players don't. It is my second time [playing] here and to be able to play a semi-final for the first time makes me grow up as a player, as a person,” Alcaraz said. “Every match is new, it is different and [I] have to learn from the matches that I'm playing here.”

The Spaniard will face countryman and former finalist Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the semi-finals on Saturday. Alcaraz revealed that he is close friends with the 25-year-old but will put their relationship to the side when they meet for the second time in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.
“He invited me to his wedding. He's a friend,” Alcaraz said on Davidovich Fokina. “We have seen each other for a long time already. He used to play with my old brother when they were younger.
"I know him pretty well. I've played against him a few times. Hit with him a lot. So it's going to be interesting. It's not going to be easy, never easy playing against a friend, but this is tennis. Once you step on the court, there are no friends.”
Alcaraz is 18-4 on the season, highlighted by his title run in Rotterdam. If he wins the trophy in Monte-Carlo, he will pass Alexander Zverev for No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday.

Alex de Minaur was a man on a mission on Friday at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters, where he delivered a statement performance to reach the semi-finals.

The 26-year-old Australian eased past Grigor Dimitrov 6-0, 6-0 in just 44 minutes to reach the last four at a clay-court ATP Tour event for the third time in his career. It was the first double bagel served up at the quarter-final stage or later on the ATP Tour since 2013, when Roger Federer blanked Mischa Zverev in the Halle quarter-finals. 

De Minaur will next continue his quest for a maiden clay-court trophy against three-time champion Stefanos Tsitsipas or Lorenzo Musetti.

“With the troubles I had on this surface at the start of my career, I didn't quite understand it and how to play well on it," De Minaur said of his improvements on clay. "As the years have gone by, I have grown to understand the things I can do well to become a tough opponent on this surface. I'm very happy that I am playing better and better every year.

“It's not about hitting hard, powerful shots [on clay]. It's about opening up the court, using angles, height, and different speeds. Understanding the balance between being too aggressive and too passive.”

With his 20th victory of the season, De Minaur extended his lead for the most wins on the ATP Tour in 2025. The No. 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings now owns a 20-6 record this year, and his nearest contenders are Carlos Alcaraz and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, who each recorded their 18th triumph on Friday to set a semi-final clash in Monte-Carlo.

De Minaur's convincing win, which improves him to 4-2 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Dimitrov, comes on the heels of dominant 6-2, 6-2 performance against ninth seed Daniil Medvedev in the quarter-finals.

While Dimitrov struggled to find his range and often lacked intensity, De Minaur took complete advantage with relentless hitting from the baseline, committing just six unforced errors in a 23-minute opening set. The pattern continued in the second, during which the Australian landed an inch-perfect lob to break serve in the first game and motored across the line.

In the deciding moments of the third set, the Frenchman overhit just a bit, while the No. 2 seed raised his game just in time.BySteve TignorPublished Apr 11, 2025 copy_link

After two hard-fought, missile-filled sets, Arthur Fils had the shot he wanted lined up. One more clean swing on an inside-out forehand, and he would be serving for the match against four-time Grand Slam champ Carlos Alcaraz.This was the first meeting between the 21-year-old Spaniard and the 20-year-old Frenchman. It had been a long time coming, but it had been worth the wait. For two sets and 90-odd minutes, they had thrown everything they had at each other. Full-swing forehands from one side were met by even bigger swings from the other. Slugfests rallies from the baseline turned into cat-and-mouse finesse duels at the net.Alcaraz was the more accomplished of the two, but Fils had been building to this type of high-profile collision for the past month, when he made quarterfinal runs in Indian Wells, Miami, and now Monte Carlo. He was more than ready for whatever Alcaraz had in store, and looked, for a set and a half, like he would be the better player on the day. When push came to shove, it was Fils' brilliantly reflexed returns and heavy forehands that were prevailing. Alcaraz's customary grin was nowhere to be found. He looked stressed, by Fils and the French-centric Monte Carlo crowd.

When push came to shove, it was Fils' brilliantly reflexed returns and heavy forehands that were prevailing. Alcaraz's customary grin was nowhere to be found. He looked stressed, by Fils and the French-centric Monte Carlo crowd.

At 5-5 in the second set, Alcaraz seemed to buckle under Fils' pressure, going down 0-40 on his serve. Two good points got him back to 30-40. With one more break chance, Fils slowly took control of a long rally, running around to hit forehands, and forcing Alcaraz to come up with short-hop backhands near the baseline. Finally, Fils had a look at an inside-out forehand. He fired it toward the sideline; for a split-second, the ball looked like it would go for a winner. Then the electronic voice spoke: “Out.” Alcaraz had reached deuce. Breathing a sigh of relief, he held, then played a much more upbeat game to break for the set, finishing with a perfectly measured reflex lob winner. The grin was back.Fils' best chance, it turned out, had come and gone. But instead of caving, he forced Alcaraz to earn it. Down 1-3 in the third, the Spaniard kicked into another gear, while the Frenchman may have succumbed to nerves. Fils opened the door with an error-filled game at 3-2, and Alcaraz barreled right through it. At 3-3, his backhand began to click. At 3-4, Fils tried to counter by going even bigger with his forehand, but sent the ball into the net and the doubles alley instead. Fils was broken for 5-3. A second or two later, so was his racquet.“Honestly, I just wanted to stay strong and wait for my chances,” Alcaraz said after his 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 win. “He puts a lot of pressure on his opponents, I could feel it in some moments. He made a few mistakes and I tried to make the most of it.”

The stat lines for both players were not as impressive as the match itself. Together, they combined to hit 41 winners and make 95 errors. Fils won just 32 percent of points on his second serve. Alcaraz's drop shot helped make the difference.“I miss clay,” Alcaraz said with smile. “I think on clay it's easier to play the drop shot; it's a weapon that I use a lot. Matches like this give me more confidence to keep doing it.”This was the first of many meetings between these two—another at Roland Garros in two months would be nice—and likely the start of a rivalry that will last a decade. For today, Alcaraz's big-stage experience made the difference. In the deciding moments of the third set, Fils overhit just a bit, while Alcaraz found his range and raised his game just in time.

The clay season is now well underway, with top players on the ATP Tour looking to book their places in Saturday's semi-finals at the Monte-Carlo Masters. And there has been one significant change on the dirt this year, with automatic line calling now in use.

Hawkeye technology had previously been seen as too unreliable to be adopted on the clay. Instead, umpires would manually go down to the court and look at the ball marks left on the surface. But the system has been entirely automated, with an electric line calling system running the show, and one player isn't happy.

Gone are the days of drama on the clay, when players would point out a mark and argue with officials if they disagreed with a call. It's been smooth sailing in Monaco this week with an automated voice calling the lines.

Two years ago, the ATP Tour announced that live electronic line calling would be introduced across all matches on the circuit from 2025.

ELC live has been in place at some tournaments over the last few years, but this is the first time it is being utilised throughout the clay swing.

Most players already seem to be used to it. There have been no disputes at the Monte-Carlo Masters so far, and any close calls are shown on the big screen so players and fans can get a better view of the mark.

However, Arthur Fils believes the new rule is coming at a cost. While the Frenchman is happy to use automation on the hard courts, he says the dirt is a step too far.

“Well, I think we're losing the charm of tennis. When I was young I remember the linesmen. There was more life going on on the court,” the world No. 15 said.

“On hard courts, it's not as bad, but on clay court, really, I miss them. It's nice to have the umpire's opinion and watching, you know, the mark.

“Sometimes machines can make mistakes too. So it's different for clay. I don't really like it like this. I prefer to have linesmen, but I don't think I have a choice.”

The French star's Monte-Carlo run came to an end on Friday as he lost a tight three-setter to Carlos Alcaraz. Fils was seeking his first semi-final appearance at Masters 1000 level after reaching three consecutive quarter-finals.

But it wasn't to be for the 20-year-old sensation. Fils blew his break lead in the decider, losing the last five games in a row as Alcaraz advanced 4-6 7-5 6-3.

The world No. 15 will now return to action at next week's ATP 500 in Barcelona, where he will need to get used to the automated line calls on the dirt.

Novak Djokovic enjoyed a long-standing relationship with Goran Ivanisevic before parting ways with him in 2024. 

Together, Ivanisevic's meticulous approach to preparation led Djokovic to a wealth of titles during a period where he was the dominant figure in the sport of tennis. 

Since the 2001 Wimbledon winner pursued other avenues, Djokovic hasn't won a Grand Slam title and perhaps that speaks volumes. 

Andy Murray is now in the corner of the 24-time Grand Slam champion and the weight rests on his shoulders when it comes to coaching Djokovic over the line in one of the big events. 

Ivanisevic is going to be working with Stefanos Tsitsipas after the French Open and he's been reminiscing about working with Djokovic during a recent interview. 

It's hard to imagine there being too many issues when it comes to coaching a player like Djokovic, given all he's achieved in the game of tennis. 

However, there was one thing that Ivanisevic did find a little bit tricky when it came to being in the Serbian player's corner. 

He said on a Croatian TV channel: “I don't know what could be the hardest. He's quite serious. He likes biomechanics and many similar things. It's not that I don't believe in that but some things have nothing to do with biomechanics. You can't think about the biomechanics of your hips, your knees, when you throw the ball for your serve and the sun hits your eyes and you can't see anything. You can't see the ball. For one second, you can't see the ball and you hit it blindly. You can't think about your hip while serving while you're blind as a bat. There's also the wind.

“He wants to be perfect at it. He's a perfectionist. I am too, but you have to find some balance.

“And the easiest thing for me is that I have never seen a tennis player who can not play tennis for two months and then play as if he never even stopped. 

“He plays like he had been training for five hours a day for the past two months. Such timing, such a feel for the court, for the ball, for the space. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Nadal is not like that. He has to train every day.”

Although the parting of the ways was amicable, there is perhaps a case to suggest that Djokovic should have tried harder to keep the Croatian in his corner. 

Since parting, Djokovic has reached a Wimbledon final but ultimately, he does seem to have lost that aura of invincibility about him. 

There are other things to factor in, of course. Djokovic isn't getting any younger and as a result, injuries have started to have a bigger impact on his body. 

There is no doubting Ivanisevic's quality as a coach, however, and perhaps there's an argument to suggest that Djokovic shouldn't have let him go as quickly as he did.

Dan Bloxham on centre court in Mallorca. | Mallorca Country Club

One of Wimbledon's “unsung heroes”, the Wimbledon Master of Ceremonies, Dan Bloxham, has just spent the past few days inspecting, visiting and playing at the prestigious Mallorca Country Club in Santa Ponsa, for Spobis Match Point Mallorca, sponsored by AETIB, which again this year will be hosting the ATP 250 tournament. This will take place from June 21 to June 28, with top players coming to the island as part of the final preparations for Wimbledon.



Dan, told the Bulletin this week that he has been extremely impressed with the club and what the island has to offer the players in general. He is one of the most important figures at the All England Club. He is a Level 5 tennis coach who holds a dual role at Wimbledon. He is current head coach and has helped the likes of Andy Murray and Johanna Konta on the road to success.



He is also the Wimbledon Master of Ceremonies, whose role is technically to invite players to play on Centre Court. He escorts the two players to court before each game and is watched by around 150 million people on the walk before the final. In short, he is the last person the players see before they take to the courts during the tournament. Furthermore, as head coach he is captain of the Members' Team, which every year enjoy a tennis holiday, mainly on grass courts; Mallorca has been chosen for next year.

It's amazing“It's amazing where we've found great grass courts over the years, from Japan to China, India and Hong Kong. And working with Tim Henman we've obviously played the great clubs in Europe like Stuttgart. But having seen the Mallorca Country Club, I'm extremely impressed and see a great flourishing future for the club. We'll be planning our tennis holiday in Mallorca for next year.

“It's been great. I've been down with Mark Ferguson, grass specialist from Wimbledon, and it's been very interesting and encouraging. I've been playing a couple of hours on clay and the hard courts in the morning and then grass in the afternoons and the courts are first class.



“I have to stress that the grass groundsman is part of the Wimbledon team, so the relationship between the two clubs is very close. We support the tournament ever more each year. It's an ATP event and we're nearing the 150th anniversary of the The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, of which Santa Ponsa is a member, so we have a very special year ahead and we want to further develop our relationship with Mallorca. One of the main aims is to bring that connection between Mallorca and Wimbledon to the forefront.

British heritage“So moving forwards it's not only going to be about tennis, we're also going to help host two croquet events and tournaments at the country club every month. These will be quality sponsored events to increase the club's exposure to the community on the island and attract more people of all nationalities to enjoy the experience, plus the Pimm's and the champagne ..,” he said. “It's all part of the British heritage.

"I can certainly say that my experience has been first class. The secret to a good tennis club is energy, enthusiasm and positivity, and the club in Santa Ponsa is brimming with it all. The coaching staff are excellent and it's crucial that when members, or even guests, enter the club, they feel at home; that's how I was made to feel in Mallorca. All that's very important. So, combine that with the facilities and the country club has all the makings of competing with the best tennis/padel clubs in Europe. No doubt about it.

“It's got perfect courts, a wonderful hotel across the road, it's 15/20 minutes from the airport, it has a top golf club next door, while there are all the others around the island along with the first class hotels. Most tennis players love a round a golf in their downtime and obviously want to stay in comfort but like to have things relatively close together.

Mediterranean vibe“So the club's location, surrounded by the mountains and just a few minutes from the sea, is a winner. In addition, the club has that Mediterranean vibe, which is another benefit. It's not a massive tennis resort stuck in the middle of nowhere, it's just comfortable, and all these reasons are why, since the tournament began, some of the best tennis players in the world have decided to play Mallorca ahead of Wimbledon. I can't see any reason for that to change, In fact I can only see the club's cachet growing and I certainly hope so,” Dan enthused.

“Coming out of Covid, tennis clubs, all sports clubs, are flourishing. For many active people who were locked away, unable to exercise and socialise, it's been a breath of fresh air to get to back into their normal rhythms. More people have decided it's time to get fit and healthy and enjoy the fun of being a club member and that's helped us all in the sector as a whole,” he added.

Roger, Rafa, Andy and NovakWith Wimbledon just a few months away, Dan has always got his mind set on his vitally important role at the most famous tennis club in the world. “I've got a great team and obviously as I or we walk the greats to the courts, there's always the odd member who tries to get in the way for a chat or whatever, so diplomacy is the key, I've become a great diplomat over the years. But when it comes to the players they love and deeply respect Wimbledon. Behind the scenes, for example, timing is very important. Depending on the nationalities, some are more punctual that others.

“But what does shine out and is something I always take with me when I give talks to juniors or in schools is the high level of respect the players have for each other, the club and its rules. They love the clothing regulations, for example, it all adds to the prestige and importance of the event. I have to admit I have a unique position, but the players, and I've seen some the biggest rivals of the history of the game, especially with the recent big four of Rafa, Roger, Andy and Novak. Their behaviour has been impeccable and they show each other the utmost respect. They all hold great values and that applies to all of the top tennis players, male and female.

“They bring that to their game. On court, for example, the players, especially the top seeds, are more concerned about themselves and their game than the other players. In most cases they have a pretty good idea how the opponent players, the fitness levels, best shots, etc., so the players focus more on themselves. Their job is to get the very best out of themselves to beat the person on the other side of the court. When they do get angry or frustrated it's with themselves, not their opponent and that is something I always share and try to explain to youngsters when I give open days or talks, as does the rest of the team.



“Yes, each player has his or her own little final warm-up move or attempt to psych the other player out and put him off guard slightly. Rafa (Nadal) was a prime example with his final jumping up and down moves as we waited to finally go on court. On one occasion, while playing on one of the outer courts, the height of the entrance to the court slipped my mind. Rafa started bouncing up and down and hit his head on the door frame, but it was no big deal and things do happen,” he sniggered.

“It will be interesting this year because we're moving to electronic line judges. This will make line calls more efficient but we will still have a team of judges because anything can happen. Say the power goes down like at Heathrow, we can't call it all off until the matter is repaired, so the traditional line judges will step in. Yes, there's the argument of whether the electronic system is 100% correct, but if it's slightly off, then it will affect both players, so really no one will be playing at a disadvantage. It's the future I guess and one we have to embrace,” Dan said.

“There's been a change of the guard at the top of men's tennis, if you like, so it's going to be a very interesting and exciting Wimbledon this year. The British men and women are on form, especially Jack. Novak is obviously still there and he wants one more slam. I think he's got his sights set on the French but he'd clearly take Wimbledon - who wouldn't - plus there's Carlos Alcaraz, who is playing some great grass tennis. It's very difficult to say about the women. There are some great players who have come through and it's going to be very open on both sides of the draw,” he said.

Win or lose“But win or lose, that's when the respect I've talked about really comes to the forefront. Obviously the winners don't need consoling, it's the loser. But as we see time and time again, the players remain on court after the match and the losers are always very courteous. They pay their respects to the winner, thank the organisers and the crowds and that is not always easy when you've lost an important match; that shows courage as well. It reminds me of rugby. In fact I think tennis and rugby are the only two sports which show so much respect for the losers. In rugby, the winning team always gives the losers a tunnel or applause of the pitch and I think those traits and traditions in these sports are very important and must be cherished. But yes, sometimes walking a loser back to their locker room can be a slow and testing walk. That said, once it's all over, the focus switches to the next tournament and making sure the same mistakes are not made again,” Dan explained.

“This is where some of the top players will be hoping to fine tune their game on the eve of Wimbledon this year. Edwin Weindorfer, CEO of the organising e|motion group, has created a winning tournament and my trip down here, which will be the first of many I am sure, has been to bolster relations between the two clubs. Wimbledon is a first-class spectacle and there is no reason whey the Mallorca Championships can't hit those heights,” Dan said.

With the retirement of Rafael Nadal, Carlos Alcaraz seems poised to carry on Spain's success on the ATP Tour. The 21-year-old star has already won four Grand Slam titles and reached World No. 1. But how does he compare to Nadal in terms of prize money so far?

When it comes to career earnings, Nadal, who retired in 2024, ranks second all-time, behind only Novak Djokovic. Nadal captured 92 ATP titles, including 22 Grand Slams. According to official ATP records, the Spaniard earned a total of $134.9 million in prize money.

It's an impressive figure that also includes his earnings from doubles. Nadal won 11 doubles titles during his career. Alongside Roger Federer, he also played a key role in pushing for prize money increases, particularly during his second term on the ATP Player Council.

Alcaraz, who turned pro in 2018, has earned $39,194,113 in prize money from singles and doubles to date. He has won four major titles and five Masters 1000 titles in singles. This season alone, he has collected $1,339,136 so far.

In 2025, after falling to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open quarterfinals, Alcaraz had a strong run at the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam, capturing his first indoor hardcourt title and becoming the first Spaniard to win the event.

He later made his debut at the Qatar Open, where he was eliminated in the quarterfinals by Jiri Lehecka in three sets. Alcaraz entered Indian Wells as the two-time defending champion and reached the semifinals, but was upset by eventual champion Jack Draper.

The loss ended a 16-match winning streak at the tournament and marked his first ATP loss past the quarterfinals in over a year. His struggles continued in Miami, where he was knocked out in the second round by David Goffin. However, he is poised to be one of the players to watch during the clay season. 

Including endorsements, Nadal is the third highest-earning tennis player of all time, behind only Federer and Djokovic. Through deals with brands such as Nike, Santander, and Richard Mille, Nadal has earned an estimated $850 million over the course of his career.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz already boasts endorsement deals with major brands such as LVMH, Rolex, BMW, Babolat, Calvin Klein, and ISDIN sunscreen. According to Forbes, he earned $32 million in endorsements between August 2023 and August 2024.

Novak Djokovic had a disastrous start to the clay season as he lost to world no. 32 Alejandro Tabilo in straight sets in the Monte Carlo opener on Wednesday. The defeat came as a big setback for the Serbian as it deflated all the momentum, he gained during the Miami Open. Djokovic reached the final of the ATP tournament but suffered a woeful loss in the tournament's concluder to Jakub Mensik. Barring the final, it was a much-improved Djokovic on display in Miami, and based on the performance, he looked set to ride on the confidence but got inflicted by yet another devastating early elimination.

Former US Open winner Andy Roddick has yet again paid heed to the situation of Novak Djokovic and gave an interesting opinion. According to Roddick, Djokovic must not be looking at the bigger picture, which would be winning two majors, rather he would be more focused on attaining the peak form for the said tournaments.



“It should be viewed as normal. I don't think that the base level for Novak for a successful year is two majors anymore. I think the question is, ‘can I build up my season? Can I peak for the majors, right? Can I be as good once as I ever was?' Right? I think that matters a little bit more," the 2003 US Open champion said on Tennis Channel. 

The former player weighed in on Serb's Monte Carlo loss and stated that it shouldn't be concerning as featuring in the tournament might not have been in his initial plans but eventually decided to take part in it because he lives across the street and would be a "paid practice." 



"He's going to reset. Next Monday, he's still going to be in Monte Carlo training, to get ready for the clay-court season, so I don't put a ton of stock in this," the American tennis legend added.

Djokovic, 37, is searching for the elusive 25th Grand Slam glory and his 100th title overall. He has been denied the milestone quite a few times and the pressure is building up. It will be intriguing to note how the perceived GOAT of the game will deal with this tough phase and grab the glory which is just a step away. Djokovic will feature in the Madrid Open next, which is scheduled to start on April 23.

Former World No. 1, winner of 12 Grand Slam singles titles and founder of the WTA, Billie Jean King knows about greatness. As one of the legends of the sport, she has not only played against some of the biggest stars, but has also witnessed the talent of recent generations. So, when it comes to claiming a GOAT, King gave a clear answer and it isn't Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal.

King, who has always defended equality, went with Serena Williams as her choice for the greatest player of all time. “I think that we have been very blessed to have Serena Williams in our sport. Great athlete, I think a lot of people think she is the GOAT, I think every generation gets better. So right now she's the GOAT,” she told the National Bank Open's social media team.

“I love reading about her and listening to her about how she's evolving. She has transcended the sport way beyond the boundaries of just being an athlete,” King added. “Because of her stature, using tennis is a platform way beyond just the sport and giving back, and also making it better for women particularly women of color, it's just the beginning for Serena,” she said.

Williams secured 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any female player in the Open Era, with only Djokovic surpassing her at 24. Her dominance wasn't confined to the majors; she held the world No. 1 ranking for 319 weeks, including an impressive 186-week streak that tied Steffi Graf's record.

Partnering with her sister Venus, she captured 14 Grand Slam doubles titles and earned three Olympic gold medals in the event. Additionally, she secured a gold in singles, making her the only player in tennis history to achieve a career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. Overall, Williams won 73 WTA singles titles, including five WTA Finals championships.

Billie Jean King, a former world No. 1 tennis player from the United States, is widely regarded as one of the sport's greatest. Throughout her career, she amassed 39 Grand Slam titles: 12 in singles, 16 in women's doubles, and 11 in mixed doubles.

Beyond her on-court achievements, King was a pioneering force off the court. She founded the Women's Tennis Association and the Women's Sports Foundation, advocating for gender equality in sports.

McLaren driver Oscar Piastri topped the timesheets during Friday evening's second practice session for the Bahrain Grand Prix, leading the way from team mate Lando Norris and Mercedes racer George Russell.

After a baking hot first hour of practice, FP2 served up more representative twilight conditions for teams and drivers – the sun setting and the floodlights switching on around the Sakhir venue, as they will ahead of Qualifying and the Grand Prix.

It also involved all 20 full-time drivers, following a handful of ‘rookie' appearances in FP1, with Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Russell, Fernando Alonso, Ollie Bearman and Carlos Sainz returning to their respective cockpits.

Drivers were quick to head out on track and get a feel for grip levels when the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane, bringing a mixture of run plans with Pirelli's soft, medium and hard compound tyres through the early stages.

Practice 2 results

It was a tricky start for reigning four-time World Champion Verstappen, who reported over the radio that his car was “jumping a lot” with a “very bad ride” – highlighted by a lock-up and trip to the run-off area at the tight Turn 10 left-hander.

Matters were worse for Alonso, who encountered a steering wheel problem only a couple of laps into his programme and crawled back to the pits, where Aston Martin mechanics surrounded the AMR25 and changed parts of its steering system.

Some 15 minutes into the session, Russell provisionally led the way with a time of 1m 31.945s on soft tyres, just ahead of former team mate Lewis Hamilton, new team mate Kimi Antonelli and the aforementioned Verstappen.

However, as the minutes ticked by and every driver completed a lap with the red-marked rubber, the McLarens impressively moved to the fore – Piastri pumping in a 1m 30.505s and Norris a 1m 30.659s to put the papaya cars around half a second clear of the field.

Russell grabbed the ‘best of the rest' slot with his own improvement, 0.527s back, with Ferrari's Leclerc taking fourth over Antonelli, high-flying Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and Verstappen, who reported further issues relating to his brakes late on.

Second practice in Bahrain saw the sun set and the floodlights switch on

Hamilton wound up eighth in the sister Ferrari, as the team completed back-to-backs with their new floor design, followed by Haas youngster Bearman, the two Williams machines of Sainz and Alex Albon, and Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls car.

Gabriel Bortoleto found plenty of time on his soft-shod run to place 13th, from Alpine's Jack Doohan, the compromised Alonso – who made it back out but finished with fewer than 20 laps – and the Haas of Esteban Ocon.

Pierre Gasly put his Alpine 17th, in front of Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda, who continues to get to grips with the “science room” that is the RB21, while Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll and the Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg completed the order.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock at the Bahrain International Circuit before returning to the track for Saturday's final practice session, which is scheduled to get under way at 1530 local time.

F3: Camara beats Voisin to take pole position in Sakhir

Lando Norris topped the timesheets during the opening practice session of the Bahrain Grand Prix weekend, the McLaren driver going fastest from Pierre Gasly and Lewis Hamilton in an hour that featured appearances from six rookies.

Just days after racing in cool conditions at Japan's Suzuka Circuit, the teams and drivers returned to action amid hot and sunny weather at Sakhir for Friday's Free Practice 1. Several of the current grid, however, would not be getting behind the wheel, having instead handed their cars over to a young driver as part of the rule stipulating that teams must run rookies in four FP1 sessions during the season.

Ayumu Iwasa, Dino Beganovic, Fred Vesti, Felipe Drugovich, Ryo Hirakawa and Luke Browning were set to turn out for Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Haas and Williams respectively, taking the place of Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, George Russell, Fernando Alonso, Ollie Bearman and Carlos Sainz.

The new faces seemed keen to get going, with Iwasa leading the pack out from Browning and Hirakawa when the green light appeared at 1430 local time. There was early trouble, meanwhile, for the more familiar name of Kimi Antonelli, the Mercedes driver reporting “no power” before slowly returning to the pits less than 10 minutes into the session.

Practice 1 results

While Antonelli's car was worked on in the Silver Arrows' garage – the issue seemingly being due to a loss of water pressure – other drivers appeared to be struggling to find grip out on track, with Liam Lawson stating that the balance on his Racing Bulls machine was ”shocking”.

By the halfway point of the session – after most of the pack had put a time on the board with the medium or hard tyres – Alex Albon led the way for Williams on a lap of 1m 35.180s, putting him six-hundredths clear of Norris in the McLaren, with Gasly slotting into third for Alpine.

Attentions then started to shift to the soft tyre runs and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto quickly went fastest by half a second after being one of the first to bolt on the compound, before promptly being displaced by team mate Nico Hulkenberg.

As Antonelli's problems persisted in the Mercedes garage – with the mechanics seen pulling on the rear wing in their efforts to sort the issue – Albon was released into the path of Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda in the pit lane, prompting the Thai driver to apologise over the radio. The incident will be investigated after the session.

The stewards will also look at a possible impeding incident that occurred between the two Williams drivers, with Browning having to take avoiding action after encountering a slow-moving Albon on track.

As more soft-shod laps came in and the times continued to tumble, it was Norris who had gone fastest with his effort of 1m 33.204s, two-tenths faster than Gasly in second, while Hamilton slotted into third for Ferrari after completing his soft run later in the session.

Albon – who reported a loss of power in the closing stages – held onto fourth, ahead of Haas' Esteban Ocon in fifth and Hulkenberg in sixth. Jack Doohan was seventh for Alpine, with Lawson, Tsunoda and McLaren's Oscar Piastri completing the top 10.

Bortoleto ended the hour in 11th, followed by Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar, Browning and Beganovic. The Aston Martins of Lance Stroll and Drugovich took 15th and 16th respectively, with Hirakawa, Vesti, Iwasa and Antonelli – who missed most of the session due to those aforementioned car issues – rounding out the order.

The drivers and teams will now have an opportunity to examine their data before returning to action for Free Practice 2, which is set to get underway at 1800 local time.

The hits just keep on coming for season 13 “American Idol” winner Caleb Johnson. Weeks after fighting his former record label to put his music back online, the rocker is dealing with a parasitic infection that's caused him to lose 30 pounds in a month. 

On April 10, 2025, Johnson updated his fans in an Instagram Story, saying he was “hoping and praying” he'd feel better soon but that the infection “almost killed me.”

One week after posting photos and footage from an “awesome” Connecticut show he performed in late March, Johnson posted an Instagram Story to let fans know he's been quietly battling a severe illness. 

“Hey yall,” Johnson wrote in a text-only message. “Please keep me in your prayers. I've been really sick for over a month and a half now and was just recently diagnosed with a parasitic infection called Giardia. It almost killed me.” 

Giardia is a “microscopic parasite that is found worldwide, especially in areas with poor sanitation and unsafe water,” according to Mayo Clinic, which said symptoms of the intestinal infection it causes include stomach cramps, bloating, nausea and bouts of watery diarrhea.

“I've lost 30 pounds in the month of March,” Johnson revealed in his Instagram Story. “I just started antibiotics this week and I'm hoping and praying that I start to feel better by tomorrow. I've had really bad fevers the last week and a half. Thank you.”

Though many people recover from Giardia without medical intervention, severe cases require antibiotics, per Mayo Clinic. At the time of publication, Johnson had not yet updated fans on his condition.

In sickness and in health, Johnson, who turns 34 on April 23, can often be found on the road — from performing his own rock concerts to touring with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra each holiday season since 2018. He also continues to release new music, including putting out the single “Blind” in November, featuring acclaimed guitarist Joe Bonamassa.

On March 9, as season 23 of “Idol” was kicking off, Johnson shared photos from his 2014 journey on the show, writing, “In honor of the new season of @americanidol here are some throwback pics to my time on the show! Had an absolute blast! Peep my stories for more throwback pics ⚡️” 

Earlier in the year, the rock singer went to battle with his former record label, Interscope, when tunes and the “Fighting Gravity” music video from his first album, “Testify” — released after his big win — disappeared from YouTube and streaming platforms. Fortunately, he updated fans on February 27 that the label had agreed to return the missing music. 

“That was my first record that I ever did after ‘American Idol,'” Johnson said of his “Testify” album, “and I'm just baffled as to why it's been pulled down.”

Original star Macht says he came back to pass the baton to the NBC spinoff: "I have found that I personally am in a better space in my life emotionally — and I think Harvey is too."


							By 

	Max Gao



Gabriel Macht never expected to play Harvey Specter again. 


	After wrapping up his nine-season run as the debonair, suave super lawyer on the USA drama Suits in 2019, Macht intentionally stepped away from acting in order to refocus his attention on spending more time with his family and raising his two young children. As time went on, he felt he was able to slowly shed the onscreen persona that had dramatically upended his life and shot him to international fame.




	But in the summer of 2023, amid the actors' and writers' strikes in Hollywood, Netflix acquired the co-streaming rights to Suits in the U.S. (The series had already been available to stream on Peacock.) Suddenly, the glossy, eminently bingeable legal drama — which centered around hotshot corporate attorney Harvey's decision to hire brilliant college dropout Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) as his new associate, and the inevitable cover-up and fallout from their long con — got a new lease on life. By the end of that year, according to Nielsen, Suits had racked up 57.7 billion total minutes watched and became the most watched title ever acquired by a streaming service.

	Like his former co-stars and colleagues, Macht did not quite know what to make of the unprecedented resurgence of Suits, but he had a feeling that creator Aaron Korsh would eventually end up expanding the fictional universe with another set of impossibly witty and snazzy lawyers. Sure enough, while developing the new West Coast-set spinoff, Suits LA, for NBC last year, Korsh asked Macht if he would consider suiting up again for a three-episode arc in the 13-episode first season, which would reveal an existing connection between Harvey and new protagonist Ted Black (Stephen Amell).


	“I thought, ‘You know what? I could give something back to the fans because they're so, so hungry for more of this character. And if I can support the show in my way and bring some eyes to it, that might be a really nice thing to pass the baton,'” Macht tells The Hollywood Reporter in the interview below, about why he returned for a three-episode arc (his next final episodes release April 13 and 20). “They worked out a way to make it make sense for my family, and here we are.”


	In 2010, while Ted was prosecuting federal cases for the U.S. Attorney's office in New York City, Harvey, shortly before leaving to work for the indomitable managing partner Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), was still working for the District Attorney. Suits fans will remember that baseball was Harvey's sport of choice growing up, and as shown in Harvey's first Suits LA appearance in episode four, Harvey and Ted would sometimes play in the prosecutors' league baseball team together.

	











	After a playoff game, Harvey took Ted and his brother Eddie (Carson A. Egan), who has Down syndrome, out for a drink, and Harvey gave Ted some valuable intel about Pellegrini (Anthony Azizi) — the mob boss who had not-so-subtly threatened Eddie at his workplace. With Harvey's help, Ted was able to put Pellegrini away for another case that he was prosecuting. But after Pellegrini gets out of prison in the present day, Harvey convinces Ted that, in order to settle an old score, they need to team up and go after the mobster again.


	Below, Macht opens up about his decision to return (albeit, briefly) to scripted television to support the expansion of the Suits universe, why he thinks the fan-favorite relationship between Harvey and Mike has stood the test of time — and why he believes that hypermasculine antiheroes, including Harvey, are often celebrated for the wrong reasons.


	***


Suits was a hit during its nine-season run, but the show came back into the cultural zeitgeist in a way no one could have anticipated. What have you made of the resurgence of the series? And once it became clear that this universe would be expanding, what conversations did you have with creator Aaron Korsh about what you both wanted to accomplish with Harvey's return?


	I'm in utter awe of the numbers and amount of downloads, the commitment that fans have regarding the show. The fandom has been complete insanity. [I'm amazed by] someone who wants to spend that kind of time with us on multiple reruns. I've met a couple people who have watched the show four times, seven times, 10 times, 15 times all the way through. You multiply that by 134 episodes. This resurgence happened, in many ways, I believe, in connection with TikTok and Instagram. [With] the little bite-sized format and presentation that this new generation had [on those apps], they picked up on the motivations and inspirational Harvey quotes, or the witty banter. I think those were little nuggets that people took and went to Netflix and said, “What is this show? I've been seeing these things pop up.” I think that helped create the explosion. It's very interesting to see how different platforms create this widespread attention.

	











	We were really a hit when we first premiered. The show was very solid on USA and around the world on the different streaming platforms. So to have another round owas amazing and, “Wow, this is intense.” It's created so many opportunities for me personally, which is a blessing, and when Aaron said, “Look, we had this idea of doing this universe and creating this world where maybe some of the original cast members pop up, would you be interested?” I said, “Well, tell me a little bit more about it, because I feel like we wrapped up these storylines and these characters really gracefully, and I think we did a good job of giving the fans what they wanted.”


	Aaron said, “Well, our lead character could have been friends with Harvey back in the day, and there's some stuff that's gone on. But if we could make it happen and it worked out for [your] schedule, and [we could] truncate the work, maybe you'd consider it.” I took that as a very real thing. I thought about the space in which Suits LA is presented and I thought, “You know what? I could give something back to the fans because they're so, so hungry for more of this character. And if I can support the show in my way and bring some eyes to it, that might be a really nice thing to pass the baton.” And that's how it all came about. It all worked out. They worked out a way to make it make sense for my family, and here we are.


You had 134 episodes on the original series to explore pretty much every aspect — every nook and cranny — of Harvey's inner life. Considering that you had already thought so much about Harvey's evolution, what new layers did you find in revisiting him all these years later?












	Wow, that's a question I could probably take a week and a half to answer. For full transparency, my job as an actor is to cede to the vision of the showrunner and expand on the showrunner's idea of who this character is, and collaborate with the directors and the other actors and somehow be somewhat spontaneous and make some choices, but not land on too many, and try and create the magic as we go along. That's how I approached the character. 


	It turned out that I was nothing like the character when we started, and by the end I was too much like him in [terms of] behavioral actions. There were some beats of Harvey that I think developed in ways that were not healthy for me as Gabriel, but that's the character. I wanted to honor the character and honor his insecurities and the way he does things. In the flash-forward, in the present time, I think Harvey is way more in a space of his wise self and less of his young child who needs to make a statement and get his way. I have found that I personally am in a better space in my life emotionally — and I think Harvey is too.


In one of your recent social media posts, we can see that Harvey is still in Seattle and presumably working with Mike for the everyman, rather than for corporations or the one percent. Harvey still has his wedding band on in the behind-the-scenes photos that have been released, so he is still married to Donna (Sarah Rafferty). How much are we going to hear about what Harvey's life looks like now in episodes eight and nine? Are we going to hear about what he has been up to with Mike or Donna?












	I think you're going to see there are a few beats that represent what's going on in his present life, and I think that the audience will be pleasantly warm. They'll have a warm feeling. (Laughs) I think they'll enjoy it. I think it gives the fans what they want, and I think there's some special moments there.


A lot of the success of Suits had to do with the close relationship between Harvey and Mike; it was a depiction of male friendship we hadn't really seen on TV before. What do you think were the keys to building the onscreen and offscreen rapport that you had with Patrick, particularly in the earlier seasons, and why do you think that dynamic has stood the test of time?


	I think people are interested in relationships where there's a mentor and a mentee. I think that when the mentor is teaching some real truth and inspiring and creating strength in someone younger, it's really inspiring [the audience]. But I also think that when the youth is able to teach the elder, there's something there as well. Mike taught a lot to Harvey that Harvey wasn't able to work out on his own. I think that's the dynamic — they're both making mistakes along the way. Humans make mistakes all the time. I think the characters are accountable for what they have done wrong and they try to make things right.


	At the end of the day, what's most resonant is both of them really have a heart of gold, and they may do things in an alternative or maybe even manipulative way, and that's the dramatic purpose [of the show]. But at its heart, these are guys that want to do right, and that's what people respond to. They also like to see people take the piss at each other and bring them down in a playful way — not to really put them in their spot and make them feel less than or dismiss them. But they were able to one up each other throughout. I think people like that chemistry, and Patrick and I had that on set and in real life as well.

	











Harvey Specter has become a cultural icon, joining other powerful male antiheroes like Tony Soprano, Walter White and Don Draper. Jon Hamm told THR last year that those kinds of male characters are often celebrated for the wrong reasons; a certain demographic seems to think of them as “a paragon of masculinity.” How did you approach the depiction of masculinity with Harvey on Suits? And what are your thoughts on the way that the character, for better or for worse, has been used and propped up as a bastion of masculinity in pop culture?


	That's a great question. Jon Hamm totally stole that from me. I said that first — just not as articulately and just not with the vocabulary that he used. I'm just playing. (Laughs) He's absolutely right. I think that these are television characters who have made a real dent in society, and I am not in any way, shape or form supportive of the male toxicity that Harvey just exudes. I'm definitely not honoring his narcissistic need [to be told] how great he is. I think he is full of insecurities, full of vulnerabilities, full of abandonment issues, full of this patriarchal selfish greed that he needs to stay on top and control as much as he can before it's taken away. I think all of that is — what's it called? — misogynistic crap.


	I think some of our young adolescent men lean into that and think that's the way to be cool and make an influence in society. What people really respond to about Harvey is his vulnerability; his caring for the other. Once he realizes he's being a dick, and I think when he is self-reflective and in touch with himself and his emotions, he really looks at every man and says, “Let's be equal. Let's figure out what we're doing wrong, and let's make a change in an integral way with integrity and kindness.” And that's underneath what he's doing; those are his actions at the end of the day. But I think Jon Hamm is absolutely right. These characters are manipulative and often really offensive and not great in any way for our society — and I hate to say it, but we as an audience have our blinders on when we're not looking deeper at what's underneath all of this stuff. I think too much is being run in the wrong way.

	











You admittedly had little interest in coming back to work as an actor right now. You've now ventured into business as a whiskey investor and creative spokesperson, but you came back to Suits as a tribute to the fans. How open is the door to revisit Harvey again down the line? Would you consider reprising this role in any iteration in the future — whether it be in a potential future season of Suits LA or a potential movie reunion — or do you feel like this short arc was the best way for you to let Harvey go?


	I think it was the right way to come back, and it's the right way to leave it right now. I think I was here, really, to pass the baton to Suits LA, but they're up and running and these guys are solid. They've got some good writing; there's some good stories. There's definitely fans who are going to stay with the show. I don't think they need me back. But never say never! If the opportunity comes where it makes sense — again, I've got a lot of different interests and a lot of ventures going on.


	I'm really excited and passionate about my whiskey, Bear Fight Whiskey, and creating little short narratives like, “What is your 'bear fight'? Everyone's got a bear fight, so what is yours?” [The idea of that campaign is] everyone's got either a big trauma or a little trauma or a challenge or a thing that's just a daily itch, like, “God, I really haven't picked up my guitar this week. I just gotta do it, but it's not on the calendar and I forget to do it. So next week I'm going to put it on my board, and I'm going to practice the guitar.” And at the very end of the day they say, “You know what? I practiced guitar today. I lent in and I engaged, and I'm going to celebrate that moment by having a glass of Bear Fight.” I would love to see that conversation. I'm really passionate about that, and that's where my interest lies right now.

	











	Look, if [Aaron] comes back to me and says, “Hey, would you like to do another arc?” — I'm open to it, but I'm really interested in doing this short-form narrative right now. I want to spend my time with my family.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


EXCLUSIVE: The feature musical Kiss of the Spider Woman starring Jennifer Lopez, Diego Luna and Tonatiuh will be getting wide theatrical release October 10. Deadline first told you that the biggest movie at this year's Sundance Film Festival had its North American rights acquired by Roadside Attractions, Lionsgate and LD Entertainment.


	Also opening on October 10 is Disney's Tron: Ares, Warner Bros/Legendary's Animal Friends with Jason Momoa and Ryan Reynolds, and the exclusive launch of Amazon MGM Studios' Luca Guadagnino thriller After the Hunt with Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri.

	











	The Bill Condon-directed Spider Woman, an Artists Equity production, is based on the book by Terrence McNally and John Kander and Fred Ebb's songs from the Broadway show. Argentinian author Manuel Puig wrote the original 1976 novel upon which the 1985 Oscar-winning movie starring William Hurt, Raul Julia and Sonia Braga is based. Luna and Tonatiuh play jail cellmates Valentín and Luis, respectively, in a military-run 1983 Argentinian. Gay widow dresser Luis keeps Valentín's spirits alive with tales about his favorite actress, Ingrid Luna (Lopez), and the movie musicals she starred in.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Roadside Attractions acquired Gia Coppola's The Last Showgirl out of the Toronto Film Festival last year and quickly ramped up awards-season buzz for its lead star Pamela Anderson. Anderson garnered Golden Globe Best Actress and SAG Lead Actress noms, while Jamie Lee Curtis got Supporting Actress noms from SAG and BAFTA and Miley Cyrus song “Beautiful That Way” scored BAFTA, Golden Globe and Critics Choice noms.


Kiss of the Spider Woman is 82% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes coming away from its Sundance premiere.


Deadline Film Critic Pete Hammond beamed in his review for the film, “Jennifer Lopez who has the whole package — singing, dancing, acting — she has never gotten the opportunity to show on screen in this way. Lopez has always been underrated for her chops as a dramatic actress, but fans of the period and the films emulated here will see favorable comparisons with Columbia musical icon Rita Hayworth, MGM diva Cyd Charisse, Ava Gardner, even Marilyn Monroe in the delicious ‘Gimme Love' number (choreographed by Christopher Scott) where Aurora is surrounded by male dancers ala Marilyn in ‘Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.‘ ”

	It's the end of the road for The Sex Lives Of College Girls. Following the ensemble comedy's recent cancellation by Max after three seasons, producing studio Warner Bros. Television shopped it around. But its attempts to find a new home for the series, co-created and executive produced by Mindy Kaling and Justin Noble, were unsuccessful.


	“We were very much hoping to find a new home for that one, and I think we've now come to the end of the road, which is disappointing, because it's a show that we really love,”Warner Bros. TV Group chairman Channing Dungey told Deadline in an expansive interview. “I'm so proud of the three seasons that we did at Max but I don't think there's going to be more of College Girls.”

	











	As Deadline reported at the time of Max's cancellation last month, WBTV was believed to be in talks with Netflix, where Kaling has a longstanding relationship, but the streamer was considered a long-shot new home prospect given the complexities of a potential move with rights of the existing seasons entangled around the world. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	In a note to fans after Max's decision not to proceed with Season 4, Noble, still hopeful at the time that College Girls would continue, spoke of the dearth of comedy on TV. 


	“I can't help but mention that it feels like there are fewer and fewer comedy series every month — and we are living in an era where we need that comedy badly,” he wrote on IG back then. “So I really hope that turns around, but I will always be proud of this show for being the things that we weren't seeing enough of: a hard comedy ensemble where ladies get the jokes.”


The Sex Lives of College Girls Season 3 series regular cast included Pauline Chalamet, Amrit Kaur, Alyah Chanelle Scott, Christopher Meyer, Ilia Isorelýs Paulino, and Renika Williams, joined by new additions Gracie Lawrence and Mia Rodgers. Original cast member Reneé Rapp exited several episodes into the season.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	Warner Bros Television is 2-for-2 in 2025 launches, with both of its new series to debut so far this year, Max's The Pitt and Netflix's Running Point, scoring with critics and audiences to earn quick renewals. The studio also has landed early broadcast renewals for hit comedies Abbott Elementary at ABC and Georgie & Maddy's First Marriage at CBS while awaiting word on six bubble scripted shows and a comedy pilot across CBS, NBC, Fox and the CW.


	Additionally, WBTV has found itself at the center of a pop culture frenzy as the studio behind some of the most anticipated new series and returns that have sparked an unprecedented level of fan interest and casting scrutiny: HBO's Harry Potter, Apple TV+'s Ted Lasso, Max's Big Bang spinoff Stuart Fails to Save the Universe as as well Netflix's Scooby-Doo, one of two high-profile recent streaming greenlights for the studio alongside Not Suitable For Work at Hulu.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	In an interview with Deadline, Channing Dungey, Chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Television Group | WBD US Networks, spoke of the pressure of tackling beloved titles and provided updates including whether Ted Lasso could tell the story of a women's soccer team over a three-season arc as it did with the men's.


	She also spoke of adapting to the evolving broadcast and streaming businesses, producing for siblings HBO and Max as well as rival streamers like Netflix, Apple and Hulu, and keeping top talent under overall deals. Dungey also revealed the fate of Sex Lives of College Girls, hinted at 1990s Warner Bros movies getting series adaptation, and addressed the possibility of more Manifest and Gilmore Girls and a larger Season 2 of The Pitt.


	Designed to run over a decade, HBO's series adaptation of the hugely popular Harry Potter fantasy books has been assembling its main cast over the last several months. As Deadline reported exclusively, John Lithgow, Janet McTeer, Paapa Essiedu and Nick Frost are set or in negotiations to play Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape and Hagrid, respectively. HBO, which has not commented, is leading the casting selection, which saw some 32,000 kids auditioning for the roles of Harry, Hermione and Ron. WBTV is the studio on the project, from showrunner Francesca Gardiner and director Mark Mylod.

	











DEADLINE: Are you close to naming Harry, Hermione and Ron or confirming the adult cast?


CHANNING DUNGEY: We are not yet ready to announce the kids, we're still working our way through that process. I have to give you credit, you at Deadline are consistently breaking the news even when we're not ready, so I feel like you are very up to speed on all things Potter in that way.


DEADLINE: We don't have Voldemort yet, that's the one card I'm missing in my deck. 


DUNGEY: You're missing it in your deck, because we are still weighing a couple of different options there, so we're not quite ready there yet. That's an important role to get right.


DEADLINE: Cillian Murphy has been the one fans really want in the role, and he has been rumored for another Harry Potter character, too. Is that a possibility? 


DUNGEY: I have no comment, no comment, no comment. 


DEADLINE: Is the show still on track for a summer start of production? It was targeting a late 2026 or early 2027 premiere; is one of them looking more likely than the other?


DUNGEY: Still on track for summer start of production. The rest we'll know more as we get rolling.


DEADLINE: Do you have an episode count yet, is that something that you can share?


DUNGEY: Not something that we can share, because we're still working on some finesses on the last couple of scripts, and the question becomes, do we think that it's worth breaking one into two more? We should know shortly I would think.


	It was Warner Bros TV's move last August to pick up the options of British Ted Lasso cast members Hannah Waddingam, Brett Goldstein and Jeremy Swift that signaled the Season 4 return of the hugely popular Apple TV+ series. The new season, featuring co-creator/star Jason Sudeikis' Ted Lasso coaching a women's soccer team, was made official last month, with production set to begin in July in Kansas before returning to the UK.


DEADLINE: You never quite closed the door on Ted Lasso after Season 3. How did the new season come together? 


DUNGEY: It's really all been driven by Jason. The studio, Warner Bros, and Apple were very much open to doing more Ted Lasso but so much of it was about Jason feeling good about the prospects, comfortable with the idea. It's all coming from his creative brain, and we were fortunate enough to find ourselves in a place where he landed on an idea that he was excited about, and we are getting the opportunity to support him in that vision.


DEADLINE: Is everything coming together? Are you going to get all the cast members you want back, including Juno Temple and co-creator/writer Brandon Hunt?


DUNGEY: So far, so good. We're still in active conversations but we're very hopeful.


DEADLINE: Word is that Jason has another three-season arc mapped out for the women's soccer team story.


DUNGEY: We've heard the pitch for this next season, for Season 4. Is there the opportunity for the story to continue after that? Absolutely. Have I heard a whole three-season pitch? Not yet. 


	The gestational period of Stuart Fails to Save the Universe, Chuck Lorre's spinoff from The Big Bang Theory, has been about as long as Season 4 of Ted Lasso. Gearing up for a (likely) series greenlight decision by Max, co-creator Lorre a couple of weeks ago assembled the project's main cast — Big Bang alums Kevin Sussman (Stuart Bloom), Lauren Lapkus (Denise), Brian Posehn (Bert Kibbler) and John Ross Bowie (Barry Kripke) — to workshop the two scripts he had co-written with Zak Penn and Bill Prady before turning them in to Max.

	











DEADLINE: What is the status of the Big Bang spinoff? I thought by now we'd get a green light because the scripts are clearly ready; John posted photos from the informal table read.


DUNGEY: Chuck, Zak and Bill are hard at work writing stuff. We've seen some material at the studio, and we've had some creative conversations with Max, so we are hopeful for good news soon.


DEADLINE: How do you feel about the scripts? 


DUNGEY: They are creative, they are imaginative, and they are, most importantly, very, very funny. 


DEADLINE: Any chance for some of the original stars to pop in?


DUNGEY: I would never say never. We're very excited and focused on our series regulars who have great stuff to do in these episodes. 


	WBTV produced The Pitt for Max under a new broadcast-style business model, doing 15 episodes in Season 1 at a reasonable price, with HBO and Max Content CEO Casey Bloys last fall calling the medical show “a good template for a Max drama.” The series has been a success, topping Max's rankings and growing its viewership each week while also emerging as a leading Emmy contender.


DEADLINE: What is the plan for Season 2 of The Pitt? Are you going to stick to 15 episodes or will you try to go closer to the traditional 22-episode broadcast season? 


DUNGEY: There was a conversation about doing a little bit more. I think right now, we're still looking at 15 as the model. If it ends up going up from there, it would probably only be by a couple of episodes, certainly not all the way to 22.


	What's wonderful is, this is a perfect collaboration. John Wells, who is a master showrunner, but also someone who knows how to tell premium broadcast television stories. He brought those skills to play here with R. Scott Gemmill and with Noah Wyle. And it is truly gratifying, because it's not that often that you have a show that really hits on all measures. It's critically acclaimed, audiences love it. It delivers on all fronts, and that's been so satisfying for all of us.


DEADLINE: Season 1 just wrapped this week, and you already are gearing up for Season 2.


DUNGEY: One of the reasons that we wanted to have an early renewal is because we want to keep it on an annual cadence. That's the other part of this broadcast-style model. You fall in love with these [streaming] shows, you see eight episodes, and then you have to wait 18 months for there to be more. The whole promise of The Pitt was that we would be on an annual cadence, and we're going to be able to make that happen.


DEADLINE: Are you developing more dramas under that model for Max?


DUNGEY: We are looking at a couple of other things. We're developing a drama series under that model. We're looking at a couple of other procedural shows in the police space that might be done under that model. So yeah, there are a number of different things that we are developing right now for Max that would fit that same that same bill.


	After almost two years at Netflix, former longtime Disney/ABC executive Dungey took over Warner Bros' TV studio in November 2020, several months into the pandemic, when production was starting to ramp up under safety protocols. Since then, she has navigated the independent studio through the pandemic, two strikes and post-peak TV industry contraction.


	The studio recently landed series orders for Mindy Kaling's Not Suitable For Work at Hulu and Berlanti Prods' Scooby-Doo at Netflix — both of which started as script-to-series commitments — as well as a couple of high-profile sales including Dilettante starring Jeff Daniels from Berlanti Prods. at Apple; Kansas City Star with Kaley Cuoco from Hacks creators Lucia Aniello, Jen Statsky and Paul W. Downs at HBO; and Skinny Dip from Bill Lawrence at Max.

	











	All of them as well as recent renewals for Running Point, The Pitt, Presumed Innocent, Bad Monkey, Shrinking, Abbott Elementary and Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage and upcoming new series Duster on Max and Leanne and Untamed at Netflix stem from overall or first-look deals the studio has with the likes of Lorre, Kaling, Wells, Lawrence, Greg Berlanti, J.J. Abrams, Quinta Brunson and the Hacks trio.


DEADLINE: How have the last few years treated you as the head of an independent TV studio? 


DUNGEY: The greatest gift, quite honestly, is to be the head of an independent studio. We super value our partnership with Max and with HBO, and are so proud of the work that we do. But the exciting thing is that we are really able to let the stories that our creative partners want to tell drive the decisions we make about where the best homes are. 


	These are trying times in the industry across the board, there's a lot of noise happening every day. But what I love, is that at Warner Bros Television, we come to work every day with just one main goal in mind, and that is to make great television. And try to drown out all of the noise, whether it's something that's happening just within our industry, like the strikes, or something that's happening more broadly, in terms of things affecting our country. We try to drown out the noise with the faith that we have that if we continue to be the best at doing what we do, we will be successful. I've talked a lot about the fact that I feel like my role is to hold an umbrella over the creative team, shielding them from outside forces so they can focus on what they do best, which is telling great stories.


DEADLINE: You recently received a couple of series pickups and sold several big projects. Is the marketplace starting to pick up? Obviously, the strikes had something to do with buying and greenlights lagging. Is it a little easier now?


DUNGEY: I wouldn't necessarily say anything these days is easy; it's a very challenging time in the business. I feel like we have been fortunate to continue working steadily, and I chalk that up to the amazing creative partners that we have. It kind of comes back to be trying to be best in class, and we work with the best. We work with creators like John Wells. Mindy Kaling, Chuck Lorre, Greg Berlanti and Bill Lawrence and that's given us, I think, a leg up. We give the best and brightest people the time, the space and the creative canvas that they need to achieve their full potential. And that part of what gives us the opportunity to score these green lights and these series renewals.


DEADLINE: The level of commitments also has changed post-pandemic. Straight-to-series orders off a pitch are very rare. It seems like the new premium commitment is script-to-series with a short window for a streamer to pull the trigger after a script is delivered. Is that your observation? 


DUNGEY: It's definitely my observation. And I think that the script-to-series step replaced in the streaming space the notion of doing a pilot. I think that they want to — as opposed to just greenlighting things to series willy-nilly — the opportunity to read a script, see it on its feet, and a lot of times it's a script plus a development proposal or plan for the season, and then they feel confident based on those materials going off to series.


	I'm actually fine with that because I've always felt that there was value in having a pilot. And if you aren't going to shoot a pilot, having written that pilot script, at least, you really have a sense of what's the blueprint for the series. So I think that that's become the new model for a very good reason.

	











DEADLINE: Virtually all of your recent high-profile sales, greenlights and renewals come from talent under overall or first-look deals. Talk about the value of those pacts. Obviously, they're not as many as before, with studios largely holding onto their most prolific showrunners and producers. How would you evaluate the current state of the overall deal marketplace?


DUNGEY: I think there was a point in time when we all remember, as I like to call them, the glory days of broadcast where everyone had huge stables of overall deals because you would have the people who are the preeminent story generators. Those showrunners obviously were at the head of the list, but there was a point where everyone had to have a really long roster of talent because you were doing multiple shows that were 22 to 24 episodes a season, and you had to make sure that you had enough people to staff all of that up. 


	I think that a lot of that has gone by the wayside across the board. The truth of the matter is, when we look at our roster now, we are fortunate to have some of the top showrunners in the business, people who define excellence, and it's an unmatched roster. 


	Their success is our success, and we give them a lot of creative freedom. We want Warner Bros to be an amazing creative home for them, and then we are also looking to develop new voices, people that have come out of our shows that we feel have the opportunity to grow and become that next level of top talent.


	What we don't have as much as we once did is a number of writers that are just on call for staffing because so much more of the business now is a little bit auteur-driven. You have a showrunner at the top who has a creative idea and a vision. We're doing a lot of shows for streamers which are 8- to 10-episode orders. So you don't have that same longer list of needs in terms of staffing. So some of those deals, unfortunately, we don't have any more.


DEADLINE: There also have been few deals purely for development, they usually go to people who already have a successful show for the studio.


DUNGEY: We do have some deals that are based on development but that is usually because it's for a show, or wrapped around a particular show, or comes as a product of a particular show. So yeah, that's true. 


DEADLINE: WBTV recently renewed its deals with Abrams' Bad Robot, Kaling and All American and Found's Nkechi Okoro Carroll. Talk about the decision to re-up those, and also how you decide overall vs first-look; Bad Robot's new pact is first-look, a super popular deal type these days.


DUNGEY: Yeah, I think first-looks have become a little bit more popular because it's a little less expensive than an overall, and it gives the creative talent some optionality. I think for me, if it's someone that we are really excited about and believe in and feel have the opportunity to do different types of shows for different types of platforms, I would always prefer to have a overall deal to a first-look, if I can swing it.


DEADLINE: And for J.J., how did you make the decision to continue that relationship? There was some turbulence during Bad Robot's previous deal.


DUNGEY: We're very happy about our relationship with J.J. We had a big success last year with Presumed Innocent and are really excited about continuing to work on the second season within that universe. We have some exciting development going on right now with J.J., and we also have Duster, which is about to launch on Max. It is a show that it's been a little bit long in the gestation, but we are thrilled with it and very, very hopeful that it's going to connect with audiences in a significant way.

	











	As a studio, WBTV has a dual identity, feeding its own platforms with shows like the upcoming IT: Welcome to Derry, Lanterns, Steve Carell/Bill Lawrence comedy and Kansas City Star for HBO and Peacemaker, The Pitt, Stuart Fails to Save the Universe and a suite of DC animated shows, including Creature Commandos, for Max. But as an indie, the studio also has been taking big pieces a business with big auspices to Netflix (Running Point, Scooby-Doo, Untamed, Leanne), Apple (Ted Lasso, Shrinking, Dilettante) and Hulu (Not Suitable For Work).


DEADLINE: Do you determine whether to pitch outside with the creators, or do you always give Max and HBO heads-up what is coming? And what is the goal — do you want to be on every major streamer and have a hit on every single one?


DUNGEY: Believe me, yes, I absolutely want to be on every major streamer and have a hit on every single one. We've kind of been doing that; where we are at this point, we have had significant success on almost every platform, and we have meaningful development and/or series orders at every platform, which is exciting. 


DEADLINE: What about making the decision to take something like Running Point outside? Was that competitive? Was there some jealousy because it could've worked for Max too?


DUNGEY: If it's important IP, like the DC stuff, The Penguin or Lanterns, obviously that's going to be something that we do inside, either at Max or at HBO. When it's something like Running Point … I have regular conversations with Casey, [WBTV President of Creative Affairs] Clancy Collins White is constantly talking with [Max head of drama originals] Sarah Aubrey. We have a really good sense of what it is that they're looking for, particularly for Max, and if we have something coming down the pike in terms of development that we think would be right for them, or would be good for them, we try to talk about it early so that we can develop it collaboratively with them. There are other pieces of material that the town would want to explore, multiple places, so we will pitch things wide.


	What I do try to avoid is, we try not to take anything out If we have already had conversations with Max or with HBO about doing it internally; that's just not fair to our partners at other platforms. When we bring something out, if we're bringing it wide, we want to sell it to the most passionate and most committed place.


DEADLINE: You also have been doing more for HBO proper after a break with a slew of new series and development.


DUNGEY: We're thrilled about that. We love working with the team at Max and the team at HBO. Not a lot of times but some of the times when we're pitching, we'll pitch to Casey and also [HBO head of drama] Franny [Orsi] and Sarah and they'll make a determination after the fact about whether they feel like it feels more like an HBO or a Max property. At the end of the day, we're agnostic about it. We're happy to work on either side. Wherever Casey and the team feel like it's going to have the best success is where we want it to be.


DEADLINE: It's also has been a good relationship in terms of Max allowing the studio to find new homes for shows like Dead Boy Detectives, originally produced for Max, which ended up on Netflix. Will you be able to do the same for Sex Lives of College Girls following its Max cancellation?


DUNGEY: I don't think so. We were very much hoping to find a new home for that one, and I think we've now come to the end of the road, which is disappointing, because it's a show that we really love. I'm so proud of the three seasons that we did at Max but I don't think there's going to be more of College Girls.

	











DEADLINE: What about more Manifest on Netflix? That was a canceled show you successfully found a new home for.


DUNGEY: Never say never!


	Warner Bros TV helped revitalize broadcast comedy with Brunson's critical and ratings hit Abbott Elementary, and is bringing The Big Bang Theory franchise's run on CBS to two decades with a third consecutive hit, Georgie and Mandy's First Marriage. The studio also reestablished itself as a major supplier to the Big 4 broadcast networks after a vertical integration push a decade ago hit independent studios hard. Still, the broadcast business is tough with smaller margins as networks keep pushing for license fee reductions and more digital rights.


	With the 2022 sale of the CW — previously co-owned by Warner Bros and CBS — to Nexstar, Warner Bros TV's broadcast slate got cut roughly in half overnight as Nexstar moved away from pricey original scripted series, canceling most existing shows. The last remaining scripted series from the “old CW” still on the network is WBTV's All American. It is one of six WBTV broadcast scripted series on the bubble.


DEADLINE: Is broadcast still viable for the studio?


DUNGEY: Absolutely, absolutely. I love that the 18th consecutive year we have shows on all five of the broadcast networks, and I will continue to call CW a broadcast network, because my heart is still there. As long as we've got All American going, I'm still feeling really good about CW.


	Look, the broadcast business certainly has its challenges, but on the other hand, you still are reaching a very broad audience. That's one of the reasons why Quinta Brunson very much wanted Abbott to be a broadcast show, that was very important to her when we took that out as a pitch. And, between Abbott and Georgie and Mandy, we've got The Cleaning Lady and Rescue HI-Surf at Fox, and then we've got a bunch at NBC, Brilliant Minds, Found, Night Court. We just finished shooting a pilot for CBS called Zarna, which is a multi-camera comedy. So we feel like there still is a good bit of life left in broadcast, and it's a space that we still really enjoy working in.


DEADLINE: But isn't it tougher with networks constantly cutting license fees? You have three shows on NBC, which has to free up primetime real estate for the NBA. Maybe you can use The Voice as a bargaining chip because it still does well, but do you have a sense how things will shake out for Found, Brilliant Minds and Night Court?


DUNGEY: We don't yet. They're going through all of their internal deliberation processes. We have presented a Season 2 overview for Brilliant Minds and a Season 3 overview for Found and got great response from the creative teams on both. We're optimistic. It comes back to what I had said earlier, which is, we believe that we are delivering the best quality programming, and that is what gives us the courage to continue to move forward in a space that is increasingly competitive. And we are also very adept at Warner Bros. We know how to produce things at a low price point, at a high price point, and everything in between. So we feel like even in the even in this era where broadcast belts are getting tighter, we still feel like we can do an excellent job, even within budget constraints.


DEADLINE: That leads me to CW and Fox, because both now have different models; Fox's dramas are in the $3M-$4M an episode range, while the CW's license fees are now mostly well bellow $1 million an episode. Do you think you can continue to produce All American under their new business parameters? 












DUNGEY: We'll see. Could we produce something for the CW if we were starting from scratch, yes, absolutely. It's tough when you have a an established show like All American because there are some costs built into that multi season. But we're going to put our best efforts towards it. And as for Fox, we are still working there quite avidly and we're figuring it out. But again, it feels like it's one of those things where you have to build the show correctly to be able to produce it for a budget. And luckily, that's something that we have many, many years of experience doing.


DEADLINE: And your Fox shows already are built that way. At CBS, you have the comedy pilot Zarna, which is facing two pilots and one bubble series, all from CBS Studios, likely for one spot on the schedule. How did it turn out? Do you have hope that it can get that slot? 


DUNGEY: We are thrilled with it. CBS has only just seen it, so you'll have to find out from them how they're feeling. But we think the creative team has done an excellent job, and it's a really funny pilot with a great family that you feel like you've known them forever. Everyone settled in really immediately within this pilot, which doesn't always happen. So I am optimistic, and keep my fingers crossed.


	The next Warner Bros TV series set to premiere is not scripted, it is reality show Love Hotel for Bravo and Peacock from subsidiary Shed Media, which is also behind two of Bravo's Real Housewives shows.


	While the studio has an established cable reality business, which is expected to grow as Dungey now also oversees Warner Bros Discovery's U.S. networks, and it also produces NBC's flagship The Voice, its unscripted brand is probably most closely associated with The Bachelor franchise on ABC, which has been going for 23 years, spawning multiple spinoffs. Deadline's Peter White recently reported on the alleged “toxic” culture of the franchise, which is skipping a Bachelorette cycle this year. Since then, multiple producers, including The Bachelor showrunners, have exited.


DEADLINE: What is the future of The Bachelor franchise? There has been some behind-the-scene turmoil lately. Is it still a valuable piece of business for the studio?


DUNGEY: Absolutely, it's still a valuable piece of business for us. It's still an important piece of business for ABC. And we're grateful. We've had a lot of excellent conversations with our counterparts at ABC. It is still a huge priority for us, and we're very much looking forward to Bachelor in Paradise, which is next up for us.


DEADLINE: You also are part of the Bravo universe with multiple Real Housewives offshoots, including the upcoming Love Hotel.


DUNGEY: Love Hotel, we're getting tremendous feedback on from the team over at Peacock. Part of what I love about playing around in the unscripted space is the opportunity to explore different types of storytelling. And I feel like everyone always goes straight to Bachelor when they talk about it. But we've got a lot of other fun things going on, Real Housewives of New York and Salt Lake City, which, if you haven't watched it, is a delight. 


	And then, in my new U.S. networks remit, It's fun when all the things come together, like when we do something like Wizards of Baking. It's the Harry Potter space, but it's also my unscripted team at Warner Bros Television producing for the Food Network, all of those things coming together in one fell swoop. That's to me an example of the one WBD, the idea that we can work across multiple divisions of the company, all coming together to make something successful, both for Food Network and for Max.

	











	On the animation side, I would love to see even more partnership between my animation group and what we're doing for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. We're playing a lot in the IP space. Creature Commandos has been a big success for us. And we're looking forward to do more there, DC Superpowers, My Adventures with Green Lantern, Starfire!, those are some new things that have been greenlit in our partnership with DC Studios.


	Like any storied Hollywood studio, one of Warner Bros' most valuable holdings is its IP. A significant number of WBTV's current series portfolio is based on company IP, from a slew of live-action and animated DC properties including Peacemaker, Lanterns and Creature Commandos to IT: Welcome to Derry, Scooby-Doo, a One Tree Hill sequel at Netflix, a Crazy Rich Asians adaptation at Max with Adele Lim, and, of course, Harry Potter.


DEADLINE: How much are you focusing on mining Warner Bros IP?


DUNGEY: We're certainly looking at mining IP. It is something that most platforms have a lot of interest in. We're blessed at Warner Bros to have such a rich history and so much to draw from, both in terms of series that we've made in the past, and also the huge Warner Bros film library, which is fantastic. We've been at this 70 years on the television side, So there are a lot of great stories that are ripe for redevelopment.


	All that said, my belief about IP is that there needs to be a reason to tell the story now. There needs to be a reason to reinvest in that IP, and it's all about the creative talent and their take and their perspective. Why is this the right moment to revisit beloved title? I'm also a big believer in developing new IP and new franchises, things that you come up with today. Running Point, for example, that's a fantastic show on its own. You want to continue to build the library of new IP as opposed to only relying on established titles.


DEADLINE: Is there anything that is coming in down the pike on the IP front, anything that you've been trying to crack in this job?


DUNGEY: We've got a number of different things in development right now, some of which are a little too early to talk about, but I will say that we have some interesting things coming down the pike that are based on beloved Warner Bros films of the '90s. I'll leave it at that.


DEADLINE: Any chance of The Penguin coming back?


DUNGEY: The Penguin is one of those things where — and it's interesting, because when you talk with everyone involved, everyone is interested in possibly revisiting those characters and doing more — it was very much designed as a limited series. But I would never say never. I think if we can get the creative stars to line up in the right way, and the talent is available — because we certainly wouldn't want to do this without Colin [Farrell] and Cristin [Milioti] and that team — I would say it's definitely a possibility, but there's nothing in the works at the moment.


DEADLINE: This year we mark the 25th anniversary of Gilmore Girls, which has aged well, remaining a perennial favorite, especially around the holidays. Any chance of another A Year In the Life or anything more to do with Gilmore Girls or are you just celebrating the milestone?


DUNGEY: For now, we're excited to be commemorating the milestone, and all divisions of the company are working together to celebrate with our fans. As for the future, I'll simply repeat: never say never.

	











DEADLINE: With IP power comes responsibility. How does it feel to be under the microscope on all of your high-profile current projects, with fans constantly analyzing and speculating your every move? 


DUNGEY: With any of these, we always are driven by the creative first, and we want to be as true to the stories we're trying to tell as we possibly can. Yes, there's always a lot of speculation. And when you're working with beloved IP, be it something that's new and original, like Ted Lasso, or Scooby, which is so beloved to those of us that grew up watching the animated cartoons, or, of course, Harry Potter with legions of fans around the world, we're trying to let the creative drive us. We are fortunate enough to be working with incredibly talented showrunners on all of the projects, and, trusting your instincts, but letting the creative drive the decision making.

With Easter just around the corner, we could all use a reminder to avoid the worldly temptations of jelly beans and plastic eggs and focus on the holiday's true meaning: sticking it to King Arthur.

Allow me to clarify, as you'd be forgiven for thinking that a faith-based film coming out at the holiest time of year called “The King of Kings” was exclusively about Jesus Christ, and not the parenting struggles faced by Charles Dickens. But life is full of surprises, and Seong-ho Jang's Angel Studios effort begins with Ebenezer Scrooge confronting the scary revelations shown to him by the Ghost of Christmas Future in a snowy graveyard. Then we learn that it wasn't actually Scrooge, but the man who created him. 

 








Related Stories WGA Says Over 1,300 TV Writing Jobs Were Lost in the 2023-'24 Season How Steven Soderbergh Turned a Dinner Scene Where Nobody Moves Into the Most Exciting Set Piece of 2025 

It's the mid-1800s and Charles Dickens (Kenneth Branagh) is struggling to work his way through a staged reading of his new Christmas novel because he's distracted by his young son Walter (Roman Griffin Davis) pretending he's King Arthur backstage. Dickens decides to put an end to the madness caused by the boy's love of knights and chivalry once and for all by telling him a better story. To which Walter cheekily responds “If it's not about a king, I'm not interested.” 




			Popular on IndieWire		






That's our entry into “The King of Kings,” which turns into a feature-length lesson about Jesus' greatest hits with a couple throwback Judaism homages from the Old Testament thrown in for good measure. Yet even after that ham-fisted intro, the film still features way more Charles Dickens shitting on King Arthur than you could possibly be imagining. Dickens doesn't just narrate the story of Jesus (voiced by Oscar Isaac), but him and Walter appear alongside the Son of God and watch him work all of his miracles from a distance while Charles makes comments like “I would argue that Satan is a little scarier than a dragon” and his kid asks when Merlin is going to show up. 

The story we all know by now unfolds in a series of vignettes that covers Jesus' birth, his childhood excursion to the temple of Jerusalem, his sermons and miracles, and his sentencing and crucifixion. Isaac and Branagh are flanked by an A-list voice cast that also includes Pierce Brosnan as Pontius Pilate, Forest Whitaker as Peter, and Mark Hamill as King Herod, but the holy trinity of Jesus, Charles, and Walter are the real stars of the show. Even if many of the theological scenes are perfectly inoffensive, the visual of watching a cartoon Jesus suffer on the cross while Charles Dickens stands 10 feet away and uses his pain as a teaching moment is not an image I ever expected to encounter.

 










A truly abysmal run of 21st century faith-based movies has placed us in the unenviable position of grading new ones on a curve. It's reached the point where any movie about Jesus that doesn't attempt to push a MAGA message about hating thy neighbor starts with a few bonus points, artistic merits be damned. (The old “it might not be ‘The Last Temptation of Christ,' but at least it's not ‘God's Not Dead: A Light in the Darkness'” argument.) That's the case here, as “The King of Kings” does offer a theologically accurate message that's largely about being kind and helping the needy. If you fast-forwarded through all of the Dickens nonsense, it would make an adequate introduction for a young child looking to learn the basics of the Christian faith. The animation might look like its primary influence was AI-generated memes floating around evangelical Facebook pages, but it's clear that the people working on it had good intentions. 

Which brings me back to the Dickens of it all. The choice to center a film that primarily exists as a primer on the Gospels for young viewers around the parenting struggles of a 19th century literary figure who is not exactly at the forefront of culture is inexplicable. Let's just do the math. For every 100 Christian kids between the ages of 5 and 8, do 30 of them know about “A Christmas Carol?” And of those 30, how many are deeply familiar with the man who wrote it? Then subtract the ones who aren't up to date on King Arthur mythology and you're probably left with one or two literary prodigies who already know the Jesus story inside and out. Jesus' status as an enduring symbol is partially attributable to the Gospels' adaptability and relevance to the timeless problems that come with being a human, but I'm not sure the feeling of “my professional career is in shambles because my kid won't shut up about King Arthur” is a universal experience.

 










By the time the film builds to its climactic reveal that Dickens is going to write his own children's book about Jesus, it's hard to muster much more of a response than “Who the hell cares?” The “Great Expectations” scribe is constantly telling his son that Jesus has a better story than King Arthur, but somebody needs to tell him that, while that might be true, there are countless takes on the story that are better than this one. But it's not like we're getting “The Way of the Wind” at Cannes, so anyone who was gearing up for some new Jesus cinema has to take what they can get.

An Angel Studios release, “The King of Kings” is now playing in theaters.

“It's not yours if you can't keep it.” 

In “Your Friends and Neighbors,” this line emerges from Jack Bailey (Corbin Bernsen), a rich old dude who runs a hedge fund and just fired Andrew Cooper (Jon Hamm), a slightly-less-rich, slightly-less-old dude who manages, er, managed a hedge fund. Bailey's point is basically nothing that belongs to the firm belongs to Andrew, even if Andrew — who goes by “Coop,” because he's cool and relatable like that — brought in the clients, their investments, and their influence. It's a shitty thing to say, just like firing Coop is a shitty thing to do, but hey, that's Jack — and that's business.

Still, the phrase inevitably springs to mind later, as Coop pivots from taking anyone's money to make the rich richer and into taking the rich's money to make himself richer. As he sneaks into his wealthy neighbors' capacious mansions, pinching a designer purse from this drawer and a spare roll of cash from that one, you can almost hear Coop thinking to himself, “Well, it's not yours if you can't keep it.” What he actually says (via Hamm's spokesman-polished voiceover) are variations of “they won't even know it's gone” or “that asshole doesn't deserve this.” 

But we know what he means: “I need this, so I'm taking it, because you're too stupid to stop me.” His caveman perspective isn't far removed from that of the ex-boss he hates. Yet, for the bulk of the first season, Coop can't open his eyes to acknowledge the congruity, nor can he recognize the broader corresponding truth that's been abundantly clear since at least 1964, when The Beatles released the hit song “Can't Buy Me Love”: Money, or whatever it buys, isn't going to make Coop happy. What he needs… is…

Shoot. I just had it. Is it… gloves?

“Your Friends and Neighbors” dances around many a titillating topic: the parallels between Coop's socially acceptable former business and his illicit current means of making money (aka stealing it); the appearance of affluence and what it buys you vs. the appearance of poverty and what it costs; the nagging repulsion for Coop's haughty, privileged attitude toward just about anything and the persisting appeal of Jon Hamm‘s naughty, no-fucks-given approach toward being Jon Hamm. 

But despite flirting with some very good ideas, creator Jonathan Tropper's drama never confronts them (at least, not yet — Apple provided seven of the nine episodes for review). Instead, it sticks to a reliable, predictable plot, trusting its fine cast and refined aesthetic to elevate a show that's as basic as they come. 

 










Backing up a bit, “Your Friends and Neighbors” is a new series on Apple TV+ about rich white-people problems. If you are a rich white person, especially a guy, then you should be able to identify with Coop's mid-life crisis in ways those of us too busy being raked over the coals by capitalism cannot. For instance, Coop's biggest problem is that he's been fired. OK, relatable enough, except his immediate issues upon losing his sole source of income aren't paying the mortgage or buying groceries; they're learning how to turn down $20,000-a-plate charity dinners and moving his sister out of the apartment he rents for her and into his own house with an extra bedroom. 

Fine, at first, his challenges are about saving face. I guess people can get on board with that. No one likes to be embarrassed, and Coop's dismissal was embarrassing: There's a scandal involved… although, it's really just the appearance of a scandal, because Coop didn't do anything wrong. (The premiere episode bends over backwards to make that clear.) There's also a two-year non-compete to overcome… only, he does get other job offers, just not ones that he likes. 

So really, the embarrassment he's trying to get past is putting his trust in a boss who didn't deserve it, which if Coop saw a therapist, would eventually be his breakthrough moment: Not only did Coop recently lose his job because his boss threw him under the bus, he also recently lost his wife of 18 years when he walked in on her banging his best friend. Three life-changing betrayals, all within a few weeks. 

 










Ouch. Now I think most people can drum up some pity for this poor (but not poor) cuckold, as he forms new opinions of his life and himself while trying to put the pieces back together. Except in fleshing out Mel (Amanda Peet), “Your Friends and Neighbors” makes it pretty clear that she's not some cold, spoiled asshole. She didn't cheat on Coop for the fun of it, nor did she savor the stabbing him in the back. There are two sides to every break-up story, and even though Coop refuses to see Mel's perspective, the show tips it for her in a way that doubles our frustration over Coop's sluggish acceptance of any responsibility whatsoever.

Perhaps if “Your Friends and Neighbors” was willing to take its protagonist to task for his moral failings and lunkish oversights, the series wouldn't feel so emotionally inert. Instead, it coasts on Hamm's affability and focuses on Coop's new profession as a petty thief. Drunk and depressed at a party where Mel and Nick (Mark Tallman) are seated in the friend circle he once completed, Coop goes wandering through his host's lavish house. Oh, isn't that a cute little piece of soap. Ah, aren't these bed pillows fluffy. Hey, is that a drawer full of money? Guess I'll take a stack for myself, thank you very much. 

 










Thus a habit is born, both Coop's and the show's. Coop may not know why he decided to steal a wad of cash from his supposed friend. In the moment, he popped it in his pocket as casually as you or I might take a matchbook from a restaurant bar. But after holding onto it for a few days, thinking over just how much money is laying around his neighbors' suburban palaces, he decides he wants more. Eventually, he even admits he likes the act of stealing. Nevermind that wanting more is what ended him in a mess of debt and face-saving lies to begin with. Habits are hard to break.

The show's habit, however, is confusing suspense with conflict. For much of the season, Coop slides open unlocked doors or follows YouTube tutorials when locks are actually latched. Sometimes there will be an unexpected alarm or dog or security guard, and in those moments, it's only natural to worry about Coop getting caught. There's tension, but it's fleeting. “Your Friends and Neighbors” isn't dumb enough to lock up its primary asset so early, and it's not slick enough to make each new break in an “Ocean's”-esque thrill ride. So as he's puttering around his neighborhood, it's too easy to realize there's very little struggle here — which may fit Coop's posh lifestyle as snugly as his cashmere sweaters, but does little to elevate the show around him.

 










Apple has made these kind of shows before. “Dark Matter” is sad-dad mid-life crisis science-fiction. (“Hello Tomorrow” kind of is, too.) “Ted Lasso” is sad-dad mid-life crisis comedy. (“Shrinking” even more so.) But more importantly, Hamm has been here before, with much richer results. Don Draper is his own brand of sad dad: the '60s family patriarch whose existential crisis sends him bouncing between absurd heights of self-confidence and heartbreaking lows of absolute fraudulence. 

Watching him shift between each was magnetic because each movement was unpredictable and identifiable, mindful and foolhardy, specific to Don and balanced against the full lives of those around him, the lens of history, and so much more. Maybe being really good at business could make up for what he did in the war, what he did to his family, and who he believes himself to be, deep down. When that strategy inevitably failed (and even when it shockingly succeeded), we learned a little bit more about Don, because he learned a little bit more about himself (not always the right lessons, but hey, that just makes him more human and the show more self-aware).

Here, you're only waiting for Coop to figure out what you already know. There's not enough drama to it. There's not enough surprise or insight. No show should be judged against “Mad Men” just because they both share the same star, but in a way, every show should be judged against “Mad Men” because every show should want to be that good. “Your Friends and Neighbors” isn't a let-down because it falls short of greatness. It's a let-down because it doesn't try that hard to be great. And that's who Coop is, through and through.

 










“Your Friends and Neighbors” premieres Friday, April 11 on Apple TV+ with two episodes. New episodes will be released weekly through the finale (Episode 9) on May 30.

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix‘s hit series The Lincoln Lawyer has added Kyle Richards (The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills), Jason Butler Harner (Ozark), and Scott Lawrence (Paradise) to its Season 4 guest cast. 


	The storyline was teed up at the end of the Season 3 finale of the hit legal drama when Mickey Haller (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) was pulled over and arrested when the body of a client was found in the trunk of his Lincoln. Next season will see Mickey defending himself as he goes on trial for murder. He will face off with the prosecutor on the case, Dana Berg (Constance Zimmer), who has ties to his first ex-wife, Maggie (Neve Campbell).

The venerable actress played Broadway producer Eileen Rand during the show's two seasons.

Anjelica Huston may have starred on the NBC musical series Smash, but she admits she didn't feel happy on the show.


	In an interview with People magazine, the actress reflected on starring alongside Katherine McPhee, Megan Hilty, Debra Messing and Jack Davenport on the TV show.




	Huston played Broadway producer Eileen Rand during Smash‘s two seasons. The series was cancelled in 2013.


	“I wasn't very happy when I was on that show,” Huston told the publication. “I was living in New York and I wasn't very happy living in New York for the obvious reasons. It was a cold winter, and I didn't feel very prized in that role. I was a bit depressed by it. It was hard really; I didn't really have a good time making it.”

	While on the show Huston was also still mourning the loss of her husband of 16 years, Robert Graham, who died in 2008.


	“Bob was very special and very irreplaceable,” she said. “A lot's gone on since Bob died.”


	Huston's comments come amid a Broadway adaptation of the show that opened Thursday night. Robert Greenblatt, Neil Meron and Steven Spielberg are lead producing, with Susan Stroman, a five-time Tony Award winner for The Producers, directing.


	The Broadway show stars Robyn Hurder, Brooks Ashmanskas, Krysta Rodriguez, John Behlmann, Kristine Nielsen, Caroline Bowman, Jacqueline B. Arnold, Bella Coppola and Casey Garvin. Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman wrote the score, which includes many of the songs the two wrote for the television show including “Let Me Be Your Star” and “Don't Forget Me” as well as new material. Joshua Bergasse who choreographed the television series, returns as choreographer of the stage show. 


	The Broadway show has long been in the works, with Greenblatt and other team members first discussing bringing the show to a bigger stage after a 2015 one-night charity benefit concert version of Bombshell. It was originally announced for Broadway in 2020 but delayed, and the team held a developmental workshop of the show last summer. 


	The series centers on the approaching opening night for Bombshell, a new show about Marilyn Monroe. The synopsis of the Broadway show reads: “Nearly breaking under the pressure, legendary Broadway star Ivy Lynn causes a series of hilarious set-backs and surprises that brings a diva director, a bewildered producer, two exasperated authors, one eager understudy and an entire company to its knees. But the curtain's going up, no matter what.”

It's been obvious for a while now that Hollywood is hoping to position video game adaptations as its next big meal ticket, but — in an industry that's always braced for failure and blindsided by success — the blockbuster opening weekend of “A Minecraft Movie” still managed to take everyone by surprise. Even Warner Bros. seemed to be caught flat-footed by its own sudden windfall, as if the studio's recent failure to make any money off a mega-budget space fascism satire from Bong Joon Ho and/or the imminent dread it feels about selling the masses on an $115 million action film inspired by a Thomas Pynchon novel somehow meant that a manic kids movie based on the best-selling video game of all time might result in another round of embarrassing headlines.

Still, I can understand why there might have been a little trepidation around a project that, in hindsight, was always going to be a major event. Sure, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” and the “Sonic the Hedgehog” franchise had already combined to gross more than two billion dollars, but the last time someone plugged Jack Black into one of these things we got “Borderlands,” which didn't even make one billion dollars, and was almost as bad at resembling its video game as Elon Musk probably is at playing it. Further muddying the waters was the fact that “Minecraft” is a plotless sandbox that hinges on the joys of unfettered creativity, while “A Minecraft Movie” is a hyper-linear hero's journey that doesn't have a single fresh idea of its own. 

Experiencing the final product at a pre-release press screening with my five-year-old son (who spent most of the movie beating me to death with the blocky foam swords they gave him on the way in), I wasn't entirely convinced that projecting “Minecraft” graphics onto a generic adventure story would be enough to satisfy the game's fanbase, or to sell its concept on a wider audience. And judging by the tepid response to that screening (which, unlike the average showing of “A Minecraft Movie,” did not descend into “mother!”-like pandemonium at the sight of a square-headed zombie child riding a big chicken), I certainly wouldn't have suspected that “A Minecraft Movie” was about to signal a major paradigm shift in the film industry's priorities. 

 










On the contrary, as I watched Jason Momoa and co. speed through a paint-by-numbers plot so unashamedly mashed together from “The Lord of the Rings” and “The LEGO Movie” that WB might have to sue itself, all I could think about was that Hollywood still has no idea how to make a video game movie. It wasn't until I watched the box office numbers roll in that I started to think about how exciting that could be now that Hollywood is about to be making a lot more of them. 

It might be premature to declare that video game adaptations have become the new superhero movies, but something will have to be in order for Hollywood to move on, as the film business would be lost without a well it can't wait to tap dry (as box office quote machine Paul Dergarabedian confirmed to IndieWire earlier this week). Studio execs may never be able to find another licensing machine as elastic, reliable, and self-perpetuating as the MCU, but the success of recent video game movies at least seems more replicable than that of other sensations like “Oppenheimer” (there's a reason why Paramount barely waited until the weekend was over to announce “The Angry Birds 3,” but Universal still hasn't cleared its summer schedule for a star-studded biopic about Niels Bohr). 

 










It doesn't hurt that video game adaptations also come pre-installed with a more enthusiastic fanbase than movies based on board games and other toys, nor that most of them are reverse-engineered from recognizable fantasy worlds rather than from specific plots, which allows the genre to avoid the tedious fidelity of live-action remakes. Theater etiquette notwithstanding, I'll take a fan servicey moment of recognition like the chicken jockey scene over an entire film that feels like enshittified déjà vu.

All of which is to say that if I were Donna Langley right now, I'd be racing to build out the Super Mario Bros. Cinematic Universe (and using the billions I'd make at the box office to support a full slate of auteur-driven original films because I am a good Warrior of Cinema who would like to see heaven someday). I'd be standing in front of a Powerpoint presentation that maps out our release plans for a “Super Smash Bros.” epic modeled after Jean-Claude Van Damme tournament fighter classics like “Bloodsport,” a “Donkey Kong” comedy about class warfare, and an 150cc “Mario Kart” bonanza that promises to blue shell the “Fast & Furious” franchise into a pit so deep not even Lakitu could ever hope to fish it out. 

Of course, there are only so many beloved video game franchises that lend themselves to that kind of Marvelous thinking — not enough to let Hollywood run these properties into the ground on auto-pilot. With superhero movies slowing down and studios desperate for product, the film industry will likely feel pressured to create video game adaptations faster than they can figure out the safest and least interesting way of doing so. Best case scenario: The creative uncertainty that made video game movies a liability for so long will be complemented — but not replaced — by the urgency with which Hollywood is going to to start making them. 

 










In a lot of cases, that's not going to go well. Despite the fact that Hollywood is throwing a lot more talent and money at these movies than they have in the past, it's possible — probable, even — that many of them will continue to suck as bad as “Hitman” or “Uncharted.” What excites me, after a decade and change of writing virtually the same review for every superhero film that was shoved down our gullets, is my suspicion that these movies will at least have the potential to suck in different and sometimes wildly unexpected ways. 

Of course, if the unique creative freedom that video game movies are still afforded gives me reason to hope that some of them might be worth seeing, it also helps to explain why so many of them have been so bad for so long. As “The Last of Us” showrunner Craig Mazin told me a few years ago: “Movies are not a particularly good medium for video game stories, and it would be folly to try and reproduce the enjoyment of playing them as a passive experience.” (His solution: TV). It's a conundrum that Hollywood has been wrestling with for decades, and — with a few very qualified exceptions — has only been able to solve in the context of high-energy kids fare. 

If the success of “A Minecraft Movie” has broader implications than that of the “Super Mario Bros.” cartoon, however, that's because it was able to create something out of nothing; or, overcoming a challenge similar to the one faced by Amazon's upcoming “The Sims” adaptation, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it was able to create something out of everything. By sledge-hammering a broad comedy from the bones of its source material's singular brand aesthetic, “Minecraft” proved that a high-concept “Barbie” approach can still pay off in the absence of precious resources like wit and vision. To the same end, it also proved that the weakness or non-existence of video game stories, which has vexed screenwriters from “Double Dragon” to “Need for Speed,”  has the potential to be more of a feature than a bug.

 










But the real opportunity for creativity might stem from the adaptations that are rooted in a more specific narrative of atmospheric experience. I'd be lying if I said I've ever felt the need for a “Death Stranding” movie, especially as Hideo Kojima's schlepping simulator was such a cinematic feat to begin with, but my abject inability to picture what A24 and “Pig” director Michael Sarnoski might do with the idea only makes me more excited to see them try. By the same token, I struggle to imagine how Wes Ball's live-action “The Legend of Zelda” movie will be able to capture the transcendent magic of its source material, but that's all the more reason to let him experiment with it. Ditto the “Split Fiction” and “Vampire Survivor” adaptations that Story Kitchen just scooped up the rights to make, or the “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33” adaptation they've already put into motion even though the game itself has still yet to be released. 

None of these films will resemble one another, and — in stark contrast to the various installments of an interconnected superhero franchise — the success of each one won't have a direct impact on the fortunes of the next, even if all of them are bound together by their perceived viability. Mathieu Turi's imminent “Watch Dogs” might have been greenlit because video games have become widely accepted as valid source material, but it will have to stand on its own two feet in a way that “Ant-Man” never did. 

 










Where “Captain America: Winter Soldier” became a punchline for claiming to be a conspiracy thriller, and where “Logan” was mocked for fronting as a Western even though it was very much a superhero saga at heart, the “Portal” movie that J.J. Abrams is flirting with really would have to be a brain-bending piece of hard sci-fi, while any hypothetical “Red Dead Redemption” adaptation could only hope to succeed by actually embodying the cowboy ethos that “Logan” could only glance at in between other obligations. 

As much as video games have struggled to circumvent the reality that most of them boil down to shooting things, video game movies are tethered to so many different genres that it would be impossible to pump them out on the same kind of assembly line that has been clogging theaters with capeshit since 2008. Video game movies aren't held in place by spandex — there's a different kind of flexibility to them, and more room to stretch the movies towards new places. I'm not holding my breath for that to happen, but the remote possibility that it might is enough to make me happy that superheroes aren't going to be seen as multiplex cinema's only saviors anymore, or even as its most powerful allies. After all, a chicken jockey only has a 0.25 percent chance of appearing in “Minecraft” if no chickens are nearby (a fact I definitely knew offhand and didn't have to google “what is the chicken jockey?” in order to find out), but I suppose that's all the more reason for people to buy a ticket and see something the movies have never shown them before.

New Line‘s sci-fi thriller Companion, starring Sophie Thatcher (Yellowjackets) and Jack Quaid (The Boys), will begin streaming globally on Max on Friday, April 18, debuting on HBO linear on Saturday, April 19 at 8:00 p.m. ET. 


	In Companion, written and directed by Drew Hancock (My Dead Ex), Thatcher plays Iris, who joins her boyfriend Josh (Quaid) and friends at a remote lake house, only to discover that she's actually an AI “companion” rented from a tech company. We won't reveal more than that, except to say that Iris doesn't take the revelation lightly.


	The film also stars Lukas Gage (Smile 2), Megan Suri (Never Have I Ever), Harvey Guillén (What We Do in the Shadows), and Rupert Friend (Asteroid City). From the producers of horror hit Barbarian — Raphael Margules, J.D. Lifshitz, Zach Cregger and Roy Lee — its executive producers are Tracy Rosenblum and Jamie Buckner.

	Warner Bros handled the release of the film, which did just ok at the box office, at a worldwide gross of less than $37 million, in spite of strong reviews. Deadline's Pete Hammond called it a “deliciously fun new AI flick” in his review back in January.

	A lot going on in Thursday previews, many of them boosted by early screenings. 


	As we told you last night, Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie crossed $200M after a $7.1M Thursday. It took Minecraft one week to hit that mark versus Illumination/Nintendo/Universal's The Super Mario Bros Movie, which did that figure in five days in 2023, again because it was a Wednesday release leading into Easter weekend. The anticipation is that Minecraft eases by 60% this weekend to about $65M and another No. 1 showing.


	Angel Studios' is calling $2M for its animated biblical movie The King of Kings. That's pure preview money from showtimes starting at 11 a.m. Thursday. There's some high excitement that the movie could have the edge over 20th Century Studios' $60M Rami Malek PG-13 spy movie, The Amateur, after $14.6M presales. We'll see soon if all that cash is for this weekend.

The Amateur did $2M in previews, but that includes early screenings as well as 2 p.m. showtimes yesterday. That's in the range of the previews for Amazon MGM Studios/Miramax's The Beekeeper ($2.4M previews with early screenings, $16.6M 3-day last year) and 20th's own The Creator ($1.6M previews and early screenings, $14M opening in 2023). The pic is launching today in 3,400 theatres, including 400 Imax auditoriums, 300 Premium Large Format screens and 100 D-Box/Motion screens. The 3-day is expected to be north of $12M.

	Universal/Blumhouse's date thriller Drop, starring Meghann Fahy and Brandon Sklenar, posted $730K in previews from 2,600 theaters that began at 1:50 p.m. When you include Monday and Wednesday previews, that rises to $1.4M. Its 3-day is around $6M-$7M. The PG-13 feature is after women 17-34. Drop was made for $11M net before P&A after a robust tax credit from Ireland.


	A24's play for the middle of the country, Warfare, counts $1.16M previews from both early-access and Thursday showtimes that began at 4 p.m. at 2,670 sites. From directors Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, the R-rated Navy SEAL troupe POV movie is expected to come in between $7M-$9M. Warfare cost $20M before P&A.

	The Tony Awards Administration Committee met yesterday in the third of their four Tony eligibility meetings, and while most of the decisions where the usual determinations about what category to place video designs and projections. 


	But one ruling stood out: The fine revival of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross will not compete in the important Lead Actor In A Play slot – Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr will each be considered eligible in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role, the Tony equivalent of a Supporting Actor Oscar.


	The ruling is a bit surprising given that all three names are listed above the show title in the Playbill program's Glengarry Glen Ross credits page, an indication of leading actor status. But the Administration Committee is empowered to deviate from that standard, often at the request of the production

	The Committee does not discuss or explain its decisions. Deadline has reached out to a rep for the play.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Culkin, Odenkirk and Burr play the three main characters in the play: Richard Roma, Shelley Levine and Dave Moss, respectively. A fourth bold-name star of the show is Michael McKean, whose performance of sadsack George Aaronow is a below-the-title role so would would likely automatically go in the featured actor slot, with no input from the committee needed.


	It's certainly not without possibility that all four actors could be competing in the same featured actor category this year. Nominations for the 2025 Tony Awards will be announced on Thursday, May 1. 


	Among the other slightly curious rulings were for Operation Mincemeat, in which a five-person ensemble cast – all listed below the title in Playbill – play numerous characters. The committee decided that David Cumming and Natasha Hodgson will be considered in the leading performer/musical categories. 


	And one more thing: Oscar Wilde could win a Tony Award this year. His 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray will be considered eligible in the Best Play category, and Wilde and the play's adaptor Kip Williams will be considered jointly eligible as co-authors of the dazzling production starring Sarah Snookl.


	The 78th Annual Tony Awards will take place Sunday, June 8 in New York's Radio City Music Hall, airing live on CBS at 8 p.m./ET and 5 p.m.PT. The awards show will also stream on Paramount+ (live and on-demand for Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers, or on-demand for Paramount+ Essential subscribers the day after the special airs)

	President Donald Trump seems perfectly willing to plunge the United States into a full-blown trade war with China, and China is not backing down.


	Trump on Wednesday paused many of the most extreme tariffs he announced last week, but jacked up the tax on Chinese goods. The White House said on Thursday that the effective tariff rate against China is now 145 percent. In response, China has bumped up their own retaliatory tariffs against U.S. imports to 125 percent — and any gains made by financial markets since Trump announced his 90-day pause are being wiped out as the long-brewing tensions between the two economic powers look ready to explode.


	Retaliatory tariffs are not the only economic lever China is pulling. Earlier this week, China slapped restrictions on exporting rare earth minerals to the United States, a supply chain it controls almost entirely. On Thursday, the Chinese commerce ministry slapped economic restrictions on 18 major manufacturers and defense companies in the U.S. 

	











	According to a Friday report from CNN, White House officials in communication with China had warned them against attempting to retaliate against the president's punitive tariffs — and should sit down to negotiate. Instead of asking China to talk, White House officials reportedly instructed their Chinese counterparts to have Chinese President Xi Jinping request a phone call with Trump. No request, or call, ever came. 


	Major American companies are scrambling to react to massive tax increases on their day-to-day sales and operations. On Friday Tesla — the flagship company of Elon Musk — removed the “order” button on its China website for the Model S and Model X. Both cars are manufactured in the United States and exported to China. 


	One of the companies most at risk in the intensifying trade war is another emblem of American technology and innovation: Apple. Around 90 percent of iPhones are assembled by Foxconn in China, which also manufactures products for Amazon, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony. According to an estimate from Evercore ISI, over half of Apple's Mac computer products and 80 percent of iPads are also assembled in China.

	Markets once again balked on Friday, continuing the roller coaster of a week for investors. Despite Trump's decision to pull the plug on most reciprocal tariffs while he “negotiates” deals with interested nations, the effective tariff rate for imports is even higher than it was before the pause on Wednesday, mostly due to the jacked up tax on imports from China, America's third-largest trading partner.

	











	Even more worrisome is the volatility in the typically stable U.S. bond market. On Friday morning, the 10-year yield surpassed 4.5 percent, a concerning sign that the Trump administration's move to pump the breaks on their tariff regime has not reassured major holders of the U.S. debt. 


	According to a study from Yale's Budget Lab, Trump's tariffs — as they stood on Thursday — would cost the average household about $4,700 a year. Clothing and textile prices would be significantly affected, spiking up to 67 percent in the short run. Unemployment would rise, GDP would drop, and businesses both large and small would take massive hits.

	With every percentage point that Trump hikes up the tariffs, things would get worse. Nevertheless, the president insisted on Friday that he and his administration is “doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY.  Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly.” 


	Things are moving quickly, in a downward line.

Mariah Carey has officially been free for two decades — and to celebrate, she's dropping an expansive collection of music packaged in a five-disc The Emancipation of Mimi (20th Anniversary Edition).


	As announced on Instagram Friday (April 11) — one day shy of the exact 20-year anniversary of the vocalist's enduring 2005 record — Carey has personally compiled a suite of songs from the Emancipation era into one sleek five-LP vinyl box set arriving May 30 via Def Jam Records/UMe. Featuring the original tracklist of hits including “It's Like That,” “We Belong Together,” “Shake It Off,” “Say Somethin,'” “Fly Like a Bird” and “Get Your Number,” the special edition will also house dozens of bonus tracks, past remixes and collaborations with other artists, instrumentals, a capella takes, live recordings and more.

	











The Emancipation of Mimi (20th Anniversary Edition) will also include tracks from the previously released Ultra Platinum Edition — including “Don't Forget About Us,” “Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do),” “Secret Love” and “Sprung” — as well as brand new remixes and collaborations. One of those remixes, Kaytranada's version of “Don't Forget About Us,” dropped Friday as part of the anniversary project's announcement.

	“I'm really happy to celebrate ‘Mimi's Emancipation' with this special anniversary re-release,” Carey said in a statement. “While working on this edition, I got to relive all the memories from this pivotal moment in my personal and professional life.” 


	Released April 12, 2005, The Emancipation of Mimi marked Carey's 10th studio album, and a pivotal comeback moment in her career. Spending two weeks atop the Billboard 200, the project won three Grammys and spawned one of the longest-running Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits of all time, the 14-week leader “We Belong Together.”


	The new anniversary edition will further celebrate that era of the vocalist's career with a 28-page booklet of photos of Mimi, along with a personal letter she penned to her Lambs. A deluxe 2-LP vinyl set will also be available. An extended digital deluxe version of the suite will also be available on May 30 featuring additional tracks exclusive to streaming services.


	“This album has some of my biggest hits to date, as well as some personal favorites that are very special to me,” Carey added. “Forgotten gems, unreleased bonus tracks and different remixes with incredible collaborators — all of these and more are now available in one place for the first time ever!”

Are we having fun yet? It's time to rally for another spin 'round the Executive Turntable, Billboard's weekly compendium of promotions, hirings, exits and firings — and all things in between — across the music business. There's been a whole mess of news this week, so let's get to it.


Madison Square Garden Entertainment appointed David Collins as executive vice president and chief financial officer, effective April 14. Collins will oversee all financial functions at MSG Entertainment, including financial planning and analysis, controllership, treasury, investor relations, tax and procurement, reporting directly to executive chairman and CEO James L. Dolan. MSG Entertainment's portfolio includes Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall and the Beacon Theatre in NYC, and the Chicago Theatre in take-a-guess. With over 30 years of experience, Collins brings expertise across live entertainment, sports, energy, transportation and restaurant industries. He previously served as CFO and EVP at Harris Blitzer Sports and Entertainment, managing finance, accounting, analytics, and ticket operations for the Prudential Center, Philadelphia 76ers, and New Jersey Devils. Collins also held c-suite roles at Base Entertainment and began his career as a CPA at Ernst & Young. Dolan expressed confidence in Collins's broad financial experience, particularly in live entertainment and sports, as MSG Entertainment advances key initiatives and long-term goals.


Danny Buch, a promo veteran with decades under his belt who helped break artists from Stone Temple Pilots to Brandi Carlile plus a fair share of “hair” (bands), announced he has departed Sony Music after a 20-year run at two of the label's indie distribution arms and is launching his own shop, Danny Buch Promotion. Until recently, Buch was senior vp of promotion at Sony's The Orchard, where he worked artists like BTS, Kelsea Ballerini, Walk off the Earth, Jack White and Bad Bunny at radio. Pre-Orchard, he helped pioneer independent artist promotion by launching RED Distribution's promo arm in 2005 and stayed there until Sony merged RED into Orchard, starting in 2017. (The RED name was retired later.) During his RED days, Buch helped break Phoenix, Ingrid Michaelson, Alabama Shakes and more indie darlings. But before he saw RED, Buch clocked 25 years at Warner, where he played an integral role in Atlantic Records' promotion department between 1980 and 2004. Co-heading promo for much of his tenure, Buch lead efforts on behalf of Atlantic giants like AC/DC, INXS, Rush, Genesis, Led Zeppelin, CSNY, Hootie & the Blowfish, STP and more. In the mid-to-late 1980s he broke a chunk of hair/glam metal hits of the day, given Atlantic was home to RATT, Skid Row, White Lion, Winger, Twisted Sister and more. On his next chapter, Buch said: “In launching my new venture, I recognize the opportunity to tap into my years of relationships, in helping both artists & labels. I'm excited about the incredible prospects that lie ahead.” Contact: dbuchmail@gmail.com

IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast had a very special guest this week, live in New York City, with Christine Vachon. The producer at Killer Films, which she runs with Pamela Koffler, has Celine Song's “Materialists” (A24, June 13) coming up after the success of Song's “Past Lives,” which also earned Vachon her first Oscar nomination, for Best Picture. Vachon has helped steer the careers of Todd Haynes, Todd Solondz, and more filmmakers we love throughout a career dating back to Todd Haynes' Sundance-bracing queer triptych “Poison” in 1991.

 










Joining IndieWire “Screen Talk” co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio in-person at Film at Lincoln Center and MoMA's New Directors/New Films, Vachon previewed Song's new film (which co-stars Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal) and mused about the state of moviegoing: “It's not so much people aren't going; there's nothing for people to see,” Vachon said.

“One of the things I love about ‘Past Lives,' and one of the reasons I think it was successful, is everybody thinks it's about them,” Vachon said. “I introduced Celine to Steven Spielberg at that Academy lunch, and Steven said, ‘”Past Lives!” That's about me and my wife,' and then proceeded to tell me a story, which a lot of people tell me, which is ‘I almost did this, and then I did that. This is the person I ended up with.' Almost everyone has a tale that is the road that they could've taken, and they didn't, which is part of the many things that make it appealing.”

Another film Killer has coming up is “Late Fame,” directed by Kent Jones with Willem Dafoe and Greta Lee, another “Past Lives” alum. 

Vachon also talked about Sean Baker and Brady Corbet's recent frankness about how indie filmmakers struggle to make a living. “It's directors, and it's producers,” Vachon said, “and I would say at least directors are protected, to a certain degree, by their union, by the DGA. I'm not disparaging at all what Brady's saying because I know that directors give up an enormous amount to get movies like ‘The Brutalist' done.” (Killer also executive-produced Corbet's Oscar winner.) 

She added, “If a director is putting what they have on the table or on the line, it is typical for us to do the same thing… we're at a moment in independent film which feels extremely disruptive. Character-driven dramas are essentially not being made by the studios at all… It would never occur to me to see a ‘Minecraft' movie. And I assume that's what it's going to be: ‘Minecraft' movies.”

 










Earlier in this week's episode, we also break down the 2025 Cannes Film Festival lineup, which includes new films from Spike Lee, Ari Aster, Kelly Reichardt, and more.

Mariah Carey‘s Emancipation of Mimi will celebrate a milestone anniversary this weekend, marking 20 years since its April 12, 2005, release. The musician kicked off the party early last year with an expansive Las Vegas residency in celebration of the album. But now she's keeping it going with The Emancipation of Mimi (20th Anniversary Edition) and an additional digital deluxe edition, both set for release on May 30


	“I'm really happy to celebrate ‘Mimi's Emancipation' with this special anniversary re-release,” Carey shared in a statement. “While working on this edition, I got to relive all the memories from this pivotal moment in my personal and professional life. This album has some of my biggest hits to date, as well as some personal favorites that are very special to me. Forgotten gems, unreleased bonus tracks and different remixes with incredible collaborators – all of these and more are now available in one place for the first time ever!”


The physical version of the anniversary edition will include a 45-track 5LP box set including recent live performances of Emancipation of Mimi tracks, a cappella renditions, instrumentals, and unreleased cuts, including “When I Feel It,” which was leaked online in 2005 but never released due to sample clearance hiccups. It will appear on Side J along with the Esentrik remix of “It's Like That,” the Kaytranada remix of “Don't Forget About Us,”— which is out now — and the medley of “Don't Forget About Us” and “We Belong Together” that Carey performed at the American Music Awards in 2024.

	











	“When you sit down and go through the whole Emancipation of Mimi as an album, and go, ‘Some of these songs were a little bit more that way or a little bit more this way,' it's just really interesting,” Carey told Rolling Stone last year as she prepared to kick off her Las Vegas residency. “I love the album so much that it's hard to pick it apart and go, ‘Oh, I like this part less than I like that part.' It really is one unit.”

	The more time she spends with the album over the years, Carey said, the more she loves it. “Certain songs that I really didn't get a chance to perform very much — like ‘I Wish You Knew,' ‘Your Girl,' and ‘Circles' — we kind of made medleys out of a lot of these songs,” she said. “That album just ended up being my favorite body of work that I've done.”

	











	An a capella version of “Circles” will be featured on the anniversary release, as well as an a capella version of “Shake It Off” and an instrumental for “We Belong Together.” Carey launched an official website for the release that pays homage to her early 2000s fan site, a nod to the fans who have been with her for decades. “There's just something about that time period and about everything that went into my work, my music, and my life at that time that really is the essence of who I am,” she said.

Cross Canadian Ragweed sized up the expectations — months of comeback hype, a stadium filled with fans doing the wave, a five-band lineup of Red Dirt icons, and an introduction by Oklahoma State University football coach Mike Gundy — and then made a collective decision to blow right past them.


	The Oklahoma four-piece credited with laying the groundwork for today's soaring popularity of Red Dirt music capped a layoff of nearly 15 years on Thursday night with a blistering two-and-a-half-hour comeback concert at Boone Pickens Stadium in Stillwater — the town where they got their start and paid their dues 30 years ago.


	“It seems like it was a really long time ago, and not six or seven months ago, that we were talking about how we were gonna do this,” frontman Cody Canada told the sold-out crowd of more than 45,000. “Now we're here. We fucking did it.”


	Ragweed followed a scorching set from their co-headliners, Turnpike Troubadours, who announced a surprise new album onstage, plus shows from the Great Divide, Jason Boland and the Stragglers, and Stoney LaRue, at the first of a four-night concert event dubbed “The Boys From Oklahoma.”

	











	Canada, along with rhythm guitarist Grady Cross, bassist Jeremy Plato, and drummer Randy Ragsdale, spent the weeks ahead of the concert raking in accolades like an induction into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame and the Icon Award from Texas Music & Radio Awards. On Thursday night, they turned the fervor on its head with what might well go down as the most memorable concert in the state's history.


	In early October, Ragweed confirmed this reunion in an interview with Rolling Stone. In the eight months since, the four members have spoken to me in more than a dozen interviews — for this story and for a book chronicling their return, Never Say Never, which will recap all four concerts and is set for release on April 21.


	From the start, the scale of the shows never actually set in with Canada. For all the credit Ragweed get for exposing the world to Red Dirt, the group spent the arc of its career as a bar band. Canada's current band, the Departed — featuring Canada, Plato, and drummer Eric Hansen — is still a bar band. Coming back, suddenly, as a stadium act is hard to comprehend for the Ragweed frontman.

	“We got into Stillwater on Monday night, and kind of had the keys to the kingdom,” Canada tells Rolling Stone ahead of the show. “We walked around everywhere, and man, you can look at it all you want to on a piece of paper, but good Lord, it's big. I've been to so many shows like this, but I've never done it.”


	A year ago, such conversations would have been unfathomable, and the idea of a reunion residency at such a scale would have been laughable. Ragweed's final show, in October 2010 at Joe's Sports Bar in Chicago, capped a year of internal turmoil that left hard feelings and bitterness in the band. In February 2024, Canada — again speaking to RS — emphatically ruled out a comeback.


	In truth, however, the notion had been on Canada's mind for nearly two years. He saw the reaction to Turnpike's 2022 reunion after a three-year break, and social media comments suggesting that Ragweed should be next. Jon Folk — agent for both Ragweed and the Departed, as well as Turnpike — had steadily fielded offers since Ragweed broke up, but he began receiving ones that crept into life-altering territory. Canada started running the idea of a comeback past his peers: Robert Earl Keen told him to take a victory lap; Great Divide frontman Mike McClure, whose own band once broke up for nearly a decade, told Canada he'd feel like a weight had been lifted.

	“To be able to reconcile that, and to think about how happy this is going to make their fans,” McClure says, “I really can't believe it.”


	Felker echoes McClure's sentiment but is quick to point out that Ragweed were gone a lot longer than Turnpike. That time away, he says, created an aura around the band which contributed to the frenzy surrounding their return.


	“Theirs is very different than ours,” Felker says. “They're almost mythical to us, to people who are my age and a little older who were there. They sort of sum up a generation. To see them get to come back like this, at some of the biggest shows in Oklahoma that have ever happened, it's fucking insane.”


	The path to the stage on Thursday night, in hindsight, was less of a road and more of a tightrope. With the exception of Plato, who says of a comeback, “I always thought it was bound to happen,” the tightrope began at OSU. Right about when Canada was swearing off a comeback, Darren Shrum was dreaming big. At the time, the university president was Kayse Shrum; Darren is her husband. In early 2024, he thought bringing concerts to OSU's athletic facilities would help fill a need for name, image, and likeness money for the program. He tells Rolling Stone now that he ran the idea past Kayse. “She said, ‘Go for it,'” Darren recalls.

	











	But Darren Shrum was focusing on Gallagher-Iba, Oklahoma State's 13,000-seat basketball arena, not the massive Boone Pickens stadium. However, when he took the idea to Kyle Waters, the university's athletic director for facilities, Waters, who once worked for Coachella, responded by sharing a years-old proposal he had made for a concert at Boone Pickens.


	With permission to move forward, Darren — along with Waters and director of football business Kenyatta Wright, a former Oklahoma State and NFL player who is close with Turnpike — started brainstorming. They wanted a country show to be first and contacted Russell Doussan, whose company, Doussan Music Group, is currently producing and promoting Alan Jackson's Last Call Tour. With Doussan's help, OSU put out an offer for a concert featuring Jason Aldean and Miranda Lambert, but more than a month passed without an answer.


	That's when Waters suggested Ragweed. “I said, ‘Can they fill the stadium?' And Kyle said, ‘I don't know, but I think so,'” Darren tells Rolling Stone. “So I said, ‘We're gonna push forward.'”


	They contacted Folk, who contacted Canada. This time, the idea of a comeback stopped Canada cold.


	“I think there were some unresolved feelings around when and how the band split up,” Folk says. “All the guys in the band had regrets over how that chapter ended. I've always found that in life that time heals all wounds. If you were around back in the Ragweed era, you know how much fun their show was and how much happiness it brought to everyone in the room. 


	“Ultimately,” Folk continues, “I think after years of arguing with himself, Cody woke up one day and said, ‘I'm tired of being upset about this, and I'm going to do something about it.' He told me, ‘If the guys are up for it, I'd love to add some more chapters to our story.'”


	Folk reached out to Cross and Ragsdale separately. But Cross's mind didn't go to Ragweed; rather, he thought of his kids. His daughter, Charlie, and son, Slaid, were young when the band broke up. Slaid is 19 now and plays guitar in a hard-driving country band called the Smokin Oaks. Canada has two sons, Dierks and Willy, in their late teens. They play in Waves in April, a metalcore band based in New Braunfels, Texas.


	Cross saw a chance for the band to show their children what their old men were capable of together.


	“We were gone a lot, and when we broke up, we went home and raised our kids,” Cross says. “Instagram wasn't around when we played. They never got to see what we were like. This really is everything.”

	











	Cross and Ragsdale said yes, and a deal was made. Immediately, the ticket presale window revealed a massive demand for a Ragweed concert. One night became four nights, without a general public on sale ever happening.


	“I am still in the ‘is this real' mode,” Doussan says. “Being in the business for almost 31 years, and having worked with many ‘level A' artists and massive events, I have never been a part of something so explosive.”


	In early November, Kayse Shrum invited Ragweed to Oklahoma State's homecoming football game as the guests of honor. The Departed always play a concert the night before OSU's homecoming in the parking lot of Eskimo Joe's — Stillwater's longtime bellwether bar. At that concert, the four members spoke as a group for the first time in more than a decade. Canada and Cross hugged, and Cross joined the Departed onstage at Eskimo Joe's to play guitar. The next day, the band and their families took in the football game from Shrum's suite.


	One of the family members in the suite was JC Ragsdale — Randy's son, who was born in 1999 with a form of epilepsy called Lennox Gastaut Syndrome. He used a wheelchair and was limited in his speech, and Canada delighted in embracing him, crying to himself when he saw JC taking in the scene.


	“When Cody said yes, I could see a weight had been lifted in his eyes,” says Shannon Canada, Cody's wife and Ragweed's manager. “At homecoming, when I saw him with Grady and Randy, it didn't feel like 15 years had passed. That's when Ragweed really was back.”


	Less than a month later, JC Ragsdale died. The band was devastated, but it put the members in a position of comforting Ragsdale and one another. After the funeral, Ragweed resolved: This comeback is for JC.


	“You cherish a lot of the simple things that a lot of people take for granted,” Ragsdale says of JC. “You pay attention to what matters, and you just fucking learn how to soften up and have a heart, because some people have a hard fight just to get through the day. One little thing that you might think is small might mean the whole world to someone else. I didn't realize what an impact Ragweed had on my own son until I came home. For the last 15 years, he was just watching videos of us over and over again.”


	With a renewed friendship and a clear-cut motivation to set the bar for the Red Dirt concerts, Ragweed spent the end of 2024 and early 2025 rehearsing relentlessly — usually in Fort Worth at the studio belonging to Vaden Todd Lewis of the Toadies. They let Folk, Doussan, and Shannon Canada work out the details of the concert.

	











	As city, Stillwater found itself in an unprecedented position. The town's population is just over 49,000 — roughly the same number of tickets sold for each night of the Boys From Oklahoma concerts. Stan Clark founded Eskimo Joe's 50 years ago and still oversees the company that runs it. His establishment is the most-recognizable bar and restaurant in Oklahoma. Still, he says this week is a new experience for everybody with an interest in Stillwater or OSU.


	“Over 180,000 tickets sold,” Clark says. “I can't even get my arms around what that's going to look like or feel like. We've never had it. We've had game days, but that's one-and-done. We've never had four in a row.”


	By the time Ragweed stepped off the tightrope and into the spotlight Thursday night, the concert had already cemented its place in Red Dirt lore. LaRue kicked the night off and chose “Oklahoma Breakdown” — the Mike Hosty-penned river tune that was the top-selling single in Texas music in 2007 — to set the tone. Boland followed with a set heavy on the songs he wrote when he lived in this town such as “Pearl Snaps” and “Proud Souls.” The Great Divide led off the third set with “College Days,” which McClure wrote about Stillwater.


	When the Turnpike Troubadours are in their element, they are one of the hardest bands in country music to follow. On Thursday night, they were in their element. The co-headliners played a stomping, high-energy show for 70 minutes with a set list filled with enough Turnpike standards that effectively dared Ragweed to try to top it.


	“How does it feel to be a part of the biggest night in Oklahoma music ever?” Felker asked the crowd. “All of the bands on this stage are the reason we get to do this. I've had a lot of great nights in my life, but this is the best one ever.”


	Ultimately, though, the night belonged to the garage band from Stillwater, and Ragweed played an hour longer than their planned set time. At one point, Canada pleaded with event organizers from the mic, “Y'all, don't shut us off! We haven't played a show in 16 fucking years.”


	Ragweed didn't just burn through their catalog, though. They laid bare for all in attendance the driving forces behind their comeback. The children whose own musical pursuits spurred the reunion all made it onstage, highlighted by Charlie Cross, who stepped to center stage with a harmonica to kick off the event's title song, “Boys From Oklahoma,” that brought the loudest roar of the night.

	











	There was also a steady stream of special guests. Dierks Bentley joined to sing his favorite Ragweed song, “42 Miles.” Felker sat in for a verse of “Brooklyn Kid,” Boland did the same on “17,” and Wade Bowen sang “Constantly.” Before kicking off “Carney Man” — the kitschy circus tune Canada and McClure wrote that put Ragweed on the map in the late 1990s — Canada smirked to the crowd, “This is what you wanted!”


	The night ended with a cover of Reckless Kelly's “Crazy Eddie's Last Hurrah,” with Willy and Cody Braun from Reckless contributing on vocals and mandolin, respectively. The song itself is a fictional tale about a murder of passion, but fans sang the final chorus loudly and clearly, as though the lyrics were plausible to at least a few.


	Then, Ragweed walked off the stage. Spouses, children, and fellow artists met all four men at the end of the stage with a mix of laughter and tears, along with an endless line of hugs. Canada cut through the euphoria just long enough to put the evening into words.

After three years together, Ally Lewber ended her relationship with “Vanderpump Rules” star James Kennedy after he was arrested for domestic violence. A month after the arrest, Kennedy revealed that he was sober and had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.

With the changes he is making, Nick Viall asked Lewber on “The Vial Files” if she would ever consider getting back together with Kennedy. Lewber expressed that while she will always love and support him, it's time for her to move on. 

“I honestly do have so much love for James that I want him to genuinely heal and get better and I want him to find love. I really do,” Lewber said. “And I don't think that will be with me. I feel like there's just been too much that's gone down. I think I would always be on edge or wondering what if.” 

“And it's hard because I'd love to support him and do that, but I just can't,” she added. “I haven't really thought about this to be honest.”

A post shared by Ally Lewber (@allylewber)

In December 2024, Burbank police took Kennedy into custody on suspicion of misdemeanor domestic violence, per TMZ. However, in January, his lawyer announced that “no charges will be filed against James Kennedy,” in a statement to CNN.  

Following the news, Lewber posted on her Instagram story, expressing that she was “happy” Kennedy would not face criminal charges. 

“I am happy that prosecutors decided not to file James, as I never desired criminal charges,” Lewber wrote. “We had an argument outside of his home related to him drinking again, however, I was not physically hurt. I was shocked by the headlines and disheartened by how the event was portrayed.”

“We are no longer together, but I will always support James and wish him the best with his sobriety and healing,” Lewber added.

During her time on the “Viall Files” podcast that aired on April 9, Lewber also revealed that Lisa Vanderpump reached out to her following Kennedy's arrest. While she did check in to see how Lewber was doing, Vanderpump also tried to convince her to stay with him.

“She called me, and she did make sure, like, ‘Are you OK?' I mean, this was, like, two months later, but she called and made sure… maybe a month? I don't know. Certainly not the next day,” Lewber said on the podcast. “But she called and checked in on me.”

“She's very protective over James,” she added. “And I get it because I was too for a long time.”

Lewber detailed exactly what Vanderpump said to try and get her to stay with Kennedy.  

“She was basically like, ‘Ally, he needs you. You're really good together,” Lewber recalled. “She was like, ‘You should go travel with him to his [DJ] shows this weekend.' I'm like, ‘First of all, what shows? He's canceled right now. And also, no? I just moved into an apartment. We're not together.'”

“It was really weird because, on the call, I was weak in the moment,” she continued. However, after asking herself if she “made the wrong decision” by breaking up with him, she spoke to her friends who confirmed that she did the right thing.

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Pitt” finale — Season 1, Episode 15, “9:00 p.m.”]

At the end of a backbreaking, soul-shaking hospital shift, it's only fitting for Dr. Robby (Noah Wyle) to rally the troops. “Today should never have happened,” he says, as the weary doctors, nurses, and medical staffers gather around. “Such a horrific act is the worst of humanity. But it brought out the best in the rest of us.”

During his two-minute tribute, Dr. Robby — who's suffering from acute existential exhaustion on top of the day's extra-fine grind — falls back on a handful of cliches. He peppers his pick-me-up with terms like “better angels” and shares his pride in each of them for “rising to the occasion.” Near the end, he can't hold back his tears and encourages the rest of them to do the same. “It's just grief,” he says, “leaving the body.”

Dr. Robby's words mean a lot. Seeing a leader actually step up and lead is a rarity these days, and Wyle's blend of inspiration and vulnerability prove potent. They may even end up bringing Dana (Katherine LaNasa) back to Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center, as the charge nurse considers if this should be her last tour of duty.

But they're not the defining words of “The Pitt” finale. 

Those belong to Robby's friend and colleague, Dr. Jack Abbott (Shawn Hatosy). While he isn't around for the bulk of his buddy's 15-hour day, Jack shows up when it counts, in more ways than one. The night attending clocks in during the mass casualty situation (set off by a shooter at Pitt Fest), and then steps up on the roof, next to Dr. Robby, when the bedraggled doc can't stop blaming himself for falling short of his own impossible expectations.

“I broke,” Robby says.  “I shut down. The moment everybody needed me the most, I wasn't there. I couldn't do it. I choked.” 

The grace he gives to his coworkers is notably absent from Robby's brutal self-assessment. He doesn't believe he rose to the occasion. He doesn't feel proud of all the lives he saved. He only remembers the ones he didn't. The same drive and vision that allowed him to successfully lead the treatment of 106 out of 112 patients won't allow for a few minutes of personal human frailty.

But that's all they were — a few minutes, in a shift that stretched on for more than 15 hours. With a little distance, Robby might be able to see the utility he offered during 95 percent of his shift vastly outweighs the 5 percent when he felt useless. It's just hard to step back when you've been in the middle of it for so long, a perspective “The Pitt” excels at crafting throughout its unrelenting, real-time first season.

 










But that's not really what's bugging him. What's bugging him is that it happened before, during COVID, it happened today, in the aftermath of a mass shooting, and that means it will likely happen again. How long will it last then? Who will he lose next time? What's he supposed to do, living with the belief that he's destined to disappoint himself?

Well, he's supposed to recognize his own limitations, as one man in a world of billions, and when he can't do that — for all the reasons outlined above — Jack does it for him. When Robby says he broke, he choked, he failed, Jack is there to tell him, in no uncertain terms, “So fucking what?”

“That is what happens when you're in a war and nothing makes sense,” Jack says. “We survived as a species because we learned how to cooperate and communicate. So when we're in the middle of killing each other, it defies the very logic of our existence. Your brain starts to short-circuit. All you can do is focus on the medicine. The medicine is the only thing that saves the patient — and your sanity.”

The medicine is the only thing that saves the patient, and the medicine is the only thing that saves the doctor. It sounds so simple, and for as blunt as Dr. Abbott is in that moment, he still knows it's not an easy idea to accept. He knows from experience. 

 










At the start of Robby's shift, Jack talks about spending two hours trying to resuscitate a dying veteran. When he couldn't do it, he wrote a note to his family. Clearly, veterans are a personal priority for him. Later, in the park, Jack removes his prosthetic leg, and the implication is that he's been to war — actual war — and it's given him the perspective needed to know what Robby is going through. 

Despite Robby's ball-busting complaints about his speechifying, Jack doesn't just bullshit his way through his friend's crisis. Always the doctor, he speaks directly to what's ailing him. 

In doing so, he also speaks directly to what's made “The Pitt” a minor streaming sensation. Beyond playing spot the nepo baby and guessing “How'd they do that?” during graphic operations, beyond the nostalgia for well-mounted broadcast-style medical dramas and the nostalgia for “E.R.” specifically (which Wyle wearing scrubs can't help but evoke), what the first season of R. Scott Gemmill and John Wells' Max drama offers is medicine — medicine for the broken, burned-out mind. 

What Jack describes to Robby is a situation they both lived through. It's what happened to them, that day, at the hospital. But it's also what's happening all around us, every day, especially in 2025. We are surrounded by war and genocide, environmental catastrophes and unlawful deportations, economic collapse and more mass shootings. Most of us aren't witnessing these events first-hand, in the way these doctors did with the Pitt Fest victims, but we are still witnesses to unfathomable attacks on humanity. If you try to take it all in, all at once or one tragedy after the next, your brain will short-circuit, too. The only way to survive is focus on one single thing that makes sense.

 










“The Pitt” offers its viewers that one single thing. After a long day of work, school, childcare, volunteering, organizing, protesting, and everything else you do to engage with the world you want to make better, “The Pitt” is an utterly absorbing experience that commands your full attention. It's the break your brain needs from the things that are breaking your brain. It's the medicine, and you're the patient. 

Other TV shows, movies, and various forms of entertainment can offer the same physic remedy, and there's also the risk that distracting yourself from reality becomes so addictive that you get permanently lost. But that's part of makes “The Pitt” such a smart choice. It's a show that appreciates a strong work ethic. It respects the commitment its characters are making, as well as the actual dedication of the doctors they represent. It makes it hard to detach completely — what with all the talk about real-world issues like health insurance, vaccines, and, oh yeah, mass shootings — but it beckons you so smoothly into its world that your time there still feels like time off. 

That's not a feeling you can get from second-screen TV. You're not going to feel like you've escaped our current hellscape after spending two hours doom-scrolling with one eye and tracking plot-points with the other. “The Pitt,” despite persistent flaws (that could mostly be fixed before Season 2), knows how to earn your attention. It knows it needs to earn your attention, and it knows you need it to earn your attention. 

 










Maybe that's a little convoluted. Maybe it's lending a TV show a little too much control over my mental health. Maybe I should take Dr. Robby's advice and stop talking.

…you get what I'm saying, though, right?

“The Pitt” Season 1 is available on Max. The series has already been renewed for Season 2.

"I wanted it to mean something," the actress tells Billboard of releasing her first song in two years.

	Hannah Dailey



	Earlier this week, the soundtrack for Ryan Coogler's highly anticipated thriller Sinners was announced — with one gap in the tracklist that simply said, “coming soon.” Now, Billboard can exclusively announce that the slot will be filled with an original song titled “Dangerous” by star of the film Hailee Steinfeld, whose contribution to the album marks her first music release in two years.  


	Arriving April 18 along with the rest of the Sinners soundtrack — which drops the same day the movie premieres in theaters — “Dangerous” finds the Academy Award nominee singing over a tribal drum beat and eerie production that blends in with Ludwig Göransson's genre-bending, Delta-blues-infusing score for the film. Of penning the tension-filled lyrics with the composer and cowriter Sarah Aarons, Steinfeld tells Billboard, “We were all so tuned into the vision, and because I was both inside the story as an actor, and helping shape it through music, it created this really fluid creative loop.”

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	“Blending music and acting like this feels like the fullest expression of who I am,” she continues. “It's rare to have a project that lets you show up completely — and Sinners gave me that.”


	Also starring Michael B. Jordan as twins Smoke and Stack who return to their hometown post-WWI to find that a great evil is waiting for them there, Sinners features the Edge of Seventeen actress as Mary, a married woman who has “unfinished business” with the latter brother. In addition to “Dangerous,” the film's soundtrack features contributions from Rod Wave, James Blake, Don Toliver, Lars Ulrich, Brittany Howard and more stars.


	“Lyrically, I wanted to tap into Mary's deep desire to be with Stack and (maybe selfishly) not always acknowledging what a dangerous position that puts them in,” Steinfeld says of “Dangerous,” a snippet of which Billboard is premiering below. “That sort of unrequited love. There's a vulnerability in these characters that I really connected with, and I wanted my voice to reflect that.”


	Steinfeld last released music two years ago, dropping “SunKissing” and “Coast” featuring Anderson .Paak in April 2023. “Dangerous” also comes a full decade after the Pitch Perfect 2 star made her musical debut in 2015 with “Love Myself,” which reached No. 30 on the Billboard Hot 100, after which she shared EP HAIZ later that year.

	











	The singer-actress has also worked on the soundtracks for a number of her past screen projects, including “Afterlife” for Dickinson and “Back to Life” from Bumblebee.


	“Two years might not seem long, but for me, it turned out to be the exact amount of time I needed — to grow, live a little, and step back to reconnect with why I make music in the first place,” says Steinfeld, who got engaged to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen in November, of returning to music after her break. “I didn't want to come back just to fill space. I wanted it to mean something.”


	“There was something so raw and emotional about Sinners that pushed me creatively and personally,” she adds. “The music became an extension of that. It felt honest and it felt like me again. I wouldn't call this a comeback — it's about returning to the truth, and I'm so grateful to Ryan and Sinners for giving me the opportunity to do that.”


Sinners hits theaters April 18. Check out a snippet of Steinfeld's “Dangerous” for the soundtrack below.

Tennis have announced that their new album, Face Down in the Garden, will also be their last. Alongside the single “12 Blown Tires,” Patrick Riley and Alaina Moore have shared the news that they will go on indefinite hiatus after a farewell tour of North America. Below, listen to “12 Blown Tires” and check out the tracklist for Face Down in the Garden.

“After finishing Face Down in the Garden, it became clear that we had said everything we wanted to say and achieved everything we wanted to achieve with our band,” Moore said in an accompanying press statement. “This will be our last studio album, at least in this configuration as Tennis. We are ready to pursue other creative projects and to make space in our lives for new things.” Scroll down to read her full note.

Riley and Moore met as students at the University of Colorado, Denver, and formed Tennis in 2010 after an eight-month sailboat expedition along the Eastern Seaboard. This trip would inspire the now-married couple's early EPs and debut album, 2011's Cape Dory, which attracted a fanbase with its retro-leaning, Brill Building– and psychedelic pop–inspired sound. The duo released five more studio albums—2012's Young and Old, 2014's Ritual in Repeat, 2017's Yours Conditionally, 2020's Swimmer, and 2023's Pollen—with songs like “Origins” and “In the Morning I'll Be Better” becoming modern indie-pop staples. “Their music, as heard here on their full-length debut, touches on tide patterns and shifting winds and sandbars scraping beneath hulls,” Mark Richardson wrote in his review of Cape Dory. “It also emphasizes the essential romance of the whole adventure—that they went through it all together. Above all, Tennis strive to evoke an unnamed but certainly more innocent past.”

Face Down in the Garden is out April 25 via Tennis' own label, Mutually Detrimental. Next month, Riley and Moore will also release the rarities compilation Neutral Poetry: First Recordings, Unreleased Demos 2009-2010, which will feature early versions of songs from their debut album and previously unheard tracks from those sessions. The duo's farewell tour will kick off May 16—also Neutral Poetry's release date—in Las Vegas, and continue through early September. Check out the full list of dates below.

Alaina Moore:

On a cross-country drive at the end of tour, our van and trailer blew four tires in quick succession. That particular stretch of highway was a tire graveyard. I counted the shredded remains of 12 tires from where we sat on the side of the road, swapping out our last spare. Our bad luck was heavily contrasted by the good night we'd just had in Houston. The highs and lows of touring are unnatural, disorienting. On the shoulder of I-40, I began writing the lyrics to “12 Blown Tires.” It is a constellation of memories from the road, and of our marriage, two endeavors that are completely, hopelessly entangled.

When we recorded “12 Blown Tires” a few months later, I had the sense of distilling the past 15 years into four minutes of music. It felt like the end of something, though I wasn't sure what. Patrick and I spent most of our twenties and all of our thirties focused on Tennis. It has been the most joyous, bewildering, challenging, and humbling experience. After finishing Face Down in the Garden, it became clear that we had said everything we wanted to say and achieved everything we wanted to achieve with our band. This will be our last studio album, at least in this configuration as Tennis. We are ready to pursue other creative projects and to make space in our lives for new things. In that light, the upcoming tour feels more poignant, like a concluding thought. These two kids from Denver who only ever dreamed of playing a few house shows are very fulfilled. Perhaps we'll see you on the road. As always, thank you.

The cable TV pioneer lauded WBD's "incredible progress," outlook for "profitable growth" and CEO David Zaslav for "his powerful combination of operational excellence and decisive leadership."


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


John Malone‘s role at Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), led by CEO David Zaslav, is getting an update. The entertainment conglomerate on Friday unveiled that the cable TV and telecom pioneer is transitioning from his current role as a director on the company's board of directors to the new role of chair emeritus.


	The move allows Malone, 84, to remain actively involved with the board and serving as a key advisor to Zaslav and his management team, as well as a large shareholder of WBD, but he will lose his board vote and not have to deal with board minutiae anymore.

	The change, unveiled on the same day as the 2024 compensation packages for Zaslav and other top executives, comes into effect with WBD's upcoming annual stockholder meeting where, due to the new role, Malobe will not to stand for re-election as a regular board member. “As chair emeritus, Dr. Malone will continue to regularly attend board meetings and provide strategic counsel and support to the board and management team,” the conglomerate highlighted.


	“It has been a privilege to serve on the Warner Bros. Discovery board and work alongside David and hisexceptional team to help guide the company through an industry-defining merger and its ongoingtransformation,” Malone said. “A constant through this journey has been my long-standing partnership with David, built on deep trust and his powerful combination of operational excellence and decisive leadership.”


	Added Malone: “The board and management team have made incredible progress making the company more resilient, agile, and positioned for profitable growth. I am confident Warner Bros. Discovery is on the right path and I look forward to remaining actively involved, not only as a significant stockholder, but in this important role helping to shape the growth trajectory as the company evaluates important strategic and structural opportunities ahead and as a fan of our world-class assets and the engaging storytelling that set this company apart.”


	Zaslav said Malone “possesses one of the most brilliant strategic minds our industry has ever known,” adding: “His exceptional insights and visionary perspective on the global media landscape and its future have been invaluable to me personally and pivotal in shaping the trajectory and remarkable growth of Discovery and now at Warner Bros. Discovery. Working alongside John has profoundly enriched our ability to navigate complex challenges, seize transformative opportunities, and create lasting value.”

	











	In his new role, “John's unparalleled counsel, deep expertise, and clarity of vision will continue to shape our leadership team and board's decisions as we unlock the full potential of our business,” the CEO emphasized. 


	And Zaslav shared: “The partnership and friendship we've built over more than 30 years has been one of the true joys of my career, and I'm looking forward to continuing this journey with John in this new role.”


	At the end of March, WBD had added private equity and technology veteran Anton Levy to its board of directors amid pressure from the activist hedge fund Sessa Capital, which built a roughly 1 percent stake in the company and pushed WBD to add board members and restructure more quickly. The company had added Anthony Noto and Joey Levin to its board earlier this year.


	With the addition of Levy and Malone's new chair emeritus role, the WBD board will continue to be comprised of 13 directors.


	Said WBD chairman Samuel Di Piazza, Jr.: “John has been instrumental in overseeing the development of Warner Bros. Discovery's strategy and charting our course to navigate the current media landscape. We are fortunate to have the enduring benefit of his unparalleled expertise and insights as he assumes his new role.”

The country hitmaker and British crooner join forces for a folksy new track.


													By
												

	Kyle Denis



	Two of the 2024's biggest breakout stars have lent each other a hand for a new springtime single.


	Five-time Grammy nominee Shaboozey and Brit Award-winning Myles Smith have joined forces for “Blink Twice,” an infectious, folk-inflected track built on twangy finger-picked guitars, pounding drums and raucous stomps and claps. “Oh me, oh my, would you look in my eyes/ We'll laugh or cry just to feel alive/ Oh-woah-woah, no time for living a lie/ Oh-woah-woah, time flies, so don't blink twice,” they sing together in the chorus. The track also arrives alongside a pensive, tear-jerking music video.


	“Blink Twice” marks Shaboozey's first musical release after his blockbuster past year. In addition to his dual appearances on Beyoncé‘s three-time Grammy-winning Cowboy Carter LP, the Billboard cover star scored the longest-running solo Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single of all time with “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” which spent a whopping 17 weeks atop the ranking. While “A Bar Song” continues to hang around the Hot 100's top five — it sits at No. 4 on the chart dated April 12 — “Good News,” which he released last fall, ranks at No. 51, having previously peaked at No. 47.

	Smith, who won the Brit Rising Star Award last month (March 1), also appears on the Hot 100 with his own “Stargazing,” which peaked at No. 19 and spent one week atop Pop Airplay. Earlier this year (Feb. 14), he teamed up with Grammy-winning country star Lainey Wilson for a new version of “Nice to Meet You,” which reached No. 13 on Hot Rock & Alternative Songs.

	This month, Shaboozey will perform at both Coachella (April 11-13, 18-20) and Stagecoach (April 25-27), cementing his status as one of music's biggest crossover acts.

Maroon 5 were one of many artists enlisted to cover The Beatles for a 2014 CBS special.


													By
												

	Tyler Jenke



Maroon 5 vocalist Adam Levine has reflected on Paul McCartney's reaction to his band covering The Beatles on television more than a decade ago.


	Levine's comments were made during his recent appearance on The Howard Stern Show, where he and guitarist James Valentine were discussing a special televised event from February 2014. Broadcast by CBS, The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles was a star-studded performance held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Fab Four's debut on The Ed Sullivan Show.


	Alongside performances from McCartney and Ringo Starr, the event featured the likes of Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, and John Legend and Alicia Keys all covering original Beatles songs. The night opened with Maroon 5, who shared their own renditions of “All My Loving” and “Ticket to Ride.”

	“ I was scared s–tless,” Valentine told Stern of the performance, with Levine adding, “I told you I've been scared a handful of f–king times in my life, that was definitely one of them. “I was like, ‘Holy s–t.' I'm sorry man, but it's just like, you can be too cool, but not always. It's Ringo Star and Paul McCartney. F–k off if you're gonna try and be cool about that. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Afterwards, I see Paul and Paul kind of took me in close and he goes, ‘You know, we did it better,'” Levine remembered while laughing. “I thought it was so funny. And I cracked up and I'm like, ‘Yeah, no s–t, you're Paul McCartney, you're The Beatles.'”


	Levine then added how the interaction took an even stranger turn when McCartney tried to get his attention at a party some months later, using the opportunity to apologize for any bad blood his initial comments may have caused.


	“He's like, ‘Hey man, I just wanted to let you know, if that bothered you, I've been thinking about this, I didn't want to insult you or anything,'” Levine recalled. “It was something like that. Like, ‘If I insulted you, I apologize.' And I'm like, ‘Oh my God. Like, you're good. Dude, you're Paul F–king McCartney.


	“But it kind of shattered in a great way this whole thing about your heroes being who they are,” Levine concluded. “It's like, he's a human being with a beating heart and a really beautiful soul who actually was thoughtful enough to even take into account that maybe for some reason my feelings might have been hurt, but of course they were not.”


	Levine's appearance on The Howard Stern Show wasn't his only big media appearance this week, with Monday night's (April 7) episode of The Tonight Show seeing him confirm that Maroon 5 will be making a musical comeback in 2025

	











	“The rumors are correct. There are details. I cannot divulge all the details,” Levine explained. “But the details are basically, roughly, there's a single coming at the end of the month-ish. I'm really excited about it. An album is coming over the summer. Non-specifically around the summertime. And then, even more non-specifically, there is a tour coming in the fall-ish.”

In a rare move, the Hallmark movie “Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: A Lesson in Murder” will premiere simultaneously on Hallmark Mystery and Hallmark Channel on April 10, 2025. The whodunit starring Skyler Samuels has been exclusively available to stream on Hallmark+ since October, but the joint airing marks the movie's cable TV premiere. 

Candace Cameron Bure starred in the original “Aurora Teagarden” franchise until she left Hallmark for Great American Family in 2022. “A Lesson in Murder” is Samuels' second prequel in the franchise, in which she stars as a younger version of the main character. Doing so, she exclusively told EntertainmentNOW, was a major juggling act. 

The cast and crew of “A Lesson in Murder” primarily filmed the movie in Victoria, British Columbia, per IMDb. But the shoot was a long one — lasting most of March and April 2024 — because they filmed two movies back-to-back. The third prequel, “Death at the Diner,” is currently available to stream via Hallmark+ and will likely make its cable premiere at a later date. 

Complicating matters was the fact that Samuels was a new, first-time mom when she arrived to the set. Before the movies debuted on Hallmark+, she told EntertainmentNOW that she felt like she “stumbled all the way through” filming, juggling her scenes while taking breaks to feed and bond with her little one, whose name and gender she's chosen not to reveal.

Samuels laughed that she was “just a working mom who's, you know, putting the ‘Aurora' wig on and running around solving crimes. But also, like, having to take breaks to go pump and then feed the baby, and then come back to set, and just juggle all these all-day jobs. Mom job, actor job — they're both full-time.” 

A post shared by Jessica Harmon (@jessicanoelleharmon)

Viewers will recognize many familiar faces in “A Lesson in Murder.” The cast includes Marilu Henner, who appeared as Aurora's mom in the original movies with Bure. She returned in 2023 for Samuels' first movie as Aurora Teagarden, “Something New,” and appears in her second and third prequels, too. 

Henner, who's now appeared in more than 20 Hallmark projects, told KTLA in October why she loves working with the network so much. 

“They're the best,” she said. “They're the best people to work for, it's a great set … I was flattered enough that they thought I could play myself in the (“Aurora Teagarden”) prequels, so that's what I'm doing.”

Evan Roderick also returns as a young Arthur after appearing in “Something New” the year before. In the prequels, his character is working as a beat cop, years before he becomes a detective. In the original “Aurora Teagarden” movies, that role was played by Hallmark actor and director Peter Benson. 

Thankfully for Samuels, she felt surrounded by support on the Hallmark shoot by crew members who understood her need for flexibility with a new baby. Director Jessica Harmon was expecting her first child during the shoot, Samuels told EntertainmentNOW, and cinematographer Will McKnight's wife gave birth four days before filming started.

“It was just like babies everywhere,” Samuels recalled, laughing. “But I think this year's experience will always be pretty special because it was this, like, unique moment where everyone was coming into parenthood at the same time and it was very exciting.”

“Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: A Lesson in Murder” premieres on Hallmark Mystery and Hallmark Channel on April 10 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. It is also scheduled to air at additional times on Hallmark Mystery and is still available to stream on Hallmark+.

When actress Lyndie Greenwood was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2024, she was on a roll making Hallmark movies, having just co-starred in Hallmark Mystery's “Crimetime: Freefall” with Luke Macfarlane. It was her fifth movie role at the network since 2021, but her work as an actress came to an abrupt halt as she began an intense cancer treatment plan in the fall, including a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. 

“I haven't been able to work during this time,” Greenwood, 42, wrote in a blog update on April 8, 2025. “In most ways – because I have enough savings and a comfortable home with a supportive partner – this has been an unbelievable blessing. I imagine sometimes how difficult this would be if those things weren't true, and it shatters my heart.” 

But Greenwood, married to producer Ben Jamieson for six years, admitted it's also been hard to step back from acting and adjusting to her new normal, writing, “No one is ever prepared for cancer. It's not something we're taught how to deal with in advance. Coping with everything that a cancer diagnosis ignites in your life is not something that comes naturally, whether it's your diagnosis or that of someone you love.”

A post shared by Lyndie Greenwood (@lyndiegreenwood)

In her latest blog post, Greenwood expressed gratitude for having the ability to focus on treatment and healing, “but in some ways,” she wrote, “it has been emotionally taxing to not have work – and my savings won't last forever. I would have loved the distraction on the days that it was physically possible, but acting doesn't really work that way. You're all in, or you're out. And the logistics of cancer come first when trying to organize one's life-schedule.”

Noting that it's been the longest stretch of time she's ever stayed at home, not traveling for a project, the “Girlfriendship” star wrote, “I've had nothing but time to stew and to worry and to pull my hair out (literally), and to also find ways to learn and to ground and to hope and to laugh.”

Greenwood shared that, to feel productive each day, she made two goals for herself in 2025. First, she wrote, “to write something everyday (even just a sentence)” and, second, “to meditate everyday (even for just a minute).” 

“Being able to check these tiny, achievable things off my to-do list gives me a sense of accomplishment each day, but it also helps me to fully relax,” Greenwood shared. “Like if I do just those little things I said I would do, then I can justify doing ‘nothing' else. As if one needs to justify simply existing. But I am not immune to our cultural standard of worth = productivity, even as I am trying to be more conscious of it.”

A post shared by Lyndie Greenwood (@lyndiegreenwood)

In 2021, before Greenwood landed a supporting role in her first Hallmark movie, “Every Time a Bell Rings” starring her longtime friend Erin Cahill, the actress had decided to give up on acting. 

Writing on her blog that she was “miserable” and not booking any new acting jobs, Greenwood quit — and the freedom it provided seemed to usher in a new era of opportunity for her. 

“I quit, and the simple act of doing so immediately brightened my mood,” she wrote. “It felt like I gained control of my life again. I had been spinning out, desperately waiting for someone to tell me I was good enough for their stupid (expletive) show (they weren't all stupid), and now I could drop all the weight of that self-judgement and shame.” 

“I started teaching yoga and guiding plant walks, and I was peaceful and content for the first time maybe ever in my life,” Greenwood continued. “And just when I thought to myself that maybe I could go back to acting in a way that was healthier for me, I started getting offers. It sounds made up, I know, but it's true. Since then I have been living this way, accepting offers and doing specific audition requests, and it has lead to the most rewarding work of my career.”

In addition to “Girlfriendship” in 2022, she also co-starred with Holly Robinson Peete in “Holiday Heritage” that year. In 2023, she starred in one season of a Canadian TV show called “Shelved,” now available to stream on Tubi, and Hallmark's “Magic in Mistletoe.” In 2024, she appeared in “Crimetime: Freefall” and worked with fellow Hallmark actor Brooks Darnell on the sci-fi short “Embryo,” per IMDb. 

Before Greenwood went public with her cancer journey in March 2025, there was hope from fans and online reviewers for “Crimetime: Freefall” to become a franchise. Macfarlane even told TVGoodness that director Stacey N. Harding always planned on it becoming a franchise — which is still possible once Greenwood feels well enough to act again. 

“Stacey said to me right at the beginning, ‘I'm shooting this with all the preparation one would do as if they were making a pilot,'” Macfarlane told TVGoodness. “She did a wonderful job and I want it to come back. I really do. We wait and see how it does. I am certainly moving forward with the hope that we get to do it again.”

Not so long ago, it would have been a bizarre novelty if Stephen Malkmus had tried his hand at a sonata, or if Interpol had staged an evening-length multimedia work at Lincoln Center. But concert music needed to loosen up once the old divisions became almost absurd to maintain, and indie bands—well, as their industry collapsed, they needed money, and some had reached a level of professionalism that easily upscaled. Now we don't think twice about Bryce Dessner, Annie Clark, Julia Holter, or Hamilton Leithauser splitting time between hang-out and sit-down shows. Why shouldn't David Longstreth?

Dirty Projectors seem ideally suited to this kind of thing. They distinguished themselves with complex time signatures, mosaic vocal techniques, nonlinear structures, and ambiguous tonality—sweetly coated, sour-centered. Their magpie psych-pop has often snagged bits of classical in its darting path. Yet Song of the Earth, Longstreth's first major piece for a large ensemble, shows how different writing an hour of concert music is from writing an hour of songs. It's a challenging, arduous, fitfully rewarding work that favors density and creativity at the expense of clarity and continuity—long music for short attention spans.

Song of the Earth was commissioned by the Berlin-based chamber orchestra s t a r g a z e, conducted by André de Ridder. Though named after Mahler's song cycle Das Lied Von Der Erde, the album evokes late-'60s auteurs like Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks, and Scott Walker, their juiced-up harmonies and huge, shivery arrangements swirled into the nervy minimalist brew of contemporary chamber music. Longstreth has said he wrote the first draft in six “manic” weeks, disoriented by the new pandemic and new fatherhood, and that really is the best word. With 24 tracks, often subdivided into little cubicles, it's a long hour that keeps starting over. Dirty Projectors' Felicia Douglass, Maia Friedman, and Olga Bell contribute a lot, and guests like Phil Elverum and Steve Lacy are in there somewhere. It's probably best in concert, for which it was designed. But at home, it's nearly monotonous in its restless variety.

Though the overall picture is blurry, the individual parts can sound good, with a few exceptions: “Gimme Bread” is an early primer on the album's unique mess and excess. As Longstreth croons under his range, there's a Pet Sounds-y part, then a harp freakout with people chanting, then a riffy part, all before the menacing Pharoahe Monch-style horns burst in, taking the climactic insight about bread a little too seriously. In “Uninhabitable Earth, Paragraph One,” Longstreth sings an extract from a climate journalist's book verbatim, which seems like a cool thing to try before instantly seeing why it doesn't work well at all, let alone with a little gospel-rap prelude.

On the other hand, the album starts well with “Summer Light,” where the female singers set the template for the natural, flattering sections of imitative counterpoint that are consistent high points across the album. The ensemble is robust and game as it attacks the demands for churning basses, scampering trebles, and blustery horns. “At Home” in particular comes together as an enchantingly sung, confidently developed, piercingly simple song, the lyrics modest but functional. It's a tantalizing glimpse of one dimension Longstreth could have explored within this splintering psych-orchestral universe. Borrowing Mahler's vivid contrasts while jettisoning the soothing unity, Song of the Earth feels more like something coming apart than coming together, which may relate to Longstreth's ideas about the earth and how we live now. But if you can't get on its chaotic wavelength, it can wear you out.

HYBE promises to "continue to monitor and take legal action to eradicate such serious crimes."

	HYBE is continuing to work to protect its artists.


Korea's Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency (NGPPA) worked with the global entertainment company to arrest eight individuals who are suspected of creating and distributing deepfake videos of HYBE Music Group artists, Billboard can confirm. Deepfakes are false images, videos or audio that have been edited or generated using artificial intelligence.


	The investigation was launched as a result of a Memorandums of Understanding between HYBE and NGPPA, signed in February 2024, as a means to combat cybercrimes for their artists and maintain their safety. HYBE provided information to NGPPA, who were able to track down and identify the suspects. Additionally, fans helped the investigation by sending reports via the HYBE Artist Rights Violation Report Center tip line.


	“HYBE will respond firmly to crimes that infringe on our artists' portrait rights and reputations, based on a zero-tolerance and no-settlement policy,” Jason Jaesang Lee, CEO of HYBE, said in a press statement, adding, “We will continue to monitor and take legal action to eradicate such serious crimes.”

	











	Ho-seung Kim, district chief of NGPPA, also assured that deepfake suspects will continue to be tracked down. “Deepfake crimes that exploit the vulnerabilities of celebrities—who often find it difficult to report such offenses themselves — are on the rise,” he said in his statement. “Deepfake is a serious type of crime that can destroy the daily lives of victims, and crimes targeting public figures are no exception.”

“Summer House” star Lindsay Hubbard is denying rumors that she and her boyfriend, Dr. Turner Kufe, have broken up. 

During an April 2025 interview with It Girl, Hubbard said she and Kufe, the father of her daughter, Gemma, are still dating. 

“We are very much together. All the time, day in, day out, being parents to our baby. We just went to Florida. We have a couple of trips coming up. And yeah, just, like, normal life with a newborn,” said Hubbard during the interview. 

In the It Girl interview, Hubbard also noted that she and Kufe met during the fall of 2020. According to Hubbard, they “went on a few dates.” Kufe, however, let Hubbard know that he was not interested in having a serious relationship after their fourth date. Hubbard said Kufe reached out again in December 2023, four months after her engagement to Carl Radke was called off. The couple, who welcomed their daughter in October 2024, began dating again in January 2024.

Hubbard suggested she was not sure how her relationship with Kufe will end up faring during a February 2025 interview on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.”

“I think we're trying to figure that out. We got pregnant very quickly upon dating. And it's very challenging even on the strongest relationships. But, you know, we're doing it,” said Hubbard during the interview. 

She also said she does not believe Kufe will ever appear on “Summer House.” 

In addition, Hubbard gave an update about how she was feeling after welcoming Gemma. 

“I feel identity issues. And I don't know what my future holds. And I'm just getting used to being a mom,” said Hubbard while filming the “Watch What Happens Live” episode.

While speaking to It Girl, Hubbard discussed her dynamic with Radke. She said she does not believe she will “ever forgive” Radke for ending their relationship while “Summer House” cameras were rolling. 

“We were supposed to get married two months later. And next thing you know, there was cameras in my living room. And he's breaking up with me on television,” said Hubbard during the interview. 

In an April 2025 “Watch What Happens Live” interview, Radke said he did not intend to break up with Hubbard in front of cameras.

“I wanted to get on the same page. But as we were talking — which we talked in circles, it was very obvious that it wasn't right. And when I said, ‘I don't think I can do this.' Her response was, ‘Okay, it's over,'” said Radke during the April 2025 interview.

HGTV star Tarek El Moussa is sharing how is dynamic with his ex-wife Christina Haack has improved. 

While speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025, Tarek El Moussa, who shares his older children Brayden, 9,  and Taylor, 14, with Haack, said filming the series, “The Flip Off,” alongside his ex-wife bettered their relationship. The HGTV series, which premiered in January 2025, featured Tarek El Moussa and his wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, competing against Haack to see who could make a better profit when flipping a house. Haack's estranged husband, Josh Hall, was originally her partner until he left the series following their July 2024 split. 

Tarek El Moussa said filming the series “was more fun than [he] thought it was going to be.” 

“It was better for our family. It was better for our relationship. It brought everybody closer and, in the end, it did such amazing things for our family. I wouldn't change a thing,” said Tarek El Moussa to the publication. 

He also said that he and Haack were able to positively communicate with each other during the production of the show. 

“The show gave me and Christina an opportunity to apologize for things we did to each other. It gave Christina and Heather an opportunity to bond even closer. I mean, we're going to dinners now. So, honestly, it's just about working together, spending time together and creating some really fun TV together,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview.

Tarek El Moussa spoke about filming with Haack for “The Flip Off” during a January 2025 Us Weekly interview, alongside his wife. He said he was not worried about working with his ex-wife again because they have “been in a really good place” for “the last couple of years.” 

“It took us almost 10 years to get there, so going back into shooting together, it's a lot more of an intimate relationship. There were some reservations. But as the show has gone on, we've realized it's just business,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview. 

He also said that he and Haack did argue while filming the HGTV series. According to Tarek El Moussa, he took issue with Haack “because she always wants to get her way.” 

“She doesn't want to have rules,” said Tarek El Moussa to Us Weekly.

Heather Rae El Moussa also shared that he and Haack's dynamic is similar to how siblings fight.

During a November 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Haack said Hall took issue with her dynamic with Tarek El Moussa while filming “The Flip Off.” 

According to Haack, Hall viewed her relationship with her ex-husband as flirty. She said, however, that she views Tarek El Moussa like a sibling.

Doctors are often medical shows' harshest critics, but “The Pitt” seems to be the one they actually like. Doctors credit Max's scripted medical drama, which spends a season exploring 15 hours in a Pittsburgh ER, with capturing the experience of working in a 2025 emergency room.

“The other thing that's really great is the emergency workers who say, ‘For years, I've tried to explain to my family what I do in the emergency department, and I can never put it into words,'” said co-executive producer Dr. Joe Sachs. “ They could never explain, ‘What I go through,' and when they watch an episode of the show, they get it and they understand.”

For decades, real-life cops, lawyers, and doctors have helped TV procedurals with their stories. So what does “The Pitt” do that's different? That's the question IndieWire posed to Sachs as well as medical consultants Dr. Jacob Lentz (eps 103, 106, 109, 112), Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira (eps 104, 107, 110, 113), and writer's intern Dr. Ariel Wu. Short answer: Doctors shaped every aspect of “The Pitt.”

For Season 1, “The Pitt” employed seven residency-trained, board-certified emergency physicians: four for the writing process, and three on-set medical advisors. Six nurses and physician assistants also served as specialty background players throughout production.

Overseeing it all was Sachs, who received his master in film studies while going to medical school — a combination motivated by his interest in public health education. While working for 30 years as a TV writer, Sachs continued to work part-time as an attending emergency physician at a teaching hospital and trauma center.

“I worked all during COVID, all during the peak of the pandemic, intubating the sickest patients in full protection gear, so I know what it's like,” said Sachs.

“The Pitt” creator R. Scott Gemmill, executive producers John Wells and Noah Wyle (who plays Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch) shared the goal of realistically capturing an ER in 2025. In their first conversations with Sachs they asked, “What's new? What's going on today?” Sachs' immediate answer was the Boarding Crisis, which took off during COVID and never went away.

“In a 40-bed ER, there may be 30 patients taking up beds in rooms, on gurneys on every available wall spot waiting for admission, so your ability to see new patients suffers,” said Sachs. “The waiting time is terrible. And the horrible solution is that you have to practice waiting-room medicine. From the waiting room, as we portrayed, you get your labs drawn, you come back, you go to x-ray, you come back, and sometimes you never make it back to a bed.”

 










The opening sequence of episode 1 of “The Pitt” grounds the audience in that new normal.  Dr. Robby walks through a hundred patients in the waiting room and briefs the new medical students and residents on the reality of boarding and waiting-room medicine. Said Sachs, “I think in the first few minutes of episode 1, healthcare workers knew this was a show that's real and different from your typical medical show.”

Another reason “The Pitt” is instantly recognizable to doctors, and it could shoot in a realistic way, stemmed from early planning and collaboration between Sachs and production designer Nina Ruscio. She created a set that was not only grounded in modern medicine, but was also built for unique production needs.

“I gave Nina a book of the 20 newest, greatest emergency departments,” said Sachs. “It's curvilinear, there's open doors, there's depth — our set has a ceiling that allows for a documentary-style walk for a half a mile where you see everything. Most sets don't have ceilings and our lighting is built right into that.”

“We never start with a medical case,” said Sachs. “It stems from the dramatic needs of the characters, and when we have the dramatic needs, then my job is to go to the well.”

 










In the search for the specific medical condition that will serve the dramatic needs, that well of story options is deep. Beyond his own three decades in the ER, Sachs brought aboard Dr. Mel Herbert, CEO/Founder of continuing medical education organization EM:RAP; it comes with its own network of medical professionals. Joining Sachs and Herbert in the story development was Dr. Greg Moran, the retired chair of emergency medicine at Olive View Medical Center, and Dr. Ariel Wu, the chief resident in emergency medicine at UCLA who brought the perspective of what the ensemble of medical students and resident characters experience.

“The Pitt” also benefits from an army of more informal consultants. One example of this was hosting “nurse's nights,” where the show feeds working nurses dinner and lets them tell their stories. Sachs offered an example of how this deep well can lead to finding just the right medical case to fit dramatic and character needs.

“A writer wanted to do a scene that showcased Mel King's (Taylor Dearden) special abilities to relate to patients, especially patients with special needs,” said Sachs. The team settled on a patient with SD Autism Spectrum disorder who had an ankle sprain but frustrated Dr. Langdon (Patrick Ball) with his endless questions. Said Sachs, “And Mel comes into the room, sits down quietly, turns off the lights, closes the door, and gets everything she needs out of him.”

 










The case allowed character to be expressed in action and conflict. Without a need for backstory or medical exposition, the viewer knows a great deal about Dearden's character and the medical drama is de-escalated, while Mel's relationship with Langdon takes a new turn.

Sachs, Wu, Moran, and Herbert also gave script notes at every step of the writing process, including a list of vocabulary and medical terminology. 

“We don't shy away from complex technical dialogue,” said Sachs. “If it's crazy technical and the audience doesn't understand it at all, it's fine because the emotion, the conflict, the humor comes through performance.”

Trusting the audience will follow the drama, and won't stumble on jargon and procedures they don't fully understand, is a driving ethos of the writers room. Doctors who watch “The Pitt” love characters who talk like professionals, especially when featuring a particularly cutting-edge scenario. Sachs' favorite example came during episode 14, the mass casualty episode.

“Dr. Langdon places a supraclavicular, subclavian line and calls out all the appropriate landmarks and pointing to the ipsilateral nipple. The cast reading it were going, ‘Are you kidding me? What is this?'” said Sachs. “It's a procedure that isn't taught, that frequently was featured on EM:RAP as a way to do a central line when you don't have ultrasound. Anyway, that show just aired and when that scene came on, Mel Herbert, who's the CEO of EM:RAP, his phone blew up with about 300 texts and emails saying, ‘Oh my God, did you see what they're doing?'”

 










The 15 episodes of Season 1 were divided among the three on-set medical consultants, Drs. Jacob Lentz, Elizabeth Ferreira, and Fred Einesman. Each medical consultant begins prepping their episode as soon as the scripts are ready, sitting in all production meetings and working with directors and department heads. They follow their episodes through production and are on-set for every shot.

“You're responsible for every medical part of everything for the entire episode,” Lentz told IndieWire. “There's a huge amount of prep time and then a huge amount of legwork mapping these things out. And you have to answer every single medical question for the entire episode.”

Medical consultants break down the script to outline what each department will need ahead of time. This is especially key for the art department and props, which must return the medical tool or equipment “back one” as if it hadn't just been used every time.

The doctors learned how, with proper prep and information, filmmakers can produce incredibly lifelike and detailed results. Sachs was particularly impressed how makeup department head Myriam Arougheti created open fractures, the dislocation of a lower extremity, a fasciotomy with tissue bulging out, open chest surgery with a beating heart, third-degree burns, and a vaginal delivery.

 










“The biggest compliment her work has ever had was someone [who worked on ‘The Pitt'] was at a cocktail party and a real-world surgeon said, ‘Don't you know it's a HIPAA violation to use real footage of real patients? Who gives you that footage? Because it's against the law,'” said Sachs. “So to fool a surgeon with our makeup and our procedures is pretty great.”

Each of the principal cast went through a medical boot camp to learn the basics of suturing, intubation, and how to hold an ultrasound. “[For each shooting] day, we write extensive sides, [outlining the] choreography, to make sure these trauma scenes look as legitimate as possible,” said Ferreira of her role as on-set medical consultant. 

During down moments, Ferreira, Einesman, and Lentz would pull an actor aside to review the mechanics of aprocedure to create the right physicality. Said Lentz, “All three of us [the on-set medical consultants] have the muscle memory of how things feel when you pop into a lung. There's a distinct feel to a lumbar puncture, and so you're trying to like explain that and show them how they can best physically mime it  — your shoulder jerks a little bit as you pop through the chest wall into the lung when you're putting in a chest tube.”

 










Ferreira was impressed by how dedicated the cast was to getting it right and how quickly they learned how to mirror each act. According to Ferreira, the actors' muscle memory improved as the season progressed and they slipped more quickly into the physicality of playing ER doctors. The medical consultants learned  thatphysicality was only half of the equation.

“One thing that Lizzie [Dr. Ferreira] is really good about is thinking about where their head is at when you're about to do something,” said Lentz. “If you're doing a crazy procedure, the actor doesn't know if this is routine or a very rare thing. We have to tell them, ‘You rarely do this and it's super high stakes, so this is a hair on fire situation, you're secretly panicked, you're trying to seem calm.'”

Actors getting their actions down is only part of accurately portraying medical procedures. Who stands where, who is responsible for what, who hands what to whom — there's a coordination and choreography in doctors and nurses trying to save lives. Medical consultants shared videos of real-life medical procedures with their episode's director to provide a sense of the action involved, but ultimately it has to be staged and rehearsed to get it right.

 










“I think the directors are very kind because sometimes we do things that I feel typically the director is in charge of,” said Ferreira. “But because of the nature of the situation where it requires a lot of technical knowledge, they give us a lot more freedom into creating the scene and then they [see] what we've done to create their shot.”

Lentz said the series allowed consultants to first stage and rehearse medical procedures. “I would always say, ‘Here's what I came up with. It's your show. It's your episode. Tell me what you think. If you're okay with it, great. If you wanna change anything, let me know,'” said Lentz. “It was a symbiotic, cooperative thing.” 

Professional background extras know how to portray everyday things like busy New Yorkers walking down the street, posh guests at a cocktail party, or workers to board a bus. “It turns out that it's very difficult to teach background actors how to be nurses,” said Lentz. 

In the busy ER, the realism of nurses how move and do their job is vital. Each episode had six nurses as background performers: Melette LeBlanc, Ambar Kaiser Martinez, Jordan Farrand, Tim van Pelt, and Jamie Watkins.

“It's interesting,” Lentz said. “Someone says, ‘Oh, I'd like to be a background on the show,' we'd have to say, ‘Oh, can you work Monday through Friday for seven months? Because it all happens in one day.”

 










Van Pelt was also in charge of background choreography. At any point, there are up to 21 boarded patients on the walls in “The Pitt.” Van Pelt mapped out each patient's symptoms and care minute to minute.

“Tim worked out a spreadsheet for every hour and every episode,” said Sachs. “Each boarding patient has a different appropriate activity, whether it be a breathing treatment, IV antibiotics, meals, physical therapy unique to their condition, And this is the part that I love: Tim looked after the fluid in their IV bag, making sure it went down an appropriate amount every. The attention to detail was phenomenal.”

The actor played the Tenth Doctor from 2005 to 2010 before reprising his role as the Fourteenth Doctor in 2023.

David Tennant almost didn't portray one of his most iconic roles to date.


	The actor shared on a recent episode of David Tennant Does a Podcast With… that his former agent actually told him, “Don't touch” the role of the Doctor in the BBC hit show Doctor Who.




	His wife, Georgia Tennant, who took over hosting duties on the latest podcast episode, recalled how David initially got asked to star as the titular character, saying he met Doctor Who executive producers Russell T. Davies and Julie Gardner while working on the 2005 miniseries Casanova, which Davies and Gardner also exec produced.

	Georgia said they were looking for someone to take over the role of the Doctor from Christopher Eccleston in their 2005 Doctor Who revival, and decided to “lure” the Broadchurch actor to their house to watch some of the first season.


	“And then they go, ‘Guess what? Do you want to play [the Doctor]?'” she recounted. “And you pretend to think about it for, like, a day or something?”


	“It was longer than that,” David responded, before his wife added that he was “clearly” going to take the part.


	“Well, maybe I was clearly going to do it,” the Jessica Jones actor admitted, “but there was definitely a moment where I wasn't.”


	David continued, “About 40 hours after they asked me, and I sort of had to process everything that it meant. And I had an agent at the time who was like, ‘Don't touch it. It's not going to work.' Not my current agent. A previous brilliant agent who's since retired, but she didn't call that correctly, as it turns out. She said, ‘It's not been on yet, it's not going to work. You don't want that hung around your neck.'”


	And his former agent was definitely wrong, as his Doctor Who character has become one of his notable roles. David ultimately played the Tenth Doctor for three seasons from 2005 to 2010 before reprising his role as the Fourteenth Doctor in 2023 for the 60th anniversary Doctor Who specials.

Donald Trump has taken extreme measures in his second term to deport foreign nationals legally residing in the U.S., such as revoking the visas of students involved in pro-Palestine protests on campuses around the country. Now, as The New York Times reports, the administration will look to widen the scope of its attacks on immigrants by canceling their Social Security numbers.


	The idea is to make it impossible for immigrants to work or access banking services — even though they came here legally — in hopes that they will be forced to self-deport. The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to accomplish this by adding names to its “death master file,” marking living individuals as dead and removing them from the system. The agency's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, explained in an email to staff that their “financial lives” would thus be “terminated.” Approximately 6,000 mostly Latino immigrants have already been pronounced dead by the SSA at the request of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, according to The Washington Post.

	











	And, according to Times, the “death master file” scheme isn't the only way the SSA has cooperated with Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. It also reached an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to hand over the last-known addresses of 98,000 people to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).


	Supposedly, the targets of these moves include “suspected terrorists” and convicted criminals — though as Trump's mass deportation of migrants to a mega-prison in El Salvador has demonstrated, the administration hardly bothers to justify these categorizations. About 90 percent of those prisoners have no criminal record, and ICE and DHS appear to have based their spurious claims about alleged gang affiliations on unrelated tattoos and clothing. Authorities have also admitted to sending one person to the prison in El Salvador due to an “administrative error.” The conservative-dominated Supreme Court today ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” that man's release, in a unanimous decision.

	Similar errors are likely to arise as the Social Security Administration starts to rescind credentials from thousands of people. But it's just part of a sweeping and unprecedented effort to weaponize data from agencies formerly considered apolitical. Several top Internal Revenue Service officials resigned this week after the agency signaled that it would use tax documents to help the Trump administration identify immigrants to be deported.

	











	Tech oligarch Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency are heavily involved in this allegedly illegal ransacking of sensitive information from the administrative state, accessing this material through federal IT systems and feeding it into AI models for analysis. Needless to say, that software isn't infallible — and Musk himself seems committed to misreading and distorting whatever his team finds. The world's richest man has trashed Social Security as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” baselessly claimed that undocumented migrants are receiving benefits, and, at a rally in Wisconsin last month, argued that President Joe Biden had allowed an increasing number of noncitizens to receive Social Security numbers.


	But the program of automatically assigning Social Security numbers to immigrants authorized to work in the U.S., Enumeration Beyond Entry (EBE), began in 2017 under Trump. The program doesn't entitle noncitizens to receive Social Security benefits — it was designed to let noncitizens with legal status start paying into the program without visiting a SSA field office to obtain a number. The current Trump administration has partially frozen the EBE deal, meaning many work-authorized immigrants (and newly naturalized U.S. citizens) will need to visit one of those offices, which have been ravaged by DOGE-imposed staff cuts and closures, in order to get a Social Security card.

	More broadly, DOGE appears to be gathering personal data on hundreds of millions of Americans, not just immigrants, presumably in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, enacted after Watergate to prevent the abuse of private personal information by government officials. For Trump, who promised “retribution” in the closing days of the 2024 election, access to these records could enable all manner of revenge against perceived enemies. Already, federal workers have come to believe that DOGE is spying on their internal communications, perhaps with the aim of purging anyone disloyal to Trump.


	The machinations afoot at the Social Security Administration alone reveal how easy it is for the White House to inflict harm on swaths of people with little regard for who is actually lumped into those groups or why. They also raise the question of what other phony pretexts the administration might invent to declare a person — citizen or not — effectively nonexistent. For an institution established to keep older and disabled Americans out of poverty, it's about as far from the original mission as you can get.

Tesla is responsible for producing some of the most unique technological advances in recent years.

Many have often wondered whether some of Tesla's designs are UFO-inspired. 

However, jokes and gags around the UFO pilgrimage site might be building ground. 

Because the American brand is constructing a UFO-inspired supercharger in New Mexico.

July 1947 was an extremely tense and nervous time. 

The Cold War – the ideological conflict between America and the Soviet Union – was in its infancy, and fear and mistrust spread all across the globe. 

Naturally, the United States government tried to deter the Soviet Union's efforts to undermine American democracy.

As part of those efforts, the United States launched Project Mogul from New Mexico. 

Based at Alamogordo Army Air Field, the project involved high-altitude balloons.

Its purpose was to try and detect long-distance sound waves from Soviet atomic bomb tests.

That month, a man named W.W. “Mac” Brazel discovered debris in his ranch near Corona, New Mexico. 

Thinking it might be UFO material, Brazel drove to Roswell, New Mexico, to tell the authorities. 

The 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force was informed, stationed at Roswell Army Air Field.

At the time, the 509th was the only group capable of delivering nuclear weapons. 

Public Information Officer Walter Haut confirmed that parts from ‘a flying disc‘ had been found. 

Despite this later being denied, rumours of alien life forms have strongly persisted ever since. 

Recently, the EV giant announced that it's building a new supercharger facility.

That might not sound overly exciting in itself, but it's being built in alien country. 

More specifically, the new facility will call Roswell, New Mexico, home.  

The new CyberCanopy is planned to house eight superchargers.

Max de Zegher, Tesla's Director of Charging for North America, confirmed the news. 

He made the point that Tesla ‘wants to build a few Superchargers cool enough to be worth of the trip itself.'

The supposed CyberCanopy certainly does indeed bear a resemblance to certain UFO images. 

So, if you've always planned to visit Roswell, now might be the perfect chance.

Liam Coen was one of the top head coaching candidates on the market this year after an impressive year as the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offensive coordinator. The Jaguars showed strong interest in Coen during their search for a head coach, setting up an interview with him on Wednesday.

He turned down that opportunity and was set to sign a lucrative three-year deal with the Bucs to make him the highest-paid coordinator in the NFL, but he never put pen to paper.

That's when the Jaguars pulled the “break glass in case of emergency” card and fired GM Trent Baalke, making one last push to hire Coen as their head coach. Fast-forward to Thursday and they've landed their guy.

According to reports, Coen is expected to be hired as the Jaguars' next head coach. It was a bizarre turn of events, particularly considering the Buccaneers were unable to reach Coen on Thursday after he left to take the interview with the Jaguars.

Furthermore, his contract with the Buccaneers was reportedly contingent on him not taking a second interview with Jacksonville – but he never signed it, so he never breached the contract.

Coen had two different stints with the Rams. He was the assistant wide receivers coach from 2018-2019 before being promoted to assistant quarterbacks coach in 2020. He then left for Kentucky in 2021, returned to the Rams as Sean McVay's offensive coordinator in 2022, went back to Kentucky in 2023 and then landed with the Buccaneers in 2024.

So, yeah, he's made a few stops in the last five years.

A California-based startup plans to launch hundreds of flattened "microsatellites" into low-Earth orbit at once, by firing rockets out of a giant centrifugal cannon. The first batch of pancake-like spacecraft could be shot into space as soon as next year — and could set a new record.

SpinLaunch is a private company that aims to fire payloads into space using giant, cannon-like machines. These "cannons" accelerate spacecraft using spinning arms inside a vacuum-sealed chamber, before shooting them upward out of a barrel faster than a speeding bullet. Using this novel technology, the company aims to establish its own satellite constellation, Meridian Space, which they claim could provide more cost-effective competition to the likes of SpaceX's Starlink network.

On April 3, SpinLaunch revealed that it had received $12 million in funding from Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace (KDA), putting its total funding close to $150 million. The announcement also revealed that KDA's NanoAvionics had been selected to build the first batch of 250 satellites in the Meridian Space constellation, which could be launched during an in-orbit demonstration test planned for some point in 2026.

On the same day, NanoAvionics also released a video explaining more about the new satellites. This revealed that each satellite will be shaped like a flat disk and placed on top of one another inside a "launch bus," like a giant stack of pancakes. Each satellite will be 7.5 feet (2.2 meters) wide and weigh approximately 154 pounds (70 kilograms), making them significantly lighter than most other communications satellites. For example, Starlink's current V2 satellites weigh around 1,760 pounds (800 kg) each.

If all the satellites are successfully delivered into low-Earth orbit (LEO) next year, it would set a new record for most spacecraft launched at once, currently held by SpaceX's Transporter-1 mission, which launched 143 satellites in 2021, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com.

SpinLaunch has previously launched 10 rockets using its Suborbital Accelerator in New Mexico, which has a vacuum chamber around 108 feet (33 m) wide and spins objects to speeds of up to 5,000 mph (8,000 km/h). The most recent launch, in September 2022, successfully delivered multiple payloads into suborbit for the first time, Space.com previously reported.

During these test launches, the acceleration process took up to 30 minutes, and the rockets experienced up to 10,000 Gs of force before being fired into the upper atmosphere. (One G is equivalent to the force exerted on an object by Earth's gravity.)

Details of next year's orbital demonstration are limited, but the mission will likely be carried out using the same machine as the previous tests. This means that the rocket will be catapulted into a suborbital flight before its engines kick in and deliver the final push needed to put the payload into LEO, according to Space.com.

The main draw of this type of launch system is that it is much cheaper than firing chemical rockets. SpinLaunch predicts that its future commercial launches could cost between $1,250 and $2,500 per kilogram launched into space, which is less than half the cost of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, which cost around $6,000 per kilogram, according to New Space Economy.

Since the accelerated rockets don't release any greenhouse gases during launch, they are also better for the environment than chemical rockets. These spacecraft also do not need boosters that have to be discarded in space, which will mean less space junk in LEO and reduced chances of discarded equipment falling back to Earth's surface.



SpinLaunch is only planning to launch around 1,200 of satellites in its Meridian Space constellation. However, once this is completed, the company is planning to build a larger Orbital Accelerator machine — with a 328-foot-wide (100 m) chamber — that will be capable of firing payloads for other companies directly into LEO, without the rockets having to fire at all. If this happens, SpinLaunch claims it could eventually launch up to five commercial payloads into space every single day, according to New Space Economy.

However, this could lead to more problems further down the road.

If this ambitious launch frequency were achieved, it could exacerbate problems that communications satellites and other commercial payloads are causing in LEO, including an increased chance of spacecraft collisions, more light pollution in the night sky, radio signals that interfere with astronomy and atmospheric metal pollution caused by spacecraft re-entires.

Researchers have proposed many origins for a gravity anomaly in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, but the latest evidence suggests the subglacial hole is an impact crater measuring 315 miles across.

Name: Wilkes Land crater

Location: East Antarctica

Coordinates: 70°S 120°E

Why it's incredible: Evidence suggests it could be the greatest known impact crater on Earth.

The Wilkes Land crater is a hole in the bedrock beneath East Antarctica's ice sheet measuring 315 miles (510 kilometers) across. Researchers have been trying to explain its existence since the 1960s, and the most recent evidence suggests it was born from a cataclysmic meteorite impact.

The crater was first detected as a huge dent in Earth's gravitational field. Initial ground-based seismic and gravity surveys already indicated that the crater was huge — around 150 miles (240 km) across — but newer techniques reveal that it is likely more than double this size.

According to a 2018 study, the Wilkes Land crater sits about 1 mile (1.6 km) beneath the surface of Antarctica's ice sheet. The study showed the crater in more detail than ever before and examined its potential link with southern Australia, which was connected to East Antarctica until around 35 million years ago. While the origin of the crater remains uncertain, the results of the study suggest the event that created the hole likely occurred before the continents separated.

Researchers have proposed several explanations for the Wilkes Land crater, including that it could be a volcanic structure, a sedimentary basin, a deeply eroded valley or a meteor impact crater, according to a 2015 paper. For that paper, scientists used satellite remote sensing techniques to map the crater and determine its physical characteristics. In the middle of the hole in Earth's gravitational field, known as a negative gravity anomaly, they found a positive gravity anomaly, with the ice sheet filling the gap around this central peak like a huge, frosty donut.

The central peak is likely a structure known as a mass concentration, or a "mascon," according to the study. Mascons can occur within meteor impact structures due to the meteor crashing through Earth's crust and affecting the mantle beneath. Following the impact, the mantle may recoil and form a dense plug, resulting in a positive gravity anomaly, the study authors wrote.



The Wilkes Land crater and its mascon aren't perfectly circular and instead form a U-shape, according to the 2018 study, whose results support the conclusion that the crater was caused by a meteor impact. The northern side of the crater is fragmented, perhaps as a result of tectonic processes that ripped Australia and Antarctica apart, the authors noted. Parts of the crater are clearly visible in southern Australia, they added.

If the Wilkes Land crater is an impact crater, then it "would be the greatest impact crater known" on Earth in terms of its size, the authors wrote.

In the 2015 study, researchers found that the crater's diameter matches the speed and size of space rocks that regularly crashed into Earth during its early history between 4.1 billion and 3.8 billion years ago. "The WLA [Wilkes Land Anomaly] could have been created by such bolides," they wrote in the study.

"Nonetheless, because of the constraints imposed by the overlying continental ice sheet, [...], we believe that the other explanations for the subglacial structure remain viable," they added.

Dr. Anona Blackwell shares her remarkable journey from orthodox-trained medic to unapologetic mystic in her recently released candid memoir: From Medic to Mystic – The True Story of an Academic Physician's Journey Into the Paranormal.

Chronicling her dual professional life as a highly respected, Lancet-published academic physician while also investigating powerful psychic and paranormal experiences in her work and personal life, Dr. Blackwell presents compelling evidence for telepathy, clairvoyance, near-death experiences (NDEs), life after death, the power of prayer, non-ordinary reality, and more.

From humble beginnings as the daughter of a bus driver and market gardener, growing up on a smallholding in rural Wales, Dr. Blackwell, BSc, AKC, FRCP, rose to become a leading authority in genito-urinary medicine. She led a research team whose work transformed clinical practice in the UK, improving the health of millions of women by advancing the treatment of anaerobic/bacterial vaginosis.

Immersed in orthodox medicine by day, she devoted her after-hours to the in-depth investigation of anomalous phenomena, energy healing, and metaphysics. Her innate psychic abilities offered profound insights into her patients' lives, psyches, and hidden traumas—insights that few modern doctors are privileged to experience.

Anona's book has been a long time in the making, chronicling her remarkable journey from her birth on a three-acre smallholding in Wales to earning a degree in biophysics, followed by a medical degree in London and post-graduate research at St. Thomas's Hospital. Her career progressed to a consultant post in Swansea in 1985, where she contributed to internationally recognised research, clinical practice, and teaching.

Throughout her journey, she has remained deeply aware of other dimensions of reality—sometimes integrating these perspectives into orthodox treatment. The book is designed for a broad audience but particularly encourages healthcare professionals to adopt a more open-minded approach to the aetiology of disease and holistic care. Infused with Anona's sharp sense of humour, shaped by a challenging childhood, the book resonates on many levels.

Now at age 75, Dr Anona Blackwell is taking the USA by storm, especially among podcasters eager to explore her unique blend of science and spirituality. Her recent appearance on the Jeff Mara Podcast quickly attracted over 23,000 views and a wave of heartfelt feedback from viewers. Her warmth, insight, and candour about her experiences have struck a chord with international audiences. You can watch the episode on YouTube.

The book reveals how, after years of attempting to reconcile her extraordinary experiences, Dr. Blackwell transformed from a scientifically trained medic into a mystic, acknowledging there is far more to life—and to us—than science alone can explain. Her irreverent humour (her account of meeting Prince Charles is unmissable) and ability to bridge medical and metaphysical worlds create a thought-provoking, multi-layered and often amusing read.

By sharing her forays into non-ordinary reality, Dr. Blackwell encourages others to speak more freely about their own experiences—without fear of judgement or being labelled ‘crazy'.

“At the pinnacle of her career as a well-respected British Genitourinary physician, Dr Anona Blackwell decided that there is more to healing than standard drugs and surgery, and bravely embarked on a journey to discover an alternative toolkit – everything from spiritual healing to medical intuition. ‘From Medic to Mystic', which recounts this journey, is nothing less than a blueprint for a new medicine, a wake-up call for every doctor and essential reading for every patient who believes that true healing encompasses the spiritual. Read this book and reclaim your right to true holistic medicine.” – Lynne McTaggart, bestselling author of ‘The Field', ‘The Intention Experiment' and ‘The Power of Eight'.
