YORK COUNTY, Pa. (WHP) — A York County man has pleaded guilty to charges relating to years worth of improper tax return filings.

According to a release from the United States Department of Justice, 45-year-old Waylon Wilcox of Dillsburg filed false income tax returns for years 2021 and 2022.

Authorities said Wilcox had sold 97 pieces of digital artwork from a "CryptoPunks" collection of "10,000 unique art characters."

The DOJ confirmed that:

These "non-fungible tokens", also known as NFTs, Wilcox had sold for millions of dollars but, when filing for taxes, Wilcox checked no when asked if he sold, exchanged, or received virtual currency for his 2021 tax filing.

Wilcox also checked no in 2022 when asked if he received, sold, or exchanged digital assets.

Because of this, Wilcox's underreported income led to his owed taxes being reduced by roughly $3 million between 2021 and 2022.

Wilcox later pleaded guilty on April 9 of 2025 to two counts of filing false individual income tax returns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche called for an end to targeting crypto mixers, while New York Attorney General Letitia James called for a further crackdown on them. On Monday, Deputy Attorney General (DAG) Blanche published a memo entitled “Ending Regulation By Prosecution” in which he stated that the U.S. Department of Justice will stop its crackdown on bitcoin and crypto mixers. Specifically, the Department will no longer target virtual currency exchanges, mixing and tumbling services, and offline wallets for the acts of their end users or unwitting violations of regulations…” The following day, New York Attorney General (NYAG) James co-authored a letter in which she called on congressional leaders to create federal crypto regulation, in part to prevent the use of crypto mixers for illicit purposes. Here's what she and her co-authors had to say about crypto mixers: “Effective legislation must require cryptocurrency platforms to expressly comply with anti-money laundering laws, know your customer (“KYC”) regulations and cyber security protocols to prevent the use of cryptocurrency to finance terrorism, adversarial regimes, and crime. While DAG Blanche gave the benefit of the doubt to users of Bitcoin and crypto mixers, NY AG James implied that all users of such mixers are criminals, as she refers to the technology as “money laundering mixers.” Such language is deeply concerning to hear from the attorney general of a state — much less any lawyer — as it presumes guilt. NY AG James has employed this type of rhetoric around Bitcoin and crypto since she assumed the attorney general role in 2018, and it's unfair because 1.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rising systemic risks and distrust in the Federal Reserve could push investors toward Bitcoin as a safe haven. Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, addressed the issue of rising Treasury yields on April 11, suggesting that they might indicate a shift in investor sentiment away from United States government debt. Kashkari highlighted that the Federal Reserve has tools to provide more liquidity if necessary. While underscoring the importance of maintaining a strong commitment to reducing inflation, Kashkari's remarks signal a possible turning point for Bitcoin (BTC) investors amid growing economic uncertainty. The current 10-year US government bond yield of 4.5% is not unusual. Even if it approaches 5%, a level last seen in October 2023, this does not necessarily mean investors have lost confidence in the Treasury's ability to meet its debt obligations. For example, gold prices only surpassed $2,000 in late November 2023, after yields had already decreased to 4.5%. Rising Treasury yields often signal concerns about inflation or economic uncertainty. This is crucial for Bitcoin traders because higher yields tend to make fixed-income investments more appealing. However, if these rising yields are perceived as a sign of deeper systemic issues—such as waning confidence in government fiscal policies—investors may turn to alternative hedges like Bitcoin. Bitcoin's trajectory will largely depend on how the Federal Reserve responds. Liquidity injection strategies typically boost Bitcoin prices while allowing higher yields could increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth and negatively impacting Bitcoin's price in the short term. One strategy the Federal Reserve could use is purchasing long-term Treasurys to reduce yields. While this approach could temporarily stabilize yields, aggressive bond purchases might signal desperation to control rates. Such a signal could raise concerns about the Fed's ability to manage inflation effectively. These concerns often weaken confidence in the dollar's purchasing power and may push investors toward Bitcoin as a hedge. To counterbalance this liquidity injection, the Fed could impose stricter collateral requirements, such as valuing pledged bonds at 90% of their market price. Instead, they may turn to safe-haven assets such as gold or Bitcoin for protection.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>WASHINGTON, D.C. — The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission could consider a short-term crypto oversight framework to allow firms to keep innovating while the agency works out a more permanent answer to digital assets regulation, interim Chairman Mark Uyeda suggested during a Friday event at the agency's Washington headquarters. "We should consider whether there may be a more efficient method of regulation under an accommodating federal regulatory framework," said Uyeda, in a recorded statement played at the agency's latest crypto industry roundtable. "While the Commission works to develop a long term solution to address these issues, a time-limited, conditional exempt relief framework for registrants and non-registrants could allow for greater innovation with blockchain technology within the United States in the near term." That may happen as soon as later this year, according to the lawmakers working on that effort, but months will pass before its arrival and even longer for the SEC and other relevant federal agencies to write regulations and put them in motion. Once he arrives, though, Uyeda and fellow Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce, a crypto advocate, will still be on board. "What can and should we do in the short term, and what should Congress consider in the longer term to ensure that the regulatory gaps are filled as firms increasingly seek to combine securities and non-securities trading activity?" "Crypto trading platforms are unique because, among other reasons, they often perform multiple services under one roof, sometimes including bridge clearing and custody," said Crenshaw.

The combined $3.1 billion represents about 3% of net flows into BlackRock's products in Q1. As of Friday, BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF had nearly three times the AUM of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, totalling $45 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. BlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF had an AUM of $1.8 billion, less than the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF's $3.46 billion footprint, although the latter is a conversion from an existing fund and has shed $4.1 billion since its ETF debut. Still, investors had less of an appetite for BlackRock's crypto products in the first quarter amid a largely risk-off environment. Ethereum's price meanwhile collapsed 45%,its biggest plunge since Q2 2022), but BlackRock's crypto ETFs still generated inflows. BlackRock, which first tapped Coinbase as a custodian for its crypto ETFs, recently turned to Anchorage Digital. BlackRock disclosed in filings earlier this week that it would now lean on the digital assets trust bank as an additional option for safeguarding digital assets.

So far this year, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has erased the gains it made in 2024 and has been on the hardest receiving end (among major altcoins) of the crypto sell-off we've witnessed in the past month. For comparison, on a YTD basis, ETH has lost ~55%, Bitcoin (

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Momentum trading among smaller cryptocurrencies know as “altcoins” is rising in the current market volatility, according to data from platform PowerTrade. Traders and investors are reportedly hedging their bets and speculating on opportunities with cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL). Trading volume in XRP options soared to over $5 million in the last week as the market see-sawed between gains and losses. PowerTrade says most of the trading activity remains concentrated in short-dated expirations, which one would expect given the current level of volatility in crypto and stocks. The action suggests that investors are anticipating significant short-term price movements and are trying to capitalize on sharp price swings up and down. Traders are betting on whether an asset such as a cryptocurrency's price will rise or fall in a short period of time. The current market ups and downs have enabled traders to bet on, and capitalize from, short swings in prices. PowerTrade says the current activity shows people are engaging in short-term “momentum trading,” which are bets on quick price moves among the likes of Dogecoin. The price of DOGE is currently at $0.16, having declined 52% on the year. Most analysts don't offer ratings or price targets on Dogecoin, so instead we'll look at the cryptocurrencies three-month performance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital assets transactions from Bitcoin, XRP, other cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) must be reported on taxpayer's tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service says that income from digital assets like Bitcoin and other tokens is taxable. About 17% of U.S. adults say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency, according to 2024 findings from the Pew Research Center. As tax season nears its end, here's what to know about reporting report crypto such as Bitcoin to the IRS. The IRS says that individuals who sold crypto, received it as payment, or had other digital asset transactions must accurately report it on their tax return. For tax purposes, the agency treats digital assets as property, not currency. The "Yes" or "No" digital assets question listed on federal income tax returns must be answered correctly: According to an IRS, you answer "yes" if you received digital assets (crypto, Bitcoin, NFTs) as payment for property or services, from a reward or award, from mining, staking and similar activities, and more criteria. Taxpayers must report all income related to their digital asset transactions, the IRS notes, regardless of whether they result in a taxable gain or loss. Here's what the agency recommends when reporting crypto and other digital asset transactions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, SOM hosted the second annual Yale Blockchain Conference. The conference featured panels from a number of industry experts and alums. Included in the lineup was SOM alum and keynote speaker Edison Siu, who organized the first Blockchain Conference at Yale in 2024 and returned to speak about his company, Solo. Solo is a blockchain company that focuses on enhancing user verification within the Web3 ecosystem. Was there a specific problem or moment that sparked the idea? The idea for Solo was sparked during a blockchain course I took at Yale, taught by Professor Ben Fisch. One lecture focused on Worldcoin and its attempt to create a “proof-of-humanity” system using biometric orbs. While Worldcoin's approach was bold, it raised serious concerns around hardware centralization, privacy, and regulatory compliance. That question led me to discuss the concept with two brilliant minds—my now co-founders, Professor Sissi Wu, an AI expert focused on user behavior analytics, and Professor Stephen Wang, a specialist in zero-knowledge cryptography and blockchain architecture. Together, we envisioned a decentralized, privacy-preserving solution for continuous humanity verification—one that didn't rely on proprietary hardware, but could instead leverage widely accessible mobile devices. The more we explored, the more we realized that Sybil attacks were crippling real-world applications across Web3—from airdrops and governance to data labeling and DePIN. Our goal is to build a scalable, secure, and user-friendly proof-of-humanity protocol that enables what we call “credible anonymity”—a future where users can remain anonymous, yet accountable, in the new internet. Can you walk us through your background before launching Solo? Later, while pursuing my MBA at Yale, I led the SOM Blockchain Club and co-organized the first-ever Yale Blockchain Conference in 2024. What does success look like to you personally, and has that definition changed over time? To me, success means creating real, lasting impact on society—building something that doesn't just generate returns, but fundamentally improves how people live, connect, and interact. This definition of success became much clearer after I joined the Yale MBA program, where the school's mission of “educating leaders for business and society” deeply resonated with me. It reinforced my belief that entrepreneurship should serve a broader purpose. One of our biggest technical challenges was building a biometric verification system that is fully decentralized while still protecting user privacy. Most existing solutions either rely on centralized hardware or expose sensitive user data during the process. We wanted Solo to be different—something that works on any mobile device, proves each user is a real, unique person, and preserves privacy at every step. To overcome this, we combined advanced cryptographic tools like homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to verify users while preserving their biometric data. This required close collaboration between our team's expertise in cryptography, blockchain systems, and AI. It took months of iteration and testing, but we ultimately created a scalable and privacy-preserving architecture that can support real-world use cases across Web3. What is your biggest milestone that you've reached to date? Our biggest milestone to date has been securing integration partnerships with a strong lineup of high-impact Web3 projects, including Sapien, Perle AI, GEODNET, Synesis One, and PublicAI. Each of these partners operates in domains where proof-of-humanity is critical—whether it's data labeling, decentralized mapping, or AI alignment—and they've chosen to work with Solo to ensure their user base is made up of real, verified humans, not bots. These agreements not only validate the need for our solution but also give us a direct path to acquiring tens of thousands of users from day one. How do you see Solo contributing to building a more human-centered internet? Solo contributes to building a more human-centered internet by ensuring that every digital interaction is tied to a real, unique person—without compromising privacy. Solo solves this by enabling decentralized biometric verification that is both privacy-preserving and scalable, so users can prove they are human without revealing who they are. Our long-term vision is to enable “credible anonymity,” where users can remain pseudonymous while building verifiable reputations and being held accountable for their actions. This foundational layer of trust unlocks an entirely new form of the Web3 economy—one where users can access uncollateralized loans, meaningful credit scoring, and personalized recommendations, all without sacrificing their privacy. By anchoring digital identity in privacy-preserving but verifiable human authenticity, Solo paves the way for a more equitable, secure, and human-first internet. What advice would you give to other founders working at the edge of privacy tech, crypto, and AI? Stay focused on solving a real human problem - technology should be in service of that. At the intersection of privacy, crypto, and AI, it's easy to get caught up in hype or complexity. But the winning solutions are the ones that are not only technically sound, but also usable, compliant, and clearly aligned with user needs. Build with privacy as a core design principle, not as an afterthought, and surround yourself with collaborators who bring both technical depth and ethical clarity. Yale School of Management Edward P.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the last 24 hours, according to data from Tradingview, the crypto market has recorded surprising performances: some altcoins have posted triple-digit increases, awakening the interest of investors and analysts. Marso.Tech (MARSO), with a growth of +643.63%, dominates the ranking. Despite the scarcity of information about the project, speculative interest seems high, typical of micro-cap. Here too we are talking about a crypto at a very low price (0.000411299 USD) and with an even smaller market cap (93,070 USD). The high relative volume (over 34,000 USD in the last 24h) indicates an unusual trading flow, often a symptom of temporary pumps. The dynamics are similar to those seen with Dogecoin or Shiba Inu: large community, viral narrative, and movement on social media. Similar is the case for Jerry, which marks a +168.72% and even has 1 billion tokens in circulation. BurgerCities (BURGER) grows by +184.76% and stands out from the others due to a more solid base: capitalization of 1.4 million USD and presence in the DeFi and decentralized gaming sector. The daily trading volume is remarkable (almost 600,000 USD), indicating a growing interest in play-to-earn projects. Another example is Kryptomon (KMON), with a +110.08% and a hybrid category between gaming, NFT and collectibles. The current price explosion in many small cap and meme coin could represent the beginning of a new speculative phase: However, this scenario depends on a favorable macro condition and the maintenance of positive sentiment, which currently remains fragile. On the other hand, there are signals that evoke speculative dynamics typical of bubbles: In this context, enthusiasm can quickly turn into panic, especially if Bitcoin were to correct or negative news were to emerge from regulatory authorities. The crypto market continues to prove highly volatile and full of surprises. However, it is important to distinguish between momentary movements and structural trends. The coming days will be crucial to understand if we are at the beginning of a new expansionary cycle or simply in a short speculative rally.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>South Korea leads in digital asset takeover within the last ten years. The digital financial landscape has changed constantly with South Korea being at a crossroads. For many of Korea's youth, digital assets came to symbolize not only a financial instrument, but also an economic opportunity in an otherwise unfair society where avenues of traditional wealth—like real estate—seemed permanently closed. It raised alarm bells concerning rapid growth in trading volume and speculation. It attracted money-laundering, tax evasion, and increased absence of proper investor protection. Also, open-ended markets, lack of transparency, and cyber threats just continued shaking trust. What once considered the booming frontier now began showing signs of fragility. This shift denoted the beginning of a new chapter-the one in which unchecked innovation need no longer be tolerated. While much of the world continues to debate under which laws to treat digital assets, South Korea has taken a more proactive approach. The regulatory bodies began developing a tailored framework that explicitly delineated the responsibilities of market participants, including mandatory registration of trading platforms, extensive anti-money laundering measures, and disclosure requirements aimed at enhancing transparency. By raising the threshold, South Korea would look to push out malefactors and create a fertile ground for responsible development. Clarity was welcomed by some; over-regulation, they felt, would come in the way of innovation and push developers and investors away to jurisdictions with lighter regulations.

By raising the threshold, South Korea would look to push out malefactors and create a fertile ground for responsible development. Clarity was welcomed by some; over-regulation, they felt, would come in the way of innovation and push developers and investors away to jurisdictions with lighter regulations. Something South Korea decides in crypto will echo far beyond its borders. It happens to be one of the most technologically advanced economies in Asia, and thus its policy decisions often serve as a model-or cautionary tale-for its neighbors. Some countries might emulate South Korea's stringent approach, viewing it as a necessary step toward legitimizing an outright industry. Others may take a more laissez-faire stance, hoping to attract talent and capital through lighter regulatory treatment. Of course, the danger with any disunity in regulation is that it invites arbitrage, so that actors simply migrate to jurisdictions with the fewest restrictions. Regulatory and innovation contradictions are inherent in their nature, for as they create an environment free of scam and stabilize the market, it hinders sometimes free innovations or developments. The new regime comes with two-edged swords when this applies to developers and entrepreneurs in South Korea. South Korea knows what to do as authorities learn, adjust and evolve with the environment. Coming changes in regulation will bridge other gaps such as decentralized platforms, digital national identity validation, and cross-border cooperation. Most importantly, a balancing act is needed as any regulatory change is put in place-the extremes of either having too much oversight or too little. Too tight will kill the country's perhaps most innovative financial sector in history, while too lax will leave serious and devastating risks for citizens. Given its reputation for forward-thinking governance and high technological agility, South Korea is poised perfectly to strike the balance. It may be able to protect this market and even shape the future of digital finance in Asia and other parts of the globe. WATCH | Ghibli-Style AI Art Is Everywhere — But At What Cost?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>His perspective – decidedly bullish – neatly supports more technical factors that indicate $BTC, even if it falls further, could be near the end of a correction phase and ready to start another upwards surge. With bullish predictions growing adoption, $BTC's path to $250K is taking shape. Here's how MIND of Pepe ($MIND) could capitalize on the Bitcoin run and reap major rewards for early investors. Bitcoin is once again commanding bullish headlines. Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, shared his Bitcoin price prediction, saying it will hit $250K in 2025 or early 2026. He based his prediction on broader market factors – more on that later – but his instincts align nicely with more technical indicators. First, the bad news: the market's recent turmoil led to a mass round of liquidations, dropping the Open Interest (OI) to market cap ratio from 17% to just over 10%. Liquidations took a lot of positions, and a lot of investors and market players, off the board. But that leads to the good news: the remaining market should be much healthier, with many bad positions gone could be ready to make big moves He notes that macro-economic conditions are uncertain, and a true recession (defined as two consecutive quarters with no economic growth) would throw off his analysis. Or will Trump's tariff turmoil throw things off? In a bold statement on CNBC, Charles Hoskinson claimed $BTC is poised to hit new heights on the back of macroeconomic tailwinds and increasing global stablecoin adoption. And Hoskinson doesn't think the tariffs will ultimately have too much impact. ‘The markets will stabilize a little bit, and they'll get used to the new normal, and then the Fed will lower interest rates, and then you'll have a lot of fast, cheap money, and then it'll pour into crypto.' The ‘new normal,' Hoskinson noted, will return to an earlier era of geopolitics. The current international order will be replaced by great power networks That would turn $BTC, stablecoins, best altcoins, and most of the crypto economy into far more than a cool financial innovation. They would instantly be the cornerstones of a new financial network, capable of transcending competing nations and fiat networks. No wonder Hoskinson's Bitcoin price prediction targets $250K; if he's right, that could be only the beginning. If the bull run starts, and you don't own $BTC – or don't hold enough of it – how can you capitalize on its gains? MIND of Pepe ($MIND) will launch an autonomous agent on X to interact directly with crypto analysts and make its own crypto predictions. Not only that, but MIND will also be able to interact directly with the blockchain. Eventually, that means the AI agent will be able to launch its own tokens, exclusively for $MIND token holders. Will MIND of Pepe be able to out-predict and out-analyze Charles Hoskinson, who co-founded Ethereum, has a decade of crypto experience (a virtual lifetime in crypto terms), and is also behind Cardano, a Top Ten crypto with a market cap of $22B? But MIND of Pepe can build on the meme coin star power of Pepe, combined with cutting-edge AI technology. If Bitcoin price prediction is right and it truly is heading toward $250K, the best altcoins will stand to gain the most, including top trending crypto with a low market cap yet high growth potential like $MIND. With exclusive insights, MIND of Pepe could give $MIND token holders a much-needed leg up on a competitive, bullish market. This is not financial advice, and the crypto market remains highly volatile. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin has swung wildly over the last week as traders ride U.S. president Donald Trump's tariff rollercoaster (with Michael Saylor's Strategy issuing a shock warning). The bitcoin price is holding up following the latest tariff shots fired by Trump and China after plunging along with stock markets in early April—even as Wall Street grapples with a looming “existential threat” from crypto. Now, while traders bet on a Federal Reserve game-changer, the bitcoin price is braced for a dollar "confidence crisis" as the ICE U.S. dollar index plummets to its worst day since 2022. U.S. president Donald Trump is grappling with a growing U.S. dollar "crisis of confidence" that some ... More think could boost the bitcoin price. “The question of a potential dollar confidence crisis has now been definitively answered—we are experiencing one in full force,” ING analysts including Francesco Pesole wrote in a note seen by Bloomberg. "Like a rising tide, the dollar's decline is lifting other assets," Alex Kuptsikevich, the FxPro chief market analyst, said in emailed comments, adding “a falling dollar supports cryptocurrencies.” “Bitcoin's correlation with U.S. equities may have garnered excessive attention, while its ties to Federal Reserve policy and the U.S. dollar's trajectory deserve greater scrutiny,” LMax Group's market strategist Joel Kruger said via email. Trump has been pushing Fed chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates as he embarks on his global trade war, fuelling expectations the Fed could be forced to cut interest rates through 2025, either in response to a tariff-led economic slow down or because Trump has fired Powell. “Market dynamics are shifting as the Fed's outlook adjusts to pressures from U.S. trade policy, with expectations of steeper rate cuts in 2025 now taking hold. This pivot toward a more accommodative stance is poised to narrow yield differentials, weakening the dollar's appeal and, in turn, creating a supportive tailwind for bitcoin," Kruger said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Buterin advocates for integrating privacy tools in wallets and proposes dApp-specific addresses to limit user activity traceability. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a streamlined roadmap to enhance Layer-1 privacy on the blockchain network. In a blog post on April 11, Buterin introduced a framework focused on improving user confidentiality without requiring significant changes to the network's core infrastructure. The proposal targets four distinct areas of privacy, including making on-chain payments private, partially obscuring user actions within decentralized applications, hiding read-access data from the blockchain, and anonymizing network-level communications. He continued that while individual dApp activity may remain visible, the link between a user's actions across multiple platforms would be obscured. The Ethereum co-founder concluded that this approach would offer privacy from observers and infrastructure-level threats like compromised RPC nodes. Buterin's proposal begins with integrating privacy tools such as Railgun directly into Ethereum wallets. He argued that this would let users manage shielded balances without relying on third-party wallets, making privacy more accessible by default. “There should be a ‘send from shielded balance' option, ideally turned on by default. This should all be designed to feel maximally natural from a UX perspective. Users should NOT have to download a separate ‘privacy wallet. While this approach could introduce user experience trade-offs, it significantly limits activity traceability across multiple applications. To support this, send-to-self transactions must preserve privacy by default; a design Buterin views as necessary despite the added complexity. Expanding on this, Buterin explained that such changes align well with existing efforts in cross-chain interoperability, where users already interact with various chains through separate workflows. He pointed out that integrating these features into in-app wallets would help standardize private interactions without major architectural shifts. Buterin also called for technical improvements, such as using TEE-based RPC privacy as a short-term solution and planning to transition to private information retrieval (PIR) when ready. Additional recommendations include connecting each dApp to separate RPC nodes, advancing proof aggregation protocols, and supporting privacy-enhanced keystore wallets. He imparts insights on a range of topics like DeFi, hacks, mining and culture, underlining transformative power. He believes that decentralized technology has the potential to make widespread positive change. Disclaimer: Our writers' opinions are solely their own and do not reflect the opinion of CryptoSlate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This offers a structured path toward robust privacy features that require minimal changes to Ethereum's Layer-1 consensus, thus promising near-term benefits without overhauling the network's core.Layer-1 Unconditional Privacy Buterin's proposal addresses four key areas: privacy of onchain payments, anonymization of onchain activity within applications, safeguarding private reads to the chain (such as RPC calls), and network-level obfuscation. My own current privacy roadmap (much lighter on L1 changes, but also more limited in its consequences): Highly encourage people to read both! Rather than waiting on long-term innovations or radical protocol shifts, Buterin presents an incremental and implementable strategy that could fundamentally change the way Ethereum users experience privacy. Crucially, he calls for Ethereum wallets to natively integrate privacy tools such as Railgun and Privacy Pools, enabling users to maintain a “shielded balance.” Transactions made from this balance would be private by default, streamlining the experience so that users no longer need specialized wallets to ensure confidentiality. To eliminate traceable links between actions taken across different decentralized applications (dApps), Buterin advocates for the use of separate addresses per application by default. While this requires a trade-off in convenience, he believes it is essential to breaking the visible chain of associations that currently compromise user privacy. Together, these standards would allow privacy-focused applications to function without the need for public transaction relays, which will bolster resistance to censorship.The Philosophical Shift Toward Unconditional Privacy He argues that the current paradigm, where users must make deliberate choices, often at the expense of convenience and usability, to shield their activity, is not sustainable. Instead, privacy must become the default, deeply embedded into Ethereum's protocol stack. Buterin's roadmap aligns with this sentiment, advocating for UX-first, protocol-assisted mechanisms that make private activity indistinguishable from public ones. The goal is to create an Ethereum that functions as a maximally private and self-sovereign financial system, not one where privacy is a luxury or afterthought.Scaling Layer-1: How Buterin's Broader Vision for Ethereum Supports Privacy and Resilience Vitalik Buterin's focus on privacy is just one piece of a larger architectural puzzle he's been shaping throughout the year. These changes, he said, would allow Ethereum to process more transactions without undermining its decentralized nature. For Ethereum to remain robust, it must retain a strong and scalable base layer. This same resilience argument underpins his recent blog post advocating for a tenfold increase in L1 gas capacity. The move could support seamless exits and lower transaction costs. While the network recently raised its L1 gas limit from 30 to 36 million (a 20% boost), Buterin believes further scaling is not only justified but essential.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Seen by the industry as an overzealous regulator, he encouraged American crypto firms to band together in a shared strategy: fight his agency's enforcement actions in court, and lobby for the passage of bills that would restrain him from doing more damage. But that is no longer the case, explains Whitehouse-Levine, as crypto has gotten virtually everything that it could have ever wanted in the last election. It now has a pro-crypto president, a Congress that is pushing through legislation with haste, and an SEC chairman in Paul Atkins, who once consulted for some of the very crypto firms he will be regulating. “It's only natural that disparate interests become more pronounced,” Whitehouse-Levine explained. Read More: Coinbase Aims to Jointly Pass Market Structure and Stablecoin Legislation in Congress Everyone for Themself In one prominent example, Coinbase wants a complex market structure bill more relevant for its business passed at the same time as a stablecoin bill, despite many other firms' concerns that such a bundling could delay the passage of any legislation. In the world of stablecoins, the $140 billion Tether is at odds with $45 billion competitor Circle over nuances in upcoming legislation, such as how these tokens would be regulated on secondary markets and reserve requirements governing how their tokens get collateralized. And sometimes, projects now just want to make sure that they have their own seat at the table to address critical issues that could impact their own futures. Ripple Labs, the primary developer behind the $114 billion XRP Ledger blockchain, has ruffled feathers by using its war chest to buy its own access to President Trump and Congress. “Given the amount of money [Ripple's] spending, they're in every single room,” a source familiar with the Solana Policy Institute's thinking said, adding that they weren't aware of any developers building on the XRP Ledger that Ripple Labs could be advocating for. “I don't know what their objectives are other than perpetuating their business model [of selling XRP tokens into the market], if one wants to call it that.” With the SPI, Whitehouse-Levine says he aims to tip the scales in favor of Solana developers, whom he says are not well represented. “Ripple's done a lot over the last 10 years and awareness of them in Washington is pretty strong. We want to make sure there's a Solana-specific voice in the conversation,” he said. A representative for Ripple Labs did not comment on its lobbying efforts. Read More: SEC Drops Its Appeal Against XRP and Ripple — $125 Million Fine Still In Play Solana Stretches Its Legs Aside from the resetting of crypto's relations with Washington, the timing is right for Solana supporters to get more active in lobbying and advocacy. However, there is a lot more activity occurring on the ultrafast, albeit somewhat centralized blockchain behind these speculative tokens. “The throughput that the Solana blockchain affords in terms of the ability to issue a token and trade it quickly, can only happen right now on Solana.” SPI's Funding and Leadership The Solana Policy Institute is a 501(c)4 nonprofit, a type of organization that is not required to disclose its donors. The Solana Policy Institute declined to say the amount of funding they had, which organizations had donated, and which Solana ecosystem projects would be weighing in on their decisions. In order to achieve his mission, Whitehouse-Levine began hiring an influential team. Colin McLaren, who played a key role in designing several highly influential attack ad campaigns against crypto-skeptical politicians and regulators last year at the Cedar Innovation Foundation, was recently hired as SPI's head lobbyist. Read More: Solana Policy Institute Hires One of DC's Most Powerful Lobbyists What the SPI Actually Wants So what does the SPI hope to achieve? Right now the issues they're focused on, according to Whitehouse-Levine, will coincidentally still help developers of other DeFi ecosystems, like that on Ethereum. His fear is that a stablecoin bill could force arduous AML/KYC requirements on small-time developers who incorporate these tokens into their platforms, which would choke stablecoin adoption on Solana. Whitehouse-Levine said he would also like clearer guidelines in the bills describing how decentralized stablecoins are to be regulated, something which he says is ambiguous in the current texts and could hamper innovation if not made distinct from the reporting requirements for centralized stablecoins. These rules are particularly important for Solana, which has a small but growing share of the stablecoin market. More than half of the $232 billion stablecoin market resides on Ethereum. He is also concerned about forthcoming market structure legislation that could treat all crypto projects as financial applications due to the prominence of crypto trading. This could mistakenly force builders of non-financial applications into expensive and arduous compliance frameworks designed to lower financial risks they are not responsible for. Instead, a market structure bill like FIT21 should limit its focus to registrants in the markets, like custodians, dealers, brokers, or exchanges, Whitehouse-Levine argues. In fact, Whitehouse-Levine expects many more blockchains and projects to follow his lead. When asked if he expects to see more blockchain ecosystems form their own policy organizations, Whitehouse-Levine said, “I hope so.

Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, has revealed the latest update to its “Assets Under Consideration” list for the second quarter of 2025. In this latest iteration, Grayscale's “Assets Under Consideration” list features 40 altcoins. Previously, 35 assets were included in the October 2024 version. “We're excited to share this list of assets under consideration for inclusion in future Grayscale investment products,” the blog read. Additionally, Grayscale has excluded Sei, Sonic, and Starknet from the smart contract platforms category. This reduction hints at the firm's recalibration of what it considers to be foundational utilities in the changing crypto sector. It is now incorporated into the smart contract platforms category, signaling a growing interest in the project's potential. Previously, Grayscale's Q2 2025 Top 20 list highlighted Maple Finance, Geodnet, and Story for their strong growth potential. IP, which was previously listed under Utilities and Services, has now been moved to the Consumer and Culture category. Meanwhile, SYRUP has been added to the Financials category, and GEOD has joined Utilities and Services. Grayscale's Q2 2025 update also introduces several assets that have yet to be classified under the Grayscale crypto sectors framework. Among these new additions are Babylon, Berachain, Monad, Movement, Lombard, Mantra, Eliza, DeepBook, and Walrus. Prime Intellect, Sentient, Space, and Time, which were featured in the last list, are also included. “We aim to update this list as frequently as 15 days after quarter-end as the crypto ecosystem expands and the Grayscale team reviews or reevaluates additional assets. The list below is as of April 10, 2025, and is subject to change intra-quarter as some multi-asset funds reconstitute and we launch new single-asset products,” Grayscale noted. Furthermore, two assets that previously appeared on the list, Pyth Network (PYTH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have now joined Grayscale's product suite. Shortly after, on February 18, Grayscale introduced its Pyth Trust. Thus, the market now watches closely to see which of the listed assets will transition from consideration to reality.
