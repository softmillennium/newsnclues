Here, we report results from our characterization of synthetic condensates formed by phase separation of mixtures comprising two types of RNA molecules and the biocompatible polymer polyethylene glycol. Purine-rich RNAs are scaffolds that drive phase separation via heterotypic interactions. Conversely, pyrimidine-rich RNA molecules are adsorbents defined by weaker heterotypic interactions. They adsorb onto and wet the interfaces of coexisting phases formed by scaffolds. Lattice-based simulations reproduce the phenomenology observed in experiments and these simulations predict that scaffolds and adsorbents have different non-random orientational preferences at interfaces. Dynamics at interfaces were probed using single-molecule tracking of fluorogenic probes bound to RNA molecules. These experiments revealed dynamical anisotropy at interfaces whereby motions of probe molecules parallel to the interface are faster than motions perpendicular to the interface. Taken together, our findings have broad implications for designing synthetic condensates with tunable interfacial properties. Biomolecular condensates are compositionally distinct membraneless bodies that form via phase separation of macromolecules1,2,3. Condensates are two- or multi-phase systems that provide spatial and temporal control and organization over biochemical reactions involving proteins and nucleic acids1,2,3,4,5. There is growing interest in developing synthetic condensates with bespoke functions6,7,8,9,10,11. These efforts are being driven by advances in our understanding of the physico-chemical principles underlying the formation and dissolution of condensates in live cells12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 and in vitro14,15,19,20,21,22,23. In live cells, condensates comprise several distinct types of macromolecules24. Additionally, within dense phases of condensates, one often observes a hierarchical organization of the constituent macromolecules. This has been reported for stress granules18,25,26, nucleoli15,27,28, nuclear speckles29, and the mitochondrial nucleoid5. Spatially organized condensates were also shown to arise in simple mixtures30 including ternary systems comprising two different RNA molecules and an arginine-rich peptide31. Increased attention is being paid to interfaces of condensates22,32,33,34. A recent computational study predicted that in condensates comprising a single type of polymer in a solvent, the polymers that drive condensation, referred to as scaffolds, prefer non-random, orthogonal orientations with respect to the plane of the interface33,34. Additionally, the electrostatic fields at interfaces39, generated by interphase potentials40, can affect condensate fusion41, catalyze redox reactions42, and resist the transport of molecules moving from dilute to dense phase or vice versa43. Notably, RNA molecules can be scaffolds that drive phase separation from the bulk, or they can adsorb onto interfaces of condensates formed by scaffolds. Understanding why specific RNA molecules are scaffolds versus adsorbents is relevant for understanding how RNA-based condensates function in cells44. It is also relevant for designing de novo condensates based on protein-RNA mixtures. We investigated the principles underlying spatial organization in condensates formed by ternary mixtures using a model system that comprises a biocompatible polymer, namely polyethylene glycol (PEG)45, and pairs of homopolymeric, non-base-pairing RNA molecules such as poly-adenine (poly-rA), which is a poly-purine, and poly-cytosine (poly-rC), which is a poly-pyrimidine46. Our investigations were motivated by a general framework anchored in the Gibbs adsorption isotherm47, and the physics of adsorption-mediated wetting transitions48. We studied adsorption in ternary mixtures, and we investigated the effects of polymer interaction strengths, concentrations, lengths, and stiffness on adsorption. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we quantified the orientation of molecules at the interface that leads to the distinction of condensate components being scaffolds versus adsorbents. We also report results from single-molecule super resolution imaging, which reveals the movement of molecules near the interface. Near the interface, we observed significantly faster motion in the parallel direction than in the perpendicular direction. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our findings for the design of de novo condensates with specific spatial organization and interfacial properties. Heterotypic PEG-RNA interactions provide the driving forces for forming condensates in the model ternary systems45,49,50. Increasing the concentration of PEG alters the chemical potential of PEG and promotes phase separation. Increasing the concentration of NaCl weakens electrostatic repulsions between RNA molecules, and this also promotes phase separation40,46. We first obtained a coarse mapping of the overall phase behaviors as a function of NaCl and PEG concentrations. Poly-rA undergoes phase separation in the presence of sufficient PEG and NaCl (Fig. The concentration of NaCl required to drive phase separation decreases as the concentration of PEG increases, and the slope of the phase boundary becomes zero above 3% w/w of PEG. For these concentrations of PEG, the poly-rA + PEG mixture undergoes phase separation for all NaCl concentrations that are above 0.5M. a Poly-rA (1 g/L) undergoes phase separation in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl and PEG, b forming spherical (ii) or irregularly-shaped condensates. c poly-rC (1 g/L) phase separation requires higher concentrations of NaCl and PEG d to form spherical condensates. e The dense phases in a mixture of poly-rA (1 g/L) and poly-rC (1 g/L) show a range of condensate architectures. At low concentrations of PEG (i of f) or low concentrations of NaCl (I of g) the dense phase is homogenous. Increasing either the concentration of PEG or NaCl, poly-rA forms condensates and some poly-rC is recruited into it (ii of f, II or g). Notably, poly-rC adsorbs to the interface. At higher concentrations of PEG, for fixed NaCl, or higher concentrations of NaCl for fixed PEG, the adsorbed poly-rC undergoes phase separation leading to a poly-rA-rich phase coexisting with a poly-rC-rich phase. Adsorption of poly-rC around the poly-rA dense phase is still observed (iv of panel f, VI and VII of g). All scale bars in the confocal images represent 3 μm. Confocal images show representative examples of observations on 50 or more condensates. While poly-rC also undergoes phase separation, higher amounts of PEG and NaCl are required (Fig. This shows that poly-rA drives phase separation through stronger interactions when compared to poly-rC31,46,51. In these systems where base-pairing is not possible, we reasoned that the double rings of poly-purines make them more hydrophobic and allow for stronger π-stacking than poly-pyrimidines52. Stronger interactions in purine-rich systems can also engender dynamically arrested phase separation31,46,51, giving rise to irregular mesoscale structures that are dominated by long-lived intermolecular crosslinks. Here, we observed dynamically arrested percolated networks for poly-rA and not for poly-rC (Fig. 1b, d)—an observation that is consistent with recent reports53. Next, we mapped phase boundaries for ternary mixtures of PEG plus a 1:1 ratio of poly-rA and poly-rC (Fig. In the absence of PEG and 0.75 M NaCl, we did not observe phase separation (i, Fig. Increasing the PEG concentration to 2% w/w, leads to crossing of the phase boundary and formation of a poly-rA-rich phase that coexists with a dilute phase (ii, Fig. The extent of adsorption increased with increasing concentration of PEG (iii, Fig. When the concentration threshold for forming poly-rC-rich phases was crossed, we observed the formation of three coexisting phases: a dilute phase that coexists with poly-rA- and poly-rC-rich phases, with an interface between the latter two phases (iv, Fig. Notably, poly-rC still adsorbed to the poly-rA interfaces. The transition from two coexisting phases with adsorption to three coexisting phases is known as a wetting transition48. We observed similar wetting transitions when varying the concentration of NaCl. In 4% PEG and 0.25 M NaCl, the system formed a homogeneous solution (I, Fig. In the presence of 0.5 M NaCl, poly-rA formed condensates and poly-rC partitioned into and adsorbed onto the interface of the poly-rA-rich phase (II, Fig. Between 0.75 M and 1.25 M NaCl, we observed what Kaplan et al.48 refer to as complete wetting whereby poly-rC formed a well-defined, micron-scale layer at the interface (III-V, Fig. At 1.5 M NaCl and above, we observed a distinct poly-rC-rich phase that coexists with a poly-rA-rich phase (VI, VII, Fig. The cascade of transitions we observed for poly-rC can be explained as follows: At low salt concentrations, poly-rC is an adsorbent, forming favorable interactions with PEG molecules at the interface. Increasing the salt concentration beyond the levels that saturate the interface leads to the formation of two coexisting phases defined by favorable poly-rA and PEG interactions (the poly-rA-rich phase) and less favorable poly-rC-PEG interactions, which gives rise to the poly-rC-rich phase. The line scans show the coexistence of poly-rA-rich and poly-rC-rich phases separated by a poly-rC-rich interface (VI VII, Fig. Note that increasing the salt concentration enhances the heterotypic PEG-poly-rC interactions and homotypic poly-rC interactions. To assess the transferability of our findings to other systems, we explored the phase behaviors of a range of RNA homopolymers. Specifically, we explored the ability of rA20, rA80, poly-rA, rC20, rC80, poly-rC, rU20, rU80, poly-rU and rG20 to adsorb onto condensates of poly-rA, poly-rC and/or poly-rU with PEG (Figs. The interaction strengths between the RNA and PEG are influenced by whether the RNA is a poly-pyrimidine or poly-purine. Out of the 35 unique combinations that were explored, we observed a clear trend whereby poly-pyrimidines (rC, rU) adsorb onto dense phases rich in poly-purines. This observation is consistent with the fact that the poly-rA, which is a poly-purine, is a stronger driver of phase separation with PEG (Fig. Taken together, our results suggest that in ternary mixtures, the differences in the relative interaction strengths determine which RNAs are scaffolds and which RNAs are adsorbents that drive phase separation and concentration-dependent wetting transitions. Next, we compared the relative interaction strengths between PEG and different RNAs by comparing low concentration arms (dashed line) and tie lines of phase diagrams of different ternary mixtures and tie lines (solid lines) (Fig. A sample with a total composition of ϕtotal separates into a dilute phase (blue circle with composition ϕdilute) and dense phase (blue square with composition ϕdense). The tie line connects the points ϕdilute, ϕtotal, and ϕdense. The slopes of tie lines quantify the relative contributions of homotypic versus heterotypic interactions in the RNA and PEG system. A positive slope points to favorable heterotypic interactions driving the formation of condensates, whereas a negative slope indicates that heterotypic interactions are unfavorable. We mapped phase diagrams using a previously established microfluidics platform49,50,54, creating ~104 samples with varying amounts of RNA and PEG. The approach known as “PhaseScan” scans and sorts of a wide cross section of samples, annotating these as homogeneous (blue) or two-phase systems containing condensates (red). The totality of measurements across the entire spectrum of PEG and RNA concentrations that were scanned helps in mapping the boundary between the one-phase and two-phase regimes (Fig. Additionally, we use the concentrations of RNA in the coexisting dilute phase to infer proxies for tie lines (Fig. This is a way to leverage data from high throughput scanning and estimate a useful proxy for the actual tie line (Fig. a Tie lines show how a sample with total composition ϕ separates into a dilute phase (blue circle) and dense phase (blue square). Tie line angles quantify the repulsion versus attraction of molecules in the two phases (Fig. S4), we can delineate a phase boundary (dashed line) and obtain proxies for tie lines using dilute phase concentrations. Phase diagrams of d poly-rA (1 g/L) and e poly-rC (1 g/L) generated using a microfluidic platform. Solid lines show the tie line proxies. Phase separation requires less PEG for poly-rA (d), than for poly-rC (e). Full lines show a tie line proxy. The tie line proxy of poly-rA with PEG (c) is steeper than that of poly-rC with PEG (d). This indicates that PEG interacts stronger with poly-rA than with poly-rC. Analysis of the microfluidics data (Fig. S4) helps with delineation of the low concentration arms of phase boundaries for the poly-rA plus PEG (Fig. 2d) and poly-rC plus PEG systems (Fig. As expected, poly-rA undergoes phase separation at lower PEG concentrations than poly-rC. The slopes of the tie line proxies are positive for both mixtures, indicating favorable heterotypic interactions between RNA and PEG and partitioning of both PEG and RNA into the dense phases. Notably, tie line proxies for poly-rA with PEG are larger than for poly-rC with PEG. This implies that the favorable interactions between poly-rA and PEG are stronger than the favorable interactions for poly-rC with PEG49,50. Taken together with the data in Fig. 1, we arrive at a phenomenological explanation of the adsorption data. Poly-rA and PEG interact favorably, and this drives phase separation with the dense phases being enriched in both species even at moderate PEG concentrations. The favorable interactions between poly-rC and PEG are weaker when compared with poly-rA. This allows poly-rC to partition into the poly-rA + PEG rich phase. Partitioning of poly-rC into poly-rA-rich phases creates a competition between poly-rA and poly-rC. The latter cannot compete effectively for interactions within the dense phase, and as a result, the partitioning is weak, and it adsorbs onto the interface of the poly-rA-rich phase. At the interface, poly-rC can interact with PEG that is not engaged in interactions with poly-rA. The adsorbent undergoes a cascade of wetting transitions based on the concentration of the adsorbent. To put these observations on a quantitative footing, we turned to computations to explore how adsorption depends on interaction strengths (Fig. a The interaction strengths between polymer beads used in the simulations. The interaction between beads of polymers A and B was varied from –4 to –4.5. b Molecules A, B, C represent poly-rA, PEG and poly-rC respectively. c Representative snapshots from LaSSI simulations showing distinct condensate architectures obtained by varying the interaction strength between beads of polymers A and B, |εB-A | = –4, –4.25, –4.5. For this same titration, we show d the radial density profiles and e the average cos2θ values, which indicate the average orientation of molecules with respect to the center of the condensate (Supplementary Methods). If a given datapoint had an error greater than 0.1, then that datapoint was omitted. In d and e, error bars indicate the standard errors about the mean across three replicates. The interaction between beads of polymers A and B was set to a |εB-A | = –4, or b |εB-A | = –4.5. We observe that molecule length affects partitioning into dilute or dense phase. Notably, varying length does not cause polymer C to a adsorb when it previously did not, or b stop adsorbing when it previously did. The interaction strength between the monomers has a much more extensive effect on condensate architecture and interface organization than the length of the polymer. If a given datapoint had an error greater than 0.1, then that datapoint was omitted. Error bars indicate the standard errors about the mean across three replicates. We modeled phase behaviors in polymer mixtures using coarse-grained, single bead per monomer representations as implemented in LaSSI55, which is a lattice-based simulation engine (Fig. We simulated mixtures of three distinct homopolymers labeled A, B, and C. These bead-string-bead polymers were designed to be phenomenological mimics of poly-rA, PEG, and poly-rC, respectively. Distances between beads are quantified in terms of lattice units (l.u.) For calibration, if the polymer of interest were to follow Gaussian statistics, then the mean end-to-end distance of a single chain would be n1/2 where n is the number of Kuhn monomers that make up the chain. Accordingly, for polymers comprising n = 100, 250, 300, or 400 beads, the mean end-to-end distance of Gaussian chain equivalents would be 10 l.u., 15.8 l.u., 17.3 l.u., and 20 l.u., respectively. Polymer B is parameterized to drive condensate formation via heterotypic interactions with polymers A and C. The microscopic pairwise interactions between monomers of the polymers (εx-y) are −2 kBT for most combinations, −4 kBT for B-C and we query the effects of varying the interaction strengths for B-A (Fig. 3a, b, see Supplementary Material). Here, we used normalized units of kB = 1. By maintaining equivalent polymer concentrations and varying εB-A, we obtained three possible architectures (Fig. If |εB-A | = |εB-C | = −4 kBT, then a uniform dense phase is obtained since A and C are equivalent. For |εB-A | = −4.25 kBT, the stronger B-A interaction increases the concentration of B and A within the dense phase and displaces polymer C to the condensate interface and dilute phase. If |εB-A | = −4.5 kBT, polymer C is mostly excluded from the condensate interior, but its concentration remains highest at the interface. Adsorption is observed for the polymer C characterized by its weaker interaction with the scaffold B. Notably, adsorption is observed in cases where polymer C partitions preferentially into the dense phase over the dilute phase (ii) and where it partitions preferentially into the dilute phase over the dense phase (iii). For |εB-A | = −4.5 kBT, we investigated the effect of polymer concentration on adsorption. Simulations were performed with 100 molecules of A and B, with 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 molecules of C (Fig. Molecules of C adsorb preferentially to the interface, with very similar partitioning irrespective of concentration over this range. Increasing the number of A molecules or decreasing the number of B molecules reduces the number of interactions B can have with C thus increasing the dilute phase concentration of C (Fig. Decreasing the number of A molecules and increasing the number of B molecules has the opposite effect, increasing the partitioning of C in the dense phase (Fig. Notably, while partitioning is affected, molecules of C still adsorb, albeit weakly, to the interface, highlighting the importance of monomer interaction strength over polymer concentration. Next, we consider the effect of polymer length on adsorption (Figs. For molecules with a length of 250, |εB-A | = −4 kBT does not result in adsorption (Fig. Starting in a situation where we observe adsorption for molecules with a length of 250, |εB-A | = −4.5 kBT, varying the length of the polymers again affects partitioning (Fig. Notably, it does not prevent polymer C from adsorbing (Fig. We concluded that relative interaction strengths are the most important variable in determining whether polymers adsorb to interfaces. We also considered the effect of polymer stiffness on adsorption (Fig. We varied molecule stiffness using a bond angle potential of the form: u(1 − cos2θ). Here, θ is the bond angle at the intersection of three consecutive beads in a chain and u quantifies the amplitude of the stiffness. For flexible polymers, we set u = 0 whereas for stiff polymers, we set u = 200. As with flexible polymers, setting |εB-A | = −4kBT, does not lead to adsorption even for stiff polymers (Fig. As far as adsorption is concerned, the results for |εB-A | = −4.5 kBT are equivalent for stiff versus flexible polymers (Fig. We conclude that of the four variables considered, relative monomer interaction strength is the key determinant of condensates architecture with respect to adsorption. Farag et al.,33 introduced an order parameter to quantify the orientation of polymers with respect to the interfaces of condensates. In their simulations, the system had only one type of polymer. We adapted their approach and analyzed the simulations to determine the orientations of polymers A, B and C in our simulations (Fig. Note that the solvent is pseudo implicit, defined by an absence of direct interactions, but the vacant sites on the lattice do represent solvent molecules. Specifically, we determined the angle θ swept out by the condensate center-of-mass, a given polymer bead i, and another bead on the same polymer that is exactly 100 beads apart from bead i. In contrast, if θ is close to 90°, which corresponds to cos2θ values close to 0, then the 100-bead segment is essentially parallel to the interface. In the case of a polymer that has a random orientation, cos2θ = 0.33 (Fig. When |εB-A| = |εB-C| = −4 kBT, all polymers have random orientations, except at the interface, where there is a bias toward perpendicular orientations. We also computed the orientational preferences in the case of adsorption realized for |εB-A | = −4.25 or −4.5 kBT. In the dense and dilute phases, orientations are random. However, at the interface, polymer A and B have an enhanced perpendicular orientation. At the highest concentration of polymer C, ~30 l.u. from the center of the condensate, we observe that polymer C has a more parallel orientation. These results suggest that in a quartenary system with three types of polymers and a pseudo implicit solvent, polymers that behave as scaffolds, namely polymers A and B, minimize the overall interfacial free energy density by adopting more orthogonal orientations at the interface. In contrast, the homopolymer C contributes to minimizing the overall interfacial free energy density by preferring a more parallel orientation. Condensate formation by the scaffold molecules A and B drives a more parallel orientation for molecules of type C because the relative interaction strengths are such that |εB-A| > |εB-C|. Taken together with published work, the following rules emerge regarding the orientational preferences of different types of molecules at interfaces of different types of condensates. In a two-component system comprising a single type of polymer in a solvent, enhancing the driving forces for phase separation leads to a diminished preference for more perpendicular orientations of the polymer and an increased preference for more parallel orientations at the interface34,56. These results imply that there are two distinct ways to minimize the interfacial free energy density in the polymer plus solvent systems. One, which is realized via a preference for more perpendicular orientations, helps maximize the number of polymer sections at the interface while minimizing the number density of unsatisfied interactions per chain. The second, which becomes necessary as the driving forces for phase separation become stronger, is a preference for more parallel orientations. This limits the number of chains at the interface while maximizing the interfacial area covered by each chain. In the quaternary systems comprising three types of polymers and a solvent, the scaffold polymers which are stronger drivers of phase separation prefer a more perpendicular orientation when compared to the adsorbent polymers, which prefer more parallel orientations. This allows for scaffolds to prefer a more perpendicular orientation because it reduces the number density of scaffold segments that need to be exposed at the interface. Thus, the adsorbent thus provides a degree of freedom that is absent in the binary mixture comprising a single type of polymer and a solvent. It is worth emphasizing that scaffolds and adsorbents will align in directions that are both perpendicular and parallel to the interface, with there being a statistical preference of the adsorbents for more parallel orientations. To further investigate interfacial properties of the condensates, we leveraged advances in single-molecule tracking which allowed us to ask if molecules near the interface display anisotropic motions57,58,59,60. Specifically, we tracked the movement of single poly-rA molecules (blue) in condensates near interfaces (Fig. YO-PRO-1 (oxazole yellow) is an RNA binding dye which can diffuse into a poly-rA condensate and intercalate with the RNA. Under continuous excitation, YO-PRO-1 is dark and only emits fluorescence while bound to RNA, due to its fluorogenic nature (yellow squares)61,62. Over time, and depending on the laser power, some of the dyes can be bleached (black square). At low laser power, the poly-rA-rich phase is bright, while the dilute phase is dim (i, Fig. Increasing the laser power results in significant bleaching and the middle of the poly-rA-rich phase becomes dark (ii, Fig. At very high laser power, we observe YO-PRO-1 molecules mostly near the interface, which corresponds to a full width at half maximum of ~123 nm. This is due to the combination of constant bleaching and new dye molecules entering the condensate via the interface (iii, Fig. a YO-PRO-1 is a fluorogenic RNA intercalating dye with a strong preference for binding to poly-rA over poly-rC. Initially dark, the dye can move into the condensates and bind to poly-rA to become bright (orange). We track the location of the dye every 10 ms until it is bleached (black). b The field of view within the condensate is excited at various laser strengths, bleaching increasingly more bound dye molecules until single molecules can be localized. From diffraction-limited imaging, line profiles (schematized using dashed lines) yield mean (solid) and standard deviation (shaded) of the number of photons/pixel in (i) and (ii). Super-resolution imaging allows quantification of the localization density of YO-PRO-1 near the interface, since the condensate is constantly bleached, and fresh dye molecules move into the condensate through the interface. The histogram in (iii) shows that the full width at half maximum is ~123 nm. Six independent experiments were repeated with similar results. c The trajectory in the x and y-directions is converted to the displacement parallel (aqua) or perpendicular (red) with respect to the interface. d Trajectories (multiple displacements) of poly-rA molecules in a poly-rA-PEG condensate. e Displacements of the trajectories shown in (d). We fit the displacement information with 2D Gaussian distributions for trajectories f near interfaces and g in the interior of the condensate. Insets, scatters of (orange) interface YO-PRO-1 localizations and (gray) interior localizations. h The standard deviation in perpendicular and parallel motions for six condensates for trajectories near interfaces: poly-rA dense phase with dilute phase (rA-dil, orange), poly-rA dense phase with poly-rC adsorbed to the dilute phase (rA-rC-dil, yellow), and poly-rA dense phase with poly-rC dense phase (rA-rC, purple). In the interior of poly-rA condensates (interior rA, dark gray) and inside of poly-rA condensates in touch with poly-rC droplets (interior rA-rC, light gray), we observe no anisotropy. Scale bars, b, 1 μm, d and insets of f and g, 500 nm, e–g, 50 nm. The high laser power allowed us to track single YO-PRO-1 molecules using 10 ms camera frames and eliminated signals further away from the interface. We interpret a continuous burst of fluorescence as a single YO-PRO-1 molecule emitting while bound to a single poly-rA molecule before photobleaching or dissociation. We thus obtained trajectories of the poly-rA molecules, which we converted from displacements in the x and y-directions to displacements parallel or perpendicular to the interface for each 10 ms step (Fig. Aligning the origin of each displacement to a common location, we were able to track the movement of molecules (Fig. To ensure an unambiguous separation between the condensate interior and interface, we chose a segmentation threshold that guards against finite size artifacts, and we split the displacement data into two segments that are within 300 nm of the interface (Fig. 5f) and further away from the interface (Figs. However, the interface itself is made up of a region that is at the outermost edge of the condensate, constituting a 50 nm band that can be accessed via single fluorogen tracking. We fit the trajectories constituting 104 displacements to a 2D Gaussian obtaining the mean and standard deviation (ellipses) traversed in the parallel and perpendicular directions from the starting location (black dot). We find that closest to the interface, the movements parallel to the interface are significantly faster than movements perpendicular to the interface. This effect disappears as we track movements that progressed into the interior of the dense phase. Figure 5h shows the standard deviation of poly-rA molecules movement of six condensates near three types of interfaces: poly-rA dense phase with dilute phase (pA-dil, orange), poly-rA dense phase with poly-rC adsorbed to the dilute phase (pA-pC-dil, yellow), and poly-rA dense phase with poly-rC dense phase (pA-pC, purple). These data points are off the diagonal, supporting the conclusion that motions of the dyes parallel to the interface are consistently faster than motions of the dye that are perpendicular to the interface. We did not observe anisotropies of motions within the interior of poly-rA-rich phases (interior rA, dark gray) or inside poly-rA-rich phases that are in contact with poly-rC-rich phases (interior rA-rC, light gray). Our findings regarding the anisotropies of motions at interfaces are in accord with predictions from theory63. For a sphere near a liquid-liquid interface, a higher drag in the perpendicular direction, which translates to lower speeds in this direction when compared to the parallel direction was predicted as being a consequence of the incompressibility of a fluid-fluid interface63,64,65. Additionally, the interface may limit movement to the dilute phase and thereby reduce perpendicular motion (Fig. Overall, our findings may be summarized as follows: In ternary mixtures comprising pairs of RNA molecules forming condensates via heterotypic interactions with PEG, we find that pyrimidine-rich RNAs adsorb onto and wet the interfaces of condensates. These results allowed us to classify molecules as scaffolds or adsorbents. The classification is bolstered by simulations that reproduce the phenomenology observed in experiments. From the simulations we learned that the identities of adsorbents versus scaffolds are governed by the relative monomer interaction strengths among different molecules. Overall, in a system comprising molecules A, B, and C where A and C interact favorably with B, we obtain the following results: If the A-B interactions are stronger than the B-C interactions, then the C molecules not only partition into the A-B-rich phase, but they also adsorb onto the interface of the A-B-rich phase. Adsorption appears to be the consequence of a balance whereby the C molecules cannot outcompete the stronger A-B interactions, and they can gain access to B molecules at the interface that are not engaged in interactions with A molecules. Increasing the concentration of the C molecules, such that the threshold for phase separation with B molecules is crossed, leads to a cascade of wetting transitions that eventually lead to A-rich, C-rich, and dilute phases coexisting with one another48. While polymer concentration, length and stiffness can affect partitioning into the dense or dilute phases, the computations show that the key determinant of adsorption and condensate architecture is the relative monomer interaction strength. The computations, which reproduced the phenomenology observed in mesoscale experiments, show that molecules at interfaces have non-random orientational preferences with respect to the planes of interfaces22,33. In the ternary system, where phase separation is designed to be driven by purely heterotypic interactions, the stronger drivers of phase separation have a more perpendicular orientation to the interface whereas the weaker drivers, which are adsorbents, prefer more parallel orientations. These results contrast with recent discoveries in condensates formed purely via homotypic interactions34,56. There, comparing across different condensates defined by different interaction strengths or valence, the stronger drivers were found to have more parallel orientations compared to weaker drivers34,56. Taken together with work regarding the interplay between homotypic and heterotypic interactions22, our findings suggest that it should be possible to tune condensate architectures and interfacial structures by modulating the relative strengths of scaffold versus adsorbent interactions in multicomponent systems. Recent studies have shown that the viscoelasticities of condensates can be modeled using graph-theoretic adaptations of the Rouse model that capture the underlying network-like organization of molecules within condensates66,67. The eigenvalues of the graph Laplacians are sufficient for capturing the measured, frequency-dependent viscous and storage moduli66,67. Therefore, it seems reasonable to expect that the interfacial viscoelasticity, which likely originates from interfacial structural anisotropy, also underlies the dynamical anisotropy reported in this work. What is needed are suitable theoretical advancements that enable predictive modeling and reasoning of how adsorbents and scaffolds contribute differently to multiscale structural and dynamical anisotropies in multicomponent condensates. The corpus of simulation results furnished here provides a useful starting point for the development of the relevant theoretical formalism. The interface is characterized by dynamical anisotropy whereby movement in the parallel direction is faster than in the perpendicular direction. There are three possible explanations for the dynamical anisotropy that we observed using single molecule tracking: The presence of a planar interface, which is a reasonable approximation of the condensate interface at length scales of a probe molecule, will generate higher drag forces in directions that are perpendicular to the interface when compared to the parallel direction63. This comes from the incompressibility of fluid-fluid interfaces. Alternatively, differences in viscosity between the dense and dilute phases, which must be balanced at the interface69, are also likely to be contributors to the observed dynamical anisotropy. A third scenario pertains to the dynamical anisotropy being determined by the structural anisotropy that combines anisotropy observed on the mesoscale70 and the molecular-scale anisotropy that we report in this work. Our observations, which were derived using generic, biocompatible, and biologically relevant homopolymers, help explain the phenomenology of adsorption that has been reported in cells70,71,72. Since multiphase condensates create internal interfaces27,72, we propose that the internal interfaces between dense phases might provide additional spatial and temporal control over biochemical interactions. Specifically, interfaces between coexisting dense phases, as well as interfaces between coexisting dilute and dense phases, are likely to provide distinct environments for molecules to accumulate and interact. Adsorption and wetting transitions at interfaces are also relevant for the design of condensates with tunable catalytic functions, given observations from the microdroplet literature which show that reaction efficiencies can be enhanced by orders of magnitude at the interfaces of coexisting phases73. Recent studies have shown that condensates are defined by interphase electric potentials15,40, and this can help set up interfacial electric fields39. In spatially organized condensates, there can be internal and external interfaces that can be engineered to minimize off-target reactions in biochemical reactions involving multi-enzyme pathways73. Overall, our work shows how rules can be extracted for designing condensates with bespoke interfacial structure and dynamics. Our results highlight key physical principles that govern the formation of spatially heterogeneous condensates. Additional considerations of site- or chemistry-specific associative interactions are likely to provide further tunability to the spatial organization of macromolecules within and around condensates. Poly-rA (MW 700-3500 kDa, 10108626001), PEG (average MW~20,000), Poly-rC (average MW 118 kDa, P4903), HEPES, NaCl, KCl, ethanol and mPEG(5k)silane were obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Alexa Fluor™ 647 Carboxylic Acid, Alexa Fluor™ 488 Carboxylic Acid and RNAase free water were obtained from Thermo Fisher. PEG(20k)-AF647 was purchased from Nanocs. Sylgard 184 Elastomer base and curing agent were purchased from Dow Corning Corporation. 18 × 18 mm glass slides were purchased from Academy. 24 × 60 mm No.1.5 glass slides were purchased from DWK Life Sciences. (T)20-AF488, (C)20-AF546 and other oligos were purchased from GenScript. The details of the preparation of imaging wells for confocal microscopy are essentially identical to those of Erkamp et al.74. As described in that work, we used PDMS slabs of 3 mm in height. These were fabricated by mixing Sylgard 184 Elastomer base and curing agent at a 10:1 ratio and heating at 65 °C for 1.5 h. All additional details are as described in Erkamp et al.74. The wells and 18 × 18 mm glass slides used to seal the top of wells were treated with PEG-silane, using a method based on recommended protocols75 and previous reports30. The treatment solution was prepared by mixing 10 mg of PEG(5000)silane with 20 µL of glacial acetic acid and 1 mL of ethanol. Wells and glass slides were treated by placing them in solution for 1 h at 65 °C and afterwards washing them thoroughly with water. Treated devices were not used after more than 3 weeks from the time of the initial treatment. These methods were essentially identical to the protocols established in previous work74. All condensates were prepared and imaged at room temperature (~20 °C). Condensates of poly-rA and or poly-rC with PEG were prepared by mixing stock solutions in an Eppendorf tube in the following order: PEG, buffer, RNA, salt. All solutions were prepared in RNAase free water. The poly-rA and poly-rC concentrations were determined with a nanodrop machine by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Poly-rA and poly-rC were fluorescently labelled by incubation of 0.5 mol% of (T)20-AF488 or (C)20-AF546 for 3 min at 80 °C. The sample was placed in an imaging well and sealed airtight. A Leica Stellaris 5 confocal microscope (confocal fluorescence imaging) (white light laser) microscope equipped with a 63× oil immersion Leica 1.4 NA was used for imaging. Further analysis of pictures was performed using Fiji76. Standard lithography processes were used to fabricate the microfluidic devices54,77. The AutoCAD (AutoDesk) software was used to design the devices, which were printed on a photomask (Micro Lithography). A 45 µm layer of SU8-3050 photoresist (Microchem) was spun on a silicon wafer and heated at 95 °C for 15 min. The photomask was placed on top, and the pattern was placed onto the wafer using exposure to UV light and heating at 95 °C for 15 min. Propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA) was used to remove excess unreacted SU8-3050. The wafer was dried and a profilometer was used to confirm the height of the device. PDMS at 1:10 curing agent:base ratio was placed on top of the mould and heated at 65 °C for 1.5 h. The PDMS was cleaned, holes were punched into inlets and outlets, the PDMS substrate was then bonded to glass slides using a plasma oven (30 s, 40% power, Femto, Diener Electronics). The interior of the device was treated with 1% trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (Sigma) in HFE-7500 (Fluorochem), before being dried and heated at 95 °C for 1 min. Aqueous droplets in oil of an average volume of 100 pL were created at ~100 droplets per second using a microfluidics setup as shown schematically in Fig. Specifically, a solution of fluorescently labelled 104 ng/μL poly-rA or poly-rC was mixed with a solution of fluorescently labelled 20% w/w PEG and a solution with buffer at varying rates while a constant amount of KCl solution was added, all of which were being encapsulated in fluorinated oil (HFE-7500 Fluorochem with 1% v/v fluorosurfactant), flowing at constant speed. To flow the solutions into the microfluidic device, syringes (Hamilton 1710) and syringe pumps (neMESYS modules, Cetoni) were used. Syringes were connected to the microfluidic device using tubing (PTFE, 0.012“ID × 0.030”OD, Cole-Parmer). The 100 pL droplets were created by a total aqueous flow rate of 60 μL/h and the oil flow rate of 150 μL/h. After a 5-min incubation period, the aqueous droplets in oil were imaged simultaneously at the wavelength corresponding to poly-rX (488 or 546 nm) and PEG (647 nm). These images were analyzed using a Python program54 to determine the concentrations of these compounds and the presence or absence of condensates. Additionally, the dilute phase concentration of poly-rX was determined by calibrating the intensity of 488 or 546 in an area absent of condensates to concentration poly-rX concentration. Each droplet gives information for one datapoint in Fig. The boundaries were determined using fitting that is based on support vector machine-based methods. The tie lines were fitted between the datapoints classified as being “condensates” by grouping them based on their poly-rX dilute phase concentration. Simulations were performed using LaSSI, a lattice-based Monte Carlo engine, which allowed us to simulate large condensates without sacrificing efficiency22,33,55. Monte Carlo moves are accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis-Hastings criterion so that the probability of accepting a move is equal to min(1, exp(–βΔE)), where β = 1/kT. Here, kT is the simulation temperature (set to 55 in units of k = 1) and ΔE is the change in total system energy associated with the attempted move. Total system energies were calculated using a nearest neighbor model and the following interaction energies: eA-A =  εB-B = εC-C = εA-C = –2; εB-C = –4; εB-A was –4, –4.25, or –4.5. Unless stated otherwise, each simulation involves 102 distinct polymers of each type. The lattice spacing is one unit L = 1 and the simulation volume is a cubic lattice comprising 150 × 150 × 150 = 3.375 × 106 lattice sites. Each bead of the polymer occupies a single lattice site. In the simplest scenario, each type A, type B, and type C chain is 250 beads long. Therefore, of the ~4 × 106 sites available to the polymers, only 7.5 × 104 sites will be occupied at any given instant. Vacant sites represent the solvent. In our analysis of simulation results, all distances between beads within a polymer or between polymers are reported in terms of lattice units and denoted as l.u. For calibration, if a chain has n beads and the chain obeys Gaussian statistics, then its mean end-to-end distance will be n1/2. Accordingly, for a chain comprising 250 beads, the mean end-to-end distance of a Gaussian chain will be 15.8 l.u. The simulations were performed for 5 × 1010 Monte Carlo moves and were allowed to equilibrate such that the chains formed a single condensate with a coexisting dilute phase before any analysis was performed. This simulation length has been shown to be appropriate for systems of the size chosen in our work5,22,33,34. Analyses were only performed using data from the second half of each simulation. Three independent simulations were performed at each condition, and the results shown are aggregates over all replicates. Radial densities of each polymer type were normalized using the exact number of lattice sites in each radial shell. The condensate center-of-mass was taken to be the center-of-mass of the single largest network of interacting chains. The chain orientation analysis in Fig. Here, we perform the analysis as follows: (1) for a given chain in the system, find all pairs of beads (i, j) that are exactly 100 beads apart along the chain. (2) For each pair, draw a line segment from the condensate center-of-mass to bead i. (3) Draw a line segment from bead i to bead j. (4) Determine the angle, q, swept out by the two different line segments. (5) Calculate \({\cos }^{2}{{{\rm{\theta }}}}\) and bin this value based on the distance between bead i and the condensate center-of-mass. (6) Repeat steps 1–5 for all chains in the system. (7) For each bin (as described in step 5), we report the average of the calculated \({\cos }^{2}{{{\rm{\theta }}}}\) values. If a given datapoint had an error greater than 0.1, then that datapoint was omitted. 5b) with various excitation laser strengths and single-molecule image stacks (Fig. S9) were acquired with a home-built epifluorescence widefield microscope. Mixtures of 10 µL condensate systems with YO-PRO-1 solution (wide-field imaging: 0.5 µL, 1 µM; single-molecule imaging on poly-rA: 2 µL, 125 nM; single-molecule imaging on poly-rA-rC: 1 µL, 500 nM) were loaded in silicone wells (Grace Bio-Labs 665206) on cover glass and sealed to prevent evaporation for imaging. A 488 nm excitation laser (Coherent OBIS LX) was collimated above an oil-immersion objective (OLYMPUS UPLSAPO100XOPSF, NA 1.4) to illuminate the sample, and the emitted fluorescence is collected with the same objective. A dichroic mirror (Semrock FF01-523/610-25) and an emission filter (Semrock FF01-593/46) were employed for maximizing the fluorescence signal-to-background ratio. Similar to Wu et al.34 a polarizing beamsplitter split the fluorescence into two orthogonally polarized channels, and each channel was focused onto non-overlapping regions of a Photometrics Prime BSI sCMOS camera controlled via Micro-Manager (v.2.0.3). For single-molecule imaging, high-intensity illumination (~4850 W cm−2 peak) was used. Single-molecule images of YO-PRO-1 were acquired with a 10-ms exposure time for 20,000 frames for an average of ~400 photons per localization within each frame. Single-molecule imaging experiments were repeated on 6 individual condensates of each condensate system. Localization and tracking of individual molecules was performed following the work of Wu et al.34 where we applied the same Robust Statistical Estimation algorithm (RoSE-O)78 and registered the two polarized imaging channels as described previously. A Poisson maximum likelihood estimator was used to fit the standard point spread function to the single-molecule images and measure the lateral position, orientation, and brightness of each molecule. This theoretical precision is evaluated for the average fluorescence signal (400 photons) and background (8 photons/pixel) from measured events. We did not observe any YO-PRO-1 with strong orientation preferences. All position estimates were subsequently classified and grouped into single-molecule trajectories. Molecular movements were tracked by connecting single-molecule positions between consecutive frames. Estimates from two consecutive frames were classified as the same molecule if: 1) they are the closest pair of estimates between the frames, and 2) their distance d is within the confinement radius d < 200 nm. All distances are computed in Euclidean form. Directional displacements between each 10 ms frame and the average position of each molecule's trajectory (termed a molecule's position) were computed. The condensate interface curvature is determined by fitting a circle to the positions of a subset of molecules ( >90th percentile of those furthest from the condensate center). The deformed curvatures on poly-rA-rC condensates from different interface types (pA-pC or pA-pC-dil) were manually separated and then fitted with the corresponding circles. Directional displacements were converted into parallel and perpendicular relative to the fitted interface curvature and aligned to a common position on the interface. Independent 2D Gaussian fits were performed on directional displacement histograms in parallel-perpendicular coordinates. Figures 1, S1, S2, S4 and S9 show representative images. Other condensates or places in the sample (>50) were observed to show similar architectures/behavior. Figure 2c, d contain information from over 104 samples (~100 pL each). The fitted phase boundaries match with phase boundaries observed for larger samples (10–100 μL, Fig. Figures 3, 4, S5, S6, S7 and S8 show the mean across three replicates and error bars indicating the standard errors. Figure 5b, d, e shows data collected by imaging a poly-rA condensate over 2.5 s. Figure 5h shows the results from 6 condensates for 3 different interfaces and 2 interiors, analyzed similar to shown in 5d–g. Supplementary Table 1 shows how many displacements were analyzed for each of these events (Fig. Single molecules blinking at the interface was observed in >50 condensates in all samples.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists are increasingly concerned about the future of Earth science under President Donald Trump as three key NASA satellites near the end of their missions with no plan for replacement A scientific instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite helps show the spread of carbon monoxide plumes from California wildfires in September 2020. Launched one after the other between 1999 and 2004, NASA researchers have always known they had built-in expiration dates. Most instruments don't work properly forever, and the satellites themselves are running out of fuel, meaning they're gradually drifting out of their intended orbits. All three could go dark within the next year. And some of the instruments they carry have no immediate replacements, meaning certain long-term datasets are poised to discontinue.

That's a big concern for climate scientists, who use these observations to track the ways the Earth is responding to greenhouse gas emissions. “People have come to rely on them, and now they're going away,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “We've been telling people to use our data and to rely on our data, and then we're not being reliable.” Some instruments aboard the three probes have no replacements lined up at all, while others have only short-term follow-up missions planned. Experts say NASA's long-standing focus on innovation, coupled with funding woes, is part of the reason. NASA's budgets have remained relatively flat for years, meaning the agency is often forced to choose between older priorities and newer projects — and “given a choice they would rather do something new,” Schmidt said. Short for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, it provides a wide range of Earth observations including measurements of forests, clouds, glaciers and oceans. Similar instruments exist on board certain NOAA satellites, although they don't provide measurements in the exact same ways. And even if NOAA can collect the same observations, it won't necessarily analyze the data in a similar manner. Scientists rely on NASA to interpret the raw data it collects and package it into scientific products that can be used for specific kinds of studies. NASA's CERES instruments — short for Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems — are another worry. These instruments help scientists measure the amount of solar radiation the Earth absorbs, an observation that helps them accurately track global warming. CERES instruments currently exist on board only four satellites in the world — the Terra and Aqua satellites, plus two other missions operated by NOAA, which are also reaching the ends of their expected lifespans. There's only one future mission in the works designed to carry CERES instruments, a NOAA satellite scheduled to launch in 2027. But that mission's estimated lifespan is only around seven years. Meanwhile, amid widespread cuts across federal agencies over the last two months, some researchers are beginning to worry about the lone follow-on mission scheduled for 2027. “If this administration decides, ‘We don't believe in all this hogwash called global warming' and cut us, then it doesn't exist anywhere else in the world,” said one NASA researcher involved in the Terra and Aqua missions who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation from the Trump administration. Gaps in certain long-term continuous datasets can be almost impossible to accurately fill once the disruption has occurred, the scientist added. One Senate spending proposal for fiscal year 2025 originally included a request for NASA to provide "a transition plan to ensure the continuity of data between the Terra, Aqua, and Aura missions and successor missions or follow-on data sources for instruments" within 120 days. ), a ranking member of the Appropriations Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee in a statement provided to POLITICO's E&E News. I will continue pushing to support these missions and the import insights they provide.” But scientists are growing increasingly concerned over the future of earth science at NASA against a backdrop of aggressive budget cuts and mass layoffs at the federal science agencies. The Trump administration already has eliminated its chief scientist role, a position formerly held by climate scientist Kate Calvin, who also served as NASA's senior climate adviser. In a post on X earlier this month, the Department of Government Efficiency claimed it had terminated $420 million in NASA contracts — although it didn't specify the eliminated contracts or offer proof of its accounting. “We're seeing, in my opinion, a full-scale assault against science across many different agencies,” said Rep. George Whitesides, a California Democrat and former chief of staff at NASA. Trump's pick for NASA administrator — billionaire commercial astronaut Jared Isaacman — has yet to be confirmed by the Senate, leaving the agency's science priorities in limbo. The Trump administration already has moved to withdraw support for climate research and climate-related grants across federal agencies, and researchers are worried the White House will seek to defund NASA's Earth-observing science programs. While NASA's funding from Congress has remained relatively flat in recent years, earth science advocates say these missions deserve more funding. I think the answer is probably not,” Whitesides said. “And my sense is that's what we're seeing today.

In a classical computer, you can never make a truly random number, which is one big reason computer scientists have had high hopes for quantum computers. Because these quantum systems involve an amount of unpredictability and entropy, simply identifying certain qualities at certain times is randomized by nature (pun intended). But who certifies the random numbers, and what can we do with them afterward? There are a bunch of ways they do this, including using concrete data like the time or hardware status and then scrambling it using another specific algorithm. (You can even, like cybersecurity giant Cloudflare does, use lava lamps.) Basically, it's like shuffling a deck of cards by alternating them, over and over, until the results appear random to a user. The computer has no free will or even concept of freedom, so there's no way for it to “choose” anything without metrics or assigned values. To be honest, people aren't better at randomness. We see actually random things and feel they don't seem random enough, because we envision a distributed randomness that is, in fact, just another pattern. The million monkeys trying to eventually type Shakespeare for us would get sidetracked by people who insist that the letters aren't being typed randomly enough. This unpredictability runs counter to existing computing's paradigm for randomness, which is simply hiding the moving pieces that could be predicted with enough knowledge. And importantly, it's also different than today's working paradigm of cryptography. Our encryption modes rely on computers multiplying, for example, very large prime numbers together. The product of two primes will only have those two large numbers as its significant factors, so something encrypted that way will only be decrypted by someone who knows at least one of the numbers. But prime numbers are predictable, and scientists push our growing list of primes into new territory every day. In new peer-reviewed research in the journal Nature, a team of more than 30 authors have collaborated to generate random numbers that pass the certification test. Certain pieces of information are sent back and forth to an “untrusted” quantum server to be turned into strings of data influenced by entropy. In the world of data encryption, there's an ongoing tension between methods that rely on private information—like a security key held by one or both machines that are communicating—versus those that do all their work using technology held in public (but still inscrutable) places. In this new method, the key is made obsolete because of the strength of the random number, freshly generated each time a new number is needed, which can then be certified as random and therefore secure. Within computing systems, the randomness or pseudorandomness of numbers resulting from various generation methods is known as entropy. The entire story you've read so far has been about 42,000 bits long. We're talking about very, very long and random strings—far too long and random for anyone to ever try to figure out from the outside. The scientists say their procedure leads to numbers with levels of entropy that satisfy metrics and can be generated in a reasonable amount of time (as compared to network communications from classical computers). “An ideal protocol for certified randomness either aborts, resulting in an ‘abort state', or succeeds, resulting in a uniformly distributed bitstring that is uncorrelated with any side information,” the team wrote. Quantum computers are in an awkward growing-pains phase, as teams work at fever pitch to get them ready for applications that... don't really exist yet. There hasn't been a killer app for quantum computing the way that Super Mario Bros. first made everyone realize they needed a Nintendo in the 1980s. This research has a stated agenda, which is to make quantum computers practical. In fact, four authors are listed as patent holders via JPMorgan Chase related to this work. “[W]e demonstrate a useful beyond-classical application of gate-based digital quantum computers,” the team explains. In other words, we can start doing this now, using technology as it is today. Caroline Delbert is a writer, avid reader, and contributing editor at Pop Mech.</p>

In a paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, researchers estimate that the lake once reached up to 42 meters (approximately 138 feet) deep at its deepest, and was about 1,100 m². That's nearly double the surface area of modern day Lake Geneva in Switzerland (580 m²), researcher Sébastien Castelltort explained in a press release. Scientists studied sediments and landforms in the region to determine where these floods were coming from. They concluded that the wet periods that contributed to filling the ancient lake likely came from northward expansions of African and Indian monsoons. When the lake did reach its peak size, it wasn't just a pretty sight—it may have been a crucial part of human activity in the region. “This is confirmed by abundant archaeological evidence found in the Empty Quarter and along its ancient lake and river systems.'' While the study's findings shine a light on Rub' al-Khali thousands of years ago, they're also relevant in current climate research. “Understanding how past climate changes shaped both the physical environment and the distribution of human populations,” Castelltort said, according to La Brújula Verde, “is essential to interpreting today's challenges.” Her work appears in several publications including Biography.com and Popular Mechanics.

Stay connected to The Universe: Get email alerts for this weekly column by Phil Plait I love simple questions that wind up having complicated—or at least not straightforward—answers. Astronomers twist themselves into knots, for example, trying to define what a planet is, even though it seems like you'd know one when you see it. Do they also confound any sort of palatable definition? In a very broad sense, a star is simply one of those twinkling points of light you can see in the night sky. But that's not terribly satisfying in either lexicological or physical terms. After all, we also know the sun is a star—but, by definition, we never see it in Earth's night sky, and it's certainly not a dot (unless you're viewing it from well past Pluto, that is). If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. From centuries of scientific observations and theoretical physics, we can say more. They're held together by their own gravity, and they consist of plasma (gas heated so much that electrons are stripped from its constituent atoms). They shine, which is probably their most basic characteristic. That's descriptive, certainly, but still doesn't really tell us what a star is. To sensibly answer such questions, we need to understand the core mechanism that makes a star luminous in the first place. Historically, astronomers were in the dark about this for quite some time. In this process, subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons—and even entire atomic nuclei—could be smashed together, fusing to form heavier nuclei and releasing an enormous amount of energy. In a star's core, fusion takes terrific temperature and pressure that is provided by the crushing gravity of the star's overlying mass. There are a couple of different pathways for fusion to occur in stars like the sun, but in the end they both yield essentially the same result: four hydrogen nuclei (each a single proton) plus various other subatomic particles fuse together to form a helium nucleus, and this process blasts out a lot of high-energy radiation as a byproduct. In the sun, this process converts about 620 million metric tons of hydrogen into helium every second. That creates enough energy to, well, power a star. A critical aspect here is that once this reaction starts in a star's core, it keeps going as long as there is enough nuclear material to fuel it. So now we can say with more confidence what a star is: a huge gravitationally bound mass of luminous plasma in which the energy generated from sustained nuclear fusion in its core is balanced by gravity. Except (and you knew an “except” was coming) there's a lower limit to the temperature and pressure needed to sustain fusion. Below that mass, there's not enough pressure to kick-start the fusion process. But you might notice that no one is eagerly declaring anything dozens of times heftier than Jupiter to be a “planet,” either. In general, middling objects too massive to be planets but too lightweight to be stars are called brown dwarfs. This is where things get fuzzy—because it turns out that brown dwarfs can sustain certain sorts of fusion reactions, too. Some can even fuse lithium with protons to form beryllium, and both these processes can occur at lower temperatures and pressures than the standard “single-proton hydrogen” fusion I described earlier. For simplicity's sake, astronomers would prefer to keep brown dwarfs in their own group and not call them stars. So most of us would say that a star has to have sustained single-proton hydrogen fusion. It's still a little bit arbitrary—after all, even this fusion eventually stops, though that might take up to several trillion years for some slow-burning stars. But setting this clear limit does make some sense. Stars have an upper limit on their mass, too. More massive stars gravitationally squeeze their core even harder, which can vastly increase the rate of fusion reactions. But that, in turn, hugely ramps up energy production, making the star hotter and brighter. We do see stars near this upper bound, such as Eta Carinae, and they are violently unstable, wracked by stellar paroxysms that blow out gas in humongous eruptions. What happens, then, after a star exhausts its nuclear fuel? Eventually the hydrogen runs out, leaving behind a core made of helium. This can get very complicated, but some massive stars can then fuse that helium into heavier elements and those elements into heavier ones yet. For true stellar heavyweights—stars with more than about eight times the sun's mass—the end comes as a catastrophic supernova explosion that leaves behind a neutron star or black hole. Smaller, more sunlike stars have a more sedate demise that eventually blows off their outer layers to expose their dense, hot core to space. Besides black holes—which are so extreme they merit a category all their own—astronomers tend to refer to these stellar remnants as stars, but the lexicology there is hazier. It's a little confusing to laypeople, but astronomers have all sorts of terms that began with good intentions but are now outdated or should be deprecated. So for now we're stuck with some words that will possibly (hopefully) fall out of use in the future. Planets, moons, stars: astronomers know the difference and know that at the edges, these terms can bleed into one another.

Nature Chemical Engineering (2025)Cite this article Ion-selective membranes are central to electrochemical technologies due to their ability to regulate ion transport and differentiate between cations and anions. However, a major obstacle to their effective implementation is the inherent trade-off between ionic conductivity and cation/anion selectivity, a consequence of the interdependence between membrane charge and water content. Here we introduce a membrane design strategy that not only achieves high charge densities but also nearly decouples charge from water content. Our strategy involves the copolymerization of low-molecular-weight charged monomers and charged cross-linkers, ensuring that every repeat unit of the polymer backbone contains a charged group. Anion-exchange membranes synthesized using this strategy exhibit ultrahigh charge densities, substantially advancing the conductivity/selectivity upper bound. We further demonstrate the practical implications of these ultrahigh-charge-density membranes for electrodialytic brine concentration, achieving a lower specific energy consumption than the state-of-the-art benchmark. This advancement in membrane design can impact the development and deployment of electrochemical systems across a spectrum of energy and environmental applications.

(2025)Cite this article Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rapid, recurring X-ray bursts from supermassive black holes, believed to result from interactions between accretion disks and surrounding matter. The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, previously stable for two decades, exhibited an increase in optical brightness in December 2019, followed by persistent active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like variability for 5 yr, suggesting the activation of a ~106-M⊙ black hole. Since February 2024, X-ray emission has been detected, revealing extreme ~4.5-d QPEs with high fluxes and amplitudes, long timescales, large integrated energies and a ~25-d superperiod. Low-significance UV variations are reported, probably related to the long timescales and large radii from which the emission originates. This discovery broadens the possible formation channels for QPEs, suggesting that they are linked not solely to tidal disruption events but more generally to newly formed accretion flows, which we are witnessing in real time in a turn-on AGN candidate.

It includes optical data from ZTF in the g (green circles) and r (red squares, divided by a factor 1.6) bands, with the total fluxes in units of mJy (shown in the left axis), and X-ray data from NICER (detections as black circles, non detections as black triangles), Swift/XRT (detections as blue diamonds, non detections as blue triangles), Chandra (pink thin-diamond), and eROSITA non detections (as purple triangles), with the X-ray luminosities in units of erg s−1 (shown in the right axis); (Bottom): zoom-in to X-ray data on dates after February 2024, when X-ray emission was detected for the first time with Swift/XRT. The X-ray luminosity is given in units of 1043erg s−1. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties in both panels. These correspond to ObsID 0935191401 (left), 0935191501 (middle), and 0935191601 (right). The light curves are background-subtracted and grouped into 20-second bins. The data were obtained during the quiescence state. The model is tbabs × zashift × diskbb. Strong residuals are observed around 0.7-1.0 keV band in bins 1 and 2. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties. From top to bottom, the observations correspond to bins 1, 2, and 3 of ObsID 035191601, and bins 4, 5, and 6 of ObsID 035191401. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties. (Top panel): From top to bottom, the observations correspond to bins 1, 2, and 3 of ObsID 035191601, and bins 4, 5, and 6 of ObsID 035191401. (bottom panels): residuals for each bin. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties. Left: Full Swift/UVOT light curves, constructed using data collected from July 31st, 2021 until July 10, 2024, including the UVW2 (purple circles), UVM2 (pink circles), UVW1 (blue circles), U (yellow circles), B (green circles), and V (red circles) bands. The period with gyroscope issues is shown in lighter colours, and observations in the low sensitivity areas of the detector are marked as empty symbols. The dashed lines show the results of the power-law decay fit for the UV bands. We obtain power-law indices of -0.23, -0.18, and -0.11, for the UVW2, UVM2, and UVW1 band, respectively. Right: Zoom of the Swift/UVOT light curves for the period between April 10 and July 10, 2024. As a reference, we show the XMM-Newton/OM fluxes in squares. Note that the transmission curves of Swift/UVOT and XMM/OM are not exactly the same. The orbital period of the EMRI is fixed by the observed QPE periodicity, while the properties of the inner disk are set so it completes a precession cycle every 25 days. The upper area represents cases in which the EMRI eccentricity is too high, resulting in a pericentre that always go through the cavity. In the lower area the EMRI has a wider pericentre, and always crosses the disk. In the middle area the EMRI sometimes crosses the disk and sometimes goes through the cavity, potentially explaining the behaviour observed in Ansky. The solid lines show the cumulative flux density for four different wavelengths. The dashed lines of the corresponding colors show the measured flux densities for each band and the vertical lines mark the truncation radii needed to satisfy each observed flux. The dotted line shows the cumulative bolometric luminosity integrated from the same disk model as a function of outer truncation radius, divided by the Eddington luminosity. The error band marks the effect of a 10% uncertainty in the g-band band flux, for this non-simultaneous observation. In the top panel the accretion rate is set to match the UVW2 flux at a truncation radius of 330 Rg, expected for the size of a TDE disc. This truncation radius under-predicts the optical flux by a factor of 2. In the bottom panel the truncation radius and accretion rates are fit to match the measured fluxes in the optical and UV bands simultaneously. Notice the different dynamical range of the y-axis on both plots.

Early, efficient Parkinson's disease (PD) tests may facilitate pre-symptomatic diagnosis and disease-modifying therapies. Here we report elevated levels of PD-specific transfer RNA fragments carrying a conserved sequence motif (RGTTCRA-tRFs) in the substantia nigra, cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with PD. A whole blood qPCR test detecting elevated RGTTCRA-tRFs and reduced mitochondrial-originated tRFs (MT-tRFs) segregated pre-symptomatic patients with PD from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.75 versus 0.71 based on traditional clinical scoring). Strengthening PD relevance, patients carrying PD-related mutations presented higher blood RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs ratios than mutation-carrying non-symptomatic controls, and RGTTCRA-tRF levels decreased in patients' blood after deep brain stimulation. Furthermore, RGTTCRA-tRFs complementarity to ribosomal RNA and the translation-supporting LeuCAG3-tRF might aggravate PD via translational inhibition, as reflected by disrupted ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs in depolarized neuroblastoma cells. Our findings show tRF involvement in PD and suggest a potential simple and safe blood test that may aid clinicians in pre-symptomatic PD diagnosis after validation in larger independent cohorts. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease1. PD poses major clinical, social and financial burdens to society2 and is characterized by progressive movement disabilities, tremors and cognitive impairments. These symptoms result from premature death of dopaminergic neurons, especially in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN)3, that are caused by oxidative and nitrative stress3,4,5,6, enhanced mitophagy7, impaired autophagy8, neuroinflammation and dopaminergic/cholinergic imbalance9. PD diagnosis often follows considerable neuronal damage manifested as severe motor impairments, such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremors10. However, earlier symptoms, including smell loss and rapid eye movement sleep disorders, may appear years beforehand. Molecular changes characteristic of this early disease phase may constitute a basis for a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test. Such a test should be cost-effective, rapid and capable of detecting changes in biomarker levels at the earliest disease stages, confirming true-positive cases and minimizing false-positive ones. Recent PD diagnostic tests have focused on elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the α-synuclein (α-Syn) protein or reduced blood mitochondrial DNA as biomarkers11,12,13,14. However, CSF sampling is invasive; purification and detection of α-Syn are cumbersome and insufficiently sensitive15; and measurements of specific proteins show high inter-individual variability. In contrast, quantification of multiple molecules, rather than one, can improve signal-to-noise ratios and overcome the variability between patients16,17,18,19,20,21. Attempting to prevent invasive tests, certain blood molecules were proven to reflect cerebral pathology22. Ideally, an easy, safe and affordable diagnosis should be based on multiple highly sensitive and specific blood biomarkers23. Transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) are 16–50 nucleotide (nt)-long, non-coding RNAs originating from multiple nuclear or mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Several enzymes cleave tRNAs to yield tRFs: angiogenin (Ang) generates 5′-half and 3′-half tRFs, whereas Ang, Dicer24,25 and other nucleases yield 5′-tRFs, i-tRFs and 3′-tRFs26. Because tRFs harbor repetitive sequence motifs inherited from their parental tRNAs, changes can be detected in an entire family of closely related transcripts, albeit of different origins and types, produced by different endonucleases20,21,27, and originating from either nuclear or mitochondrial genomes. Correspondingly, tRFs may reflect transcriptional changes or malfunctions in both the nucleus and the mitochondria27, whose DNA is known to be damaged in PD14,28,29. Intriguingly, altered Ang levels, Ang mutations and Ang-produced tRFs may exert both PD-protective and cytotoxic roles30,31,32,33. Furthermore, blood cell tRF levels present diagnostic value in various diseases, including ischemic stroke34, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis35, epilepsy36 and cellular or organismal stress26,34. Accordingly, tRFs emerge as the perfect candidates for a blood-based PD biomarker. To challenge the hypothesis that multiple tRF-derived sequences could yield informative PD biomarkers, we searched for tRF families that share common sequence motifs whose levels are changed in the brain, blood and/or CSF of patients with PD—all biofluids known to reflect cerebral pathologies, including PD22,37. Using different datasets that account for distinct biofluids and stages of the disease allowed us to study the PD links of those tRFs whose levels had been altered in unrelated cohorts of different population origins. To seek PD-characteristic tRF profiles, we analyzed a short RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset (phs.000727)38 consisting of postmortem (PM) CSF samples from 46 patients with PD, from 53 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and from 53 healthy controls (15, 27 and 24 females, respectively; Fig. Accounting for patients' age, sex and PM interval (Extended Data Fig. 2a; edgeR; Methods), we identified elevated levels of nuclear-originated tRFs in patients with PD compared to controls (N-tRFs; average levels in control (Ctrl) and PD: 980,165 and 990,387 counts per million (CPM), respectively). All but one of these were 3′-tRFs or i-tRFs that were over 35 nt long, excluding them from functioning as microRNAs39 (Fig. We also detected reduced levels of mitochondrial-originated tRFs (MT-tRFs; average levels in Ctrl and PD: 19,834 and 9,612 CPM, respectively; Fig. 1b)14,28, most of which are long 3′-tRFs (Extended Data Fig. The PD-elevated N-tRFs and reduced MT-tRFs phenomena were consistent in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c) but were absent in AD (Fig. 1c), reflecting non-random PD-altered CSF tRF profiles37. a, Schematic representation of N-tRFs and MT-tRFs in PM CSF and SN samples. b, Levels of MT-tRFs (left; green background) and N-tRFs containing and lacking the RGTTCRA motif (right and middle; blue background) in PD CSF. x: log2(fold change (FC)) of PD versus Ctrl levels. c, As described in b for AD versus Ctrl. d, MT-tRFs decrease and elevation of RGTTCRA-tRFs associates with Lewy body scores in the SN. x axis: log2(FC) for high versus low Lewy body score (that is, prevalence and localization of brain Lewy bodies). y axis: −log10(FDR-adjusted P values). Pursuing PD RNA biomarkers, we sought common motifs shared by the elevated N-tRFs using the Multiply Elicited Motif Entities (MEME) tool40. This tool detected multiple tRFs sharing the sequence [A/G]GTTC[A/G]A (RGTTCRA-tRFs; Fig. 1c), most of which were over 30 bases long (average levels: Ctrl = 79,901, PD = 92,836, AD = 83,068, CPM for RGTTCRA-tRFs >30 bases). Binomial tests confirmed that RGTTCRA-tRFs are mostly elevated and MT-tRFs are mostly reduced also when analyzing each sex separately (Extended Data Fig. 2 and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. Notably, RGTTCRA-tRFs were derived from numerous nuclear-originated tRNA genes, none of which was downregulated in the CSF of patients with PD, and all of the CSF-elevated tRFs lacking this motif were shorter than 30 bases (Fig. Together, this indicates that the shared motif embedded in RGTTCRA-tRFs might reflect disease-related features (Supplementary Table 2 lists all of the tRNA genes carrying the PD motif). Parallel analysis comparing patients with AD to controls in the same dataset revealed unchanged profiles of MT-tRFs and RGTTCRA-tRFs (Fig. Moreover, the median levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs longer than 30 bases were higher in patients with PD than in either healthy controls or patients with AD (P < 0.038 and P < 0.062, respectively, Dunnett test, false discovery rate (FDR)). The PD-specific accumulation of RGTTCRA-tRFs and decrease of MT-tRFs in CSF identified both of these subfamilies as promising PD biomarker candidates. To seek pathological implications of RGTTCRA-tRF accumulation, we conducted small RNA-seq of SN from eight PM patients with PD sourced from the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB) (Supplementary Figs. Supporting our CSF findings, elevation of RGTTCRA-tRFs (average levels = 91,856 CPM) and reduction of MT-tRFs (average levels = 54,123 CPM) accompanied higher Braak Lewy body scores in patients with PD (Fig. 2a), we analyzed a dataset of Ang overexpression in HEK293T and knockout in U2OS cells (GSE130764; Supplementary Table 4)41. Ang overexpression elevated the percentage of RGTTCRA-tRFs, but not of MT-tRFs, in HEK293 cells (P < 0.0093 and P < 0.375, respectively, t-test, FDR; Fig. However, Ang knockout had no overt effects on these tRF families (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. Therefore, Ang emerged as sufficient but not essential for producing RGTTCRA-tRFs or MT-tRFs. a, Scheme of tRNA cleavage by Ang and Dicer. b, tRFs were quantified in Ctrl and Ang-overexpressing (OE) HEK293T cells. c,d, RGTTCRA-tRF (c, purple) and MT-tRF (d, green) percentages in Ang-OE versus Ctrl. **P < 0.0093 and P < 0.375 for c and d, respectively, two-sided t-test, FDR correction. e, Numbers of blood samples from live controls and early PD patients with and without PD-related mutations (PPMI) and PM advanced PD patients (NBB). f,g, Percentage of RGTTCRA-tRFs (f, purple) and MT-tRFs (g, green) in Ctrl and PD samples (PPMI, ‘Early'; Idiopathic, carrying no PD-related mutations; Genetic, carrying LRRK2, GBA or SNCA mutations; NBB, ‘Advanced').

All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles. To test the utility of RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRF levels as diagnostic biomarkers, we performed small RNA-seq of NBB PM blood samples from patients with PD and controls (Ctrl, n = 16 and PD, n = 21; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 5; data deposited in GSE256334) and used Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data (Supplementary Table 6) from idiopathic non-deep brain stimulation (DBS)-treated patients from timepoint V08 (2 years after first evaluation; Idiopathic; PD, n = 252 and Ctrl, n = 133) and the latest timepoint available for PD-related mutation carriers with or without symptoms (Genetic; PD, n = 55 and Ctrl, n = 16). Mutation-carrying living PPMI PD patients showed a trend of reduction in blood MT-tRF levels compared to unaffected mutation-carrying controls (P < 0.057, Mann–Whitney, FDR; Fig. In comparison, PM blood samples from advanced NBB PD patients presented elevated RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs (P < 0.00015 and P < 8 × 10−11, respectively, ANOVA; ‘Advanced'; Fig. The observed PM elevation in blood MT-tRF levels contrasts with the MT-tRF reduction seen in the PD CSF and SN (Fig. 1b,d) and may reflect mitochondrial degradation in PM blood, which yields higher levels of mitochondrial RNA fragments42. Indeed, although levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs were not affected by sample RNA integrity number (RIN), MT-tRF levels were negatively correlated with the sample's RIN (MT-tRFs: r = −0.4, P < 0.025; RGTTCRA-tRFs: r = −0.14, P < 0.4; FDR, Spearman correlation), indicating that the elevated levels stem from the PM status rather than the PD status. Supporting this notion, SN tissues revealed reduced mitochondrial tRNA levels, which continued declining with disease duration (r = 0.4, P < 0.05, Spearman correlation; PD versus Ctrl P < 0.039, Mann–Whitney test; Extended Data Fig. To develop a biomarker assay that can easily compare among patients regardless of the need to account for RNA concentrations and library depth, we calculated the ratio between RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs. This ratio was elevated in PD versus Ctrl (Fig. Strengthening the notion that blood tRFs have the capability of capturing inter-individual variations, we found that blood tRF levels create a patient-specific fingerprint that maintains stability over time, positioning them as promising candidates for biomarkers (Supplementary Information: ‘Blood tRF levels create a patient-specific fingerprint'). To do so, we compared prodromal PPMI patients (showing pre-symptomatic PD signs, albeit without a clinical PD diagnosis) at the earliest tested timepoint (n = 60) to matched healthy controls (n = 128) (Fig. A subset of 60 controls optimally matched to the prodromal patients was formed based on sex, age and collection batch of patients. a, GBM machine learning (ML) algorithm segregated PPMI prodromal patients from controls using the ratio between RGTTCRA-tRFs (GGTCCCTGGTTCAA sequence) and MT-tRFs (TAACTTAGCATTAACCTTTTAA sequence), compared to clinical measurements. b, ROC of optimally matched prodromal patients and controls (n = 60 of each), using tRF-score (orange) or clinical UPDRS and H&Y measurements (turquoise) and mixed labels combining tRFs and clinical measurements (gray). c, Density plot of AUCs from 10,000 training events, each using a different pair of random 14-nt and 22-nt motifs (without RGTTCRA motif) to calculate ‘tRF-score' and GBM-based AUCs. d, tRF-score in control (gray) and prodromal patients (orange) of different ethnic and genetic backgrounds.

All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles. To create a primer-based separation reflecting the variability between controls and prodromal PD patients, we sought two single in silico polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer pairs that can recognize numerous RGTTCRA-tRFs or MT-tRFs. We designed quantitative PCR (qPCR)-suitable 14-nt-long sequences that include the PD motif and are shared among at least 100 different RGTTCRA-tRFs (Methods). For every patient, we summed the counts of all RGTTCRA-tRFs, including each 14-nt sequence, and selected the one that led to the largest median difference between PPMI prodromal patients and healthy controls (GGTCCCTGGTTCAA, shared among 285 RGTTCRA-tRFs from different tRNAs of distinct chromosomal origins, average levels of 550 CPM; P < 0.013, Mann–Whitney). Next, we similarly selected a sequence shared between the maximum number of MT-tRFs that maximizes the median difference between prodromal and controls and minimized the standard deviation within each group (TAACTTAGCATTAACCTTTTAA, shared among 106 Lys tRNA-originated MT-tRFs, average levels of 90 CPM). For each patient, we divided the sum of RGTTCRA-tRF counts (all carrying the GGTCCCTGGTTCAA sequence) by the sum of MT-tRF counts (all carrying the TAACTTAGCATTAACCTTTTAA sequence) to yield an RGTTCRA/MT score. The RGTTCRA/MT score of each control or prodromal patient from a matched pair was then divided by the pair's mean to yield a normalized score (hereafter ‘tRF-score'). Next, we employed a gradient boosted machine learning (GBM) classification algorithm (five cross-validations; Methods) to subgroup the samples into prodromal PD patients and controls, considering their ethnicity, by clinical measurements of Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scores or by the tRF-score described above. This resulted in areas under the curve (AUCs; representing the ability to segregate the patients into control and prodromal groups) of 0.73 for the clinical measurement (specificity = 0.78, sensitivity = 0.583, positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.761, negative predictive value (NPV) = 0.61) compared to an AUC of 0.86 (specificity = 0.867, sensitivity = 0.7, PPV = 0.84, NPV = 0.743) for the tRF-score (Fig. In comparison, classification using mixed labels (null) in both clinical and tRF measurements yielded a non-significant AUC value of 0.43. Further validation using 10,000 permutations, each time sampling 60 different controls, confirmed these results, as did a logistic regression algorithm replacing GBM (receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-AUC of 0.83 compared to 0.70 using clinical measurements; Extended Data Fig. To test if our findings reflect the biological role of these motifs rather than training of the algorithm, we ran the exact same GBM-based process 10,000 times on ratios between random motifs (lacking the RGTTCRA sequence and appearing in at least the same number of tRFs as the RGTTCRA motifs and the MT motifs; Methods). = 0.0537), and 99% of the AUCs were lower than 0.81 (Fig. These findings support the notion that the AUC resulting from the tRF-score reflects a biological rather than a mere training phenomenon. PD symptoms often reflect patients' genetics and ethnic origins. Therefore, we tested the ability to segregate patients to prodromal and control groups based on their genetic and ethnic backgrounds. The tRF-score enabled segregating all subpopulations (Fig. 3d; P < 2 × 10−10, ANOVA), even when examining the non-normalized ratio (Extended Data Fig. Thus, two-thirds of prodromal patients scored as 6 or higher, whereas two-thirds of controls scored lower than 6 (P < 4 × 10−5, chi-square test). An exception was Black control and prodromal patients who had similar tRF-scores. However, their UPDRS scores revealed the same trend (Extended Data Fig. 4c), potentially suggesting that our test reflected real-life clinical measurements in these patients as well. Nonetheless, although the tRF-score measurement was similar between prodromal and diagnosed PD patients, the UPDRS score of prodromal patients was akin to that of controls and differed dramatically from that of patients with PD (Extended Data Fig. Further indicating a link between our two motifs and the clinical measurements, the tRF-scores of the optimally matched prodromal and control patients presented positive correlation with the total UPDRS score (r = 0.27, P < 0.01; FDR, Spearman correlation; Extended Data Fig. 4e) and with the scores of subsections II and III of the UPDRS test (I: r = 0.19, P < 0.06; II: r = 0.245, P < 0.0163; III: r = 0.318, P < 0.004; FDR, Spearman correlation; Extended Data Fig. Next, we tested the GBM algorithms trained on the optimally matched data (60 prodromal, 60 controls) on the fully matched data (60 prodromal, 128 controls) (Methods). Both algorithms, whether trained on the tRF-score or on clinical parameters, presented far better classification abilities than random classification (Extended Data Fig. However, the tRF-based measurements performed better than the clinical ones (P < 0.0081, chi-square test). To re-challenge these observations, we tested the tRF-score-based algorithm on a holdout validation sample, including 33 prodromal samples and 33 matched control samples consisting of the second-earliest timepoint of the patients used for cross-validation (discovery sample) (Methods and Supplementary Table 7). The algorithm successfully distinguished prodromal patients from controls (P < 0.0004, t-test; AUC of 0.75, confidence interval (CI) = 0.63–0.86, specificity = 0.727, sensitivity = 0.606, PPV = 0.69, NPV = 0.649; Fig. In comparison, testing the algorithm trained on the clinical measurement on the holdout validation sample yielded a weaker separation between control and prodromal patients (AUC of 0.71, CI = 0.65–0.78, specificity = 0.523, sensitivity = 0.777, PPV = 0.58, NPV = 0.734; Methods). In subsequent tests, PD diagnosis was established for 21 of those 60 studied prodromal PPMI patients (with the rest yet undiagnosed). Comparing the tRF and UPDRS scores of these 21 patients to those of controls yielded a more significant separation by the tRF-score (P < 1.1 × 10−5 versus P < 7 × 10−3, t-test, FDR; Fig. Furthermore, 18 of the 21 patients whose PD diagnosis had been confirmed were ranked higher by their tRF-score than by their UPDRS score (Extended Data Fig. In later stages of PD with overt motor symptoms (Supplementary Table 8), clinical measurements perfectly separated patients from controls (AUC of 1), which left no room for added value of other biomarkers. We conclude that the two-primer-based tRF-score emerges as a reliable PD biomarker already in the earliest disease stages and especially in combination with clinical or other available measurements. To segregate patients with PD from controls based on a manual qPCR-based tRF test, we drew blood from 10 patients with PD, from 10 patients with head trauma and from 10 controls from the Jerusalem Shaare Zedek Medical Center (JLM cohort; Supplementary Table 9). We used the two probes described above (ΔCq = RGTTCRA-tRF − MT-tRF; Methods) and normalized the ΔΔCq separately for each sex (Methods and Extended Data Fig. Notably, patients with PD presented significantly higher ratios of RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs than either controls or patients with trauma, which showed similar values (Fig. To further validate the capacity of our qPCR test to selectively amplify the RGTTCRA motif, we subjected the amplicons of two qPCR reactions (JLM cohort, one patient with PD and one patient with trauma) to small RNA-seq. In both samples, over 50% of the reads (compared to 0.3–10% in biological samples) were mapped to tRFs, all carrying the RGTTCRA motif, with most derived from the same tRNA region but from different tRFs (Extended Data Fig. These findings provide experimental evidence supporting the notion that our qPCR test primarily detects tRFs that include the RGTTCRA motif and can quantify their levels in patients' blood. To address the consistency of our findings in other tissues, we tested 17 PD SN samples (six females) and six matched control SN samples (three females) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NeuroBioBank collection (Supplementary Table 11). Because tRFs expressed in the brain are slightly different than those in the blood, we designed a brain-adapted RGTTCRA-tRF primer (CGGGTTCGATTCCC; Methods) to maximize the number of detected RGTTCRA-tRFs. Together, our findings in blood and brain demonstrated that the signal of motif-carrying tRFs identified in sequenced blood samples from prodromal and PD patients can be translated into simple dual qPCR blood tests. Although MT-tRF reduction reflects well-studied PD-related mitochondrial dysfunction28,29 that potentially leads to reduction in MT-tRFs, our finding of RGTTCRA-tRF accumulation might reflect biological activities accelerating PD progression. In this context, four different tRFs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were shown to interrupt translation by interacting with ribosomal RNA (rRNA), in regions other than tRNA binding sites43. Interestingly, we found all four to include the PD motif. Furthermore, we identified a region complementary to the RGTTCRA-tRF sequence in the leucine tRNA-derived tRF (LeuCAG3′) that was reported to be essential for assembly of the translation complex, protein translation and cellular viability44 (Fig. Correspondingly, minimal energy assessment (RNAup)45 predicted a thermodynamically preferred interaction (total energy of −10.46 kcal mol−1) of RGTTCRA-tRFs with the ribosome-essential LeuCAG3′ tRF (Fig. 4b), far lower binding energy than all other 1,017 CSF-identified tRFs (P < 1 × 10−30, t-test; Fig. a, RGTTCRA-tRFs (purple) can hybridize both with a ribosome-essential tRF (Ribo-essential, cyan) and with 18S and 28S rRNAs, producing a ‘dual-lock' translational arrest. b, Left, total binding energy of the Ribo-essential tRF to all CSF tRFs lacking (gray) or carrying (purple) the RGTTCRA motif (n = 1,017 tRFs).

Right, secondary structures of 18S and 28S rRNA showing RGTTCRA motif-complementary sequences (red). All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles. Supporting the ribosome-binding prediction, we found sequences complementary to the PD motif that are not involved in a secondary structure in both the 18S and 28S rRNAs and are, hence, amenable to hybridization (Fig. Correspondingly, RGTTCRA-tRFs were predicted to bind more strongly to 18S and 28S rRNAs than all other CSF tRFs (P < 2 × 10−25, P < 3 × 10−67, t-test, FDR; Fig. The predicted binding of RGTTCRA-tRFs to both the LeuCAG3′ tRF and the rRNA may lead to a ‘dual-lock' mechanism interrupting both initiation and execution of translational processes (Fig. Indeed, 3 h of translation-interfering arginine or leucine starvation in three human-originated cell lines46 led to enrichment of ribosome-bound RGTTCRA-tRFs (P < 0.023, P < 0.027, Dunnett test; Extended Data Fig. We next employed Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)47 with pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c) to assess the proximities between RGTTCRA-tRF (that is, donor fluorophore-labeled RGTTCRA-tRF probe) and ribosomes (that is, acceptor fluorophore tagging an antibody to the ribosomal protein RPL24) (Extended Data Fig. The fluorescence lifetime (τ) of the acceptor fluorophore was longer after donor excitation (FRET-sensitized acceptor fluorescence) than after direct acceptor excitation (directly excited acceptor fluorescence; 1.36 ns versus 1.00 ns; Extended Data Fig. The delayed acceptor fluorescence after donor excitation may reflect a signature of FRET between the donor–acceptor pairs48 and, hence, close proximity (<10 nm) of RGTTCRA-tRFs with ribosomes (Extended Data Fig. 5d,f), supporting direct interaction between RGTTCRA-tRFs and the ribosome. DBS of the subthalamic nucleus suppresses PD tremor symptoms through an incompletely understood mechanism of action49,50. To search for RGTTCRA-tRF links to the disease symptoms, we studied the effect of DBS on blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels in 19 DBS-treated patients with PD of the PPMI cohort carrying LRRK2 (ref. Non-DBS-treated PD patient carriers of the same PD-causing mutations (n = 11) showed higher RGTTCRA-tRF levels than apparently healthy carriers of these mutations (n = 9; P < 0.027, ANOVA). In comparison, the DBS-treated mutation-carrying patients presented lower RGTTCRA-tRF levels than non-DBS-treated patients (P < 0.095, ANOVA; Fig. 5b), equivalent to the levels of the apparently healthy mutation-carrying controls (P < 0.6, ANOVA; Fig. MT-tRFs showed no significant difference between DBS-treated and the other groups (Extended Data Fig. The clinical capacity of DBS to effectively co-suppress blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels and tremor symptoms suggests that RGTTCRA-tRF blood levels may be related to the tremor profiles of PD patients. a, Blood was drawn from controls and patients with PD with and without DBS from the PPMI and Soreq datasets. b, RGTTCRA-tRF levels in control carriers of PD-related mutations (gray) and PD carriers of mutated LRRK2 or GBA genes (blue) with and without DBS (red and black outlines), n = 9, 11, 19. y: percentage of RGTTCRA-tRFs from total tRF counts (rhombuses indicate mean). c, Ang levels in blood samples of controls and patients with PD before and after DBS treatment, from the Soreq dataset (GSE23676), colors as in b.

Seeking potential causes for the reduced percentage of RGTTCRA-tRFs out of total tRFs, and considering that DBS alters blood transcript profiles52 as well as the effect of Ang on RGTTCRA-tRF levels, we measured Ang levels in DBS-treated patients and controls. For this purpose, we used our microarray dataset, GSE23676 (ref. 52), consisting of blood taken from six controls and seven patients with PD (all males), where PD blood was drawn before DBS surgery or several months after DBS treatment (Fig. 5a, Soreq dataset; Methods, Extended Data Fig. Interestingly, Ang mRNA levels were similar in controls and patients with PD (before DBS) but decreased in six of the seven patients with PD after DBS (P < 0.019, ANOVA; Fig. 5c), possibly reflecting a limited post-DBS capacity to produce tRFs. To examine the effects of electrical stimulation (such as DBS) on RGTTCRA-tRFs, we mined a short RNA-seq and ribosomal profiling dataset (GSE155727)53 from SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells harvested before, immediately after or 2 h after electrophysiological depolarization (2 h post depolarization (pDP); Fig. Immediately after depolarization, the cytosolic fraction of these cells showed reduced RGTTCRA-tRF shares, followed by re-elevation 2 h later (reminiscent of our findings in DBS-treated patients; Fig. The re-elevation of RGTTCRA-tRFs share was accompanied by reduced cytosolic MT-tRFs share (Fig. Although depolarization did not immediately change the ribosomal-bound fraction of RGTTCRA-tRFs, this fraction was reduced 2 h later (Fig. 5e; 2 h pDP versus resting, P < 0.015; 2 h pDP versus depolarization, P < 0.0065, ANOVA). The distribution of tRFs to MT-tRFs, RGTTCRA-tRFs and all other tRFs was further altered 2 h pDP in the ribosome-bound fraction of three samples compared to the mean distributions of this fraction in resting cells (P < 0.006, P < 0.022, P < 0.024, chi-square, FDR; Fig. Because RGTTCRA-tRFs mainly belong to the 3′ and i-tRF subtypes, we compared the fraction of RGTTCRA-tRFs in these specific subtypes and found the same association patterns as described above (Extended Data Fig. 6b and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. Although RGTTCRA-tRFs constituted a small portion of the total cytoplasmic short RNAs, their share of the ribosomal-associated RNAs was roughly 10-fold higher (P < 8 × 10−11, ANOVA; Fig. Our FRET findings, together with the selectively weakened ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs within 2 h after electrophysiological depolarization, suggest that the depolarizing qualities of DBS may impact the ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs. From our study, tRFs carrying a repetitive motif emerged as potentially suitable biomarkers that may constitute patient-specific ‘fingerprints' and carry short conserved sequence motifs that enable single measurement of multiple tRFs. Intriguingly, we found that RGTTCRA-tRFs accumulate in the brain, CSF and blood of male and female patients with PD at diverse disease stages but not in matched controls or in patients with AD. Moreover, motif-carrying RGTTCRA-tRFs consistently showed linkage to PD symptoms and disease stages, and their levels were elevated in correlation with Lewy body scores in patients' SN. Additionally, part of the identified RGTTCRA-tRFs stem from tRNAs that carry phenylalanine or cysteine amino acids, known to be the rate-limiting factors in the dopamine synthesis and in glutathione reductase antioxidant mechanism, respectively. Thus, shortage of these intact tRNAs (as they are enzymatically cut into the observed tRFs) may correspond to impaired dopamine synthesis54 or to processes that limit cellular antioxidation55. Compatible with the known mitochondrial damage in PD28 (which leads to general reduction in mitochondrial transcript levels), we further found reduced levels of MT-tRFs in the CSF and SN of idiopathic PD patients and in the blood of early PD patients carrying disease-related mutations. Our segregation algorithm focused on prodromal patients rather than patients at later stages of PD because it is these early disease stages that call for biomarker development, especially as, in later stages, clinical measurements suffice to determine a clear diagnosis of PD. Correspondingly, the ratio of RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs segregated early prodromal patients from healthy controls as well as or even better than those of the gold standard clinical UPDRS and H&Y measurements. This could indicate that the ratio of RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs may serve as a potential diagnostic tool for the earliest stages of PD, especially in combination with other available pre-symptomatic detectors. To our knowledge, this evaluation, which is based on publicly available data sources and manual tests, is the first to identify the power of blood tRFs as PD biomarkers. Nonetheless, this cross-sectional study calls for longitudinal studies following patients throughout disease progression to offer insights into biomarker changes and treatment outcome. As modern medicine aims to achieve patient-specific therapeutics, it is crucial for biomarker assays to compensate for inter-individual variabilities in measured values. Capturing multiple nuclear-originated and mitochondrial-originated tRFs using a dual primer qPCR blood-based assay may fulfill this demand. Specifically, our tRF-based score was designed to enable patient-tailored diagnosis, where the qPCR values determined for a certain patient will be compared to those of healthy volunteers or patients with PD of the same sex, ethnicity and genetic background, thus sparing the need for complex matching and normalization. Indeed, manual running of this dual qPCR test showed that the tRF-score segregated patients with PD from controls without the need for machine learning algorithms. Notably, our study relied predominantly on samples from specific demographics, and, as such, the results might not be universally applicable to all populations. Thus, that the tRF-score was similar in prodromal African American patients and matched controls paralleled an identical trend in H&Y and UPDRS scores in this cohort, strengthening the notion that this score represents a true effect and calling for further studies of such patient-matched tests and validation in diverse patient cohorts. Notably, too, blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels were effectively reduced under DBS stimulation, suggesting a linkage among tremor symptoms, electrical stimulus and the cellular localization and activities of these tRFs. Furthermore, yeast tRF research done by others43 and interaction predictions suggest that RGTTCRA-tRFs bind to the ribosome, potentially in an evolutionarily conserved translation-arresting manner. These findings are compatible with our FRET measurements and with the observation of ribosomal association and depolarization-triggered ribosomal dissociation of RGTTCRA-tRFs in cultured neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, as Ang may contribute to the synthesis of RGTTCRA-tRFs, our findings call for in-depth examination of the therapeutic potential of carefully adjusting its activity in the brains of patients with PD. Mitochondrial death is a hallmark characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases56,57 and was suggested as a blood biomarker in AD58,59. However, recent blood-based tests of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD14 reported that, in genetic cases, mitochondrial DNA damage was observed irrespective of a PD diagnosis14, highlighting the need to add other biomarkers to such tests. In this context, our combined nuclear/mitochondrial RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs measurements enable segregating genetic PD patients from apparently healthy unaffected controls carrying the same PD-related mutations. An in-depth comprehensive analysis of larger patient cohorts will be needed to better determine the efficacy of our tRF-based measurement in comparison to other blood-based PD biomarkers. The availability of an early, reliable and rapid blood test for PD diagnosis may potentially alleviate the burden of uncertainty from suffering individuals, assist clinicians' care of those patients early in the disease process and open routes for developing and testing new therapeutics. To achieve these goals, an efficient diagnostic test should (1) provide accurate and disease-specific results, (2) avoid complex neurosurgical procedures, (3) entail minimal risks to the tested patients, (4) be easy to perform and (5) be inexpensive. Unlike CSF-based tests that can be risky, costly and dependent on complex molecular and biochemical procedures, qPCR-based blood tests are minimally invasive, do not depend on hospital care and offer quick procedures based on easily amplifiable signals. Our tRF-based blood measurement proved efficient in separating prodromal PD patients from controls by a simple dual qPCR assay, suggesting that it may equip clinicians with an informative diagnostic tool based on a single individual blood test, alone or in combination with other non-invasive measurements. The reliability, sensitivity, speed and low cost of our assay may all indicate its value for enabling an improved universal, pre-symptomatic PD diagnosis that can improve detection rates and offer beneficial clinical approaches to patients with PD at diverse stages of their disease. Ethics approval for this study was confirmed by the Hebrew University's committee for research involving human-derived materials. Blood samples of the JLM cohort were collected at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20. This study consists of human brain (n = 8) and blood (n = 37) samples obtained from the NBB and of human brain samples (n = 23) obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank, each under the relevant institution's ethics and guidelines. Blood samples were further collected at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center (n = 30) under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20. Other human data were downloaded from the PPMI (blood; n = 475) and the NIH (CSF; n = 152) and from GSE23676 (blood; n = 20), all under relevant ethics approval. Further details can be found in Extended Data Fig. Written informed consent was obtained for all human samples included in this study. Brain tissues were obtained from the NBB as described in Hanan et al.4. RNA from eight male PD patient samples (see Supplementary Table 3 for patient information) was extracted using an miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 217004) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by RNA concentration determination (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), standard gel electrophoresis for quality assessment and RIN determination (Bioanalyzer 6000; Agilent). Libraries were generated from 1,200 ng of RNA (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina; New England Biolabs, E7560S), and the small RNA fraction was sequenced on a NextSeq 500 system (Illumina) at the Center for Genomic Technologies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE256334). TH and DAT levels for these samples are taken from previously published data4. Whole blood samples were obtained from the NBB (see Supplementary Table 5 for patient information). RNA was extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA Blood Mini Kit for RNA from blood (Machery-Nagel, 740200) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by RNA concentration and quality determination as above. Libraries were generated from 100 ng of total RNA (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina, as above), and the small RNA fraction was sequenced on a NextSeq 2000 system (Illumina) at the Center for Genomic Technologies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Data were deposited in GSE256334 as above. FASTQ files (of both in-house sequencing and of publicly available data) were checked for quality using FastQC60, and adaptors (if present) were removed using FLEXBAR61 according to the pipeline manual. Adaptor-less output FASTQ files were then aligned to tRFs using MINTmap (version 1.0)62. The CSF database phs000727 (downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)) included 66 patients with PD (20 removed as detailed below), 67 patients with AD (14 removed) and 69 healthy controls (16 removed). Before differential expression analysis, a principal component analysis was run based on tRF expression data, and samples that did not cluster were removed from the analysis. Those included six patients with PD, four patients with AD and six controls. Another five controls were removed because they had moderate SN depigmentation compared to no or mild depigmentation in other controls, and two additional controls were removed due to a combination of high Aβ plaque density (frequent) and high Tau tangle score (above 10). Likewise, 13 patients with PD were removed due to AD-like Braak, plaques or tangles scores. Seven patients with AD were removed due to severe SN depigmentation. Lastly, one control and one patient with AD were removed due to age younger than 60 years, and two controls, two patients with AD and one patient with PD were excluded due to exceptionally low tRF coverage (these patients had 21–1,627 counts, whereas the next lowest coverage patient had 11,745 counts). All eliminations were done before performing any analysis. See Supplementary Table 1a for general data of the CSF dataset and Supplementary Table 1b for a list of excluded samples. To further prevent any potential bias, differential expression analysis accounted for patient age, sex and PM interval. Small RNA-seq was obtained in February 2021 from the PPMI database (https://www.ppmi-info.org/access-dataspecimens/download-data), RRID: SCR 006431. Updated participant status was re-downloaded in October 2023. For up-to-date information on the study, see https://www.ppmi-info.org/. Only samples with RIN ≥ 6 were analyzed, and we additionally filtered out samples of participants who were disqualified by the PPMI or who had undetermined sex63. See Supplementary Tables 6–8 and 11 for elaboration. To test our hypothesis that tRFs can constitute a patient-specific fingerprint, we used all the samples of PPMI patients having tRF counts from four different timepoints (n = 318). To focus on the most informative features, we selected the top 0.5% of enriched tRFs, resulting in a set of 253 tRFs for analysis. The data were split into training and test sets, with the test set comprising the last available sample from each patient, to evaluate the model's performance across timepoints. Leveraging multiple timepoints per patient aimed to test whether blood-quantified tRFs might serve as a unique, patient-specific fingerprint and determine if the tRF values from a patient's first three timepoints could accurately identify which of the remaining samples belonged to that patient. We implemented a MultiClassModel class to train and evaluate multiple machine learning classifiers, including XGBoost, HistGradientBoostingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, Support Vector Classifiers (linear and nonlinear), K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes and OneVsRest (OvR) Logistic Regression. The OvR approach, also called One-vs-All, extends binary classifiers such as logistic regression to handle multiclass problems by training a separate binary classifier for each class. In this setup, the class of interest is treated as the positive label, whereas all other classes are grouped as negative. OvR is computationally efficient and straightforward, although it may not capture interactions between classes as comprehensively as multinomial logistic regression or One-vs-One approaches. As supported by Rifkin and Klautau64, OvR can achieve accuracy similar to more complex methods, especially when binary classifiers are well tuned, making it a robust and widely used solution in practice. All features were standardized using StandardScaler before model training. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was chosen as the primary evaluation metric due to its robustness in assessing both binary and multiclass classifications. After identifying the best-performing classifier, we conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with predefined parameter grids, optimizing for the MCC score. To validate the assumption that the model's performance was not due to chance, we compared the best-tuned classifier against a dummy model trained on shuffled labels. This comparison served to confirm the presence of a genuine, individual-specific signal in the tRF profiles. For prodromal (pre-symptomatic) patient analysis, we subdivided, from the above-described PPMI data, prodromal and control patients with known genetic background (idiopathic or GBA+), known ethnicity, without prescribed PD medications and older than 58 years. Furthermore, patients with psychiatric anxiety, muscle inflammation, urinary bladder impairments and diabetes were excluded (due to underrepresentation in either the prodromal or the control group). To examine the earliest possible stage, we only selected patients with sequencing data from timepoints ‘BL', ‘V02' or ‘V04' (corresponding to initial diagnosis, 6 months later and 12 months later). For each of these patients, we used the earliest timepoint available for the discovery sample (60 prodromal patients and 110 controls) and the second-earliest timepoint for the holdout validation sample (33 prodromal patients and 33 controls). The single Asian control meeting the above criteria was excluded because there was no Asian prodromal patient (see Supplementary Table 7 for sample information and the ‘Statistics and reproducibility' subsection for classification processes). Additionally, to prevent biological outliers, we used only idiopathic patients of White ethnicity (as none of the other ethnicities or genetic backgrounds presented in both the prodromal and control groups to enable proper matching). For each patient, we calculated the mean value of all the timepoints of that patient for each of these measurements. Because these were needed only for the control patients, the imputed values were anyway close to zero in both of the measurements. To produce ROC curves for patients with PD, we selected patients and controls with known genetic background and without prescribed PD medications. To reduce variation between the groups, we selected patients only from ‘Phase 1' and the following ethnicities: ‘White', ‘Black or African American', ‘Hispanic or Latino' or ‘Ashkenazi Jewish'. Furthermore, to analyze the early stages of diagnosed PD patients, we used only timepoint ‘BL' and PD patients for whom PD duration was 0. See Supplementary Table 8 for patient information. To analyze DBS effects, we used small RNA-seq from the 19 patients with PD who were treated with DBS, all from the ‘Phase 2' group and having familial PD, 14 with LRRK2 mutations and five with GBA mutations. Levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs in the DBS-treated patients were compared to those in PD patients with the above mutations who did not undergo DBS surgery (n = 11) and to those in control patients carrying the same mutations (n = 9). Non-DBS PD patients and controls were selected from the latest timepoint (V8) to account for the length of time most DBS-treated PD patients have been ill.

Blood from 10 patients with PD, 10 patients with head trauma and 10 controls was taken in Jerusalem under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20. Each group consisted of males and females, and all three had a similar average age (PD, 72 ± 7.5; Trauma, 73 ± 12; Control, 68 ± 5.6). See Supplementary Table 9 for detailed patient information. Samples were collected in Tempus Blood RNA Tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4342792), and RNA was extracted using a Norgen Preserved Blood RNA Purification Kit I (Norgen Biotek, 43400). Concentration was determined (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quality was assessed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA synthesis (from 250 ng) and qPCR are described below. SN tissue samples (left hemisphere) were obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank. All donors died of natural cause at age 71–79 years and were of ‘White' ethnicity. For elaboration, see Supplementary Table 10. RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit as above, followed by RNA concentration determination and quality assessment as above. cDNA synthesis (from 500 ng) and qPCR are described below. qPCRs were performed in 96-well (Bio-Rad, HSP9601) or 384-well (Bio-Rad, HSP3805) plates, using PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix Low ROX (Quantabio, 95074) and primers (Merck) as below, on a Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR System with CFX Maestro software (Bio-Rad, version 4.1.2433.1219). The qPCR was programmed for 30 s of annealing/extension at 50 °C due to the short primer length. ΔCq for each sample was calculated as ‘mean (RGTTCRA-tRF triplicate) − mean (MT-tRF triplicate)'. ΔΔCq was calculated by dividing each ΔCq value by the mean ΔCq of the control patients. Expression of each sample was calculated as 2ΔΔCq. RGTTCRA-tRF primer for blood samples: GGTCCCTGGTTCAA RGTTCRA-tRF primer for brain samples: CGGGTTCGATTCCC MT-tRF primer for blood and brain samples: TAACTTAGCATTAACCTTTTAA The products of two qPCR amplicons (PD1 and T7) were sequenced as follows. Small RNA libraries were prepared from 500 ng of cDNA (blunting with NEB-E1201, followed by poly(A) and library preparation with KAPA (KK8420) mRNA-seq Kit) and sequenced using the NextSeq 2000 system (Illumina) as described above. FASTQ files were aligned to tRFs as described above. Sequencing data of blood taken from six controls and seven patients with PD (all males) were downloaded from GEO dataset GSE23676. Blood from patients with PD was drawn before DBS surgery and several months after surgery, upon optimal stimulation (Supplementary Table 12). Affymetrix probes of Ang were found using biomaRt65, and all the Ang probes were summed to yield the expression of the gene. We checked each of the expressed tRFs against the sequences of the Ribo-essential tRFs and against the open regions in the rRNAs that we found to contain reverse complement sequences to the RGTTCRA sequence (see sequences below), and we retrieved the total energy for each tRF (total energy equals the sum of melting energies of each of the sequences minus their binding energy to each other): 18S RGTTCRA reverse complement open region: AGGGGCGAAAGACTAATCGAACCAUTCTA 28S RGTTCRA reverse complement open region: TAACCCGTTGAACCCCAT The human-derived neuroblastoma cell line LAN-5 was cultured under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2) in RPMI (Merck, R0883) supplemented with FCS (10% final concentration; Sartorius, 04-127), L-glutamine (2 mM final concentration; Sartorius, 03-020) and penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin (100 U ml−1, 0.1 mg ml−1, 0.25 µg ml−1, final concentrations, respectively; Sartorius, 03-033). Cells were mycoplasma free (MycoBlue Mycoplasma Detection Kit; Vazyme, D101) and were used between passages 5 and 8. Six days later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C. Blocking solution (PBS with 5% normal donkey serum) was added to the wells for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 1-h incubation with primary antibody against human RPL24 (Proteintech, 17082-1-AP; rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000) and secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10042; donkey anti-rabbit, 1:1,000) for 2 h. Cells were then washed with FISH buffer (1:1 of 2× SCC and 50% formamide and containing 50 μg ml−1 heparin), followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with Affinity Plus (Integrated DNA Technologies) in situ probe, at a concentration of 200 nM. The probes were 5′-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 and contained locked nucleic acids at the bases marked ‘+': Probe sequence: ACT + CGAA + CCCA + CAAC + CTT To assess interactions with donor–acceptor proximity of less than 10 nm (refs. 48,67,68,69) between RGTTCRA-tRFs and ribosomes, we used FRET-FLIM with PIE70,71,72 (Extended Data Fig. This allowed collecting fluorescence photon absolute detection times and detection times relative to moments of excitation for donor fluorescence after donor excitation, for acceptor fluorescence after donor excitation and FRET and for acceptor fluorescence after acceptor direct excitation. This was achieved with a confocal-based setup (ISS) assembled on top of a modified Olympus IX71 inverted microscope, as previously reported73,74. Donor and acceptor PIE was achieved by 488-nm and 532-nm picosecond pulsed lasers (λ = 488 nm, pulse width 80 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM), λ = 532 nm, pulse of 100 ps FWHM, rate; QuixX 488-60 PS, Omicron-Laserage, and FL-532-PICO, CNI), operating at 20-MHz repetition rate and interleaved by 25 ns. Of note, levels of donor fluorescence leakage into the acceptor fluorescence detection channel were negligible47. The laser beams passed through a single-mode polarization maintaining optical fiber (P1-405BPM-FC-Custom, specifications similar to those of PM-S405-XP, Thorlabs), a collimating lens (AC080-016-A-ML, Thorlabs), a halfwave plate (WPMP2-20(OD)-BB 550 nm, Karl Lambrecht Corp.) and a linear polarizer (DPM-100-VIS, Meadowlark Optics). Laser beams for acquiring images in laser scanning mode were reflected through galvo-scanning mirrors (6215H XY, Novanta Corp.) and scan lens (30 mm diameter × 50 mm focal length (FL), VIS-NIR Coated, Achromatic Lens, Edmund Optics) using a dichroic beam splitter at 405 nm, 488 nm, 532 nm and 640 nm (ZT405/488/532/640rpc-XT, Chroma). A ×100/1.45 numerical aperture (NA) oil objective (UPLSAPO100XO ×100 / 1.45 / oil / ∞ / 0.17/ OFN 26.5, Olympus) focused the light onto a small effective excitation volume. Scattered light was imaged on a CMOS camera (ThorCam, Thorlabs) using Airy ring pattern visualization. Fluorescence was collected through the same objective and focused with an achromatic lens (25 mm diameter × 100 mm FL, VIS-NIR Coated, Edmund Optics) onto a 100-μm-diameter pinhole and re-collimated with another achromatic lens (f = 100 mm; AC254-060-A, Thorlabs). Fluorescence was then split into two detection channels, 510/20 for AF488 and 698/70 for AF568, using a dichroic mirror (555-nm cutoff, FF555-Di03-25 × 36, Semrock) followed by bandpass filter 510/20 nm for wavelength <555 nm and 698/70 nm for wavelength >555 nm (FF03-510/20-25 and ff01-697/58-25, Semrock). Photons were detected using cooled hybrid photomultipliers (model R10467U-40, Hamamatsu) routed to a time-correlated single-photon counting module (SPC-150, Becker & Hickl) as its START signal (STOP signal was routed from the pulsed laser controller). For data acquisition, we used VistaVision software (version 4.2.095, 64-bit, ISS) in time-tagged time-resolved (TTTR) file format, and images were obtained using a laser scanning module in which a three-axis DAC module (ISS) synchronized data acquisition and control over the galvo-scanning mirrors. Images for FLIM measurements were obtained by tail-fitting fluorescence decays of each pixel in each photon stream (combination of excitation laser and detection channel), if it had at least 50 photons. FLIM images were acquired with 10-ms pixel dwell times in 15 × 15-μm2 image dimensions and 128 × 128-pixel resolutions. All multiple comparisons were FDR corrected, and all visualizations were done using ggplot2 (ref. All statistical tests were conducted two-sided unless reported otherwise. All of the box plots in this paper are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles, respectively; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles, respectively. Differential analysis was carried out using edgeR77 (version 4.0.14) with patient age, sex and PM interval used as covariates in the design matrix of the edgeR analysis. Data collection and analysis were not performed blinded to the conditions of the experiments. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are compatible with those accepted in other publications in the field34,38,63. We found the power of each of the differentially expressed tRFs to be higher than 0.87, with most of them (25th quantile and above) having a power higher than 0.9, which may improve the credibility of our findings in spite of the small number of samples. Whenever the number of samples was smaller than 30, and the data did not distribute normally (P < 0.05 in a Shapiro test), a non-parametric test was run. Non-parametric tests were likewise used upon the need to compare median rather than mean values. All correlation tests conducted in this study (Extended Data Figs. 3c and 4e,f) are Spearman correlations, as we were interested in any type rather than linear correlation. Whenever comparing two groups to a third one, we used a Dunnett test (Figs. Binomial test was run on the differentially expressed tRFs in the CSF (Fig. 1b) and showed that they behave as a family and that most of the tRFs carrying the motif change in the same way. Upon comparing RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRF or RGTTCRA/MT-tRF ratio in blood of living and PM patients (Fig. 2f–h), we used the Mann–Whitney test (with FDR correcting for multiple comparisons) to compare the PD effect (PD versus Ctrl in each subgroup of a specific dataset and genetic background), and we employed a two-way ANOVA test to estimate the overall effect of PD while accounting for the dataset (that is, PM or alive) and the genetic background as covariates. The reason for using Mann–Whitney rather than a t-test for the first type of comparisons was that both the genetic controls and the PD idiopathic groups included low patient numbers (16 in each), and the data did not distribute normally (P < 0.0014, P < 0.003, P < 3 × 10−5, for PM RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRFs and Live genetic MT-tRFs, respectively; Shapiro test). Matching analysis was carried out using MatchIt79 (version 4.6.0), with matched factors being sex, age and batch (‘Study'), distance = ‘glm' and link = ‘probit'. For each of the ROC calculations (either prodromal and controls or PD and controls), we first used an ‘optimal' matching in which each prodromal or PD patient was matched with a control (based on the above-mentioned factors). Next, the ratio between RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs was normalized for each matched pair of prodromal and control or PD and control individuals, by dividing the pair's scores by the pair's mean. Lastly, we used a machine learning algorithm to calculate ROC (MLeval, version 0.3)80. In the feature selection process, a Mann–Whitney calculation was used to prevent outlier patients from skewing the results (for this reasoning, we focused on median rather than mean differences). The dimensions used for the ROC calculations included ethnicity and either UPDRS III and H&Y scores or the tRF normalized ratio (described above). The training control was performed with five cross-validations using both GBM and linear model (LM) machine learning algorithms (method = ‘cv‘, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, number = 5 and classProbs and savePredictions = T). ROC curves were plotted using the pROC package81 (version 1.18.5). In training the model on randomly mixed labels, we received an AUC of 0.43, which reflects systematic misclassification rather than predictive power, as the model picked up on random patterns in the data. This result illustrates the random distribution expected in a sham model setup, with a marginal error. We further ran iterations of a ‘full' matching in which patients were divided into clusters, each containing at least one prodromal or PD patient and one control, and the same pipeline as described above for the ‘optimal' matching was used. 4g), we ran chi-square, first using the percentage of patients predicted by random distribution and then using the percentage of patients predicted by the clinical-based algorithm as the reference probability. This created a confusion matrix of two columns (predicted to be prodromal, predicted to be control) and two rows (is indeed prodromal, is indeed control). Comparing the matrix of the tRF-based algorithm to the reference clinical-based matrix enabled proving that the tRF-based algorithm predicted a higher number of true prodromal patients to be prodromal. First, we extracted all options of 14-nt-long sequences found in the PPMI-expressed tRFs. For example, for a tRF with the length of 30 nt, we regarded each of the sequences produced from nucleotides 1–14, 2–15, 3–16… 17–30 as a potential motif. We than created 10,000 couples of randomly selected motifs and, for each couple, ran the same process as described above (namely, for each patient, we summed the counts for each of these motifs and calculated the ratio between the sums). We then normalized the ratio for each pair of optimally matched prodromal and control patients by dividing both by the mean of the pair's ratio. We ran GMB analysis and extracted the yielded AUC.

(2025)Cite this article The immune system plays a major role in the regulation of adipose tissue homeostasis. Viral infection often drives fat loss, but how and why this happens is unclear. Here, we show that visceral adipose tissue transiently decreases adiposity following viral infection. Upon pathogen encounter, adipose tissue upregulates surface expression of ligands for activating receptors on natural killer cells, which drives IFNγ secretion. This cytokine directly stimulates adipocytes to shift their balance from lipogenesis to lipolysis, which leads to release of lipids in circulation, most notably of free fatty acids. The free fatty acid oleic acid stimulates early-activated B cells by promoting oxidative phosphorylation. Oleic acid promoted expression of co-stimulatory B7 molecules on B cells and promoted their ability to prime CD8+ T cells. Inhibiting lipid uptake by activated B cells impaired CD8+ T cell responses, causing an increase of viral replication in vivo. Our findings uncover a previously unappreciated mechanism of metabolic adaptation to infection and provide a better understanding of the interactions between immune cells and adipose tissue in response to inflammation.

Indicated are statistical significances at 2-sided Student t-test (F) or ANOVA with Bonferroni's post testing (A, E, M). Viral infection causes an influx of immune cells in white adipose tissue (WAT), most notably of NK cells. These cells recognize stress ligands in WAT and produce the cytokine IFNγ. In response to IFNγ stimulation, adipocytes shift the balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis in favour of the latter, resulting in the release of lipids, including free fatty acids (FFAs), in the circulation. The FFA oleic acid promotes B cell activation and stimulates their co-stimulatory potential by upregulation of CD86. This, in turn, promotes activation of CD8 T cells and potentiates the antiviral response. Created in BioRender.
