The alert explained that U.S. Customs discovered that the entry code for U.S. shippers to use to have their freight exempted is not working and "the issue is being reviewed." In the alert, Customs advised filers "to transmit cargo release separately and follow up with the summary filing when resolved." The on the water clause has not changed, even though the China tariff percentages have increased to 145% and a series of other recent tariffs have been put in place. For U.S. shippers and the supply chain, it's the latest blow at a time of uncertainty and fear about tariffs policy. It also raises questions about Customs ability to handle the new policy and collect the tariffs revenue that is key to Trump administration economic goals. Interpretations of the multiple executive orders, social media posts, and customs alerts have some U.S. companies and industry groups trying to figure out when the new tariffs will be deployed. "There has been some confusion on what President Trump has said in social media posts on when the tariff starts and what is written in the executive order," said Jarred Varanelli, vice president of US sales at logistics firm Savino Del Bene. "Social media posts are not law on the pause and increase in tariffs. With the constant changes to the regulations, all customs brokers in our industry have a difficult task ahead of them." Despite President Trump saying numerous times tariffs are in effect and being collected, U.S. shippers tell CNBC they have not been charged higher tariff rates on their containers, some of which came in as late as yesterday. Dewardric McNeal, managing director and senior policy analyst at Longview Global with a focus on international trade, foreign affairs and defense, tells CNBC glitches do happen, but the timing is unfortunate and will lead to more questions about Customs' ability to keep up with the pace of the tariffs. "Whether you agree or disagree with the policy, you have to ask, do we have the ability to do it this rapidly?" "This glitch may be an indication we need more time. "I don't think it will slow down goods. These companies will need to refile that at a later date. The U.S. is currently at work on negotiations with over 75 countries on tariffs deals that Trump has said will be tailored to each nation. Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a three-generation educational toy company which makes its products in China, said this year it was scheduled to expand with the construction of a new building, but now he is pausing expansion and reviewing his company's financials to see where cuts can be made. "I cannot run my business based on social media posts," said Woldenberg. "This is making it difficult for me to make my business decisions. Instead of planning on growth, I'm talking about surviving. The banking industry and insurance industry that serve businesses both large and small will be impacted if companies go bankrupt." This policy was crafted with little interest in the details.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Personal Loans if You Don't Have Credit Personal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower President Donald Trump on Friday said five more law firms have struck agreements with his administration that involve them committing to at least $600 million total in pro bono work for causes the president supports. The new deals follow similar moves by numerous other law firms, which came as Trump threatens to sign punitive executive orders targeting legal offices for their past or current association with his perceived enemies. Trump on Truth Social on Friday said that four firms — Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Allen Overy Shearman Sterling US LLP, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, and Latham & Watkins LLP — have each committed to at least $125 million in free legal work, for a total of $500 million. In a separate post, Trump announced a similar deal with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, LLP for at least $100 million. The pro bono services will be directed toward causes that both Trump and the firms support, include assisting veterans, combating antisemitism and ensuring "fairness in our Justice System," according to the posts. All five firms also agreed not to "engage in illegal DEI discrimination and preferences" and commit to "Merit-Based Hiring." They additionally affirm not to deny representation to clients "because of the personal political views of individual lawyers." Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has withdrawn letters it sent them on March 17 "and will not pursue any claims related to those issues."

Mari Shor was deep into a firm-wide presentation on what President Donald Trump's tariffs meant for the dozens of consumer companies she analyzes at Columbia Threadneedle when someone interrupted her. Mari, the tariffs are paused, the colleague said, the stocks you cover are soaring.

For days, Shor had been scrambling to tweak her profit models to incorporate the steep tariffs Trump unveiled last week and now those new estimates looked, for the moment at least, irrelevant. A day later, as stocks began to sink anew, Shor marveled at the blinding confusion created by all the twists and turns in Trump's trade war. </p>

Larry Fink

BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said he was caught by surprise at the breadth of President Donald Trump's tariffs last week on many countries, including key US trading partners.

“The sweeping US tariff announcements went beyond anything I could have imagined in my 49 years in finance,” Fink said on a call on Friday with analysts after the company reported first-quarter financial results.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a fiery statement, China's Finance Ministry accused the US of "bullying" and said it risked becoming a "joke" on the world stage. "The US's arbitrary imposition of abnormally high tariffs on China seriously violates international economic and trade rules, disregards the post-World War II global economic order built by the US itself, and violates basic economic laws and common sense. It is completely unilateral bullying and coercion," the statement said. "Even if the US continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of the world economy," it added. Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note on Friday that the difference between the two figures was "negligible in any practical economic sense. " But they said the markets reacted to an increased decoupling of two of the world's largest economies. "Neither the US nor China are showing signs of backing down, with President Trump expressing confidence in his tariff plans yesterday, even as he acknowledged potential 'transition problems,'" the analysts said. Earlier in the week, Trump announced that he would pause a large swathe of his tariffs for 90 days, though many — including tariffs on China — remained in effect. Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said on Friday that the president's willingness to change his stance on tariffs in response to equity and bond market turmoil showed some sensitivity to market turbulence. "To be sure, the significant tariffs on China will cause economic disruption if they remain in place," he said. "But while downside risks do remain, we believe the risk of a more severe economic downturn is now more limited." On Truth Social, Trump wrote Wednesday: "At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable." The Trump administration estimated the US ran a trade deficit of $295 billion with China in 2024, with the US importing $440 billion in goods from China and China importing $145 billion in goods from America. China's announcement of new retaliatory tariffs had a mixed impact on European stocks, though it was less significant than moves earlier in the week. Germany's DAX was down 1.5% by about 1:30 p.m. local time (7:30 a.m. US futures were trading a little higher, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all set to open up by about 0.2%. "Both China and the US have sent clear messages, there is no point of raising tariffs further," Zhiwei Zhang, the president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in a note on Thursday.</p>

He joked that he'd like to see "a three-camera sitcom in 'Star Wars' or a horror movie." Gilroy spoke to Business Insider on the "Andor" season two red carpet in London on Thursday. Asked what he would do with a "Star Wars" horror project, he said Lucasfilm and Disney already had one in development: "They're doing that. I think that's in the works, yeah." Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He also clarified his previous comments: "I'm agnostic about what should be done. Sometimes riffing doesn't work with the 'Star Wars' community." So, my hope is that the show connects, and then we can pass along the favor that we were given from 'Mandalorian,' and we can pass along a good healthy backwind to someone else who wants to do something else cool." The "Andor" series is a more serious affair than some of the other "Star Wars" projects of late. The first season, released in 2022, was met with widespread critical acclaim and earned a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Its success showed that the "Star Wars" franchise can explore wider themes and genres without relying on the Jedi, lightsabers, and the Force to keep its audience engaged.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I recently visited Redwood Materials, a company that's deeply entrenched in the electric vehicle industry. Elon Musk's DOGE activities have dented the allure of Tesla vehicles, and there are nagging questions over EV demand and whether the auto industry is all in on this technology — or not. "We've been very fortunate to have a strong set of partners — to be very tied into their demand plans and how they see the market evolving — and we have not seen softening," he said. 2024 was the largest year of EV shipments on record in North America, and I think 2025 will be even larger," Lankton added. OEM refers to an original equipment manufacturer, or a company that designs and makes its own cars. "But the consumer is looking at EVs as compelling options," he said. "OEMs in North America are offering more and more compelling options and we feel very bullish about the long-term growth of electric vehicles." It's fair to take Lankton's view with a pinch of salt. Redwood Materials is relying on EV demand staying strong to support its ambitious business plans. Cox Automotive's Q1 2025 report found the US EV market continuing to grow. And while certain brands have lost ground, others are leaning into long-term demand with confidence. While Tesla saw a decline, legacy auto brands such as Chevrolet, VW, Toyota, and Honda saw massive growth, year over year. It sold more than 4,000 EVs in Q1, up 250% from a year earlier. "Despite many obstacles — and what you may read elsewhere — electric-vehicle sales continue to grow at a healthy pace in the US," Cox wrote in its latest report.</p>

The Model S and Model X account for only a fraction of Tesla's sales in China.

Tesla Inc. stopped taking orders in China for Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles — both of which are imported from the US — after the countries raised tariffs on one another in an escalating trade war.

The electric-car maker was offering the option to order the two models as of the end of March, according to a screenshot of its China website archived by Wayback Machine. Although that had been removed as of Friday, existing inventory of cars, such as a white Model S listed for 759,900 yuan ($103,800), is still available.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, OpenAI says it could rebuild GPT-4 with as few as five people, all because of what it learned from its latest model, GPT-4.5. In a company podcast episode published Friday, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, asked a question to three key engineers behind GPT-4.5: What's the smallest OpenAI team that could retrain GPT-4 from scratch today? Altman said building GPT-4 took "hundreds of people, almost all of OpenAI's effort" — but things get much easier once a model is no longer at the frontier. Alex Paino, who led pre-training machine learning for GPT-4.5, said retraining GPT-4 now would "probably" take just five to 10 people. "We trained GPT-4o, which was a GPT-4-caliber model that we retrained using a lot of the same stuff coming out of the GPT-4.5 research program," Paino said. "Doing that run itself actually took a much smaller number of people." Daniel Selsam, a researcher at OpenAI working on data efficiency and algorithms, agreed that rebuilding GPT-4 would now be far easier. "Just finding out someone else did something — it becomes immensely easier," he said. In February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, saying it was the company's largest and most powerful model to date. Paino said GPT-4.5 is designed to be "10x smarter" than GPT-4, which was released in March 2023. Altman also said OpenAI is no longer "compute-constrained" on the best models it can produce — a shift he thinks the world hasn't really understood yet. For many AI companies, the biggest hurdle to building better models is simply having enough computing power. "For so long, we lived in a world where compute was always the limiting factor," he added. Big Tech has been pouring billions into AI infrastructure. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in February that demand for AI compute will only grow. Future reasoning can consume much more compute," Huang said on the call. The GPT models are very efficient at processing information, but there's a "ceiling to how deep of an insight it can gain from the data," he said. Pushing beyond that, he said, will require "some algorithmic innovations" to squeeze more value from the same amount of data.</p>

Emma Walmsley on navigating global politics and why inclusion still matters

In her eight-year tenure as chief executive officer of GSK Plc, Emma Walmsley has seen off a combative activist investor, navigated multi-billion dollar litigation in the US and spun out a consumer health company, Haleon Plc. Her latest challenge is preparing the drugmaker for the looming threat of getting dragged into President Donald Trump's trade war.

The 55-year-old has worked to turn GSK — which traces its history to the 18th century — into a forward-looking pharma company by embracing new developments, including pivoting back to cancer medicines and investing in artificial intelligence. Still, with the share price stubbornly low, she's facing pressure from investors to improve performance. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dollar and Treasurys are selling off on Friday as President Donald Trump's trade war ratchets up the risk for American assets. The index chalked up 2.7% in losses over the past week and is 7.6% lower year to date. Meanwhile, Treasury yields have risen, which means that prices of the assets have fallen because the two metrics move in opposite directions. The 10-year Treasury yield is around 4.45% — up nearly five basis points. The spike in bond yields — which typically indicates higher interest rates — helped prompt Trump to put a 90-day pause on most tariffs. The slump in the greenback and Treasurys is significant because they are typically considered safe assets that investors flock to in times of uncertainty. In contrast, investors are putting their money into classic haven assets elsewhere, like the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc, and gold. The dollar's steep losses signal that many investors are focusing on the idea that "Trump's reluctant pause on tariffs was due to increased system risk and migrating capital away from Ground Zero," Weston wrote on X on Friday. Even though Trump's pause on most tariffs for 90 days sent markets into a stunning rally on Wednesday, the gains came off quickly on Thursday, showing investors' jitters about ongoing macro uncertainty. The unusual pattern of higher long-term interest rates and sharply lower stock prices suggests a "generalized aversion to US assets in global financial markets," wrote ex-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, on X on Wednesday. "We are being treated by global financial markets like a problematic emerging market," Summers wrote. The trade suggests that the US's "flip-flopping of policy is now demanding a higher risk premium of US asset markets," wrote Chris Turner, the global head of markets at ING, in a Thursday note. The unusual market movements come amid unprecedented tumult sparked by Trump's trade war that is shaking confidence in the central role of the dollar in the global financial system — a position that others are also eying. I believe that the Trump administration also has that view, but it is very incoherent in the way it practices that," Francois Villeroy de Galhau, the French central bank governor and a policymaker at the European Central Bank, told France Inter radio on Thursday. "What has happened in recent days and weeks plays against the confidence in the US currency." ING's Turner wrote that euro assets could benefit if the "Sell America theme" unfurls fully.</p>
