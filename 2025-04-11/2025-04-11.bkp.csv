            The Trump administration plans to eliminate the research arm of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, close all weather and climate labs and eviscerate its budget along with several other NOAA offices, according to internal documents obtained by CNN.
    


            The move would devastate weather and climate research even as weather is becoming more erratic and extreme. It could cripple the US industries — including agriculture — that depend on free, accurate weather and climate data and expert analysis. It would also halt research on deadly weather, including severe storms and tornadoes.
    


            A source familiar with the plan told CNN that while the draft budget for fiscal year 2026 will have to be approved by Congress, it is also being distributed to the agency now as guidance on how to slash its current operating budget for the agency, which means the cuts could be implemented this year.
    


            The budget proposal eliminates NOAA's Oceanic and Atmospheric Research office and stops funding regional climate data, climate competitive research or sea grant programs. Overall, it cuts the funding for programs currently under the research office by roughly 75%.
    


            The proposed budget also severely defunds other key offices of NOAA, such as the National Ocean Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, and transfers most of the fisheries service functions to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which sits under the Interior Department. (NOAA currently is housed within the US Commerce Department).
    


            The internal Trump administration document says the National Marine Fisheries Service “should prioritize permitting” to “unleash American energy” from activities like offshore oil drilling.
    


This is a developing story and it will be updated.

            If José Luis Ballester was trying to make a name for himself at his first Masters tournament, he certainly succeeded. Just not in the way he might have expected before his opening round.
    


            The debutant, known by his nickname Josele, admitted to urinating in Rae's Creek on the 13th hole at Augusta National Thursday afternoon. Not quite the water hazard relief golfers usually take.
    


            The 21-year-old, who qualified for the major after winning the 2024 US Amateur at Hazeltine in Minnesota, defended his decision after the round.

            “I completely forgot that we had those restrooms on the left of the tee box,” Ballester told reporters.
    


            “And then I'm like, ‘I really need to pee.' Didn't really know where to go, and since JT (Justin Thomas) had an issue on the green, I'm just like, ‘Okay I'm just going to go sneak here in the river.'”
    


            Ballester didn't think anyone would see him. The Spaniard might've underestimated the number of fans and officials at an event like the Masters as after his bathroom break, he got a round of applause.
    


            “They clapped for me. Probably one of the (loudest) claps that I really got today. Like, really loud. So that was kind of funny,” Ballester said.
    


            Despite confirming that fans saw him, he felt no regret and was not concerned about any potential repercussions from Augusta officials.
    


            “It was not embarrassing at all for me,” Ballester added. “So, if I had to do it again, I would do it again.”
    


            And clearly it wasn't too much of a distraction as the Arizona State senior went on to par the hole.
    


            Peeing into Rae's Creek wasn't the only eye-catching moment of Ballester's opening round. He also garnered attention on social media for his Arizona State hat featuring upside down “Sun Devils” lettering. Augusta National is known to have strict dress code rules for players and patrons alike – something Jason Day knows all too well after being asked to tone down his outfits this year.
    


            Ballester, who was playing with last year's Masters winner Scottie Scheffler and world No. 8 Justin Thomas, ended the day tied for 73rd at four over par.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Republicans may be poised to kill tens of thousands of jobs in districts that voted for Trump","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/climate/republican-budget-clean-energy-jobs/index.html","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            Republican Rep. Joe Wilson believes former President Joe Biden's landmark climate law was “fraud.” He dislikes the tax credits it created for solar power and electric vehicles. He's not opposed to clean energy, he said, he's just not interested in taxpayers funding it.
    


            But he is proud of the development of a Scout Motors electric vehicle factory and the 4,000 jobs it stands to create in his South Carolina district. The project, under construction about 15 miles north of Columbia, is relying at least in part on funding from the climate law, but Wilson thinks they'd move forward with the venture even if Republicans carry out Trump's desire to kill the clean energy credits in an upcoming budget vote.
    


            “I have not discussed this with (the company), but it would be my view from my visit there and understanding of what they're doing, I think they're so professional, they can handle it on their own without government subsidy,” Wilson told CNN.
    


            “Scout Motors is here to stay,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “With that said, the tax incentives that help companies who choose to manufacture great products here in the United States are important for our business. Repealing these tax incentives could have a significantly negative impact on American innovation, American job creation, and the growth of Scout Motors.”
    


            Wilson's position reflects the battle brewing between Congressional Republicans: Some vocally defend Biden's tax credits because they're bringing billions of dollars of investment and thousands of jobs to their districts; others want fulfill Trump's promise to terminate the law.
    


Nearly 80% of the investments sparked by the climate law has been in Republican congressional districts, according to data from the nonpartisan think tank Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Republicans represent 14 of the top 20 congressional districts that are set to gain the most jobs.
    


            Tennessee, Georgia and the Carolinas have gained most of the new jobs in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing, said Trevor Houser, a partner at Rhodium Group. Unlike Wilson, experts and business leaders aren't bullish the clean-energy ventures can stand on their own.
    


            “We'll see a huge number that get canceled” if the tax credits are killed, Houser said. “It's hard to predict exactly which facilities will get canceled, but a bunch of them will.”
    


            That could devastate Republican voters.
    


            “The worst thing that can happen is these factories get built, open, and either leave a ton of expected growth (and) jobs on the table — or they close entirely,” said Albert Gore, the executive director of EV trade group the Zero Emission Transportation Association. “That's a terrible outcome for these districts.”
    


            Republican infighting is on the verge of spilling into public view as Congress inches closer to its massive budget proposal, after House Republicans cleared a key procedural hurdle on Thursday. Now the hard work of filling in the budget blueprint while simultaneously making significant spending cuts begins, which is where the fate of the energy tax credits will be determined.
    


            Trump has vowed to “terminate” Biden's clean energy law, dubbing it the “Green New Scam,” and his administration has attempted to halt several federal grant programs created by the law with varying amounts of success.
    


            But it will take an act of Congress to reverse the tax credits that have spurred the investment and jobs in mostly Republican districts.
    


            No Republican lawmakers voted for the climate and tax law when it passed in summer 2022, opposing the climate measures as well as unrelated programs that boosted the number of IRS agents to collect tax revenue.
    


            Now, many House Republicans acknowledge the vital economic role clean-energy tax credits are playing in their districts.
    


            Rep. Mark Amodei, whose Nevada district is poised to gain more than 20,000 jobs in mining, refining and processing lithium for EVs and batteries, told CNN that continuing to fund these facilities in his district is “fundamental.”
    


            A bill that doesn't include these tax credits would be a red line for him, he said.
    


            “This makes good economic development sense, tariff policy sense and trade sense,” said Amodei, who recently met with lithium business leaders in his district. “If you don't have lithium production, it's like, ‘I'm going to see the baseball game, but we don't have a stadium.'”
    


            Buddy Carter's district in Georgia is home to a Hyundai electric-vehicle factory that could add more than 8,000 jobs, depending on outstanding funding from IRA tax credits. Carter thinks Republicans “should take a scalpel to (the clean energy law), and not a sledgehammer.” It's unclear which tax credits he would propose cutting and which he would keep.
    


            Carter told CNN the response he has received across the party, including from House Speaker Mike Johnson, has been “mixed.”
    


            House GOP lawmakers who want to keep the tax credits told CNN they have been doing outreach on the issue for months, which has included letters to House GOP leadership, educating members with specific examples of how their districts have benefited and conversations with the Trump administration.
    


            “This is something that I've been talking about for well over a year,” said Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa, who chairs the Conservative Climate Caucus.
    


            The Trump administration's aggressive tariff push has shined a brighter spotlight on the case for the continuation of IRA tax credits.
    


            “Especially now with all the tariffs and the interest in trying to bring manufacturing back to the US, you can't have that manufacturing if you don't have energy and you can't run the plant,” said New York Rep. Andrew Garbarino, who led 21 Republicans in a letter to the House Ways and Means Committee last month calling for the tax credits to be preserved.
    


            Garbarino said there is a “need” for energy from renewables like wind and solar to keep projects powered. “It takes 10 years to build a natural gas plant,” he added.
    


            Rep. Darin LaHood of Illinois, whose district stands to gain nearly 13,000 jobs from projects including a re-opened Stellantis EV assembly plant as a result of IRA tax credits, acknowledged to CNN that there was a “bullseye” on the legislation since it was not initially passed with bipartisan support.
    


            LaHood, who sits on the Ways and Means panel, told CNN the task for Republicans will be figuring out how to not pull the rug out from under businesses that have been counting on and planning around these federal dollars.
    


            “These tax credits are not going to last in perpetuity or until the end of their life currently in the bill. But let's figure out what's the appropriate sweet spot for a reasonable ramp down” LaHood said, emphasizing that approach will vary by sector.
    


            Meanwhile, Rep. Randy Weber, who represents a swath of coastal Texas southeast of Houston, is not worried if his district loses over 10,000 jobs related to offshore wind manufacturing and carbon capture that IRA tax credits would bring.
    


            “If we have to give a little, we'll give a little,” Weber told CNN. “You're talking about jobs, but you're also talking about things that people have disagreement on. Not everybody is for offshore wind. I wish I could tell you they are.”
    


            In Tennessee, Ford is building a massive EV and battery factory in Rep. David Kustoff's district, which is part of the reason it stands to gain as many as 18,000 jobs — the most in the nation — from Biden's tax credits.
    


            Kustoff says the businesses he represents “have made investments where they've relied on what was passed in the Inflation Reduction Act.”
    


            But, deep in conversations with his fellow Ways and Means Committee members, Kustoff has a less-than-reassuring message to send back home.
    


            “Stay tuned.”

Follow:


President Donald Trump is happy to talk about the financial markets when they're rising, as they were on Wednesday, but when markets were falling Thursday in the aftermath of his remarkable turnabout on tariffs, he punted to the closest adviser around.
    


            This time, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was in the hot seat.
    


            When a reporter in the Cabinet Room asked Trump to weigh in on yet another day of tumbling stocks, the president said: “Scott, do you want to have a statement on that?”
    


            “Sure,” Bessent said, pausing for a moment. “The up 2, down 1, is not a bad ratio – or up 10, down 5.”
    


            As his fellow Cabinet members and the president watched, Bessent filled the air with words. Finally, he arrived at this definitive message: “We will end up in a place of great certainty over the next 90 days on tariffs.”
    


            The next three months at the White House, until the deadline of the tariff pause approaches on July 8, will offer a telling window into just who has Trump's ear on trade policy.
    


            For now, that clearly includes Bessent, who is credited with persuading the president to pull back – at least temporarily – from the brink of economic calamity, emerging as one of the leading voices in the latest round of global economic upheaval.

            But others, including trade hawk Peter Navarro, continue to wield influence with Trump, even if to some it appeared his hardline position fell out of favor with Trump in his decision to retreat.
    


            Navarro acknowledged Thursday he wasn't in the room as the president reached his final decision; that duty fell on Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has rarely missed an opportunity to visit the West Wing, sometimes to the confusion of the people who work there.
    


            But Navarro — a longtime Trump ally who served prison time last year for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee that investigated January 6, 2021 — said it hardly mattered.
    


            “It doesn't matter who was in the room. The boss calls and whatever. That's not the point,” Navarro told CNN. “The point is that this team is the best team in history, we provide him the appropriate set of advice, every one of us on the team has a different skill set that combines to the collective wisdom of the group and the boss makes the decision.”
    


            To some, Trump's economic team amounts to “angels and demons,” whispering their divergent advice on tariffs and trade from opposite shoulders. To others, the disparate band of aides that have spent the past week forming, then reversing, new worldwide tariffs are all birds of a feather, willing to indulge the president's impulses no matter the economic cost.
    


            Whichever the interpretation, one truth abides in the second iteration of the Trump presidency: no one is voicing much dissent to the president himself, who continues to wage a global trade war that has spooked markets, foreign leaders and many of his own allies.
    


            That, officials say, is key to understanding the dynamics of the president's economic agenda amid an ever-more-volatile global economic standoff: Trump's objectives rest on the unapologetic view that the experts are wrong, and his gut is right.
    


            While Trump advisers this week quietly acknowledge the obvious — that the messaging, preparation and execution each fell far short of what was necessary on the reciprocal tariff plan — the decision to green light the action wasn't based on a whim.
    


            “Somebody had to pull the trigger,” Trump told reporters. “I was willing to pull the trigger.”
    


            Still, a week on the brink and the fallout in the day after Trump's three-month pause on some tariffs has laid bare the challenge ahead, and the people who will manage it.
    


            The Wall Street vs. Trade Warrior construct that defined Trump's first economic team was rife with bureaucratic knife fights, profanity-laced shouting matches and, on more than one occasion, aides on the verge of physical altercation.
    


            From the outside, the 2.0 version of Trump's team has been viewed in a similar manner, with former hedge fund manager Bessent and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in the “Wall Street” camp and Navarro, Lutnick and Stephen Miller, the deputy chief of staff for policy, filling the “trade warrior” roster.
    


            That dynamic does exist, but by degrees of difference, not chasms. And unlike in Trump's first term, when advisers like Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin made overt efforts to limit the president's tariff impulses, the president's advisers this time have all been explicit that they aren't there to chart their own path. Trump decides, and they execute, whether it was their preferred option or not, White House officials say.
    


            That dynamic was on display this week, as Trump's tariffs rocked the global economy. Trump's team regularly updated him on market conditions and had asked for his team to prepare a number of options for ways to pump the brakes as market conditions worsened. He kept a close eye on the business news networks and the perspectives shared on television by CEOs.

            Trump and some of his senior aides took notice when it appeared some members of his team seemed out of step in interviews, including on whether the tariffs amounted to a negotiation or whether they were meant to be permanent. Lutnick's appearances in particular frustrated many officials, and his television bookings waned in the days before Wednesday's pause.
    


            Mostly, however, Trump was on the phone with foreign counterparts and powerful executives desperate for some kind of exit ramp.
    


            “He just loves this shit,” a senior White House adviser said. “Talking deals with the most powerful people in the world when he's got all the cards and leverage is like air for him.”
    


            Trump has made clear to his economic team that he wants to be personally involved in each negotiation – and that he plans to drive a hard bargain and secure tangible wins, even if his threshold or even parameters for that metric are a mystery to his top aides.
    


            “My opinion is that there's a variety of improvements that could take place,” Council of Economic Advisers Chair Stephen Miran said when asked for clarity earlier this week. “But at the end of the day the president is the decider and he's gonna decide.”
    


            Miran's answer, while obvious on some level, also reflects a reality about Trump's economic team that is dramatically different from his first. There are disagreements and varying degree of enthusiasm about the president's final decision to impose sweeping new tariffs from the Rose Garden on April 2. But there has been no real attempt at changing his mind.
    


            The White House has, at times, tried papering over the differences between Trump's aides. But for the most part, they have allowed the dissension to spill into public view, suggesting it actually reflects a robust decision-making process and not the chaotic viper pit it can appear from the outside.
    


            “(Trump) has people at the highest levels of this government in this White House who have very diverse opinions on very diverse issues. But the president takes all opinions in mind, and then he makes the best decision based on the best interests of the American public,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week while explaining why Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser who has little role in trade talks, called Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks” online.
    


            “Elon and I are fine,” Navarro told CNN on Thursday. “It's no problem. It's no problem.”
    


            Bessent is among the newest members of Trump's economic team – shedding his Democratic stripes long ago to support the president's campaign – who has been put forward again and again as a reassuring voice over the past week. He often appears as something of a reluctant messenger, being asked to deliver news through carefully parsed words that can move markets.
    


            A longtime associate of Bessent, who does not share his current political views, said it was “astonishing” to see Bessent become the face of Trump's policy, but also “comforting” to see him searching for an exit ramp.
    


            “If he didn't know what he was getting into before this, he knows it now,” the associate said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating Bessent. The associate said he had “empathy, but no sympathy” for Bessent's role.
    


            Bessent has actively sought to downplay both his own role in the decision and how heavily the markets factored into Trump's thinking.
    


            “He and I had a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along,” Bessent told reporters in the White House driveway, an opaque reference to the lengthy conversation he held with Trump in Florida and on Air Force One about how to better articulate the endgame of the tariffs, which in his view was a series of negotiated trade deals.
    


            That stood in contrast to Lutnick, who wasted little time making clear on social media that he had been standing in the room with Trump when he made the reversal announcement.
    


            Navarro, meanwhile, took what appeared to be a loss in stride. He denied any tensions with his fellow advisers.
    


            “It's the whole team. We work together beautifully. I mean, Scotty is one of my best friends. We have known each other for years now,” he said on Fox Business, using a nickname for Bessent not particularly widespread in Washington. “It's a beautiful thing. … If you went behind the scenes and actually sat in on some of these meetings, we got really smart people. Each has their own comparative advantage. We all get along. We all have great ideas.”
    


            “And the president – the president is the one who guides this whole thing,” he said.
    


            Caustic, indefatigable and the keeper of Trump's maximalist “Tariff Man” flame, Navarro is firmly in the barrel as allies look for scapegoats to pin for a disjointed and messy rollout.
    


            Navarro has been a mainstay in Trump's orbit since Jared Kushner called him out of the blue, offering the role of trade adviser to Trump during his first campaign. He'd come across Navarro's book “Death by China” in the search for anyone who aligned with Trump's hardline protectionist views.
    


            He's never left, despite a long list of efforts to keep the two apart. Cohn blocked his ability to send memos directly to Trump's desk. Mnuchin undercut his ability to push more hawkish China views in the first term. And onetime chief of staff John Kelly demoted him to the periphery of the White House organizational chart.
    


            A judge sentenced him to jail.
    


            Navarro left prison and flew directly to the 2024 Republican National Convention to speak a few hours later. At one point, he pulled his fiancé on stage with him and kissed her.
    


            Standing at the back of the convention hall floor, a Republican official who served on Trump's first White House staff shook his head with a smile.
    


            “This is peak Peter,” he said.
    


            That same official, reminded of that moment this week, laughed and asked to change his answer.
    


            “I was wrong, clearly,” the official said. “This – these tariffs – this is peak Peter.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:cnn.com","Earthquake and war ravaged their families in Myanmar. But they're too scared to leave Trump's America to visit home","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/us/myanmar-students-trump-immigration-intl-latam/index.html","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","


            When a 7.7 magnitude earthquake destroyed her family's home in Myanmar, US-based international student Hope Pyae felt helpless.
    


            On the morning of March 28, she woke to frantic calls from friends, who described to her the devastation of what was the strongest quake to have hit the country in more than 100 years. Thousands of people had been killed and injured, and untold numbers lay buried beneath the rubble.
    


            Glued to her phone, she grew desperate for updates as videos of fallen buildings and sacred pagodas spread across social media. She feared the worst for her family. And as the extent of the damage grew, so too did her feeling of impotence.
    


            Hope, for whom CNN is using a pseudonym for safety reasons, is among the growing number of international students who say they do not dare leave the US because they fear they will be barred from re-entry due to President Donald Trump's clampdown on immigration.
    


            The earthquake destroyed Hope's family home, forcing her parents to move into a one-story house they now share with nearly a dozen other relatives. She yearns to visit them, to offer her support, but feels trapped by the uncertainty of what might happen upon her return to US soil.
    


            “I really want to go home. I miss them so much,” Hope says, adding she is unable to shake “this feeling of, ‘what if I never meet them again,' or ‘what if somebody passes away' and I can't be [there].”
    


            So she remains in the US, journaling alone in her dorm to cope with the sadness.
    


            Since re-entering office in January, Trump has led a widespread crackdown on immigration which has included a series of arrests and deportation proceedings against people associated with US colleges and universities, sending shockwaves across the immigrant and academic community.
    


            As a result, many US colleges and universities, including UC Berkeley and Columbia, have begun advising international students, faculty, and staff to avoid non-essential travel, citing the unpredictability of US immigration policy and the possibility of Trump enacting a travel ban.
    


            Myanmar, also known as Burma, was among those countries included in the travel ban Trump ordered in his first term and, according to a memo seen by Reuters, is on a list of nations that could face a similar measure in his second.
    


            Against this background, many international students feel they have little choice but to stay put.
    


            For Hope, who is studying clinical psychology, there is a painful twist in that when she left Myanmar, she had mentally prepared herself that she might never see her family again – but for very different reasons.
    


            Her parents knew they would not have enough money to visit her, and they did not want her to risk coming back to a country that has been wracked by an ongoing civil war since a military junta took power in a coup four years ago.
    


            “When I left my country, I was like, ‘Oh, this might also be the very last time we meet,'” says the 21-year-old.
    


            She did not foresee it would be the politics of America, rather than Myanmar, that would hold her back.
    


            Another student from Myanmar, Emma, a high school senior from a township near the capital city Naypyidaw, had big dreams when she learned last month that she had been accepted to study political science at a US university with full financial aid.
    


            But she fears Trump's clampdown could hinder her ability to get a student visa, even as an applicant with financial aid and a scholarship.
    


            Emma, also identified by a pseudonym, fears that even if she does get into the US, she would then be too anxious to leave in case she is stopped from re-entering, despite having a valid visa.
    


            She is finishing off her high school studies in India, where her parents sent her for safety after the outbreak of the war, and is currently unable to contact them due to a combination of the damage the quake did to communication lines and deliberate VPN internet blockages by the military junta.
    


            The last, brief time she managed to get through to her family was on the day of the quake. Her mother was crying because a building had collapsed onto Emma's aunt, killing her.
    


            “The world [has] broken down in front of them,” she says. “It's like they don't have their world anymore.”
    


            There were more than 3,200 students from Myanmar studying in the US in the 2023/2024 school year, according to the Institute of International Education, a global non-profit that facilitates international student exchanges, including fellowships administered by the State Department. But they are not the only ones worrying about the immigration clampdown.
    


            Some 5,000 Myanmar nationals were issued immigrant and non-immigrant student and employment-based visas during fiscal year 2023, according to figures from a US State Department spokesperson, while thousands of others have come as refugees.
    


            According to the Department of Homeland Security, in the same fiscal year, over 6,000 Myanmar nationals came to the US as refugees – following only behind the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, and Afghanistan.
    


            A further 2,300 are under the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, which opened to people from Myanmar about three months after the 2021 coup, according to the National Immigration Forum, an immigrant advocacy organization. Many of those with TPS also fear for their future, following the recent move by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem to end the protection for about 300,000 Venezuelan TPS holders.
    


            With no certainty of being able to enter, let alone stay in the US, Emma is planning to apply to universities in Europe and Asia as a backup plan.
    


            Wherever she ends up, she will feel the pull of her family in Myanmar – and particularly of her mother, with whom she has been particularly close since Emma's younger sister died when she was 8.
    


            “My parents already lost a child, and now I'm the only child. So, [my mother] really wants me to be with her, by her side,” she says.
    


            The shifting sands of US immigration policy are far from the only thing stopping students from returning to Myanmar for a visit.
    


            As a young man of fighting age, Hornbill, 19, faces the prospect that even a quick trip home could lead to him being drafted into the very same military he has dedicated much of his life to opposing.
    


            Three years after the coup that brought it to power, Myanmar's military – the Tatmadaw – introduced a draft for all men up to the age of 35 and women up to 27, and up to age 45 and 35 for men and women specialists, respectively, such as doctors.
    


            Before Hornbill, another pseudonym, moved to the US in July 2024 to study graphic design, he had actively protested against the junta leadership that overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint. Such defiance could easily have resulted in his death, as could any one of the several violent confrontations he had with soldiers. Miraculously, he escaped with his life – unlike his friend who was shot dead during an anti-coup demonstration.

            Since the coup, the Tatmadaw has cracked down on all dissent against it as it wages a brutal civil war that has displaced more than three million people. It has shot peaceful protesters and disappeared those who speak out against it. Its terror tactics include burnings, beheadings, mutilations, and torching villages, according to the UN.
    


            Still, Hornbill says he remains determined to speak out.
    


            “We're going to be the last generation to suffer from this,” he said. “We don't want our sons, grandsons, our next generation to suffer from this. We want our country to be at a better place for the next generation. So, we will sacrifice whatever we have to, but we're not letting this affect our next generation too.”
    


            Emma, 19, would also be eligible for mandatory military service were she to return. Still, she thinks it's a risk she needs to take soon, before she gets to the US and the window of opportunity closes.
    


            Her plan is to switch her passport type (Myanmar issues several different ones) from “standard visit” to “student,” which she hopes will prevent her from getting flagged for the draft when she crosses the border.
    


            “It's a very risky choice,” she concedes.
    


            “But I really want to go back home because I'm pretty, pretty sure it's going to be five, six years – until I graduate – [and that] I will not be able to go back home.”

            A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan's misty skyline into a tragedy.
    


            The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents – who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24.
    


            Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river.
    


            “The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,” Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS.
    


            A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. “The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,” former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday.
    


            Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN's Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn't feel safe in his own building.
    


            “Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,” Rakesh said.
    


            Here's what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board:
    


            The victims include Agustín Escobar, 49, his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, and their three children. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprubí's 40th birthday.
    


            “We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,” a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident “an unimaginable tragedy.”
    


            Camprubí was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020.
    


            “We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,” said a statement from Siemens Energy. “Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.”
    


            In addition to her international corporate career, Camprubí is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprubí's grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world.
    


            The pilot was also killed, though officials have not yet released their identity.
    


            CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims.
    


            The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims.
    


            The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan's downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

            Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon.
    


            At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said.
    


            Jersey City resident, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, described the sound as “such a loud sound. It felt like thunder,” she told WCBS. “Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it's just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that's when it was like, ‘OK, what's happening.'”
    


            With the helicopter's catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN's Kate Bolduan.
    


            “There's nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,” Brandt Anderson said.
    


            First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X.
    


            The aircraft's main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, WCBS reported.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat.
    


            “The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,” Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday's crash. “I'm a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon.”
    


            When asked about the helicopter's maintenance, he said, “That's something my director of maintenance handles.” The director of maintenance declined to comment.
    


            Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation.
    


            “(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn't arrive,” Roth told The Telegraph Thursday.
    


            The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.
    


            Maintenance records are not public and during investigations NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident.
    


            The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday's crash.
    


            Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a “go-team” to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have.
    


            The helicopter was flying within New York's Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone.

The Indian and Russian governments have reached an agreement to collaborate on six new strategic projects, with an aim to strengthen their bilateral investment cooperation, according to a statement released by the Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday. 

Although the specific sectors and details of the projects were not revealed, India and Russia reaffirmed their dedication to enhancing economic relations and expanding cooperation across a range of industries, the statement added. 

The agreement was made during a meeting of the India-Russia Working Group on Priority Investment Projects, which falls under the India-Russia Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technological and Cultural Cooperation.

The projects have been announced against the backdrop of the global tariff war being waged by US President Donald Trump, which has increased complexities in international trade. Last month, at a high-level conference in Moscow, India and Russia explored new ways to deepen their strategic partnership.

New Delhi and Moscow have set a target of increasing bilateral trade to $100 billion in the next five years, as agreed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Moscow in July 2024.

“Our trade turnover skyrocketed. We have achieved levels which we couldn't have imagined before. Energy is one of the driving forces, along with the traditional spheres of our cooperation, such as nuclear energy, military-technical cooperation. Food security is also a very prospective field,” said Russian International Affairs Council Director-General Ivan Timofeev. 

Historically, areas like energy, defense, and civil nuclear cooperation have been the focus of engagements with Russia, but now new areas are being explored, such as trade, technology, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, connectivity and the regional economy, Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar has said.

Russia's wheat exports to African countries surged in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, with supplies to Nigeria increasing fourfold to 210,000 tons, food safety watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor reported on Thursday.

According to data from Russia's Federal State Information System (FGIS Argus-Fito), cited by Rosselkhoznadzor, exports of raw grain and its processed products totaled 11.8 million tons between January and April 6.

Tunisia's imports of Russian wheats grew by 78% to 191,000 tons, Morocco's accelerated by 72% to 147,000 tons, and Mozambique's rose twelvefold to 74,000 tons.

“Deliveries of wheat (373,000 tons) from the ports of Leningrad region to Israel, Bangladesh, Senegal and Togo; and barley (127,000 tons) to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Libya have begun,” the agency stated.

Russia's grain exports to Africa have seen significant growth in recent years. Last year, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a 50% increase in agricultural exports by 2030 compared to 2021 levels, which totaled $37 billion.

Last month, Moscow's Ministry of Agriculture reported that Russian food exports to African countries exceeded $7 billion in 2024, up 19% from 2023.

According to the ministry's Agroexport center, domestic food products were supplied to 45 countries on the continent, with Egypt remaining the top importer.

The North African nation's imports of Russian goods, including wheat, sunflower and soybean oil, legumes, flax seeds, molasses, and yeast, grew by 21% in value terms, the department stated.

Algeria ranked second in terms of Russian food imports, followed by Libya, Kenya, and Tunisia, Agroexport data shows. Cereals – mainly wheat, barley, and corn – accounted for 87% of all food shipments to the continent. Dairy product exports also saw significant growth last year.

Russia surpassed France as Morocco's top grain supplier last year, with Ruslan Khasanov, head of Moscow's Center of Grain Quality Assurance, citing competitive pricing and limited French supplies as reasons.

Apart from African countries, shipments of buckwheat from Russia to China have tripled to 127,000 tons, according to Rosselkhoznadzor.

“After a year-long hiatus, barley exports to Lebanon (9,000 tons) resumed. Shipments were made from ports in the Rostov region,” it announced on Thursday.

China will raise tariffs on American goods coming into the country from 84% to 125%, officials in Beijing have said. There will be no further hikes of import duties no matter what Washington does next, they added.

On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump raised the tariffs on Chinese products to 125% in response to measures Beijing had imposed over Washington's previous protectionist economic moves.

Trump stressed that the increased duties are intended to make China realize that “ripping off the USA and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable.”

The Customs Tariff Commission of the Chinese State Council said in a statement on Friday that tariffs on US goods will be raised for the last time, to 125%, starting from Saturday in response to the duties announced by Trump.

“In view of the fact that under the current tariff level, there is no possibility of market acceptance of US goods exported to China, if the US side continues to impose tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US in the future, the Chinese side will ignore it,” the statement read.

The commission also slammed Trump's “abnormally high tariffs” on Chinese products as “unilateral bullying and coercion.” The move by the US president represented “a serious violation of international economic and trade rules, as well as of basic economic laws and common sense,” it stressed.

After Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs caused a sharp drop in US stock prices last week, he declared a 90-day pause on reciprocal duties for US trading partners, lowering them to a 10% baseline.

China became one of the few exceptions, and instead saw tariffs against it increased even further. According White House officials cited by the media, the 25% duties will also remain in place for car manufacturers and steel and aluminum producers in Mexico and Canada.

‘Average man from Derbyshire' shocked to find photo of tattoo celebrating child's birth was used to deport migrants

A British man was shocked to discover that a photo of his tattoo was included in a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to identify alleged members of a notorious Venezuelan criminal gang, Tren de Aragua (TdA).

Earlier this week, 44-year-old Pete Belton, who lives in the English county of Derbyshire, told the BBC that he was stunned to find a photo of his forearm tattoo featured in a DHS document among nine images of tattoos intended to assist in “detecting and identifying” TdA members.

Belton, who says he has no connection to the Venezuelan group, expressed his disbelief, telling the BBC: “I'm just an average middle-aged man from Derbyshire.”

The DHS document notes that open source material “has depicted TdA members with a combination of the below tattoos”.

Among them appears to be Belton's tattoo, which depicts a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth, as well as other tattoos which include stars, skulls, the Michael Jordan “jump man” basketball logo, crowns and guns.

The BBC reported that it conducted reverse image searches for some of the tattoos depicted, and discovered that several of the images first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious connections to TdA or any other gangs.

They traced the image of Belton's tattoo to an Instagram post from nearly a decade ago by a Nottingham-based UK tattoo artist.

Belton said that initially he found it a “bit strange” and a “bit funny” that his tattoo was in the document, but now he is worried about a planned family trip to Miami in August with his wife and daughter, and that it might turn into a “six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantánamo”, he said.

“In my head I'm thinking if I'm working in border force and I saw me walking through I'd think ‘hey-up we've got one, he's the one in the document',” he told the BBC.

The DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

The same image of Belton's tattoo also seemingly appears in a report by the Texas department of public safety (DPS) about TdA activity.

The DPS also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

But in recent weeks, questions regarding the accuracy of these gang allegations have intensified, with lawyers arguing that some of the deportees were misidentified as a result of their tattoos.

Lawyers representing one man say that he was deported over a crown tattoo, which he says is inspired by the Real Madrid football team logo.

In another case, lawyers representing a makeup artist say he was deported after officials deemed his crown tattoos proof that he was a member of TdA. But his lawyers assert that his tattoos reference only the Three Kings Epiphany celebrations.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Advocates braced for revamp of certification system as experts warn of political pressure being brought to bear

Advocates for academic freedom are bracing for what they expect to be the next phase of the government's effort to reshape higher education: an overhaul of the system accrediting institutions of higher learning.

Donald Trump has made no secret of such plans. During the campaign, he boasted that accreditation would be his “secret weapon” against colleges and universities the right has long viewed as too progressive.

“I will fire the radical left accreditors that have allowed our colleges to become dominated by Marxist maniacs and lunatics,” Trump said last summer. “We will then accept applications for new accreditors who will impose real standards on colleges once again and once for all.”

In recent weeks, the government has taken aggressive actions against US universities in the form of funding cuts, a ban on diversity initiatives, and the targeting of international students. Dismantling the accreditation system would be a powerful tool to further erode the separation between the government's political ideology and what US students are taught.

While it's unlikely that Trump can delist currently recognized accreditation agencies, which are controlled by a bipartisan body enshrined in federal law, there are several ways in which the administration could weaken their authority to enforce schools' compliance with a series of standards. Project 2025 and efforts to curtail accreditors' power in some conservative states offer a blueprint for what several education professionals who spoke to the Guardian, along with officials at the Department of Education, fear may be an impending executive action on the issue.

Targeting accreditation – the peer-review system guaranteeing quality assurance on learning institutions – is part of the right's broader strategy to undermine higher education as a whole, advocates warn. Because accreditation by a recognized agency is required for students to be eligible for federal financial aid, the government has huge financial sway over how the system works.

“The Trump administration unfortunately doesn't care about quality assurance in higher education,” said Tariq Habash, a former education department official. “If colleges and universities do not align with this administration on diversity policies, on immigrants' or trans rights, or on speech supporting Palestinian rights, Donald Trump wants them to suffer the consequences, by illegally cutting off access to federal funds.”

Accreditation has been in place for centuries, but the government tied it to federal funding in the aftermath of the GI bill of 1944, when countless veterans were essentially defrauded by sham schools. Since the 1960s, degree-granting institutions have been overseen by a so-called “triad” regulatory mechanism involving federal and state authorities and independent accrediting agencies. Today, there are dozens of accreditors recognized by the Department of Education, including many specialised in technical subjects and six major regional accreditation agencies.

One way in which Trump may seek to undermine the current system – and one of several proposed by Project 2025 – would give states the authority to approve institutions for federal aid purposes, bypassing accreditors altogether. That's a troubling prospect for the ability of universities to remain independent of political pressure.

“If a state wanted to force institutions to act in certain ways to achieve accreditation, this would be a huge cudgel that could be used to make really fine-level changes in colleges and universities across the state,” said Timothy Cain, a professor of higher education at the University of Georgia who has researched accreditation practices. “At the core of it, it's a real problem for American democracy.”

Project 2025 also outlines how the government could prohibit accreditors from requiring universities to adopt diversity policies, from “intruding” upon the governance of state schools, and from enforcing standards that “undermine religious beliefs”. Such prohibitions would severely weaken accreditors' authority to ensure quality and serve as guardrails for education institutions' autonomy from government.

Trump is also expected to expand long-existing conservative attacks on the accreditation apparatus, which rightwing activists and legislators have often referred to as a “cartel”.

In 2023, Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, argued in a lawsuit against the Biden administration that the government had “ceded unchecked power” to accrediting agencies. Florida and North Carolina have passed legislation seeking to weaken accreditation standards. And during Trump's first term, the then secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, loosened accreditation regulation in the name of free-market competition, introducing policies that critics said would give schools an option to “shop” for more friendly accreditors.

Some Republican senators, including Marco Rubio before Trump appointed him secretary of state, also introduced legislation at the federal level seeking to prevent accreditors from requiring universities to adopt what Rubio called “woke standards”.

“The endgame is always about controlling the curriculum, and controlling what takes place within the classroom,” said Isaac Kamola, a political science professor at Trinity College, whose research focuses on conservative efforts to undermine higher education. “In order to remake the institution, you need to get rid of the guardrails that would prevent you from exerting that much external interference.”

But there is an additional risk in Trump's suggestion that he would pave the way for “new accreditors” more aligned with the administration, Kamola noted.

“You're going to see a bunch of fly-by-night, grifty, Trump University-style colleges that are going to appear,” he said.

“And without accreditation, and federal funding being tied to accreditation, you're going to see a massive exodus of federal funds into the hands of a higher education mass grift economy. Student loan money will be spent in institutions that under the current regime would never be accredited.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Some farmers recovered from president's first-term trade war and a fresh one is estimated to cost the state $6bn a year

California's $59bn agricultural industry is bracing for disruption as Donald Trump's tariffs continue to spike tensions and trigger economic turmoil with China – one of the state's biggest buyers.

California is the country's breadbasket, supplying roughly one-third of US vegetables and 75% of its fruits and nuts. But it also exports much of its produce – close to $24bn worth in 2022. This means farmers in the state could lose out significantly as China imposes retaliatory tariffs on US goods.

The threat of another prolonged trade war has contributed to growing uncertainty in an industry where decisions often have to be made long before harvests or sales. It's difficult for producers to decide to cull or keep dairy cows from their herds, rip plants tended to for years from the soil or pluck trellises of grapevines from their pastures.

Already grappling with extreme weather events that have damaged or destroyed crops and water restrictions that added challenges, a spate of Trump policies – including attacks on agricultural research, a funding freeze of billions from the US Department of Agriculture, and crackdowns on migrant workers – have left farmers reeling.

“The uncertainty is probably more of a problem than the tariff itself,” said Zachary Williams, sales director for Stewart & Jasper Orchards in Newman, California. “Uncertainty about whether there will be, or won't be, is a little harder to plan around.”

The issue is sharply affecting California almond growers, who collectively export close to three-quarters of what they grow. Roughly 76% of almonds eaten around the world currently come from the state, but Australia, the second-largest producer, could cater to countries unwilling to pay higher prices.

Fallout from Trump's first-term trade war is still fresh on the minds of many farmers and growers in the Golden state, when they were hit hard by Chinese retaliation.

“The first trade war was a disaster for California agriculture and in particular for tree nut exports – and they never really recovered,” said Colin Carter, professor emeritus of agriculture economics at the University of California, Davis. “Prices for pistachios and almonds have only just begun to rebound, he added, “but now the tariffs are even higher”.

The expansion of almond acreage stalled during the first trade war and walnut orchards were ripped from the ground. “A lot of farms were put up for sale, bankruptcies have impacted some processors, and that affected farms as well,” Carter said.

That trade war caused a $27bn loss to US agriculture. California tree nut growers were among the hardest hit, with losses at $880m, according to a 2022 analysis by UC Davis researchers.

Few saw a full recovery, even with a 2018 $12bn federal aid package for US farmers. Even though almond prices fell by more than a dollar a pound, “California's farmers were largely left out of the government compensation schemes,” Carter and his colleagues found in an analysis published late last year. Midwestern farmers, he said, received the bulk of federal subsidies.

This time around, Carter said, it could be worse. A new trade war could cost $6bn per year and wipe out one-quarter of California's agricultural exports. “This would have a ripple effect across the state, from the large almond orchards in the Central valley to the small family vineyards scattered throughout wine country,” according to Carter's analysis.

Officials at the USDA have hinted that the administration might offer aid funds for impacted farmers again, but the federal government might not be in a position to offer as much support or recovery tools if the Trump administration continues slashing staff, programs and budgets.

Almond farmers are well aware of the risks. Rick Kushman, a spokesperson for the Almond Board of California, said they are “closely monitoring the impacts” from both retaliatory levies and US tariffs that could affect imported materials the industry relies on.

Advocates for growers have also pushed officials to proceed cautiously.

“Almonds remain California's top agricultural export, $5.8 billion in 2024, underscoring their importance to both the state and national economies,” Alexi Rodriguez, the president and CEO of the industry advocacy group Almond Alliance, wrote in a letter to agriculture secretary, Brooke Rollins, and trade representative Jamieson Greer in March. She called for “careful consideration to be given to the risks of retaliatory tariffs”.

“When US tariffs are imposed, the resulting retaliatory tariffs could significantly disrupt US almond exports, depress farm prices, and further shift market share to competitors,” she said, noting that California almonds contribute more than $9bn to the state's economy.

But even as Trump takes grave risks with California agriculture in his attempts to rework global markets, few in the industry have been outwardly critical of his actions. Many growers are instead focusing on their confidence that the president will come through with campaign promises to make more water available for thirsty crops, even as supplies grow shorter.

A single almond requires more than a gallon of water to grow and trees have to be irrigated throughout the year. The nuts are controversial in the drought-prone state, where regulators are working to reign in strain on underground aquifers. Meanwhile, farmers face increasingly steeper fines and fees, along with challenges to maintain their orchards.

Along Highway 5, a thoroughfare that snakes through the heart of California's ag-land, large signs still signal the region's support for Trump and its ire against water restrictions. Farmland sprawling across the state's rural Central valley is still a bright-red belt in a deeply blue state.

Carter said he finds it ironic. Tariffs could prove even more costly than California's last devastating drought.

“The president says he supports agriculture but these trade wars send an opposite signal,” Carter said. “We are seeing that now. It is coming again. Foreign countries know which commodities to target.”

Carmaker removes ‘order now' buttons for Model S saloon and Model X SUV on its Chinese website amid tariffs war

Tesla has stopped taking orders in China for two models it previously imported from the US, as companies scramble to adapt to prohibitive tariffs imposed in Donald Trump's trade war.

The manufacturer, run by Trump's close ally Elon Musk, removed “order now” buttons on its Chinese website for its Model S saloon and Model X sports utility vehicle.

Tesla did not give any indication of why it had made the changes but it came after the rapid escalation of the trade war between the US and China. In tit-for-tat moves, Trump has raised total tariffs on China to 145%, while China responded on Friday by increasing its levies on US exports to 125%.

The border taxes make the goods trade between the two countries prohibitively expensive and mean cars imported from the US are now much less attractive in China than those produced locally.

New orders for the two imported models were also no longer available on Tesla's mini-program account on the Chinese social media app WeChat, Reuters reported. The “order now” buttons were replaced with “view available cars” for the Model S and Model X on the US carmaker's website, with some remaining cars appearing to be available for Chinese buyers.

Since 2020 Tesla has produced its Model 3 and Model Y cars in a large factory in Shanghai, giving it some insulation from the tariffs. However, the company is still likely to be heavily affected. Analysis by Nikkei Asia in 2023 suggested that about 40% of the companies supplying Tesla with battery materials were Chinese, although the carmaker has sought to source parts and materials from outside China as trade tensions between the US and China have increased.

Musk has been a key player in the Trump administration, leading the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, in its efforts to slash the US federal budget that have been described as illegal by constitutional experts. Yet he has also appeared to criticise the tariffs, saying last week that there should be “zero tariffs” between the EU and US. That is a stark contradiction to the 10% tariffs imposed by Trump on every nation in the world for 90 days, with the threat of the return of even higher levies.

Tesla last month warned the US government that tariffs could harm American companies, in a letter to the White House's trade representative.

The possible loss of orders would represent a significant financial blow to Tesla, at a time when it is already struggling with slumping demand, particularly in Europe. Although it is tricky to work out the motivations of buyers, analysts have said that Musk's close association with Trump has tarnished the brand, contributing to the sales slump. The company also has an ageing lineup of models that are struggling to compete with newer offerings, particularly from Chinese rivals such as BYD.

Dan Ives, an equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, an investment bank, argued last week that Tesla was still undervalued, despite it being the most valuable carmaker in the world, at an $812bn market valuation on Friday. However, he said the company was facing a “full-blown crisis” and that Musk needed to leave the Trump administration.

Col Susannah Meyers removed amid reports she distanced base from Vance's criticism of Denmark's oversight of territory

 Europe live – latest updates

The head of the US military base in Greenland has been fired for criticising Washington's agenda for the Arctic island after JD Vance visited two weeks ago.

Col Susannah Meyers, who had served as commander of the Pituffik space base since July, was removed amid reports she had distanced herself and the base from the US vice-president's criticism of Denmark and its oversight of the territory.

Greenland has its own government but is also part of the kingdom of Denmark, which previously ruled it as a colony and continues to control its foreign and defence policies. Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire the island and has not ruled out military or economic force to do so. 

The US Space Force said in a statement on Thursday night that Meyers had been removed from the position of commander on Thursday due to a “loss of confidence” in her ability to lead.

“Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties,” it added.

The statement did not expand further, but the US website Military.com said Meyers sent an email to all personnel at Pituffik on 31 March “seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there, following Vance's appearance”.

Vance visited the base on 28 March in a trip that was substantially changed at the last minute amid increasingly strained relations between the US, Greenland and Denmark. During the visit he told troops that the US had to gain control of the Arctic island to stop the threat of China and Russia. He also criticised Denmark, which he said had “not done a good job by the people of Greenland”.

Originally, the delegation had been planned to be led by his wife, the second lady, Usha Vance, who had been scheduled to visit the capital, Nuuk, and a dog sled race in Sisimiut. But after outrage over the timing after the election – the new coalition government had yet to be sworn in – the plans were changed.

The vice-president said during a press conference at the base: “Our message to Denmark is very simple: you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have underinvested in the people of Greenland and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful land mass.”

In her email Meyers wrote: “I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by vice-president Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik space base.”

The Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on X: “Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defence.”

Trump has said the US needs control of Greenland for national and international security.

The US Space Force said Meyers had been replaced with Col Shawn Lee.

Meyers appears to be the latest in a Trump administration purge of high-ranking military officers and commanders. Others include Air Force Gen Tim Haugh, the director of the National Security Agency, and V Adm Shoshana Chatfield, who served with Nato.

Joe Kasper, the chief of staff at the US department of defence, said: “Civilian control of the military is a bedrock principle of our armed forces. Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the defence department.”

The Danish defence department declined to comment. The Pituffik space base has been contacted for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

HBO renewed Mike White's hit drama before third season aired and rumours abound about luxury settings and return of stars

You've only just got home from a holiday when you start planning the next one. So it is with the super-rich spa satire The White Lotus. The gunsmoke is still clearing from the finale of the third season but speculation is rife about where the HBO hit will head next.

This week's climax of Mike White's drama might have divided critics, but it was still group chat-dominating, column inch-gobbling TV, notching its highest ratings yet. The show was renewed for a fourth trip before the third had even aired, with White reportedly pitching HBO execs his next idea while still filming in Koh Samui. Buzz is now building about the next chapter, expected on our screens in late 2026.

Each season has unfolded at a luxury resort in a different region. Viewers have been whisked to the Pacific (the debut season in Hawaii), Europe (the Sicily-set sequel) and Asia (the third hotel from hell, filmed in Thailand). White has previously said his dream for the show is to “hit every continent”.

If the pattern continues, options are likely to be Africa (there are rumours of a Moroccan riad, Kenyan safari or a sightseeing tour of Egypt), South America (Buenos Aires has been mentioned) or Australia (White has alluded to its “wealth of talent”).

A factor is the production's partnership with Four Seasons, after signing a reported £25m deal in 2021 to film exclusively in the high-end chain's resorts. Its five-star hotel in Marrakech's ancient medina has emerged as a frontrunner. White apparently stayed at the Four Seasons Tamarindo in Mexico before Christmas, potentially on a research trip. He is also said to have looked at £1,000-per-night glamping at the Four Seasons in Tanzania's Serengeti national park.

There is conjecture that after three sun-soaked stories, a cold climate would provide a change of gear. White had been spotted in Norway, making that a strong favourite. Local press reports suggest it nearly happened for season three. There are no Four Seasons sites in Norway, but spectacular alternatives include the Juvet Landscape hotel, which featured in the HBO series Succession.

However, the show's producer, David Bernad, has hinted this is a longshot, saying: “Mike doesn't like the cold. He's a California guy. He's not built for snow.” For his part, White has teased that the fourth season could move away from beach settings, saying: “I want to get a little bit out of the ‘crashing waves on rocks' vernacular.”

Tax incentives and subsidies will play a part in the decision, making Japan an attractive proposition. Four Seasons Kyoto or Osaka head the shortlist here. However, there have been calls for the production to stay closer to home. The media union Sag-Aftra wants the fourth season to be shot in California as part of its “stay in LA” initiative.

Perhaps the most definitive clue came from HBO's head of drama, Francesca Orsi, who said in February: “We're location scouting in the next couple of weeks. I can't really say where we're going to land but chances are somewhere in Europe.”

There are plenty of Four Seasons spots in mainland Europe to choose from, notably Cap-Ferrat in the French Riviera. However, White will not take an obvious path. “Where we choose to go next could be hugely impactful to that destination,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. “That's why it was so cool to shoot in Thailand. It's hard to go backward. Doing it in Paris feels like a cop-out.”

As for the season four cast? Stick a pin in a list of A-list acting talent. Woody Harrelson came close to being cast in season three as the Bangkok berserker Frank, ultimately played by Sam Rockwell. It was only scheduling conflicts that scuppered Harrelson's involvement, so he could be high on the hitlist next time. Hollywood names will probably be joined by a scene-stealing British actor or two, with big impressions made by Tom Hollander, Leo Woodall, Jason Isaacs and Aimee Lou Wood in previous series.

Each season has featured overlapping characters. Jennifer Coolidge's needy heiress Tanya McQuoid provided continuity between the first two seasons in meme-spawning style. In season three Natasha Rothwell returned as the spa manager Belinda and Jon Gries as Tanya's murderous widower Greg AKA Gary.

Rothwell is a firm favourite with fans and could be due another comeback. Having tapped Greg for $5m hush money, Belinda has gone from put-upon staff to potential pampered guest. What better way to illustrate how wealth corrupts? Rothwell has said she “knows nothing” of what White has planned but would return if asked.

If she does not get the call, who are the other candidates? The unhappy honeymooners Shane and Rachel from season one (Jake Lacy and Alexandra Daddario) or season two's sex worker Lucia (Simona Tabasco) could work well. If it is a season three star, possible names include Carrie Coon as the brittle lawyer Laurie Duffy, Patrick Schwarzenegger as the protein shake-guzzling Saxon Ratliff or Parker Posey as his mother, Victoria, set to become a “prison widow”.

White has even mentioned an all-star series as a “cool” idea. “I feel like they'd do all the douchiest guys together or all the hotel managers together,” said Schwarzenegger.

One member of the White Lotus team who will not be returning is the Emmy-winning composer Cristóbal Tapia de Veer, whose feud with White has played out in public. After De Veer spoke out about creative differences over the latest theme tune, White hit back that this was “a bitch move”. We can safely assume someone else will supply season four's signature music.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Taiwan launches first such prosecution, alleging the captain of the Chinese-crewed Hong Tai 58 dropped anchor near an undersea cable that then damaged it

Prosecutors in Taiwan charged, for the first time, a Chinese ship captain with intentionally damaging undersea cables off the island in February, after a rise in sea cable malfunctions alarmed Taiwan officials amid tensions with China.

Prosecutors say the man was captain of the Chinese-crewed Hong Tai 58, registered in Togo, which Taiwanese authorities detained after suspecting the ship had dropped anchor near an undersea cable off southwestern Taiwan, allegedly damaging it.

The prosecutors' office in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan said they had charged the ship's Chinese captain, whom they identified only by his family name, Wang, with being responsible for the alleged damage to the cable.

Wang has said he is innocent, but refused to provide details of the ship's owner and “had a bad attitude”, the prosecutors alleged in a statement.

Seven other Chinese nationals detained at the same time will not be charged and will be transported to China, prosecutors said, adding that the case was the island's first prosecution relating to damage to sea cables.

Reuters was not able to determine the ship's ownership or immediately locate a lawyer representing the captain.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has previously accused Taiwan of “manipulating” possible Chinese involvement in the case, saying it was casting aspersions before the facts were clear.

Taiwan has reported five cases of sea cable malfunctions this year, compared with three each in 2024 and 2023, according to its digital ministry.

Taiwan's coastguard has in recent months stepped up efforts to protect its sea cables, including monitoring a “blacklist” of close to 100 China-linked ships registered to a country other than that of its owner near Taiwan, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Taiwan said in January it suspected a China-linked ship of damaging an undersea cable off its northern coast. The shipowner denied the accusations.

Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has repeatedly complained about “grey zone” Chinese activities around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation, such as balloon overflights and sand dredging.

Taipei was alarmed after another Chinese-linked ship was suspected of damaging a different cable this year, prompting the navy and other agencies to step up efforts to protect the undersea communication links, which are vital to the island's connections to the rest of the world.

Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, has pointed to similarities between what it has experienced and damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

This blog is now closed, you can read the latest in our Ukraine coverage here

We're just getting new lines from the Kremlin, confirming that US president Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff who landed in Moscow a few hours ago will meet Russian president Vladimir Putin.

In reports carried by Reuters from Russian agencies, Ria and Interfax, the Kremlin is also quoted as saying the pair will talk about Ukraine and “may discuss Putin's meeting with Trump”.

But also a caveat that “Witkoff's visit to Russia cannot be called momentous, no breakthroughs should be expected.”

… and on that note, it's a wrap from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

US envoy Steve Witkoff visits Russia today, where his is expected to meet Russian president Vladimir Putin (14:27). The meeting comes amid growing impatience over Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire and peace talks over Ukraine, with US president Donald Trump saying “Russia has to get moving” (16:10).

Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov warned Russia was ramping up its military production and has shown no will for peace (12:55).

His comments came on the day as western allies mobilised over €21bn in new military aid to Ukraine, including from the UK and Germany.

But German defence minister Boris Pistorius stressed that “given Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future.”

British defence secretary John Healey strongly pushed back on EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas's apparent criticism that there was a lack of clarity on the Coalition of the Willing's plans for the reassurance force in Ukraine (9:39), saying the planning was “real, substantial, well advanced,” and the EU was not a part of it (12:59).

On economy front, the EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič will go to Washington on Sunday for further talks with US counterparts on tariffs, a commission spokesperson confirmed (11:52).

And finally, in Greenland, the head of the US military base that was visited by vice-president JD Vance has been fired for criticising Washington's agenda for the Arctic island (10:35).

And that's all from me, Jakub Krupa, for today.

We also got an update from Trump on what he thinks about Russia as his envoy Steve Witkoff is in Moscow for talks with president Vladimir Putin.

Here's his post on Truth Social:

Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war - A war that should have never happened, and wouldn't have happened, if I were President!!!

… and if you wondered what president Donald Trump thinks of his tariffs policy, here's his take, as published on Truth Social just now:

We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY. Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT

If you want to know what the markets think – the New York Stock Exchange has just opened for trading – our business live blog is here:

The EU will not rip up its tech rules in an attempt to reach a trade deal with Donald Trump, the bloc's most senior official on digital policy has said.

Henna Virkkunen, the European Commission vice-president responsible for tech sovereignty, indicated the EU was not going to compromise on its digital rulebook to reach an agreement on trade with the US – a key demand of Trump administration officials.

“We are very committed to our rules when it comes to the digital world,” Virkkunen said in an interview with European newspapers, including the Guardian. “We want to make sure that our digital environment in the European Union … that it is fair and it's safe and it's also democratic.”

Elsewhere, Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has offered his condolences to friends and relatives of a Spanish family who died in New York on Thursday after their sightseeing helicopter crashed in the Hudson River, killing all onboard including the pilot.

It emerged on Friday that the victims were Agustín Escobar, his wife, Mercè Camprubí, and their three children, who were 11, five and four. The identity of the pilot has not yet been made public.

The sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair and crashed upside down into the Hudson between Manhattan and the New Jersey waterfront shortly after 3pm local time, leading to a huge response from emergency crews.

Umerov gets asked about Witkoff's trip to Russia, but sidesteps the question, as he says he only just heard about it, and he hopes to hear from US counterparts on this later.

And that concludes the press conference.

Pistorius gets also asked if Germany could provide more Patriot air defence systems to Ukraine, but he says that is not an option at that moment as it is waiting on deliveries of these systems itself.

Asked about it, Germany's Pistorius plays down the significance of US defence secretary Pete Hegseth's participation via a video call, and not in person.

He says “it is a matter of schedules,” as Hegseth only returned to the US from other grips, and said that some other ministers were not physically here for the same reason.

“The most important fact was that he took part,” he said.

He says:

“And in the near future, in the weeks to come, we will see what's going to happen with the US participation, with the US support. 

I am not able to … look in the crystal ball. We wait and see. …

We take on more responsibility as Europeans and Nato as Europeans, together with UK.”

Ukraine's Umerov supports him speaking along the same lines.

UK defence secretary John Healey strongly pushed back on EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas's apparent criticism that there was a lack of clarity on the Coalition of the Willing's plans for the reassurance force in Ukraine (9:39).

Asked about it, he says:

Our planning is indeed for the Coalition of the Willing, [it is] real, substantial, well advanced. The European Union is not part of that planning.

Ukrainian defence minister Rustem Umerov says he informed other ministers that “Russia is ramping up its production … and does not show any evidence [it is] willing to have peace.”

He thanks allied countries for their continuing help, stressing the particularly urgent need for more air defence systems.

UK defence secretary John Healey says today's discussions led to over €21bn in fresh military aid commitments from allied countries, “a record boost in military funding for Ukraine.”

He adds the UK also continues its support, with the total of £4.5bn to be spent on military support for Ukraine this year.

Healey joins Pistorius in calling out Putin's continuing aggression:

Today is one month to the day in which Russia rejected president Trump's peace settlement. 

Putin said he wanted peace, but he rejected a full ceasefire. 

Putin said he wanted peace, but he continues to drag his feet and delay negotiations. 

Putin said he wanted peace, but his forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike.

Speaking about the current situation, German defence ministers Pistorius – who is expected to retain his job in the next coalition government – says that:

“Given Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future.” 

He adds:

“We will ensure that Ukraine continues to benefit from our joint military support. Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting, and we will support it.”

Germany's Pistorius condemns Russia for “continuing its attacks against Ukraine,” as he says Moscow “is still not yet interested in peace.”

“Ukraine needs a strong military, and only then can the negotiation process lead to a just and lasting peace,” he says.

German, British and Ukrainian defence ministers are giving a press conference after today's meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group now.

I will bring you they key lines here.

Separately, speaking at a press conference in Warsaw, EU economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis spoke about the US tariffs, saying that:

The nature of these rapidly moving developments make it difficult to assess their impact on the EU's economic outlook.

But what is clear and what also ministers in today's meeting agreed on is that the impact of the tariffs, it will be the US itself that will be first and most hit by the tariffs.

He said that early model simulations indicated the US GDP would be reduced by 0.8 to 1.4% until 2027, with the EU's growth hit much lower, at 0.2%.

“These model simulations do not account for additional loss of investor and business confidence in the US economy, which could further the negative GDP impact,” he added.

He said:

“So let me make it clear, Europe did not start this confrontation, and Europe does not want this confrontation. 

Tariffs go against the political and economic logic of deep and longstanding transatlantic trading partnership, … so from commission side, will continue to closely monitor financial developments in a days and weeks ahead. 

We're ready to negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome while defending our economic interests so there is no need to continue to hurt the US own and our economy.”

We're getting an update on US envoy Steve Witkoff's visit to Moscow, with TASS news agency reporting he met with Vladimir Putin's international cooperation envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

I will bring you more on their conversation if and when we have it.

EU trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič will go to Washington on Sunday, a commission spokesperson told the Irish broadcaster RTÉ.

Self-styled anti-corruption crusader Brice Nguema helped overthrow Bongo  family dynasty in August 2023

An estimated 1 million Gabonese citizens head to the polls on Saturday to vote in the country's first presidential election since an August 2023 coup ended the 55-year Bongo family dynasty. For Brice Nguema, the junta leader turned civilian head of state, it could be a chance to cement his democratic credentials.

Last November, 860,000 registered voters approved a referendum for a new constitution with two seven-year presidential terms and an amnesty for participants in the removal of Ali Bongo, who had succeeded his father in 2009. Officials are yet to release data on the updated voters' register but previously said they expected an additional 300,000 new registrations, including from those who have recently come of age.

Observer missions are already in place, including that of an eight-person Commonwealth team led by Danny Faure, a former president of Seychelles.

Four independents are in the race for president but analysts say the favourite is Nguema. Since coming to power, 50-year-old Nguema has styled himself as an anti-corruption crusader who had to resort to a coup to end an unpopular family dynasty, despite also being a cousin to Bongo. In October 2023, he made headlines for reportedly refusing to draw a salary for the presidency.

Those announcements drew plaudits in the oil-rich central African state where a third of the 2.3 million people live in poverty.

“Gabonese tell themselves that someone who works with this much ardour is trying to transform things,” Joseph Tonda, a sociologist at Omar Bongo University in Libreville, told Reuters news agency earlier this month.

But like his cousin, Nguema has maintained close ties with France even in the face of high anti-French sentiments in the region. And a 2020 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) revealed multimillion-dollar assets abroad, believed to be the proceeds of embezzlement during his time in the presidential guard.

His closest challenger is the ex-prime minister Alain Claude Bilie By Nze, who was in government until the coup. Nze, who has campaigned as a pragmatic veteran seeking to create jobs and reduce the size of government, has also tried to dissociate himself from the old guard.

Other candidates include the former tax official Joseph Lapensée Essingone and Stéphane Germain Iloko, previously a member of the former ruling Gabonese Democratic party (PDG).

The coup, one of a string of military takeovers in west and central Africa between 2020 and 2023, was well received in Gabon, with many citizens trooping to the streets of Port Gentil and Libreville, its two biggest cities.

But there are concerns that Nguema may also be using the same Bongo playbook of muzzling dissent.

In particular, the Union for Democracy and Social Integration (UDIS) party – once allied with the former ruling party – has accused the administration of targeting its exiled leader, Hervé Patrick Opiangah, who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged incest and undermining state security.

Opiangah, 54, a former mining minister, has proclaimed his innocence and filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.

Edmond Ngadi, a UDIS spokesperson who has called the matter a “state conspiracy”, said Opiangah was being targeted for mobilising for people to vote no during the 16 November referendum.

“This is a blatant violation of human rights … he is a Gabonese citizen who simply asks to return to his country safely to be able to secure his family, secure his businesses and also participate in the life of his country,” Ngadi said.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Temperatures exceeding 40C trigger deadly thunderstorms, as Mali agency issues hot weather warning

Northern India has been experiencing early extreme heat this week as temperatures topped 40C (104F), including in the capital, New Delhi.

Hot weather across the north-west of the country peaked on Tuesday as Barmer, a city in the state of Rajasthan, reached 46.4C – more than 6C above the average maximum in April.

New Delhi rose to 40.3C on Wednesday, surpassing 40C for the first time this year. Farther south, Jaipur exceeded 40C for five consecutive days from Sunday, with a maximum temperature of 43C recorded on Wednesday, almost 5C above the average April high.

The Indian meteorology bureau said last week that most parts of the country would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with two to four more such days than normal.

The extreme early heat this week triggered severe thunderstorms across Bihar, including in Patna. At least 19 people have died in the past two days amid frequent lightning, significant hail and strong winds.

There was extensive damage to crops – including wheat, mango and lychee – weeks before the harvest. Stormy conditions are likely to persist across Bihar until Saturday, owing to a low-pressure system over the west-central Bay of Bengal.

Meanwhile, parts of east Africa are experiencing higher-than-average temperatures, which could approach the April record.

In Mali, the national meteorological agency issued an extreme weather warning covering the entire country from Wednesday to Sunday. Maximum temperatures are expected to reach 40-47C for at least three consecutive days.

This is comparable to average temperatures during the height of summer in June and July, whereas April averages tend to be 38-40C. People have been advised to stay indoors during the hottest hours, wear light-coloured clothing, eat foods with high quantities of liquid and drink plenty of water.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Exclusive: Action comes five years after lack of legal recognition for humanist marriage in England and Wales was ruled discriminatory

Two couples are taking the government to court over its failure to legalise humanist marriage in England and Wales five years after a ruling that the lack of recognition was discriminatory.

Engaged couples Terri O'Sullivan and Edd Berrill, from Coventry, and Nicole Shasha and Rory Booth, from Leicester, are preparing to go to court in their fight to be married in line with their humanist beliefs.

“It's insulting that we've got to try to prove our beliefs are valid to have them recognised,” O'Sullivan, 45, said. “It makes me feel a bit emotional because it's so important to us.”

O'Sullivan was raised as a Jehovah's Witness before leaving the religion at 21 after years of abuse and becoming homeless.

“To be able to stand in front of our friends and family and talk in a way that's important to us, it means everything … Being an ex-religious person who's experienced religious abuse, it's important I can now be something positive – I'm not just an atheist, I'm a humanist.”

Shasha, 32, said: “We're the examples, but there's going to be thousands of individuals like us.”

Booth, 32, said it was important they took a stand. “It's about making sure that people are treated fairly no matter who they are. It's not really just a humanist issue, it's an issue of fair treatment for everyone.”

Humanism, a non-religious worldview that emphasises human agency, is not recognised under marriage laws, meaning couples having a humanist celebrant must also have a civil registration service.

In 2020, the high court ruled the lack of legal recognition for humanist marriage in England and Wales “gave rise to discrimination”, with Mrs Justice Eady saying the then justice secretary, Robert Buckland, “cannot simply sit on his hands”.

Humanist marriages are legal in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and elsewhere in the world including New Zealand, Canada and Australia. In Scotland in 2022 there were 9,140 humanist wedding ceremonies compared with 8,072 based on faiths or other beliefs.

“It just feels like it has been fobbed off,” O'Sullivan said. “It makes no sense that it's perfectly fine in Scotland and Northern Ireland, but it's just not here. There's nothing really outlandish or bizarre about our views, they're pretty common.”

Berrill, 42, said he “started secondary school as a Catholic and left it as an atheist”, before discovering humanism 15 years ago.

“It's important for someone to represent the views and the rights of the non-religious, to stand up for us and make sure we've got the same representation and are afforded the same opportunities,” he said.

Shasha, who is a humanist funeral and wedding celebrant, co-runs a humanist group in Leicester with Booth, her partner of 11 years.

“I think sometimes people can assume that [humanism] is a vague ephemeral thing,” Booth said.

“We run a community group much like many religious people do …. So being able to have the humanist philosophy as part of our wedding would be a really lovely thing for us. It's an equalities issue.”

The government is expected to announce plans this year for an overhaul of marriage laws, which could allow weddings to take place at a variety of venues, based on recommendations from the Law Commission.

Humanists are concerned a major shake-up would take years to implement, and are calling on the government to move quicker to legalise humanist ceremonies.

Andrew Copson, the chief executive of Humanists UK, which is supporting the action, said: “Since 2013, every leader of the Labour party has said they supported legal humanist marriage and every Labour frontbench spokesperson has urged the government to act without delay.

“But today the same bad arguments that Labour comprehensively debunked from the opposition benches are made by Labour ministers without a blush. I can completely understand the frustration of these couples.”

He said expensive legal action was “nobody's first resort” and that “humanist marriage could be made legal within weeks at no cost and with no detriment to anyone, if the government chose to do so”.

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “It is right the government takes the time to consider this important issue, including the Law Commission's 2022 report, and will set out its position in due course.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Twice-daily hiking trips for civilians in Golan buffer zone recently seized by Israel sold out almost immediately

Israel's military is organising hiking tours for civilians in newly occupied Syrian territory during the Passover holiday, local media has reported.

The twice-daily tours in the contested Golan Heights will run for a week beginning this Sunday. Tickets sold out almost immediately.

Under a military escort in bulletproof buses, small groups will travel up to 2.5km into Syrian territory that was off limits until the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) seized the Golan buffer zone after the fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December. Israel has occupied the Golan Heights since 1967 and now controls hundreds more square kilometres of Syrian land.

The itinerary includes the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, which overlooks Damascus, and Lebanon's Shebaa Farms at the foot of the mountain. The Israeli-occupied strip of Lebanese land, reputedly the site of God's covenant with Abraham, has been a flashpoint for violence between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for decades.

Visitors will also be able to hike and swim in the Ruqqad river valley which flows into the Yarmouk on the border with Jordan, and see parts of the abandoned Ottoman Hejaz railway, which used to connect the empire's capital in Istanbul to Haifa, Nablus and holy sites in present day Saudi Arabia.

The trips have been organised by the IDF's 210th Division, the Golan regional council, the Keshet Yehonatan religious education centre, the environmentalist Golan Field School and the Israel nature and parks authority, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported.

The tours are part of a wider initiative, “Returning to a Safer North”, after the end of last year's Israel-Hezbollah war, which was part of the regional fallout ignited by Hamas's October 2023 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in the Gaza Strip.

The Israeli military said: “It's important for us to restore heritage and tourism to the region and to tell the story of the battles fought during the war.”

Tourists sign up at their own risk and the trips may be cancelled at short notice if there are security issues. In response to questions from Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the IDF said that the tour was “inside Israel”, rather than Syria, although the visits take place in the Golan Heights demilitarised buffer zone, internationally recognised as Syrian territory.

The IDF began a heavy bombing campaign across Syria targeting the regime's weapons stockpiles shortly after Assad fled the country, while ground troops advanced in violation of a 1974 agreement.

Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has demanded that forces belonging to Syria's new Islamist-led transitional government stay away from the border area and that the IDF remain until an alternative arrangement can be found.

Given demand, organisers have said that they hope the security situation will permit additional tours to Syria after Passover.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Follow:


            A sightseeing helicopter plunged into the Hudson River on Thursday, turning a family outing above Manhattan's misty skyline into a tragedy.
    


            The helicopter carried six people, including three children and their parents – who have both worked for Siemens, a German multinational technology conglomerate. It lifted off from a Manhattan heliport and followed a familiar route: circling the Statue of Liberty, gliding north along the Hudson toward the George Washington Bridge and then turning south. About 16 minutes after takeoff, the aircraft crashed into the water, according to analysis by CNN and FlightRadar24.
    


            Witnesses described the helicopter flipping and spiraling before crashing near the New Jersey shoreline upside down, scattering debris across the river.
    


            “The helicopter was a little bit like nose down, slightly, and I saw the propeller separating from the helicopter. It kept spinning in the air alone. Nothing was attached to it,” Sarah Jane Raymond Ryer, who saw the crash unfold, told CNN affiliate WCBS.
    


            A video obtained by CNN shows the rotor blades detached from the helicopter and flying through the air. “The videotape in this case is very dramatic and very important to the investigation,” former National Transportation Safety Board managing director Peter Goelz told CNN on Friday.
    


            Eyewitness Avi Rakesh told CNN's Jessica Dean that what was left of the helicopter appeared to be so out of control, he didn't feel safe in his own building.
    


            “Debris was flying everywhere. I was concerned that something might come and hit the window,” Rakesh said.
    


            Here's what we know about the crash that killed everyone on board:
    


            The victims include Agustín Escobar, 49, his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal, and their three children. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the family was visiting from Spain, and Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said in a social media post that the family was in New York to celebrate Camprubí's 40th birthday.
    


            “We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,” a Siemens Mobility spokesperson said in a statement to CNN.
    


            Escobar served as CEO of Rail Infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, the transportation solutions division of Siemens AG.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, expressed his condolences, calling the incident “an unimaginable tragedy.”
    


            Camprubí was the global commercialization manager for Siemens Energy, according to her LinkedIn page. Siemens Energy is an independent company that was spun off from Siemens AG in 2020.
    


            “We are deeply saddened and shocked by the loss of a colleague due to a tragic accident during vacation,” said a statement from Siemens Energy. “Our thoughts and heartfelt condolences go out to the family, friends and colleagues of the victims.”
    


            In addition to her international corporate career, Camprubí is known in Spain as a member of a prominent sports family. Camprubí's grandfather and great-grandfather both served as presidents of FC Barcelona, one of the most popular soccer clubs in the world.
    


            The pilot was also killed, though officials have not yet released their identity.
    


            CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims.
    


            The cause of the crash remains unclear, but its sudden descent stunned witnesses as first responders raced to rescue the victims.
    


            The helicopter took off at 2:59 p.m. from Manhattan's downtown heliport following a popular sightseeing route, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. After circling the Statue of Liberty, it flew north along the Hudson River, reaching the George Washington Bridge by 3:08 p.m. It then turned south along the New Jersey shoreline, where it lost control shortly after, Tisch said.

            Visibility at the time was 10 miles, though the region was cloudy with winds of 10 to 15 mph and gusts up to 25 mph. A weather system was expected to bring light rain later in the afternoon.
    


            At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a crash near Pier A Park in Hoboken, New Jersey. Witnesses said the helicopter appeared to stop midair before pieces broke off, consistent with preliminary emergency reports, Tisch said.
    


            Jersey City resident, Ipsitaa Banigrhi, described the sound as “such a loud sound. It felt like thunder,” she told WCBS. “Then I saw black particles flying. Again, I thought maybe it's just dust or birds, and then we heard all the emergency vehicles and sirens go by. I think that's when it was like, ‘OK, what's happening.'”
    


            With the helicopter's catastrophic failure in midair, there was no way to guide the aircraft to safety, a former combat pilot told CNN's Kate Bolduan.
    


            “There's nothing that pilot could have done in that situation to recover the aircraft,” Brandt Anderson said.
    


            First responders from NYPD and New York City Fire Department teams pulled six people from the water. Four victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two others succumbed to injuries shortly after, Tisch said. Two children were taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where they were later pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X.
    


            The aircraft's main fuselage was retrieved from the river on Thursday evening, and dive operations continued Friday, WCBS reported.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on a boat.
    


            “The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,” Michael Roth, the CEO of the company operating the flight, told CNN of Thursday's crash. “I'm a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon.”
    


            When asked about the helicopter's maintenance, he said, “That's something my director of maintenance handles.” The director of maintenance declined to comment.
    


            Maintenance records are not publicly accessible, and the NTSB restricts what companies can disclose during an ongoing investigation.
    


            “(The pilot) called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn't arrive,” Roth told The Telegraph Thursday.
    


            The helicopter, a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, was built in 2004 and held an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid through 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records.
    


            Maintenance records are not public and during investigations NTSB rules prohibit companies from releasing certain information relating to the accident.
    


            The investigation into the cause of the crash will pore over documentation on all the work that was done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent FAA-issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023, required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            It remains unclear whether any of these issues played a role in Thursday's crash.
    


            Both the FAA and the NTSB are investigating the crash. The NTSB has dispatched a “go-team” to the site to examine the wreckage and review maintenance records, it said on social media, and is asking the public to submit any additional video or photos they may have.
    


            The helicopter was flying within New York's Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where air traffic control support is limited, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said in a post on X. Duffy added that the helicopter had received air traffic assistance from LaGuardia Airport shortly before entering the uncontrolled zone.

            Global markets are reeling over President Donald Trump's haphazard approach to tariffs and an escalating trade war with China. Stocks have been volatile, and an unsettling shift has emerged in the bond market. 



            Earlier this week, as stock markets around the world declined, US Treasuries also sold off. Stocks and bonds declining in tandem raised red flags.
    


            Typically, when investors sell off stocks in times of crisis, they pile into US Treasuries, seeking the safety of an asset backed by the full faith and credit of the US government.
    


            Yet as stocks declined, investors abruptly sold off US Treasuries, raising questions about how much they value the promises made by the US government to pay its debts amid concerns about how tariffs will impact economic growth.
    


            The sell-off in bonds was so unsettling that it spooked the White House.
    


            “People were getting a little queasy,” Trump said Wednesday as he told reporters he was watching the bond market.
    


            “The bond market is very tricky,” he said.
    


            While previous outcry from Wall Street, economists and lawmakers had yet to make Trump step down on tariffs, it was the turmoil in the bond market that made him blink and delay many of his tariffs.

            “The ‘blink' came sooner than we expected, probably forced by the markets,” said Mohit Kumar, chief economist and strategist for Europe at Jefferies, in a note Thursday. “The reversal is in sharp contrast to the fanfare with which Trump unveiled his tariff policy just a week ago.”
    


            The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note spiked as high as 4.5% on Wednesday. It was a whiplash reversal after falling below 4% and hitting its lowest level since October just days before. Yields and bond prices trade in opposite directions.
    


            US Treasuries are considered one of the safest corners of the market. It's where investors park their cash during economic turmoil and bouts of uncertainty. When stocks and bonds decline together, investors get spooked about broader economic stability. The trend is so unusual it's associated with moments of extraordinary uncertainty, like the pandemic and the 2008 financial crisis.
    


            Wall Street veterans were blunt about how the bond market forced Trump's hand.
    


            “The bond market spooked the president,” Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told CNN's Matt Egan. “Bond vigilantes were screaming that they weren't happy with what was going on, and there was a potential for a recession.”
    


            Trump's shift on his reciprocal tariffs serves as a stark reminder of the power and influence of the bond market — which can receive less attention than the stock market. While Trump watched stocks decline, it was a sell-off in Treasuries that forced him to move.
    


            “The Bond Vigilantes have struck again,” Yardeni said in a note.
    


            Bond vigilantes refer to investors who threaten to sell or refuse to buy government bonds, often to express dissatisfaction with government policy. Less demand for bonds means lower prices, which means higher yields — and a higher borrowing cost for the government.
    


            It's an example of how bond markets can signal to a government it must shift policy or face higher borrowing costs. For a recent example, just look at former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss.

Trump is on a collision course with the bond vigilantes



            Democratic political strategist James Carville famously said in the 1990s: “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter. But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.”
    


            National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said bond markets played a role in Trump's tariff pause Wednesday but did not cause “a panic move.”
    


            “And I think you know, the fact that the bond market was telling us, ‘Hey, it's probably time to move,' certainly would have contributed at least a little bit to that thinking, but it wasn't the bond market that made a panic move,” Hassett told CNBC.
    


            In a Fox Business interview Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed the moves in the bond market as “uncomfortable, but normal.”
    


            UBS said Tuesday that investors were selling bonds to raise cash to cover losses on the stock market. Deutsche Bank said Wednesday that US government bonds may be “losing their traditional haven status.”
    


            Whatever the case, the spike in yields alarmed market watchers.
    


            The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note is one of the key rates in the economy.
    


            The 10-year yield strongly influences mortgage rates and underpins a range of other borrowing costs for everyday Americans, small businesses, startups, large corporations and more.
    


            Bessent has been outspoken about his focus on the 10-year yield and his desire to see the yield come down.
    


            But a higher rate sparked by Trump's tariffs could be considered a self-own for the administration and could strain Americans trying to buy a home or take out a loan.
    


            “The bond market right now is beautiful,” Trump declared Wednesday, after his tariff pause. But the bond vigilantes can strike again.
    


            The 10-year yield settled above 4.4% Thursday — better than when yields rose above 4.5% early Wednesday, but still far above its dip below 4% last Friday, before yields spiked. It's a sign that relief can be fleeting.
    


            And after a historic rally on Wednesday, US stocks were lower again on Thursday.
    


            Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said that investors see America as a less reliable place to put their money due to the damage the Trump administration is doing to the US economy.
    


            “The whole Trump, Bessent, Lutnick grand plan is crumbling under the weight of its own inconsistency,” Sai told CNN's Anna Cooban. (Howard Lutnick is the US secretary of commerce.)
    


            “They've done significant damage to the notion that US assets are a safe haven for global capital,” Sai said.
    


            Chip Hughey, managing director for fixed income at Truist Advisory Services, said hedge funds are also unwinding bets tied to Treasuries, which could be contributing to higher yields. Demand at an auction for 10-year Treasuries on Wednesday was strong, according to Hughey, and he thinks yields could fall more as hedge funds tie up their trades.
    


            Trump's tariffs have also raised concerns that international investors might sell their Treasuries as a negotiating tactic. And Hughey said that if there is less being imported into the US from its global trading partners, that could disrupt demand for US Treasuries. Less trade with the US means foreign investors have fewer dollars to buy US Treasuries.
    


            The US dollar index, which measures the dollar's strength against six major foreign currencies, tumbled 1.8% on Thursday, a possible warning sign about waning investor confidence in the United States.
    


            “Our stock market is down. Bond yields are up and the dollar is declining. These are not the markers of successful policy,” Trump ally and investor Bill Ackman said in a post on X on Wednesday before Trump reversed his tariff policy.
    


            “Bonds are signaling that the pause is significant, yet not much has fundamentally changed,” said ING analysts in a note to investors Thursday. “Markets will not easily forget these episodes with wide market swings.”

            A family's afternoon sightseeing excursion above the misty shoreline of Manhattan ended in tragedy Thursday after the helicopter carrying them crashed off the New Jersey shoreline, killing them and the pilot.
    


            Spectators watched the helicopter as it dropped from the sky and slammed into the river upside down as fluttering debris landed in the water.
    


            The victims included Agustín Escobar, a Siemens executive, and his family, according to a law enforcement official. The family was visiting from Spain, New York Mayor Eric Adams said during a news conference Thursday. CNN has reached out to the New York Police Department and the US Coast Guard for more information on the victims.
    


            While not much is known about why the helicopter crashed, its staggering descent from the sky shocked witnesses as first responders did what they could to rescue the victims. 



            At 3:17 p.m., multiple 911 calls reported a helicopter crash in the Hudson River near the New Jersey coastline at Pier A Park in Hoboken, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. When first responders arrived, police pulled four people out of the water and FDNY pulled out two people, she said.
    


            Four victims were declared dead on scene and an additional two people were taken to local hospitals, Tisch said. Two children were taken to the Jersey City Medical Center before being pronounced dead, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said on X.
    


            “Our hearts go out to the family of those who were on board,” Adams said.
    


            President Donald Trump also sent his condolences via a Truth Social post, saying “God bless the families and friends of the victims” and that Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy was looking into the incident.
    


            The helicopter, operated by the tour company New York Helicopter Charter, is currently submerged in the river. 



            “The only thing I can tell you is that we are devastated,” Michael Roth, the CEO of New York Helicopter Charter Inc., told CNN Thursday evening.
    


            “I'm a father, a grandfather and my wife hasn't stopped crying since this afternoon,” he added. When asked about the maintenance of the helicopter, Roth said, “It's my director of maintenance who deals with that.”
    


            The company's director of maintenance declined to comment. Maintenance records are not public and the NTSB limits what companies can say publicly during an investigation. 



            Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, called the incident “an unimaginable tragedy” in a post on X.
    


            “I share in the grief of the victims' loved ones at this heartbreaking time,” he said.
    


            FlightRadar24 reported the aircraft to be a Bell 206L-4 LongRanger IV, based on ADS-B tracking data. It was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was good until 2029, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. There was no information immediately available on the pilot, according to Adams.
    


            The helicopter took off from the downtown Manhattan heliport at 2:59 p.m., where it flew south before turning to fly north along the Manhattan shoreline, up the Hudson River, Tisch said. At 3:08 p.m., the helicopter reached the George Washington Bridge and then turned to fly south along the New Jersey shoreline, where shortly after it lost control, she said.
    


            When the helicopter hit the water, officials believe it was inverted, leaving the cabin visible in the water, Tisch said. Reports that the helicopter stopped in mid-air and pieces of the helicopter were falling off before it hit the water is consistent with 911 reports, she said. The cause of the crash is under investigation, she said.
    


            The helicopter flew for about 16 minutes before going down into the water, according to analysis by CNN and flight tracking site FlightRadar 24.
    


            The flight path reflects much of what officials said, showing the aircraft took off from lower Manhattan and did a circle near the Statue of Liberty before flying up the Hudson River to the George Washington Bridge at about 1000 feet. At that point it turned back south, ultimately coming to rest in the water near New Jersey.
    


            The path up the Hudson is a popular sightseeing route.
    


            When the helicopter crashed, it was cloudy with winds around 10 to 15 mph with gusts up to 25 mph according to various weather reports in the area.
    


            Visibility at the surface was good — 10 miles — but it was cloudy as a system is moving into the region, bringing light rain to the region this afternoon and evening.
    


            Helicopters on an air traffic control frequency were asked to look for anyone in the water following the crash. “Please keep your eyes open. You guys see anything in the water, please let us know,” said an emergency response pilot on the frequency.
    


            The FAA is temporarily prohibiting drone pilots from flying near today's helicopter crash unless they have specific authorization.
    


            The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is investigating the situation alongside the National Transportation Safety Board. The NTSB is leading the investigation and will provide updates.
    


            The helicopter was in the Special Flight Rules Area in New York, where no air traffic control services are provided, Secretary Duffy said in a post on X Thursday. Several minutes before entering that area, air traffic control from LaGuardia Airport was providing support, he said.
    


            The National Transportation Safety Board chair and investigators are on their way to the site of today's deadly helicopter crash in the Hudson River.
    


            “The NTSB is launching a go-team to investigate Thursday's crash of a Bell 206 L-4 helicopter near Jersey City, New Jersey,” the Board said in a social media post. “The team is expected to arrive tonight.”
    


            The cause of the crash is under investigation by the NTSB, which will pore over documentation on all the work that had been done on the aircraft. That would include the company's compliance with two recent Federal Aviation Administration issued airworthiness directives.
    


            One directive from May 2023 required the testing and possible replacement of tail rotor drive shafts on eight different Bell 206L models, including the 206L-4. That directive was prompted by an incident in which a Bell 206L helicopter experienced the loss of a tail-rotor drive due to a joint failure.
    


            The FAA also issued a December 2022 airworthiness directive on Bell 206L models with specific parts, requiring inspection and possible replacement of the helicopters' main rotor blades because of “delamination.” That refers to layers within the blade separating due to material fatigue, damage (from bird strikes, for example), or manufacturing errors, potentially leading the rotor blade to fail.
    


            The helicopter that crashed in the Hudson River was built in 2004 and had an airworthiness certificate issued in 2016 that was valid until 2029, according to FAA records.
    


            The company operating the helicopter was previously involved in two safety incidents investigated by federal aviation authorities.
    


            In 2015, a pilot for the New York Helicopter Charter company was forced to land in New Jersey after hovering 20 feet in the air for a short time. An initial inspection showed there “may have been corrosion removed” from sections of the helicopter and that some of the helicopter's component parts may have been deformed to an extent to be “considered unairworthy,” according to an FAA inspector at the time. The same helicopter was previously involved in a crash in Chile in 2010.
    


            In 2013, a pilot for the company was forced to land a helicopter carrying four passengers on the water near Manhattan after hearing a “bang” that was followed by the “Engine Out warning horn.” The pilot inflated the helicopter's floats and got the passengers to safety on an approaching boat.

            When discussions began over releasing Israeli hostages shortly after the October 7 attack by Hamas, the negotiators tasked to strike a deal were mostly intelligence and security professionals. But in February, Israel made an important change that those now involved say has had a profound slowing effect on the discussions to resurrect the broken ceasefire: The file was taken over by the prime minister's closest political aide, Ron Dermer.
    


            With Dermer, says a source involved in the negotiations, there's a “significant difference in momentum,” from when Israel's team was led by intelligence chiefs David Barnea and Ronen Bar.
    


            “There is a clear shift in [Israeli] priorities,” the source said. “Negotiations are seemingly being politicized from the Israeli team.”
    


            Now, Barnea, who directs the Mossad, has been sidelined and Bar, who ran the internal security service Shin Bet, has been fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, causing an uproar in Israel.
    


            The decision to push aside career national security professionals in favor of Netanyahu's closest adviser was intended to give Netanyahu more control over the negotiation process, an Israeli source familiar with the negotiations said.
    


            “The political considerations of the Israeli team led by Dermer is not having a positive impact,” says an American who advocates for the families of Israeli hostages. “The families understand that Dermer is a big problem to getting their loved ones.”
    


            An Israeli official pushed back on claims that Dermer's position at the helm of negotiations has hampered progress or politicized the negotiations, saying, “Negotiations need to be judged by results, not process.”
    


            “To reach a deal, you need someone who actually represents the will of the government that will authorize said deal, not ‘dissent,' which only served to undermine negotiations,” the official said.
    


            The fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that started as President Donald Trump took office collapsed last month when Israel re-launched its military operations and US and Israeli officials accused Hamas of rejecting a deal to extend it, which Hamas denied.
    


            There had long been indications Israel planned to resume its war against Hamas after the first phase of the ceasefire deal, when 38 Israeli and Thai hostages were released over six weeks.
    


            Netanyahu regularly cites freeing the hostages as a top priority. But so is the destruction of Hamas, and critics have accused him of prioritizing the latter at the expense of the former, namely because that is also where the prime minister's political interests lie.
    


            Destroying Hamas has long been the priority of key right-wing members of Netanyahu's governing coalition, who have invariably threatened and followed through on threats to quit the government.
    


            With Dermer in charge of the negotiations, Netanyahu can more deftly manage the delicate political balancing act that has influenced Israeli decision-making at every critical turn of the ceasefire negotiations.
    


            During the many months of ceasefire negotiations last year that ultimately led to a ceasefire deal in January, Israeli security officials balked at Netanyahu's shifting positions and stall tactics that they believed were influenced by political considerations and delayed the brokering of a deal. But with Dermer now in charge and intelligence leaders marginalized, those dissenting views have featured less prominently in Israeli security discussions and in Israeli press reports.
    


            While in the US to meet Trump earlier this week, Netanyahu rejected accusations that freeing the hostages isn't a top priority.
    


            “The president looked at me and told the journalists who were present: ‘This man is working constantly to free the hostages.' I hope that this shatters the lie that is being circulated to the effect that I am not working for them, that I don't care. I do care, and I am doing it and we will be successful,” Netanyahu said.
    


            The Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel recently made a direct appeal to Dermer, whose title is the Minister of Strategic Affairs, accusing him of leaving them “in complete darkness.”
    


            “When you were appointed as head of the negotiating team, we were promised that this would help reach a breakthrough on a new agreement,” the letter said. “In reality, more than a month has passed and there is no progress in sight.”
    


            Barnea and Bar had regularly shuttled to Egypt and Qatar, as well as other countries, for ceasefire talks that included the heads of the CIA, Egyptian intelligence and the prime minister of Qatar.
    


            Now Dermer speaks less with mediators from Egypt and Qatar, which maintain direct relationships with Hamas, according to the source involved in the negotiations.
    


            The US point person has also shifted from the former CIA director to the Trump administration's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, who has accused Hamas of intransigence that caused the recent ceasefire to break down.
    


            “If you're the Trump team, you blame Hamas but behind the scenes I believe they are trying to push both sides,” the American who works with the hostage families said.
    


            A spokesperson for Witkoff said in a statement, “Ambassador Witkoff and the Trump administration are in lockstep with Israel in their pursuit of freeing the hostages, including American Edan Alexander, and achieving peace – which means Hamas out of power in Gaza. To achieve this, difficult negotiations are necessary.”
    


            Witkoff and US hostage envoy Adam Boehler have tried to figure out formulas to get Hamas to release the remaining Americans – one living and four dead – and get the truce extended enough to try to negotiate the next phase.
    


            “The US is doing everything possible to release alive and deceased US hostages, which necessitates the deal,” said an Egyptian official. While Israel “doesn't see hostages superseding breaking Hamas.”
    


            Most recently, Hamas agreed to an Egypt- and Qatar-backed proposal that mirrored one Witkoff presented last month to release the lone living American hostage, Edan Alexander, along with four others and extend the peace through Ramadan and Passover.
    


            Israel quickly countered, demanding 11 living hostages, almost half of the 24 remaining. That would more dramatically cut into what Hamas views as their greatest leverage over Israel.
    


            “We're still working on the Witkoff plan for an extension,” said a diplomat familiar with the discussions. “I think we have some wiggle room that we can work on.”
    


            Israel had early in the ceasefire delayed launching negotiations for the second phase whose terms stipulated the release of all remaining hostages, a permanent ceasefire and a withdrawal by Israel's military from Gaza.
    


            That could have meant the survival of Hamas – even if not in power - and flown in the face of Netanyahu's goal of “total victory.” It would also have threatened Netanyahu's government.
    


            Those second phase talks never began.
    


            “There's no clarity on the [Israeli] objective,” the first source involved in the talks said, adding: “Americans are getting impatient.”
    


            As Israel's latest operations have taken the death toll in Gaza over 50,000, there has been promising movement to resurrect the truce, those involved say.
    


            Hamas is feeling the pressure, both from Israel's military and widescale protests by Palestinians in Gaza, said a US official familiar with the negotiations.
    


            “Hamas is struggling for oxygen,” said the official who accused Hamas of missing American opportunities last month to keep the ceasefire going. “They're not very quick to move.”
    


            The American working with the hostage families has felt “some air being breathed back into the process.”
    


            “There's a real sense of urgency and push on the part of the Americans and the [Egyptian and Qatari] mediators,” the source involved in the negotiations said.
    


            To try to salvage the ceasefire, hostage envoy Boehler made an unprecedented move: meeting directly with officials from Hamas, which the US considers a terrorist organization.
    


            That meeting angered Israeli officials, and reportedly Dermer in particular. Boehler confirmed he spoke with Dermer after and defended the meeting, telling CNN: “we're not an agent of Israel.”
    


            With much of Hamas' leadership inside Gaza decimated, it's not clear if the military leaders still fighting Israel are on the same page as the political leadership engaging with mediators, including Boehler, the source involved in the negotiations said.
    


            “Stubbornness in Hamas also unhelpful. They need to account for the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza,” the source said.
    


            Meanwhile, the discussions continue with the Israeli team led by Dermer, but which still includes security professionals working on the technical details.
    


            “The Israeli team is putting a lot of effort, but the way it's being managed tactically from the top,” the source said, “the current structure of the negotiation team is not as helpful as needed for progress.”

            The 89th playing of the Masters got off to a blazing start at Augusta National Golf Club on Thursday, with Englishman Justin Rose ending the day atop of the leaderboard.
    


            The first major of the year got started with a ceremonial tee shot from Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tom Watson. After that, 95 players began the quest for the iconic green jacket.
    


            The 44-year-old Rose put himself in strong position to win his second career major, after posting a career-low 7-under 65 opening round, his fifth time leading the tournament after the first round.

            Rose, who sits three shots ahead of world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, Ludvig Åberg, and Corey Conners, had previous success in Augusta, finishing in second in 2015 and 2017.
    


            Despite never winning the prized tournament, Rose's confidence has never wavered in his ability to one day get there.
    


            “I feel like I've played well enough to win this tournament,” Rose said after the round. “I just feel like I don't have the jacket to prove it. … I've obviously played, I've played a lot of good rounds of golf here. Got a lot of crystal, which is obviously always nice.
    


            “But yeah, you know, ultimately, you want to be last man standing on Sunday, and I was a shot shy – I guess Sergio and I in 2017, that was a real 50/50. That could have gone any which way down the stretch. A little bit of Lady Luck here and there is always the difference here at times.
    


            “But I've had my luck on occasion and been a champion. But you've got to be playing the golf to keep creating those opportunities, and obviously the only way to do that is to get your name on the leaderboard. I definitely don't shy away from it.”
    


            Scheffler, a two-time Masters champion, came into the tournament the betting favorite and he certainly looked the part.
    


            The 28-year-old Scheffler coasted to a bogey-free 68 to sit within striking distance of the lead ahead Friday's second round.
    


            Scheffler, who will be hoping to join an exclusive club by winning a third Masters title and has the chance to be the first player to defend his green jacket since Tiger Woods in 2002, said he felt “pretty good” about his four-under par score.
    


            “I had a feeling the golf course was going to get pretty firm,” Scheffler said. “The areas to hit your irons out here are pretty small and they get even smaller when the greens are firm, so there's definitely some challenge to the golf course today, and I'm sure that'll continue as the week goes on.”
    


            Rose will tee off at 8:52 a.m. ET while Scheffler get going at 1:23 p.m. ET.
    


            World No. 2 Rory McIlroy quickly went from looking like a true contender for his maiden green jacket to possibly missing the cut.
    


            Through the first 14 holes, the 35-year-old blazed out to a 4-under par, bogey-free round.
    


            That was until the last couple holes.
    


            McIlroy, who has won twice this season on the PGA Tour including at The Players Championship, took a pair of double bogeys late and settled for a 72 which saw him fall from second place down to 27th on the leaderboard.
    


            The Northern Irishman declined to speak to reporters following the round.
    


            In his pursuit for a career grand slam, McIlroy will look to rebound on Friday with a 9:58 a.m. ET tee time.
    


            It was a nightmare round for two youngsters - American Nick Dunlap  and highly-rated Spanish amateur Jose Luis Ballester.
    


            The 21-year-old Dunlap, playing in his second career Masters, shot a historic opening round 18-over 90 to find himself in last place on the leaderboard.
    


            Dunlap, a two-time winner of the PGA Tour, became the first player under 38 years old to fail to break 90 at the Masters.
    


            It's the worst score at the Masters since Ben Crenshaw's 91 back in 2015.
    


            Dunlap did not speak to reporters after the round.
    


            Life comes at your fast, especially when you are young.
    


            For the 21-year-old, Arizona State University senior Ballester, it came at the expense of stuff beyond his actual play.

            Last year's US Amateur winner Ballester, who played alongside Scheffler and Justin Thomas on Thursday, admitted to going to the bathroom at Rae's Creek at Augusta National.
    


            Ballester said he forgot there were bathrooms near the 13th hole tee box and relieved himself in the creek much to the delight of spectators.
    


            “Didn't really know where to go, and since (Justin Thomas) had an issue on the green, I'm like, I'm just going to sneak here in the river and probably people would not see me that much, and then they clapped for me,” Ballester said.
    


            “Probably one of the claps that I really got today real loud, so that was kind of funny.”
    


            Ballester added that he had no regrets.
    


            “They saw me. It was not embarrassing at all for me. If I had to do it again, I would do it again,” Ballester said.
    


            Dunlap will tee off at 12:50 p.m. ET while Ballester is at 1:23 p.m. ET.

PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) — A Japanese pilot slammed his Zero fighter plane into the USS Missouri and ignited a fireball on April 11, 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa. The suicide attack instantly killed the pilot, but none of the battleship's crew members were badly hurt.

The Missouri's captain ordered a military burial at sea with full honors, marking one of the more unusual and little-known episodes of World War II. The pilot received the same funeral that the ship would have given one of its own sailors.

Eighty years later, the Missouri is a museum moored at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, not far from the submerged hull of the USS Arizona, which sank in the 1941 Japanese bombing that propelled the U.S. into the war. On Friday, three of the captain's grandsons will mark the anniversary of the attack and burial with the mayors of Honolulu and the Japanese city of Minamikyushu, from which many kamikaze pilots set off on their suicide missions.

“This is one of the ship's great stories and explains, in part, why the ship became an international symbol of peace and reconciliation within two years of its launching and rather than just an instrument of destruction,” said Michael Carr, CEO of the Battleship Missouri Memorial. “This is a remarkable story of compassion and humanity, even in the midst of one of the worst battles of World War II.”

Here's what to know about the attack on the Missouri and the pilot's burial:




Japan launched a suicide attack campaign as a last-ditch measure to push U.S. forces back late in the war, when it was hopelessly losing. 

The Imperial Navy founded the Kamikaze Tokko Tai, which translates as Divine Wind Special Attack Corps, and the Imperial Army followed with its own unit. Internationally their missions are called kamikaze, but in Japan they are better known as “tokko,” which means “special attack.” 

The pilots flew hastily constructed planes and even reconnaissance and training aircraft because the military lacked sufficient equipment. They took off on one-way flights with just enough fuel to reach their targets.

Kamikaze sank their first ship on Oct. 25, 1944, when a navy Zero pilot smashed into the USS St. Lo in the Philippine Sea while carrying a pair of 550-pound (250-kilogram) bombs. Britain's Imperial War Museum says they killed 7,000 Allied naval personnel in all. 

Their initial 30% success rate fell to about 8% by mid-1945 due to declining crew skills, dwindling aircraft capabilities and improved U.S. defenses. 

Some 4,000 pilots died on suicide missions, about 2,500 navy and more than 1,400 army, most of them university students drafted in late 1943. Many launched from Chiran, a tea farming town that today is part of Minamikyushu, a city in southwest Japan.

The missions became more intense as Japan's outlook grew more dire and the military showcased the sacrifice of the pilots to drum up patriotism and support for the war. Those who failed to take off or survived were considered a disgrace. 

Despite stereotypes of kamikaze as super-patriots who volunteered to die, many were not, as shown by their carefully nuanced last letters to loved ones and survivor accounts. 

“They were victims of war,” said Hiroyuki Nuriki, mayor of Minamikyushu, who noted the pilots were only around 20 years old and had futures. 

“I'm sure they didn't want to die, but they still had to go,” he said. “That's the tragedy of war, and that's why we should never start a war again.”

The Battle of Okinawa lasted 82 todays, with fierce fighting on land and sea. On April 11 the Missouri fended off aerial assaults from multiple directions and already had downed one kamikaze plane when a second approached.

The Missouri's gunners hit the Zero fighter with a 5-inch (12.7-centimeter) round. The plane plunged, but it leveled out about 20 feet (6 meters) above the ocean and headed for the ship's starboard side. 

The crash ripped off the plane's right wing, which landed on the deck. Fuel in the wing caught fire, unleashing a giant plume of smoke. The crew controlled the fire within five minutes. 

The dent left by the attack is still visible on the Missouri's hull.

Capt. William Callaghan ordered the funeral to be held the next morning. 

The crew collected red and white cloth and sewed a makeshift “rising sun” flag so he could be buried under his own colors, said Frank Clay, curator of the Battleship Missouri Memorial. They cleaned the body, wrapped it in canvas and placed it on a tray against the rail beneath the flag. 

Marine rifle guards gave a gun salute and a bugler played taps. The chaplain gave an invocation and said, “Commit his body to the deep.” The crew tipped the tray and the body slid into the sea. 

It was the only known instance of U.S. forces holding a military funeral for a kamikaze pilot.

Some crew members resented the ritual, while others grumbled but later came to believe it was the right thing to do, Clay said. 

Ed Buffman, who was a teenage gunner's mate 2nd class on the Missouri, said he did not dwell on it: “The next day you're ready to go back and battle again.” 

Little is known of Callaghan's reasons for ordering the ceremony, which appeared on the ship's daily schedule for meal times and other routine activity. 

Carey Callaghan said his grandfather never spoke of the burial and his family didn't learn about it until 2001. He said his grandfather had empathy and a sense of dignity, which was reflected by the funeral. 

A remarkable thing, Callaghan said, was that three years earlier, his grandfather lost his brother, Rear Adm. Daniel Callaghan, to Japanese gunfire off Guadalcanal.

Scholars believe he was Setsuo Ishino, a petty officer 2nd class in a flight training program. 

The pilot took off from Kanoya air base in southern Japan with 15 others as part of the No. 5 Kenmu Squadron. Most failed to hit their targets and crashed into the ocean. 

“Dear Mother, The time has come for me to blossom at last. I am fulfilling my final duty with a smile. Please don't say anything, this is for our country,” Ishino wrote. “The next time we see each other, we will be under the beautiful cherry blossom trees at Yasukuni Shrine. Please don't cry, only smile and tell me ‘well done.'”

Then-President Barack Obama referenced the burial in 2016 when he visited Pearl Harbor with then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. He told those gathered that Callaghan showed “we must resist the urge to demonize those who are different” and do so “even when hatred burns hottest.”

Thanks to Callahan's act, the Missouri museum and the Chiran Peace Museum, which displays army tokko artifacts, today are partners and help each other with exhibits. 

Nuriki, the Minamikyushu mayor, said it is important to remember the events of April 11, 1945, and the tragedy of kamikaze pilots as Asia-Pacific tensions rise. 

“We share the history between the former enemies that have become friends,” he said. “We should keep telling the story and think about peace.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — A Russian-American woman freed by Moscow arrived back in the United States late Thursday as part of a prisoner swap completed as the two countries aim to repair ties.

A plane carrying Ksenia Karelina landed around 11 p.m. EDT at Joint Base Andrews, where she was greeted by her fiancé. Morgan Ortagus, President Donald Trump's deputy special envoy to the Middle East, presented her with a bouquet. She was released earlier in the day in exchange for a Russian-German man who'd been jailed in the U.S. on smuggling charges.

Karelina was arrested in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg in February 2024 and convicted of treason on charges stemming from a donation of about $52 to a charity aiding Ukraine. U.S. authorities have called the case “absolutely ludicrous.”



“They released the young ballerina and she is now out, and that was good. So we appreciate that,” President Donald Trump said at a Cabinet meeting Thursday. He said the release followed conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Arthur Petrov was released as part of the swap in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, according to the Federal Security Service, or FSB, Russia's main security and counterintelligence agency. Petrov was arrested in Cyprus in August 2023 at the request of the U.S. on charges of smuggling sensitive microelectronics to Russia and extradited to the U.S. a year later.

Karelina was among a growing number of Americans arrested in Russia in recent years as tensions between Moscow and Washington spiked over the war in Ukraine. Her release is the latest in a series of high-profile prisoner exchanges Russia and the U.S. carried out in the last three years — and the second since Trump took office and reversed Washington's policy of isolating Russia in an effort to end the war in Ukraine.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe hailed “the CIA officers who worked tirelessly to support this effort.” The CIA also emphasized that “the exchange shows the importance of keeping lines of communication open with Russia, despite the deep challenges in our bilateral relationship.”

Meanwhile, Russian and U.S. diplomats met in Istanbul for a second round of talks on normalizing embassies' work, following the first such meeting in February. The State Department said the delegations “exchanged notes to finalize an understanding to ensure the stability of diplomatic banking for Russian and U.S. bilateral missions.”

It said the U.S. reiterated its concerns about the Russian ban on hiring of local staff, “the key impediment to maintaining for stable and sustainable staffing levels at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow.”

Alexander Darchiyev, Russia's ambassador to Washington, who led Moscow's delegation in the talks, praised their “positive atmosphere” and noted the parties agreed to continue discussions to facilitate diplomats' travel. He added that the Russian side also pushed for a quick return of its diplomatic property seized by U.S. authorities.

In February, Russia released American teacher Marc Fogel, imprisoned on drug charges, in a swap that the White House described as part of a diplomatic thaw that could advance peace negotiations. That same month, Russia released another American just days after arresting him on drug smuggling charges.

Karelina, a former ballet dancer also identified in some media as Ksenia Khavana, lived in Maryland before moving to Los Angeles. She was arrested when she returned to Russia to visit her family last year.

The FSB accused her of “proactively” collecting money for a Ukrainian organization that was supplying gear to Kyiv's forces. The First Department, a Russian rights group, said the charges stemmed from a $51.80 donation to a U.S. charity aiding Ukraine.

“I am overjoyed to hear that the love of my life, Ksenia Karelina is on her way home from wrongful detention in Russia,” Karelina's fiancé, professional boxer Chris van Heerden, said in a statement. “She has endured a nightmare for 15 months and I cannot wait to hold her. Our dog, Boots, is also eagerly awaiting her return.”

He thanked Trump and his envoys, as well as prominent public figures who had championed her case, including Dana White, a Trump friend and CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Trump also credited White, too, saying the UFC boss had called him about the case.

White House national security adviser Mike Waltz said on X, “President Trump and his administration continue to work around the clock to ensure Americans detained abroad are returned home to their families.”

The exchange was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

The United Arab Emirates' state-run WAM news agency released photos of Karelina boarding a plane and one of her standing next to Yousef al-Otaiba, the UAE's ambassador to the U.S.

The FSB, which said Putin had pardoned Karelina before the swap, released a video showing her being escorted to a plane somewhere in Russia. The footage then featured what appeared to be the scene of exchange at the Abu Dhabi airport, with Petrov walking off a plane and shaking hands with Russian officials on the tarmac.

The video showed Petrov undergoing medical checkups on a flight to Russia. “I have no particular complaints, just a bit tired,” he said.

Another video released by the FSB later in the day showed him walking off a plane after arriving in Russia. 

Petrov was accused by the U.S. Justice Department of involvement in a scheme to procure microelectronics subject to U.S. export controls on behalf of a Russia-based supplier of critical components for the country's weapons industries. He was facing a 20-year prison term in the U.S.

Abu Dhabi was the scene of another high-profile prisoner swap between Russia and the United States. In December 2022, American basketball star Brittney Griner was traded for the notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. 

The UAE has been a mediator in prisoner swaps between Russia and Ukraine, while the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai has become home to many Russians and Ukrainians who fled there after the start of Moscow's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) — Justin Rose did more than just match his best score at the Masters.

With a round that was nearly nine shots better than the field Thursday, the 44-year-old Rose managed to steal the spotlight from the Masters dominance of Scottie Scheffler and the endless quest of Rory McIlroy to complete the career Grand Slam.

Rose felt his 7-under 65 had the potential to be something special. And even with a bogey on the final hole, it was every bit of that.

He opened with three straight birdies. He ran off three in a row around the turn. And he wound up with a three-shot lead over Scheffler, Ludvig Aberg and Corey Conners.

“When I have been playing well, I feel like I have been competing at a high level,” Rose said. “My consistency maybe has not been as high this year. But my good is good again. So I'm excited about that.”

Scheffler did his part in his bid to win a third Masters green jacket in four years, playing a bogey-free round of 68. 

McIlroy, so desperate to win this major and complete the career Grand Slam, was right there with him until the end. He took a pair of double bogeys late in the afternoon with careless mistakes and had to settle for a 72. It was the seventh straight time he failed to break 70 in the opening round of the Masters.

He declined to speak to the media after his round.

Rose set one Masters record: The fifth time he has had at least a share of the 18-hole lead, breaking the mark held by Jack Nicklaus. The glaring difference, of course, is Nicklaus has six of those green jackets.




It also was the eighth time Rose has had at least a share of the lead after any round at Augusta National, something only five others have done. All are Masters champions.

“I feel like I've played well enough to win this tournament,” said Rose, whose best chance was a playoff loss to Sergio Garcia in 2017. “I just feel like I don't have the jacket to prove it. ... But you've got to be playing the golf to keep creating those opportunities, and the only way to do that is to get your name on the leaderboard. I definitely don't shy away from it.”

Rose opened with a 25-foot birdie putt and made his eighth birdie with a 20-foot putt on the par-3 16th. In between was a series of good shots — smart shots — that gave him plenty of chances and he converted most of them.

Augusta National, soaked by rain that washed out most of the Monday practice round, already was getting scary fast.

The average score was 73.6. Only six players broke 70, and 20 others broke par.

“Ridiculous. That's nuts,” Viktor Hovland said about Rose's score. “Those greens are so firm. I remember a few years ago — I can't remember what year it was — but he kind of did something similar. I think this one is probably a little bit more impressive because out of all the Masters I've played, this is probably the firmest it's been on a Thursday. It's definitely no joke out there.”

Scheffler was 3 under at the turn, including one birdie on the par-5 eighth in which his ball was deep in a divot hole short of the green. He managed to get that out some 20 feet left of the pin and used the slope to bring it back to 15 feet and made the putt.

He was rarely under stress.

“I struggled for what felt like two pars today,” Scheffler said “But other than that, the golf course was in front of me most of the day, kept the ball in play, did a lot of really good things out there.”

U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau and Tyrrell Hatton carried the LIV Golf flag, both at 69. DeChambeau had seven birdies in his up-and-down day, a show of his scoring power.

“Making some bogeys for me probably frees me up a little bit and says, you know what? Just go out and play some golf,” DeChambeau said.

The roars came early, along with a few shockers.

Fred Couples, who wondered a month ago if at 65 with a creaky back he would still be welcomed to play, became only the second player that age to break par. Couples holed out from the fairway on the 14th with a 6-iron hybrid on his way to a 71. Tom Watson was also 65 — by 28 days he is still the oldest — when he shot 71 in 2015.

The horror show belonged to Nick Dunlap, a 21-year-old who last year won on the PGA Tour as an amateur. This must have felt like amateur hour when he made double bogey on the final hole for a 90. It was the highest score since Ben Crenshaw shot 91 in 2015 at ag 63.

Hideki Matsuyama might have caught the worst break when his approach into the par-5 13th hit the pin and caromed into the tributary of Rae's Creek. The wildest day belonged to Nicolai Hojgaard — one eagle, five birdies, four pars, five bogeys and three double bogeys. Do the math and that comes out to 76.

“It's mentally draining playing a round like this,” Hojgaard said.

And then there was McIlroy, chipping into the water from behind the 15th green for double bogey, and then going long on the 17th and compounding that mistake with a three-putt for another double bogey.

Far more blissful on a warm spring day was Rose, who at one point had it going so well that he felt like a pitcher throwing a no-hitter.

He pitched to 6 feet for birdie on the par-5 eighth. He hit wedge to the ninth and used the slope to set up a 5-foot birdie, giving him a career-low 31 on the front nine. That was followed by a 12-foot birdie putt.

“That's when the day felt a bit different. That's when I felt I was doing something potentially more on the special side,” Rose said. 

And then he really began to pull away from the field with a smart pitch away from the water to set up a 10-foot birdie on the 15th, followed by the 20-foot birdie on the 16th. The pins on the final two holes allowed for birdies and Rose was thinking super special. He got par-bogey instead that didn't ruin his mood.

“I'm 44. Golf is not going to get easier for me in the next five, 10 years, whatever it's going to be,” Rose said. “So your opportunity is less going forward. So you have to make the most of it.”

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen hit back at the Trump administration's 'tone' regarding Greenland on Friday. (Denmark Foreign Ministry)

The Pentagon fired the commander at the U.S. Space Force base in Greenland after she distanced herself from Vice President JD Vance, who recently visited the headquarters. 

After the vice president's visit, Col. Susannah Meyers emailed base personnel on March 31, writing, ""I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the U.S. administration discussed by Vice President Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik Space Base.""

She added that she had ""spent the weekend thinking about Friday's visit — the actions taken, the words spoken, and how it must have affected each of you."" The email was first reported by Military.com.

The Space Force said in a public statement Meyers had been relieved of command ""due to loss of confidence in her ability to lead.""

""Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties,"" the statement read. 

Col. Shawn Lee has now assumed the command, Space Force said. 

""Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump's agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defense,"" Pentagon chief spokesperson Sean Parnell posted on X. 

Meyers became commander of the 821st Space Base Group in July, according to a Facebook post about the change-of-command ceremony. 

Republican Sens. Tommy Tuberville, Ala., Eric Schmitt, Mo., and Jim Banks, Ind., all praised the firing of the commander on X. 

""Colonel Meyers tried to politicize the Space Force and was held accountable. Lloyd Austin isn't SecDef anymore,"" Banks wrote.

Vance, during his visit to the snow-covered island, criticized Denmark for treating Greenlanders as ""second-class citizens."" 

""Our message to Denmark is very simple,"" Vance said. ""You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security of this incredible, beautiful landmass.""

The vice president further accused Denmark of not keeping Greenland safe from China and Russia. 

Vance was the highest-ranking official to ever travel to the base in Pituffik, the White House said. 

The Trump administration has made acquiring Greenland a top goal. 

""We need Greenland for national security and international security,"" President Donald Trump said on March 11.

""So, we'll, I think, we'll go as far as we have to go,"" the president continued, speaking from the Oval Office. ""We need Greenland. And the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark. Denmark has to have us have Greenland. And, you know, we'll see what happens. But if we don't have Greenland, we can't have great international security.""

""I view it from a security standpoint, we have to be there,"" Trump added.

Fox News' Nate Foy reports live from Jersey City on the helicopter crash that killed six individuals, including the pilot and a family from Spain. Warning: This video contains disturbing footage.

New details have emerged regarding the final moments of the helicopter that plunged into the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey, on Thursday afternoon. 

The pilot of the doomed aircraft reportedly radioed about needing to refuel minutes before the helicopter crashed into the chilly waters, according to New York Helicopter Tour CEO Michael Roth, whose company operated the helicopter.

""[The pilot] called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn't arrive,"" Roth told The Telegraph. 

All six people on board – including five members of the same family – did not survive.

""The only thing I know by watching a video of the helicopter falling down, that the main rotor blades weren't on the helicopter,"" Roth told the New York Post. ""I haven't seen anything like that in my 30 years being in business, in the helicopter business. The only thing I could guess – I got no clue – is that it either had a bird strike or the main rotor blades failed. I have no clue. I don't know.""

The five passengers have been identified as Siemens executive Agustin Escobar, Mercé Camprubi Montal, an energy technology company global manager, and the couple's three young children, according to The Associated Press.

The pilot's identity had not been released as of Friday morning. 

Photos posted on the helicopter operator's website showed the family smiling inside the aircraft moments before it took off.

The flight departed a Downtown Manhattan heliport at approximately 3 p.m. and was in the air for about 18 minutes. Bystander footage of the crash shows the aircraft's rotor detaching from the cabin as it rapidly falls through the air before hitting the water near Jersey City. 

Authorities began receiving 911 calls regarding a helicopter crash in the Hudson River around 3:17 p.m., New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said during a news conference on Thursday. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the helicopter spinning uncontrollably before landing in the water. 

New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed the family was visiting from Spain, adding it is ""heartbreaking"" that a family traveling to the city became victims of such a tragic accident.

""We had over 65 million people that visited our city last year, and just think about it, you're on a vacation, you're with your family, you want to experience New York from the sky, and something like this happens. It's heartbreaking to everyone,"" Adams said, in part.

Emergency personnel arrived at the scene within minutes, including divers from the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) and New York City Police Department (NYPD). NYPD drivers pulled four people from the wreckage, while the FDNY recovered two additional people, according to Tisch. 

First responders attempted lifesaving efforts on an adjoining pier, but four people were pronounced dead at the scene and the others were pronounced dead at local hospitals. 

The water temperature in the Hudson River at the time of the crash was in the mid-40s, according to FOX Weather.

""The Coast Guard and Army Corps, along with local partners, continue to support the NTSB in their ongoing investigation and debris recovery efforts,"" the U.S. Coast Guard said in a statement. 

The helicopter was salvaged hours later, according to the Army Corps of Engineers. 

The incident occurred less than a mile from Manhattan and near the Holland Tunnel, where 15.8 million vehicles travel between New York City and New Jersey per year. Immediately following the crash, the Coast Guard implemented a safety zone around the Holland Tunnel and Hudson River, which remained in effect until 10 p.m. Thursday.

Roth and New York Helicopter Tours did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

The incident was the first helicopter crash the city has seen since 2019, after an aircraft struck the roof of a skyscraper, killing the pilot. 

""Our hearts go out to the families of those who were onboard,"" Adams said. ""It's almost reminiscent of the plane going down here on the Hudson River. Thank God we didn't lose any lives back then. It's still fresh and still new, the investigation is ongoing, and … the family members, we lift them up in prayer.""

 Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., discusses efforts to deport illegal migrants under the Trump administration on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a lower court's decision to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national living in Maryland, from an El Salvador prison where federal officials sent hundreds of suspected criminals and gang members in March.

Abrego Garcia, 29, was deported to the El Salvadoran megaprison last month for being an alleged MS-13 gang member, but his attorneys maintain he does not have any gang ties.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered federal officials to coordinate his return back to Maryland in a Monday order, calling his deportation ""wholly unlawful."" On Thursday, the Supreme Court sided with Xinis. 

""On March 15, 2025, the United States removed Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia from the United States to El Salvador, where he is currently detained in the Center for Terrorism Confinement (CECOT),"" the order states. ""The United States acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador was therefore illegal.""

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said she ""would have declined to intervene in this litigation and denied the application in full.""

""Nevertheless, I agree with the Court's order that the proper remedy is to provide Abrego Garcia with all the processes to which he would have been entitled had he not been unlawfully removed to El Salvador,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""That means the Government must comply with its obligation to provide Abrego Garcia with ‘due process of law,' including notice and an opportunity to be heard, in any future proceedings.""

The High Court further said it ""properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.""

The Justice Department responded to the order in a statement to Fox News in a statement. 

""As the Supreme Court correctly recognized, it is the exclusive prerogative of the President to conduct foreign affairs,"" the statement says. ""By directly noting the deference owed to the Executive Branch, this ruling once again illustrates that activist judges do not have the jurisdiction to seize control of the President's authority to conduct foreign policy.""

TOP MS-13 LEADER ARRESTED IN VIRGINIA

Federal court filings showed Abrego Garcia had fled El Salvador to escape gang violence. Starting around 2006, gang members ""stalked, hit, and threatened to kidnap and kill him in order to coerce his parents to succumb to their increasing demands for extortion.""

He entered the United States illegally in 2011 and traveled to Maryland, where his older brother, a U.S. citizen, lived.

Around 2016, Abrego Garcia became romantically involved with a female U.S. citizen — Jennifer Vasquez Sura — and her two children, also U.S. citizens. They moved in together and the woman became pregnant with his child. Abrego Garcia worked in the construction industry to support his family, court filings say.

On March 28, 2019, Abrego Garcia went to a Home Depot in Hyattsville, Maryland, to solicit employment and was recruited by three other men. Prince George County Police Department soon arrived at the scene and detained all four men.

""At the police station, the four young men were placed into different rooms and questioned. Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was asked if he was a gang member; when he told police he was not, they said that they did not believe him and repeatedly demanded that he provide information about other gang members,"" court documents state. ""The police told Plaintiff Abrego Garcia that he would be released if he cooperated, but he repeatedly explained that he did not have any information to give because he did not know anything.""

A judge later granted his release, and Abrego Garcia married his now-wife in 2019. He did, however, miss the birth of his child while in federal custody, the federal complaint says. 

Abrego Garcia was arrested in Baltimore on March 12 after he worked a shift as a sheet metal apprentice in Baltimore and picked up his now-5-year-old son, who has autism and other disabilities, from his grandmother's house, the complaint says.

Panelists Christina Pascucci and Cata Truss discuss the White House defending their aggressive deportation agenda to reporters on ‘Fox News @ Night.'

The Trump administration was handed another win on Thursday after a federal judge ruled that everyone in the U.S. illegally must register with the federal government and carry documentation.

The Associated Press reported that Judge Trevor Neil McFadden, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, sided with the administration after arguing it was enforcing an existing requirement for everyone in the country who is not a citizen of the U.S.

Rather than rule on the substance of the Trump administration's arguments, McFadden ruled that the group pushing to stop the requirement did not have standing to pursue their claims.

McFadden's ruling will go into effect Friday.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Thursday that the deadline to register for anyone who has been in the country for 30 days or more is Friday, adding that the registration requirement will be enforced to the fullest.

""President Trump and I have a clear message for those in our country illegally: leave now. If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream,"" DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in the statement. ""The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws — we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce. We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.""

The DHS began warning illegal immigrants in February that they should leave the country or face serious consequences.

The secretary said DHS will enforce the Immigration and Nationality Act, which was enacted in 1952 and created several tools to track illegal aliens and compel them to voluntarily leave the U.S.

DHS said the tools include criminal penalties for migrants who choose not to leave the U.S., fail to register with the federal government and get fingerprinted, and fail to notify the federal government of changes to their address.

Illegal immigrants who fail to depart the U.S. will be charged with a crime resulting in a ""significant penalty,"" DHS said.

But migrants who fail to register with the federal government could be fined, imprisoned or both.

Registration is mandatory for anyone 14 and older without legal status. Anyone registering will be required to provide their fingerprints and address.

Canadians are also required to go through the registration process if they have been in the U.S. for more than 30 days – this includes ""snowbirds,"" who spend winter months in warmer areas like Florida.

While it has long been required for people who live in the U.S. and are not American citizens, the requirement has only been enforced in rare circumstances.

For instance, the requirement was enforced in a limited way after Sept. 11, 2001, when the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System required noncitizen males 16 and older from 25 countries – all but one of them Arab or Muslim – to register with the U.S. government.

Even though the program did not lead to terrorism convictions, it pulled over 13,000 people into deportation proceedings. The program was suspended in 2011 and dissolved in 2016.

Interim Top Federal Prosecutor for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba addresses reports that New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy has allegedly ordered police to stop cooperating with ICE on ‘Hannity.'

President Donald Trump's longtime legal counsel and appointee as U.S. attorney for New Jersey announced Thursday she will launch a probe into Gov. Phil Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over reports that state police were asked to ignore new immigration warrants.

Alina Habba said on ""Hannity"" she decided to launch the probe following a Shore News Network report that an internal memo from New Jersey State Police (NJSP) Col. Patrick Callahan revealed Murphy and Platkin ordered that officers not pursue thousands of immigration warrants recently added to the National Crime Information Center.

The move was reportedly meant to be in line with former Attorney General Gurbir Grewal's 2018 ""Immigration Trust Directive,"" which limited the types of voluntary assistance state and local police could offer the feds.

""We know that the governor has on his website, currently, dos and don'ts for his local state of law enforcement. Those dos and don'ts instruct them not to cooperate with illegal immigrants who have administrative warrants that have been issued by the court after due process,"" Habba said.

NJ GOV SAYS HE'LL ‘FIGHT TO THE DEATH' AGAINST TRUMP ACTIONS HE DEEMS ‘CONTRARY TO VALUES'

""It is instructing them to go against our federal rules, our executive orders.""

She said her new probe into Murphy and Platkin should be a warning to all other state leaders that if they hinder the FBI, DEA or other federal law enforcement agencies, they will be held accountable.

""[W]e are to take all criminal, violent criminals and criminals out of this country and to completely enforce federal law. And anybody who does get in the way of what we are doing - which is not political, it is simply against crime - will be charged in the state of New Jersey for obstruction, for concealment, and I will come after them hard.""

Habba, whose office is based in Newark, said she met with state law enforcement on Thursday and noted they do not have the same authority as federal officers, but they can still legally notify U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hand off or alert them to immigration-related investigations.

""If anybody wants to use politics or their position to go and violate any federal law or any executive order in this state, and that includes sanctuary cities, and I'm looking at you in Paterson - I will be investigating you, and if you did commit a crime, if you ordered obstruction, if you are ordering concealment and harboring, you will be charged.""

Fox News Digital reached out to Murphy, Platkin and Paterson, New Jersey, Democratic Mayor Andre Sayegh for comment.

Sayegh recently made waves politically last month, when he declared Paterson the American ""capital of Palestine."" The city has a large Muslim and Arabic population.

Murphy recently suggested he was housing a migrant at his Monmouth County home and went on to dare Trump to do something about it.

In February, he said he and New Jersey first lady Tammy Murphy were talking about ""someone in our broader universe whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to.""

""And we said, you know what? Let's have her live at our house above our garage,"" Murphy said.

""Good luck to the feds coming in to try to get her.""

Fox News Digital reached out to NJSP for more information on the memo and its actions in regard to Murphy's order.

South Korea's Constitutional Court, by unanimous decision, removed conservative-leaning Yoon Suk Yeol from office on April 4, citing his December 3 declaration of martial law. 

The election to replace Yoon has been set for June 3. An anti-American, hardcore leftist, Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party of Korea, is now the leading candidate to become the 14th president of the Republic of Korea. 

If Lee gets his way, he will almost certainly try to end South Korea's alliance with the United States and there will be nothing stopping him from opening his country to more Chinese and North Korean infiltration. He apparently believes in the reunification of Korea, so as president he will probably do all he can to merge his Republic of Korea into the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the formal name of North Korea.  

TRUMP SAYS HE HAD 'GREAT CALL' WITH SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, SUGGESTS DEAL POSSIBLE

The South Korean people as a whole do not share Lee's agenda, but there are two problems. Lee is absolutely ruthless — he threatened ""horrific mass bloodshed and chaos"" this month if the Constitutional Court freed Yoon — and his party is almost certain to rig the next election.

The next election, therefore, could be the last in Korea. 

All the national elections this decade in South Korea have been marred by fraud. Minjoo, as the Democratic Party of Korea is commonly known, almost certainly changed ballots in at least the last three national elections, starting in 2020.  

Its ""uniformly narrow"" wins in district after district in the National Assembly contests in 2020 were ""statistically improbable"" as were the results in the National Assembly election last year. The results in both 2020 and 2024 were substantially different than late polling suggested, an indication of ballot fraud. 

Also, improbable was Lee Jae-myung's impressive showing in the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to Yoon by a much closer margin than the last polls indicated.  

What is the possibility of ballot rigging now? ""There's a very high likelihood of fraud in the upcoming South Korean presidential election, say, 99%, maybe 100%,"" Grant Newsham, a South Korea analyst, told me after Yoon was removed. ""Every stage of the electoral process is susceptible to manipulation and outright fraud. The National Election Commission, the NEC, is a tainted organization and shows no signs of wanting to address vulnerabilities, much less actual evidence of fraud."" 

""The NEC after the Constitutional Court's ruling is even more powerful,"" Tara O of the East Asia Research Center pointed out in comments to me recently. ""They hate it when anyone mentions election fraud."" 

South Koreans mention fraud, with good reason. In October 2023, the South Korean National Intelligence Service tried to penetrate the country's election infrastructure and found that the NEC's system was easily compromised. The NIS found it could manipulate votes, vote counts, and electoral rolls, among other things.  

North Korea's hackers, including the notorious Lazarus Group, also have penetrated the NEC's system.

Worse, as Newsham points out, ""There's been no apparent effort to strengthen the NEC network."" There has been an almost complete failure by government officials and prosecutors to examine and fix what independent observers, such as Newsham, have observed. 

The failure to fix South Korea's faulty election infrastructure will have consequences. ""This upcoming election is Minjoo's best chance ever to get control of the main levers of power and move the Republic of Korea toward a one-party state, its long-term objective,"" says Newsham, also author of ""When China Attacks: A Warning to America."" ""Will they cheat your way to power with this last piece of the puzzle, the presidency? Of course, they'll try.""

Why should Americans care? The last leftist president, Minjoo's Moon Jae-in, tried to force Samsung and other South Korean giants to disclose technology, thereby giving China invaluable assistance. Samsung, along with Taiwan's TSMC, makes the world's most sophisticated computer chips. Its tech in the hands of Beijing, especially if Taiwan were to fall to China, would give China control of chipmaking worldwide. 

Geopolitical considerations are even more important, and China and North Korea know what's at stake. Beijing and Pyongyang have actively engaged in covert efforts to overthrow South Korea's democracy. As David Maxwell of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Asia Pacific Strategy reports, ""China's United Front Work Department has been conducting extensive covert operations in South Korea as part of Beijing's broader ‘unrestrictive warfare' strategy.""  

What is the possibility of ballot rigging now? ""There's a very high likelihood of fraud in the upcoming South Korean presidential election, say, 99%, maybe 100%,"" Grant Newsham, a South Korea analyst, told me after Yoon was removed.

Maxwell also notes that pro-North Korean elements within South Korea, including political figures, civic organizations and clandestine groups, are receiving ""covert assistance"" from North Korea's United Front Department and Reconnaissance General Bureau.

A destabilized South Korea would pose significant challenges to American security interests. As Maxwell, who served five tours of duty in the South with the U.S. Army, points out, ""For North Korea and China, undermining the South Korean government is a means to fracture the Republic of Korea-United States alliance, dismantle the U.S. nuclear umbrella, and ultimately drive Americans forces out of the Korean peninsula and mainland Asia."" 

Newsham worries about something that now seems inconceivable but is in fact entirely possible. ""South Korea,"" he says, ""could become the next Venezuela.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","How's Apple going to get out of its China jam?","https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tim-cook-donald-trump-tariffs-negotiation-iphone-prices-2024-04","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 09:01:00 GMT","

The tariffs are paused, except the ones that aren't. Which includes a whopping 145% for products shipped from China.

What does that mean for Apple?

Yes, lots of giant tech companies have deep ties to China, from Amazon to Meta to Tesla. But Apple is fully enmeshed in China, where it has spent years building up the supply chain for its iPhones, which are the company's core business.

If those tariffs stay in place, that could jack up the price of an iPhone by hundreds of dollars. Maybe more.

So now what?

Spoiler: No one seems to know. (An Apple rep declined to comment; I haven't heard back from the White House.) But if you're an Apple optimist, you're probably wishing for one, or both, of these plans.

After President Donald Trump's first election win, in 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook basically wrote the playbook for business leaders hoping to stay afloat in Trumpland. He frequently engaged with Trump privately, never criticized him publicly, and was willing to play along when Trump wanted to use Apple as a symbol of Big American Companies That Are Coming Back to America.

That included keeping mum when the president falsely claimed during his reign that Apple had opened a MacBook plant in Texas (the plant had opened years before, during the Obama administration).

And that work paid off when Apple got exemptions from the China tariffs Trump enacted during his first term.

Now Apple bulls are hopeful Cook will find a way to wriggle out again. They're especially buoyed by Trump's comments on Wednesday suggesting he'll give certain companies some kind of tariff relief.

""Some companies, through no fault of their own, they happen to be in an industry that is more affected by these things than others,"" Trump said. ""You have to be able to show a little flexibility, and I'm able to do that.""

On the one hand, it would seem much harder for Trump to give Apple a pass this time around, since his administration has consistently talked about getting Apple to build iPhones in the US. Exempting Apple from some or all of his tariffs makes that even less likely.

On the other hand, Trump is consistently inconsistent. For instance, while it's engaging with China in a trade war and talking about the need for the US to stay ahead of China in the AI arms race, Trump's administration has reportedly given Nvidia its blessing to sell its top-of-the-line chips to China. Before that, Trump was reportedly set to halt those sales.

Maybe Cook persuades Trump to give Apple a pass, or a partial pass. But in the meantime, Cook has been trying to give himself as much flexibility as possible, by reportedly shipping planeloads of iPhones — perhaps as many as 1.5 million units — from China and India to the US in advance of new tariffs. That would give him the ability to keep selling the current versions of iPhones at the same price, at the same profit margin, at least for a while.

But then what? Apple usually unveils, and starts shipping, new iPhone models in the fall. It's almost impossible to imagine those getting made anywhere but China, no matter how hard Apple scrambles to find extra production capacity in lower-tariff countries, like Vietnam or India. And those 1.5 million older model phones wouldn't satisfy demand for a company that sells a reported 220 million phones a year around the world.

And … that's kind of it, as far as options go. Note that there's no real consideration of Apple building up a brand-new supply chain infrastructure that's fully separate from China — certainly not in the short run to midterm.

Meanwhile, even if you don't own an iPhone and/or never plan on buying a new one again, Apple's iPhone dilemma is probably still your dilemma. Even if you don't own Apple stock directly, you're almost certainly exposed to it because the $3 trillion company makes up a giant slice of the major stock indexes.

As the journalist Patrick McGee notes: ""If your retirement is invested in index funds, Apple is your single biggest investment.""

The fact that Apple's stock price dropped by only 4% on Thursday — compared with 7% drops for Meta and Tesla, and 5% for Amazon and Nvidia — suggests that investors feel reasonably confident that Cook can navigate this one. Maybe they're right. Then again, these are the same investors who were surprised by Trump's tariff rollout last week. I wouldn't feel confident about any of these outcomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","OpenAI says it could rebuild GPT-4 from scratch with just 5 to 10 people, thanks to breakthroughs from its latest model","https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-chatgpt-gpt4-rebuild-breakthroughs-sam-altman-2025-4","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 09:03:00 GMT","

Building GPT-4 took a lot of manpower. Now, OpenAI says it could rebuild GPT-4 with as few as five people, all because of what it learned from its latest model, GPT-4.5.

In a company podcast episode published Friday, OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, asked a question to three key engineers behind GPT-4.5: What's the smallest OpenAI team that could retrain GPT-4 from scratch today?

Altman said building GPT-4 took ""hundreds of people, almost all of OpenAI's effort"" — but things get much easier once a model is no longer at the frontier.

Alex Paino, who led pre-training machine learning for GPT-4.5, said retraining GPT-4 now would ""probably"" take just five to 10 people.

""We trained GPT-4o, which was a GPT-4-caliber model that we retrained using a lot of the same stuff coming out of the GPT-4.5 research program,"" Paino said. ""Doing that run itself actually took a much smaller number of people.""

Daniel Selsam, a researcher at OpenAI working on data efficiency and algorithms, agreed that rebuilding GPT-4 would now be far easier. 

""Just finding out someone else did something — it becomes immensely easier,"" he said. ""I feel like just the fact that something is possible is a huge cheat code.""

In February, OpenAI released GPT-4.5, saying it was the company's largest and most powerful model to date.

Altman described it in a post on X as ""the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person.""

Paino said GPT-4.5 is designed to be ""10x smarter"" than GPT-4, which was released in March 2023.

""We're scaling 10x beyond what we did before with these GPT pre-training runs,"" Paino said.

Altman also said OpenAI is no longer ""compute-constrained"" on the best models it can produce — a shift he thinks the world hasn't really understood yet.

For many AI companies, the biggest hurdle to building better models is simply having enough computing power.

""It is a crazy update,"" Altman said. ""For so long, we lived in a world where compute was always the limiting factor,"" he added.

Big Tech has been pouring billions into AI infrastructure. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta are expected to spend a collective $320 billion in capital expenditures this year to broaden their AI capabilities.

OpenAI announced in March that it had closed the largest private tech funding round on record, including $30 billion from SoftBank and $10 billion from other investors, bringing the company's valuation to $300 billion.

The fresh capital will help OpenAI scale its computing power even further, the company said in a statement at the time.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on an earnings call in February that demand for AI compute will only grow.

""Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning can consume much more compute,"" Huang said on the call.

As for what's needed to hit the next 10x or 100x jump in scale, Selsam, the OpenAI researcher, said it's data efficiency.

The GPT models are very efficient at processing information, but there's a ""ceiling to how deep of an insight it can gain from the data,"" he said.

""At some point, as the compute keeps growing and growing, the data grows much less quickly,"" he said, adding that ""the data becomes the bottleneck.""

Pushing beyond that, he said, will require ""some algorithmic innovations"" to squeeze more value from the same amount of data.

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he doesn't really need to have Elon Musk in his administration.

""Elon has done a fantastic job. Look, he's sitting here, and I don't care. I don't need Elon for anything other than I happen to like him,"" Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.

Trump said on Thursday that he had recently purchased a Tesla vehicle as a ""show of support"" for Musk.

""I don't need his car. I actually bought one, and they said, 'Oh, did you get a bargain?' No. I said, 'Give me the top price.' I paid a lot of money for that car,"" Trump said.

Trump's purchase took place during a White House event last month, where he was seen trying out a red Tesla Model S with Musk.

""He's done a fantastic job but he hasn't been treated properly,"" Trump said of Musk on Thursday.

Musk, who was at the meeting, was seen smiling and nodding to Trump's remarks.

Musk has been spearheading cost-cutting efforts at the White House DOGE office. In an attempt to slash spending, DOGE has laid off thousands of government workers and shuttered foreign aid programs. These rapid cuts have sparked fear and chaos across the government.

Musk said at the Thursday Cabinet meeting that DOGE will cut nearly $150 billion in spending for the 2026 fiscal year.

But these broad cuts at DOGE and the turmoil that comes with them have also hit Musk's business interests. Tesla showrooms nationwide have been the target of protests, and Tesla owners have said their vehicles have been defaced.

""If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?"" Musk told Tesla employees during an all-hands meeting last month.

""Listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable,"" Musk added.

Musk has been one of Trump's biggest supporters. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO spent at least $277 million supporting Trump and other GOP candidates in last year's elections.

But Musk appeared to break with the administration after Trump announced sweeping tariffs on over 180 countries last week.

Musk called for a ""free trade zone"" between Europe and the US during a meeting with Italy's League Party on Saturday. Musk also criticized Trump's top advisor, Peter Navarro, saying he was ""dumber than a sack of bricks"" after he called Musk a ""car assembler.""

Last week, Vice President JD Vance told Fox News in an interview that Musk would stay on as an advisor even after he completes his work with DOGE.

Trump said on April 3 that he expects Musk to leave his administration ""in a few months"" but said he wants Musk to stay on for ""as long as possible.""

Musk is now working for the administration as a special government employee. Per federal law, such employees cannot work for more than 130 days in a 365-day period.

""Elon Musk and President Trump have both publicly stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete,"" the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, wrote in an X post on April 2.

Musk and the White House did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

The US's defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, on Thursday ordered the termination of IT and consulting contracts with companies including Accenture and Deloitte, calling it ""wasteful spending.""

In a Department of Defense memo, Hegseth said he would cut a Defense Health Agency contract ""for consulting services from Accenture, Deloitte, Booz Allen, and other firms that can be performed by our civilian workforce.""

Also on the chopping block is the Air Force's contract with Accenture to ""re-sell third-party Enterprise Cloud IT Services,"" which Hegseth said the government could ""already fulfill directly with existing procurement resources.""

In the memo, Hegseth also said he was terminating 11 other contracts for consulting services supporting what he called ""non-essential"" activities, including diversity, equity and inclusion, climate matters, and the Pentagon's COVID-19 response.

Hegseth said the terminations ""represent $5.1 billion in wasteful spending"" at the DOD and would result in nearly $4 billion in savings.

He said the savings would be reallocated to serve ""critical priorities to Revive the Warrior Ethos, Rebuild the Military, and Reestablish Deterrence.""

He did not specify in his memo which Pentagon projects this money would go to.

In response to a request for comment, the DOD directed Business Insider to an X video of Hegseth talking about the terminations.

""By the way, we need this money to spend on better healthcare for our warfighters and their families, instead of $500 an hour business process consultant. That's a lot of consulting,"" Hegseth said in the video.

Hegseth also expressed his gratitude to Elon Musk's cost-cutting outfit, DOGE, which has been targeting federal spending across various agencies and has championed the layoffs of thousands of federal workers and the shuttering of foreign aid programs.

""So we want to thank our friends at DOGE. We want to thank all the folks here that have helped us unpack this, reveal it, and we're excited to make these cuts on behalf of you, the taxpayer and the warfighters at the Department,"" Hegseth said in his X video.

New @DOGE findings, this time it's $5.1 billion. pic.twitter.com/vHRnDHZSUS

Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, mentioned the Defense Department's $841 billion budget in an op-ed article he wrote with Vivek Ramaswamy for The Wall Street Journal in November. Ramaswamy, who was co-leader of DOGE at the time, left DOGE in January.

""The Pentagon recently failed its seventh consecutive audit, suggesting that the agency's leadership has little idea how its annual budget of more than $800 billion is spent,"" the pair wrote.

Last month, Hegseth announced that the Defense Department was terminating over $580 million in programs, contracts, and grants that DOGE had identified as wasteful spending.

Representatives for Accenture, Deloitte, and Booz Allen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from BI.

Linda McMahon may have meant artificial intelligence — but the steak sauce brand A.1. heard opportunity.

​​After the secretary of education repeatedly referred to artificial intelligence as ""A1"" on a panel this week, the brand jumped in to savor the moment.

""You heard her. Every school should have access to A.1.,"" the brand wrote in a Friday Instagram post, alongside an image of its bottle slapped with a new label: ""For education purposes only.""

A big slogan across the graphic said: ""Agree. Best to start them early.""

McMahon made the slip while speaking at the ASU+GSV Summit, a conference on the future of education and work. She was on a panel discussing the role of AI in the workforce — but things took a saucy turn.

""You know, AI development — I mean, how can we educate at the speed of light if we don't have the best technology around to do that?"" she said. The former CEO of WWE used the correct abbreviation for artificial intelligence, before pivoting into the world of condiments.

McMahon said she heard about ""a school system that's going to start making sure that first graders, or even pre-Ks, have A1 teaching in every year."" McMahon continued: ""That's a wonderful thing!""

""Kids are sponges. They just absorb everything,"" she added. ""It wasn't all that long ago that it was, 'We're going to have internet in our schools!' Now let's see A1 and how can that be helpful.""

McMahon and A.1. did not respond to requests for comment.

The brand joins others that have seized a quick moment of fame on social media.

Coffee Mate's marketing team sprang into action after the season finale of ""The White Lotus,"" creating a semiviral post that played off a key moment from the show.

The coffee creamer brand worked with the hit HBO series on two limited-edition flavors ahead of the latest season: piña colada and Thai iced coffee. An executive said his team had no idea that piña coladas would be featured on the hit show's finale on Sunday night.

""Andor"" creator and showrunner Tony Gilroy says Disney is working on a horror project within the ""Star Wars"" universe.

The showrunner briefly touched on the future of the ""Star Wars"" franchise when speaking to SFX Magazine in March ahead of the final season of ""Andor."" He joked that he'd like to see ""a three-camera sitcom in 'Star Wars' or a horror movie.""

Gilroy spoke to Business Insider on the ""Andor"" season two red carpet in London on Thursday. 

Asked what he would do with a ""Star Wars"" horror project, he said Lucasfilm and Disney already had one in development: ""They're doing that. I think they're doing that. I think that's in the works, yeah.""

Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Gilroy didn't say whether the project was a TV show or a movie.

He also clarified his previous comments: ""I'm agnostic about what should be done. I was riffing on the thing where I said, 'Oh, do a three-camera comedy,' so I was riffing. Sometimes riffing doesn't work with the 'Star Wars' community.""

Referring to ""Andor,"" Gilroy said: ""The right creator, and the right moment, and the right vibe … you can do anything. So, my hope is that the show connects, and then we can pass along the favor that we were given from 'Mandalorian,' and we can pass along a good healthy backwind to someone else who wants to do something else cool.""

The ""Andor"" series is a more serious affair than some of the other ""Star Wars"" projects of late. The political thriller focuses on the growing rebellion against the Empire in the years before 2016's ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"" as well as 1977's ""Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope.""

The first season, released in 2022, was met with widespread critical acclaim and earned a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Its success showed that the ""Star Wars"" franchise can explore wider themes and genres without relying on the Jedi, lightsabers, and the Force to keep its audience engaged.

""Andor"" season two starts streaming on Disney+ on April 22.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","We got a picture of one of the first Waymos to touch down in Japan as the robotaxi prepares to map out Tokyo","https://www.businessinsider.com/alphanet-waymo-robotaxi-tokyo-japan-expansion-behind-the-scenes-2025-4","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 00:26:00 GMT","

Waymo has arrived in Tokyo. 

The Alphabet-owned robotaxi company announced on Wednesday that its Jaguar I-PACE vehicles will begin mapping out seven central wards of Tokyo — Minato, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Chiyoda, Chūō, Shinagawa — which represent some of the city's major commercial hubs.

The cars, however, won't be driverless yet.

Nihon Kotsu and GO, two of Japan's largest taxi platforms, will manage the fleet and manually drive the vehicles. This will help the Waymo cars gather data and learn the country's unique driving patterns, such as left-hand traffic.

""Initially, the Nihon Kotsu drivers will manually drive the car, just like you or I would with our hands on the wheel and no autonomous driving enabled,"" Sandy Karp, a spokesperson for Waymo, told Business Insider in an email. ""Waymo will use the information from these driving missions to begin adapting and validating its autonomous driving technology for operation in Japan.""

Waymo will begin the mapping process with 25 vehicles, Karp said.

The spokesperson sent BI a photo of one of the vehicles backing out of a shipment container at an undisclosed port in Japan earlier in March. In the photo, a Nihon Kotsu crew member watches the Waymo as it pulls out of the container.

Karp said the vehicles have since been moved to a depot and are ""getting upfitted with some adjustments"" to comply with local laws and regulations, including new vehicle signage and an additional blindspot mirror attachment.

Yasuharu Wakabayashi, president of Nihon Kotsu, said in a statement that the company's drivers have trained in the US and are ""well-prepared to begin introducing Waymo's vehicles to Tokyo.""

""We anticipate that autonomous robotaxis will help address driver shortages in the future,"" he said. ""We view this initiative as the first step toward building an ideal ecosystem that unites people and advanced technology.""

Waymo's approach to a fully autonomous driver system includes mapping out a specific area with its vehicles before it can launch to the public without human supervision.

This differs from other autonomous vehicle-focused companies like Wayve or Tesla, which rely more heavily on end-to-end learning models for its self-driving software. This essentially allows the car to learn to drive in its environment on the go without the need to map out an area beforehand.

Proponents of this approach argue that end-to-end learning allows for a more efficient ability to scale. Waymo's director of product management, Vishay Nihalani, told BI at a recent autonomous vehicle conference in Los Angeles that as Waymo's driver continues to learn, the robotaxi will require less time to map out any given city. 

Waymo has also sought partnerships with third parties, including rideshare platforms, to help manage its fleets in some cities.

In Austin and Atlanta, for example, Uber manages Waymos's fleet, which includes vehicle maintenance and depot operations. In San Francisco, Waymo maintains the vehicles on its own.

According to the company, Waymo now provides more than 200,000 paid passenger weekly trips.

TikTok Ban:

ByteDance Ltd.'s revenue jumped 29% to $155 billion in 2024, after online video phenom TikTok drove a worldwide expansion that helped offset an economic downturn back home in China.

Its international sales grew a much quicker 63% to $39 billion, contributing to roughly a quarter of the topline, according to people briefed on the numbers. Net profit for the year edged up to around $33 billion, they said, asking to remain anonymous discussing private information.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Two years after Elon Musk acquired the social platform, it's fair to wonder if it's even a business at all — at least in a traditional sense. 

Illustration: Hoi Chan for Bloomberg

 Bloomberg News senior reporter Kurt Wagner covered the ins and outs of Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, now X, in his book  Battle for the Bird: Jack Dorsey, Elon Musk, and the $44 Billion Fight for Twitter's Soul  (Atria Books, 2024). But Musk and X have been busy since then. In this Next Chapter, Wagner revisits the platform's business model and how it has fared under its new owner.

On the day that Elon Musk's $44 billion bid for Twitter was first made public back in April 2022, the world's richest man sat down at the TED Conference in Vancouver and said something that, at the time, sounded a little preposterous.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma, a longstanding advocate for artificial intelligence, warned that AI shouldn't replace humans but work instead to meet their every need.

The Chinese billionaire, who once likened AI to love, argued that the technology should be tailored to serve people and make their lives better.

Too much damage has been done to return to square one.

Frankfurt port.

The bond market spoke; Donald Trump blinked. The lettuce theory of Liz Truss holds true: No leader, not even one who has shrugged off assassination attempts and a fraud trial, can remain steadfast in the face of a policy-induced meltdown that punishes voters it aims to protect. The question is: What now?

What's clear from markets is that the 90-day reprieve from worst-case tariffs on “any country, except for China” is by no means a back-to-square-one moment. The dollar's haven status has been hurt, while Bloomberg Economics still expects stagflation in the US and a hit to growth in the European Union. The US remains a place where policy uncertainty is high, where tariffs can jump by double digits in days and where social-media influencers wield power over generals. This uncertainty is what deters investment and hurts economic confidence, rather than just tariffs.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Chagee Holdings Ltd., a Chinese tea chain, is seeking to raise $411 million in an initial public offering in the US, despite spiking stock volatility from President Donald Trump's tariff measures.

The Shanghai-based company is offering 14.68 million American depositary shares for $26 to $28 each, according to a filing Thursday with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. At the top of the price range, Chagee would have a market value of about $3.3 billion based on the outstanding shares listed in the filing.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Even as China's tech stocks begin to recoup some of their recent big losses, some investors and analysts are eyeing looming concerns that may have a worse impact than Donald Trump's tariffs.

The Hang Seng Tech Index has shed more than $350 billion in market value since a March high, though it has gained more than 10% over the past four sessions. While China's rapid AI development remains a key positive, heightened geopolitical tensions are at the forefront at the moment.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Tesla Inc. stopped taking orders in China for Model S sedans and Model X sport utility vehicles — both of which are imported from the US — after the countries raised tariffs on one another in an escalating trade war.

The electric-car maker was offering the option to order the two models as of the end of March, according to a screenshot of its China website archived by Wayback Machine. Although that had been removed as of Friday, existing inventory of cars, such as a white Model S listed for 759,900 yuan ($103,800), is still available.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Financed using a European post-Covid recovery fund, a new rail link could be an economic boost, and a sign that the EU is getting better at spending money.

East of Naples near the town of Telese, engineers are cutting into the foothills of the southern Apennine mountains. The straight lines and white gleaming concrete of new high-speed train tunnels and overpasses contrast with the swerving roads and ancient stone walls of the nearby countryside. 

When it is completed in 2028, the high-speed rail line will run coast-to-coast between Naples and Bari in just two hours, and connect Italy's underdeveloped south with the wealthier parts of the peninsula and the rest of Europe. The Italian government hopes the new rail links will finally open up opportunities for business, education and tourism in the south. Earlier this week, Ferrovie Dello Stato, the rail company, broke through two key tunnels that will allow part of the line to come into service by the end of the year, cutting more than an hour from the travel time between Italy's Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coasts.

An erratic reversal in policy gave some short-term relief. But only legislation can impose order on this administration.

Tomorrow never knows. 

Photographer: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

After days of mayhem, it counted as a relief: On Wednesday, the White House announced a 90-day reprieve for most countries from its severe new tariff schedule. Markets briefly rallied, the administration declared victory ... and then the chaos resumed. However this experiment is resolved, one lesson bears repeating: If Congress wants to avoid similar disarray in the future, it needs to reclaim its authority over tariffs from the executive branch.

Fortunately, sense seems to be prevailing in some corners of Capitol Hill. Among other efforts, a bipartisan bill circulating in the Senate this week — with seven Republican cosponsors — would require lawmakers to approve any tariffs proposed by the president within 60 days and allow them to cancel imposed duties at any time. A similar measure in the House also has bipartisan support, though it would face procedural hurdles. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Department of Justice missed a Friday morning deadline set by a federal judge in Maryland to inform her of the Trump administration's plan for securing the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison, where he has been held since being deported.

The DOJ, in a filing, told District Court Judge Paul Xinis that her 11:30 a.m. ET deadline was ""impracticable."" 

The department noted that her order came hours after the Supreme Court upheld her prior directive that the U.S. government facilitate the return of Abrego Garica, who the DOJ has said was deported due to an administrative error.

But the Supreme Court in its decision Thursday night had said, ""For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.""

Xinis has scheduled a 1 p.m. status hearing in the case. 

The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld Xinis' original order in the case, which directed the Trump administration ""to facilitate and effectuate the return"" of Abrego Garcia. 

The Supreme Court, however, told Xinis she needed to clarify her directive's use of the word ""effectuate ... with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.""

Xinis within hours modified her order in response to the Supreme Court decision, and directed the administration to ""take all available steps to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible.""

She also told the DOJ to tell her before Friday's hearing ""the current physical location and custodial status of Abrego Garcia ... what steps, if any, Defendants have taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia's immediate return to the United States,"" and ""what additional steps Defendants will take, and when, to facilitate his return.""

President Donald Trump on Friday said five more law firms have struck agreements with his administration that involve them committing to at least $600 million total in pro bono work for causes the president supports.

The new deals follow similar moves by numerous other law firms, which came as Trump threatens to sign punitive executive orders targeting legal offices for their past or current association with his perceived enemies.

Trump on Truth Social on Friday said that four firms — Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Allen Overy Shearman Sterling US LLP, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, and Latham & Watkins LLP — have each committed to at least $125 million in free legal work, for a total of $500 million.

In a separate post, Trump announced a similar deal with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, LLP for at least $100 million.

The pro bono services will be directed toward causes that both Trump and the firms support, include assisting veterans, combating antisemitism and ensuring ""fairness in our Justice System,"" according to the posts.

All five firms also agreed not to ""engage in illegal DEI discrimination and preferences"" and commit to ""Merit-Based Hiring.""

They additionally affirm not to deny representation to clients ""because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.""

Trump's also revealed that, as a result of the agreements with Kirkland, Allen, Simpson and Latham, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has withdrawn letters it sent them on March 17 ""and will not pursue any claims related to those issues.""

In this article

Apple is once again in the crosshairs of a global trade war. This time, the stakes may be even higher.

On April 2, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on a wide range of imported goods, including those from China, India, Vietnam and other countries critical to Apple's supply chain. That move sent shockwaves through global markets, wiping out over $640 billion in Apple's market value in just five days.

""It's the most head-scratching, absurd policy move we've seen in years,"" said Dan Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities. ""Apple is in the eye of the storm.""

CNBC technology reporter Kif Leswing calls it a ""massive moment for Apple.""

""Even with all their efforts to diversify production, the company still depends on China, and now they're facing tariffs from nearly every country they manufacture in,"" Leswing said.

While the stock rebounded on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for select nations, the broader uncertainty around Apple's global manufacturing model hasn't gone away. China tariffs remain at a staggering 145%.

""No company is more impacted by this tariff Armageddon than Apple,"" Ives said.

Apple still assembles 90% of its iPhones in China, largely through its partnership with Foxconn. China also handles 80% of iPads and over half of Mac computers, according to Evercore ISI.

""Apple's been trying to get ahead of this,"" Leswing said. ""They've been making iPhones in India, assembling Macs in Malaysia, sourcing from Vietnam, but those countries are now seeing tariffs too. That puts Apple in a really tough spot.""

India, Vietnam and Thailand were all key parts of Apple's post-COVID diversification strategy. Under Trump's new plan, imports from many of those countries face tariffs as high as 26% to 46%, although the president reduced most tariffs to 10% on Wednesday.

Still, the message from the White House is clear: Apple needs to make products in the U.S.

In theory, tariffs are meant to bring jobs and production back to the U.S. In practice, moving high-tech manufacturing out of China is neither fast nor cheap.

""If you want an iPhone made in the U.S. and you want it for $3,500, we should make it here,"" said Ives. ""If you want it for $1,000, you keep it in China.""

The iPhone 16 Pro Max currently starts at $1,199, but one UBS estimate shows that new tariffs could raise the price by $350. Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley estimates Apple may need to increase prices across the board by 17% to 18% to cover the added cost.

Apple has started building some iPhones in India and iPads in Vietnam, but the company remains heavily reliant on China's infrastructure, skilled labor force, and dense manufacturing network.

""It would take decades just to move 10% of Apple's supply chain to the U.S.,"" Ives said. ""The global supply chain is built in Asia.""

As panic rippled through the markets, Apple kept quiet. The company has declined to comment publicly on the tariffs and has offered no updated guidance to suppliers or shareholders.

That stands in contrast to 2019, when CEO Tim Cook personally lobbied the first Trump administration to exempt iPhones from a previous round of tariffs, and succeeded. This time, no carve-outs have been announced.

""It's kind of a cipher right now, what Tim Cook is cooking up in Cupertino,"" said Leswing. ""They've said very little.""

According to reporting from 9To5Mac, Apple has started modeling out different tariff scenarios and even chartered at least five planes in late March to stockpile products before tariffs took effect.

Analysts say Apple's options are limited in the short term. The company is expected to delay price hikes until its next product cycle, likely with the iPhone 17, but that could impact demand in a cooling smartphone market.

Apple already faces pressure over its slow rollout of artificial intelligence features and stagnating hardware innovation. If the tariffs remain in place, or escalate further, the ripple effects could be massive.

""This could throw the U.S. into a self-inflicted recession,"" Ives said.

So far, investors are watching closely for signs of a shift in strategy or a more forceful response from Apple leadership.

""Apple is the poster child for the trade war,"" said Leswing. ""And right now, they're not saying much at all.""

Watch the video to understand how tariffs are shaking Apple's supply chain and what it could mean for your next iPhone.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Friday that he thinks the U.S. economy has weakened to the point of growth possibly turning negative.

""I think we're very close, if not in, a recession now,"" Fink said on ""Squawk on the Street.""

Fears of an economic slowdown have risen sharply since President Donald Trump unveiled widespread tariffs last week, sparking a sell-off in the stock market. Trump on Wednesday announced that he was pausing some of those import levies for 90 days, but that move has not been enough to restore confidence in the economy, Fink said.

""I think you're going to see, across the board, just a slowdown until there's more certainty. And we now have a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs — that means longer, more elevated uncertainty,"" Fink said Friday.

Surveys of consumers and business leaders have shown weakening sentiment in recent months. However, other pieces of economic data like job growth and retail sales have held up better. Fink said consumers may have been stocking up on goods ahead of the threatened tariffs, which could be masking some underlying economic weakness.

Despite his concerns, Fink said he did not think the U.S. was in a financial crisis and he expects ""megatrends"" in the economy like artificial intelligence would persist.

At an event for the Economic Club of New York on Monday, Fink said that other CEOs also think the U.S. is ""probably in a recession.""

Fink's latest remarks come after BlackRock announced its first-quarter financial results. In a press release Friday morning, the CEO commented that ""uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations.""

The asset management giant's financial results were mixed. BlackRock reported $11.30 in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter, above the $10.14 expected by Wall Street analysts, according to LSEG. However, $5.28 billion in revenue was short of the $5.34 billion consensus estimate.

On the assets front, BlackRock reported $84 billion in net inflows during the quarter and ended March with nearly $11.58 trillion under management.

Shares of the firm were up less than 1% in morning trading.

President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. could have wide-ranging consequences for drugmakers and American patients, some experts told CNBC. 

The duties could disrupt the complex pharmaceutical supply chain, drive up the prices of drugs in the U.S. and exacerbate shortages of critical medicines, some health policy experts said. Drugmakers often rely on a global network of manufacturing sites for different steps of the production process. 

""We are already in a state where prescription drugs are unaffordable to many,"" Mariana Socal, a health policy professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, told CNBC. 

""Anything that we change, any trade policies, any tariff policies, anything that further increases the cost of prescription drugs, be it in the supply chain, the distribution network, risks increasing costs to the consumer even further and just worsening the affordability crisis for drugs in America that we've had for a long time,"" she said. 

Trump this week doubled down on plans to impose ""major"" pharmaceutical-specific tariffs ""very shortly,"" which battered the stocks of some drugmakers early Wednesday. He said he would pause steep tariff rates on dozens of countries following a market fallout that same day, but it does not appear to apply to levies on specific industries like autos, steel, aluminum and pharmaceuticals. 

Trump exempted pharmaceuticals from his sweeping tariffs unveiled last week. Still, he has said duties on drugs will encourage drugmakers to move manufacturing operations into the U.S. at a time when domestic production in the industry has shrunk significantly.

But experts said it's unclear whether tariffs will influence more companies to make more drugs in the U.S. It would cost drugmakers billions of dollars and take at least several years for them to do so, they added. 

Some drugmakers, such as Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie, may be better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note last week. The majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added. 

Meanwhile, Novartis and Roche ""look more at risk"" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.

The impact of tariffs will look different depending on the type of drug, experts said. Manufacturers of already cheaper generic drugs, which account for about 90% of the medicines prescribed in the U.S., could get squeezed the most by tariffs, according to Arda Ural, EY Americas Life Sciences Leader. 

Those medications, which are generally much more affordable for patients, have far lower profit margins than branded drugs and often rely on ingredients made in China and India, so tariffs could force some generic drugmakers to leave the U.S. market altogether. 

Pharmaceutical tariffs could ultimately undermine the government's efforts to rein in the high costs of health care in the U.S. Americans pay around two to three times more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries, according to a 2024 report from RAND. 

The tariffs could worsen the unprecedented shortfall of medicine in the U.S., which is driven by factors such as manufacturing quality control and demand surges. There are 270 active drug shortages in the U.S., which has remained unchanged for the past three quarters, according to data from the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.

But some drug categories will likely be more vulnerable to shortages than others if tariffs go into effect, said Marta Wosińska, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center on Health Policy.

Generic sterile injectable drugs, which are commonly used in hospitals, are already more prone to shortages and have faced persistent supply issues for years. Those include products like IV saline bags, cancer chemotherapy drugs and lidocaine, which is used to numb pain.

Generic sterile injectables have complex manufacturing processes and low profit margins, which could make it more difficult for their producers to absorb tariff-induced cost increases. 

Manufacturers of those injections also have limited ability to pass on cost increases due to certain contracts with so-called group purchasing organizations that lock in the prices but not the quantity of what they buy, Wosińska said. Group purchasing organizations broker drug acquisitions for hospitals and other health-care providers, and their contracts with manufacturers generally last one-to-three years.

If manufacturers of generic sterile injectables can't pass on higher costs, they may exit the U.S. market and worsen shortages of those essential drugs, said Wosińska. She said their other option is cutting costs, which is ""concerning"" because it could affect a product's quality and lead some manufacturers to temporarily slow down production due to issues like contamination. 

Generic oral drugs similarly face low margins, but their manufacturing is less complex and the market is more competitive. These include common pills such as statins for high cholesterol, multiple blood pressure medications and metformin for blood sugar control. 

Those oral drugs are used the most by Americans, as about 187 billion generic drug tablets and capsules were dispensed in retail and mail pharmacies in 2024 alone, according to a recent Brookings report by Wosińska.

She told CNBC that those drugs function more like a ""spot market,"" where pharmacies and buyers can quickly switch suppliers if one source is disrupted by tariffs. While levies may drive up prices, manufacturers of these drugs have fewer binding contracts, allowing them to pass on higher costs more easily than their injectable counterparts can, according to Wosińska.

The impact of tariffs on costly branded medications, which have patent protections and don't face competition from generic drugs, will look a lot different, some experts said. Tariffs on medications imported from Europe would likely hit the hardest, as a significant amount of branded drug manufacturing is done there and in the U.S. 

""Branded products are already predominantly manufactured in the U.S. at about 50%, and the primary importation is from Europe at about 35%,"" said EY's Ural. 

There is ""little to no manufacturing"" of those drugs in China or India, he said. 

Still, branded drugs typically have higher profit margins and more stable supply chains than generic medications. That makes branded manufacturers better positioned to absorb higher costs from tariffs or pass them onto payers – and ultimately, consumers. 

Since manufacturers of a given branded drug monopolize its market, they could raise its price, leaving ""the American consumer with no other choice because those products are protected by patents that no one else has,"" Johns Hopkins' Socal noted.

""With tariffs, the question will become, how much higher prices are we going to pay for these branded products?"" she said.

Patients will likely notice higher prices for branded drugs more than increases to generic medication prices, Wosińska said. A price hike on a branded drug would directly translate to higher out-of-pocket spending for people in high-deductible commercial insurance plans or with high coinsurance rates, she noted. 

It's still unclear what Trump's tariffs will look like. But a patient with a 20% coinsurance rate could see their monthly out-of-pocket expenses rise if tariffs are imposed, since their share of the cost is directly tied to the branded drug's price.

By contrast, generic medications already have lower price points, so ""even if a $3 drug increases by 25%, that is not going to be something that will really show up for patients,"" Wosińska told CNBC. She added that many patients have insurance plans with fixed co-pays for those drugs. 

But overall, ""the primary impact on patient pocketbooks would be indirect—premiums would likely rise as the payer spending on drugs increases,"" she noted in her Brookings report. 

The question is whether manufacturers will want to raise prices as they face fierce blowback from patients and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for charging higher drug prices in the U.S. compared to other countries. Both the Trump and Biden administrations have targeted that imbalance. 

In a March 28 note, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said he heard from multiple CEOs of pharmaceuticals that ""they may have to pass on some of the impact [from tariffs] as a price increase.""

But he said doing so will ""add more fire"" to criticism of the higher prices of many drugs in the U.S. relative to Europe. Raffat said it could backfire ""in a big way,"" and could revive a plan from Trump's first term that ties U.S. prices to those paid in other similar countries. 

Some Wall Street analysts have raised concerns that it will be difficult to reshore production in the U.S. because it is costly and could take several years. 

""Global supply chains are complex, with Pharma among the most–it's not as simple as moving where someone screws in little screws to make an iPhone,"" BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said in a note on Wednesday. 

He said the tariffs will ""likely do little to shift manufacturing"" back to the U.S. since companies already have robust operations in the country. Seigerman said he expects most large pharmaceutical companies will likely set a goal of ""waiting until the end of Trump's presidency to consider more permanent manufacturing decisions.""

Some companies have already invested billions to boost U.S. manufacturing. This year, Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson both announced new domestic manufacturing investments worth $27 billion and $55 billion, respectively, over several years. 

But some of those drumakers have already pushed back on tariffs, warning about their potential impact on research and development in the industry. 

""We can't breach those agreements, so we have to eat the cost of the tariffs and make trade-offs within our own companies,"" Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told BBC in an interview last week. ""Typically, that will be in reduction of staff or research and development, and I predict R&D will come first. That's a disappointing outcome.""

When President Barack Obama asked the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs about making an iPhone in the U.S., Jobs didn't mince words. 

""Those jobs aren't coming back,"" Jobs said at a dinner with Obama in 2011.

The president of the U.S. and the CEO of Apple have changed, but the ambition of a ""Made in the USA"" iPhone remains. 

Defending its ""reciprocal tariffs,"" the White House this week said President Donald Trump believes the U.S. has the workforce and the resources to build iPhones in the U.S. Apple CEO Tim Cook nor anybody else at the tech company has come out to back that claim, but analysts who follow Apple say the idea of an American-made iPhone is impossible at worst and highly expensive at best. 

As it's largely a theoretical exercise, there's a broad range of guesses as to how much an all-American iPhone might cost.

Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan said in a Thursday note that the iPhone 16 Pro, which is currently priced at $1,199, could increase 25% based on labor costs alone. That would make it a roughly $1,500 device.

Wedbush's Dan Ives pegged $3,500 as the U.S. iPhone's price shortly after last week's tariff announcement, estimating that Apple would need to spend $30 billion over three years to move 10% of its supply chain to the U.S.

At the moment, Apple makes more than 80% of its products in China. Those products now receive a 145% tax when they're imported into the U.S. after Trump's tariffs went into effect this week.

Experts say that a ""Made in the USA"" iPhone would face serious challenges, ranging from finding and paying a U.S. workforce to tariff costs that Apple would incur importing parts to the U.S. for final assembly.

There's broad agreement among analysts and industry watchers that it's not likely to happen. Wall Street has doubted for years that Apple would do an American iPhone. ""I don't think that's a thing,"" Needham's Laura Martin quipped on CNBC this week.

""It's just not a reality that on the time frame of imposing tariffs that this is going to shift manufacturing here. It's pie in the sky,"" said Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research.

Apple designs its products in California, but they are made by contract manufacturers, such as Foxconn, the company's top supplier. 

Even if Apple spent heavily to get Foxconn or another partner to agree to build some iPhones in the U.S, it would take years to construct the plants and install the machinery, and there's no guarantee that U.S. trade policy might not change yet again in a way to make the factory less useful.

The biggest issue with Uncle Sam's iPhone is that the U.S. doesn't have the same workforce as China – though the massive number of workers needed to build iPhones is one of the attractions for the Trump administration.

""The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CBS on Sunday.

Foxconn builds iPhones and other Apple products in massive campuses that include dorms and shuttles. Workers often travel from nearby regions to work at the plant for short periods, and employment surges seasonally in the summer before new iPhones come out in the fall. The well-oiled system helps Apple pump out more than 200 million iPhones per year. 

Additionally, Foxconn over the years has come under scrutiny for worker conditions many times, including in 2011 when the company installed nets around some of its buildings after a rash of worker suicides. Oversight groups have said that Foxconn's work is grueling and that workers are pressured into working overtime.

Despite working conditions, Foxconn hired 50,000 additional workers at its biggest factory in Henan to build enough iPhones ahead of the latest models' September launch, Chinese media reported last fall.

But Chinese workers get paid far less than American workers. The hourly wage during the iPhone 16 surge was 26 yuan, or $3.63, with a signing bonus of 7,500 yuan, or about $1,000, according to the South China Morning Post. For comparison, the minimum wage in California is $16.50 per hour. 

Bank of America Securities' Mohan estimated on Thursday that the labor cost for assembling and testing an iPhone in the U.S. would come in at $200 per iPhone, up from $40 in China.

Apple CEO Cook has also said that another issue is that American workers don't have the right skills. In a 2017 interview, Cook said there aren't enough tooling engineers in the U.S. Those engineers work on and configure the machines that take the sophisticated designs from Apple, which come in the form of computer files, and transform them into physical objects.

""The reason is because of the quantity of skill in one location, and the type of skill it is,"" Cook said when asked at a conference why Apple does so much production in China.

A meeting of tooling engineers in China could fill ""multiple football fields,"" but in the U.S., it would be hard to fill one, Cook said. 

The most recent effort to have Foxconn move significant production to the U.S. was a failure.

Trump announced a $10 billion investment from Foxconn to build plants in Wisconsin in 2017. Apple was never officially attached to Foxconn's Wisconsin location, but that didn't stop Trump from claiming Apple would build three ""big beautiful plants"" in the U.S.

Foxconn changed plans several times for what the Wisconsin plant would produce, but it eventually settled on making face masks during the pandemic – nothing electronics related. The Foxconn Wisconsin plant was pitched as delivering 13,000 jobs, but it only created 1,454 jobs. 

During the pandemic, plans for the plant were abandoned, and most of the facility remains unbuilt. 

Apple worked with Foxconn in 2011 to expand iPhone production to Brazil to avoid large import duties in that country. The plant is still operational today, and will produce iPhone 16 models to help Apple get around U.S. tariffs, according to recent Brazilian media reports.

But even after the $12 billion factory was operational, most components were still imported from Asia, and in 2015, four years after the plant was announced, the iPhones made in Brazil retailed for twice the price of iPhones made in China, according to Reuters.

However, recent efforts by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Apple's main chip manufacturer, have been successful. TSMC now makes small quantities of cutting-edge chips at a new factory in Arizona, and Apple's a committed customer.

Even if iPhones could be assembled in America, much of what goes into an iPhone comes from countries around the world, all of which have received tariffs.

The vast majority of parts in an iPhone are made in Asia. The processor is manufactured by TSMC in Taiwan, the display is produced by South Korean companies like LG or Samsung, and the majority of the other components are made in China.

Apple would face tariffs on most of those parts, according to Mohan of Bank of America Securities, unless it could secure waivers for individual parts. Semiconductors, which are among the most valuable parts inside an iPhone, are exempt from tariffs at the moment.  

Trump on Wednesday put a 90-day pause on most of his tariffs, but if the pause comes to an end, a Yankee-made iPhone 16 Pro Max could increase in price by 91% thanks to tariffs and increased labor costs, Mohan wrote.

""While it may be possible to move final assembly to the U.S., moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be a much bigger undertaking and would likely take many years, if even possible,"" Mohan wrote.

Though Jobs shut down the idea of an America iPhone flat out with Obama, Cook hasn't taken the same unvarnished approach. 

Instead, Cook has led Apple's strategy to engage with Trump, including attending his inauguration in January. Apple also announced that it will spend $500 billion within the U.S., including on some AI server production in Houston. Trump regularly cites the investment with approval.

During the first Trump administration, Cook's strategy worked. 

Although Trump talked about stars-and-stripes iPhones and Apple building plants in the U.S., the tech company was able to secure temporary exemptions for many of its products made in China. That meant Apple didn't have to pay tariffs on important devices like the iPhone.

The charm offensive during Trump's first term culminated in the fall of 2019 when Apple extended its commitment to assembling the $3,000 Mac Pro in a Flex factory outside Austin, Texas. Trump toured the factory with Cook. 

Before Apple commits to a red, white and blue iPhone, it may produce some lower-volume products or accessories in the U.S. to charm Trump, Wall Street analysts say. 

""Given we now know that the Trump administration is willing to negotiate, we wouldn't be surprised to see Apple commit to some small-volume production in the US (HomePod? AirTags?), similar to its September 2019 commitment to manufacture the new Mac Pro in Austin, TX, to try and win an exemption,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a Thursday note.   

Apple declined to comment.

In this article

Tesla has suspended taking new orders for Model S and Model X vehicles on its Chinese website, Reuters checks showed on Friday, as the world's two largest economies exchange blows in a trade war.

Both models are made in the U.S. and imported to China. New orders for the two models were also no longer available on the automaker's WeChat mini programme account in China.

Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While the company did not give a reason for the move, it comes as China and the U.S. have been locked in an escalating trade war. China on Friday raised its tariffs on U.S. imports to 125% on Friday after President Donald Trump's decision to hike duties on Chinese goods to 145%.

Higher U.S. tariffs significantly increase the retail cost for Chinese consumers, making these cars more expensive than locally produced EVs.

The Austin, Texas-based company is least affected by Trump's tariffs among automakers due to its largely domestic manufacturing for sales in the U.S.

The U.S. automaker makes Model 3 and Model Y cars at its plant in Shanghai for sale in the country and exports to markets such as Europe, making up the vast majority of its sales.

China imported 1,553 Model X cars and 311 Model S cars in 2024, said Li Yanwei, an analyst with the China Auto Dealers Association.

The two models accounted for less than 0.5% of Tesla's deliveries of more than 657,000 vehicles last year.

Increasing competition from BYD 002594.SZ and other local manufacturers has also hit sales of Tesla's vehicles in China.

Deliveries of the category that includes Tesla's premium sedan and SUV models and the Cybertruck were down 25% in the first quarter globally, largely due to the lack of upgrades to the vehicles and backlash against CEO Elon Musk's politics.

The average Major League Baseball team is worth $2.62 billion, according to CNBC's official MLB valuations.  

The New York Yankees, worth $8 billion, are MLB's most valuable team, according to CNBC's valuations. Among all North American sports franchises, the Yankees rank behind only the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys, worth $11 billion, and the National Basketball Association's Golden State Warriors, worth $9.4 billion, according to CNBC's valuations. The NFL's Los Angeles Rams are also valued at $8 billion, according to CNBC's calculations. 

After adjusting for revenue sharing, the Yankees posted an MLB-high $705 million in revenue during the 2024 season, according to CNBC's calculations.

The Los Angeles Dodgers, worth $5.8 billion, are the second-most-valuable baseball team. The Dodgers, the reigning World Series champions, generated $701 million in revenue during the 2024 season, according to CNBC's calculations, even after, according to industry sources, the team paid more than $120 million in revenue sharing. The Dodgers were also the only other team besides the Yankees to generate more than $600 million in revenue during the 2024 season, according to CNBC's calculations.  

The average MLB team has an enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 6.4, versus 10.1 for the NFL, 11.9 for the NBA and 8.6 for the National Hockey League, according to CNBC's calculations. 

The multiple is lower for baseball because MLB teams have been changing hands at lower revenue multiples than other U.S. leagues. The last MLB team that sold was the Baltimore Orioles, which in 2024 went for $1.73 billion, or just 5.3 times revenue, according to people familiar with the deal who declined to be identified discussing the terms.

In 2023, the NFL's Washington Commanders were sold for $6.05 billion, or 11.1 times revenue, according to CNBC's calculations. The most recent NBA team to change hands was the Dallas Mavericks, which in 2023 went for $3.33 billion, or 8.9 times revenue, according to CNBC's calculations.  

MLB has been facing revenue headwinds from the decline of the regional sports network model and concerns about national TV rights, particularly since February, when ESPN announced it would opt out of its agreement with MLB after this season. A lack of a salary cap in the league has also hurt the bottom line. The NBA, NFL and NHL, all of which have salary caps, boast margins for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of about 20%. In contrast, MLB, which does not have a salary cap, has an EBITDA margin of 5%, according to CNBC's calculations. 

The case can be made that baseball is a value play. Overall revenue is still growing, according to the MLB. During the 2024 season, the sport's revenue hit a record $12.1 billion — $500 million more than the previous season — as attendance, ticket sales and sponsorship revenue all reached record highs.  

International prospects are also bright. The two-game series played in Japan in March between the Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs to start the 2025 regular season was a major success. MLB revenue could grow around 3% in 2025, according to industry sources.  

""Local media headwinds are undeniable,"" said Steve Greenberg, a managing director at Allen & Company who focuses on the sports and media industries. ""That said, I feel that MLB has been undervalued versus other leagues and may be poised to close the gap.""

Here is CNBC's methodology for ranking the MLB teams.

China and the European Union are unlikely to become close allies quickly, analysts say, even as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs sour relations between the world's largest economy and both its transatlantic allies and Beijing.

""I don't see the EU and China uniting against the US,"" Max Bergmann, director of the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) said.

On a geopolitical level, the two powers might be open to more engagement, but economic clashes and existing issues related to trade and competition are a major hurdle, he explained.

""The potential for EU and China economic alignment is limited as both are export-driven economies and are therefore fierce competitors, especially in the automotive and clean tech sectors,"" Bergmann noted.

""I think there will be interest on both sides but deep practical constraints for both. Unless China is willing to make some big concessions, I struggle to see the EU uniting behind a strategy of deeper engagement.""

The EU and China have a fractious relationship. While China is one of the EU's biggest trading partners besides the U.S., economic relations between the two have also historically been characterized by investigations and tit-for-tat measures linked to trade.

The EU has long alleged that Beijing subsidizes key sectors such as electric vehicles, batteries and steel and aluminum in a way that is harmful to global markets and competitiveness. Last year, the EU hit China with tariffs on electric vehicles, as a result.

In what were deemed retaliatory moves, Beijing then launched anti-dumping probes into EU exports of pork and brandy, as well as an anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy products.

And it is not only trade that is causing tensions in the EU-China relationship, Carsten Nickel, managing director at Teneo, told CNBC.

He added that there are ""fundamental differences"" between the two ""regardless of what is going on with the U.S.""

""That has to do with unresolved questions around overcapacity in China. It has to do with ongoing misgivings in the European Parliament, especially regarding the human rights situation, and it has to do with concerns over China's support for for Russia and Ukraine,"" he explained.

Ian Bremmer, founder and president of the Eurasia group, also pointed out that there is a ""deep"" European mistrust toward China in areas like intellectual property and technological surveillance, as well as industrial policy.

This ""doesn't go away with the United States becoming an adversary,"" he told CNBC.

China could nevertheless try and use the opportunity of loosening U.S.-EU ties to try and forge a closer bond with the EU, analysts suggest.

""China especially will see an opportunity to break up the transatlantic alliance and pull Europe closer,"" CSIS' Bergmann said.

On the flipside, some Europeans may be imagining ""hedging between the US and China and maybe getting China to reduce its support for the Russian defense industry and opening up economically,"" he added.

China and the EU appear to have been drawn closer recently.

Just on Thursday, it was reported that the two were planning to look into setting minimum prices for Chinese-made electric vehicles in place of the EU's tariffs. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, and called for a more balanced relationship afterward. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also visited Europe earlier this year, advocating for closer ties and deeper cooperation.

Earlier this week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Chinese Premier Li Qiang spoke on the phone — although the EU chief ""emphasised China's critical role in addressing possible trade diversion caused by tariffs"" and urged Beijing to work towards a negotiated solution to the issues caused by tariffs, a readout from the European Commission suggested.

The language used around the call from the European side appeared ""softer"" than in the past, Teneo's Nickel noted.

Ultimately though, Nickel says, ""the focus is on managing this very challenging situation for the global economy.""

""I think it's pretty clear that that that doesn't that that doesn't mean that the the the underlying challenges in the European relationship with China are gone overnight,"" he added.

The U.S.' tariff action could even make things more difficult between China and the EU, Nickel suggested, as they could could worsen existing issues such, as Chinese export overcapacity.

Eurasia Group's Emre Peker and Mujtaba Rahman echoed this idea in a Thursday note.

""Trade diversions as the US-China tariff fight escalates will prompt the European Commission to swiftly deploy safeguard measures to prevent China—and other countries—from dumping their goods on the EU market,"" they said.

Separately, ""Trump tariffs will force Brussels to toughen its trade stance against Beijing beyond the current efforts to counter economic imbalances with China that threaten European industries,"" the Eurasia Group analysts said.

At the same time, European policymakers will use ""softer rhetoric"" towards China to avoid triggering a trade war on two fronts. ""But this is highly unlikely to translate into Brussels-Beijing cooperation against Washington,"" they concluded.

Major League Baseball is increasingly drawing private equity investors as the league faces major shifts in player salaries and media rights.

Private equity has been gravitating toward professional sports, which sports-acquisitive firm Arctos Partners called ""remarkably resilient assets"" during times of economic uncertainty in a research note this week. MLB in particular is poised to attract new stakeholders with big changes on the horizon.

A potential MLB lockout is looming if the league puts forth a salary cap proposal during collective bargaining negotiations in late 2026. MLB is also navigating a dramatically changing media landscape. The result could be major changes to league finances — and renewed interest from investors.

""There hasn't been a massive private equity gold rush to invest in MLB,"" said Neil Barlow, private equity partner at Clifford Chance with a focus on sports and entertainment. ""MLB needs to get its house in order for the league to become even more competitive for investment. Institutional investors aren't going to commit and risk their capital when all it means is it's helping to fund an arms race of talent.""

MLB does not have a salary cap for its players — unlike the National Football League, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League — which has led to some of the biggest contracts in sports and major pay disparities. Team owners and the league's front office are contemplating a new economic structure, CNBC previously reported. Meanwhile, the league is also recalibrating its media rights strategy as regional sports networks continue to suffer, and ahead of the expiration of national deals in 2028.

These factors present risk, but also a lot of opportunity, said Michelle McKenna, a senior advisor in Evercore's strategic advisory practice, who has a focus on technology, entertainment and sports. In particular, the luxury taxes associated with teams overspending on players present the biggest risk, McKenna and Barlow both said.

McKenna called it a moment of ""strategic transformation"" for MLB, particularly when it comes to the decline of local media revenues and the changing distribution model. Private equity capital could ""help smooth this transition period and offer strategic assistance,"" McKenna said.

""Baseball remains a great asset with great sports content. They will figure this out and those that invest early will benefit,"" McKenna said.

MLB has been open to private equity since 2019, becoming the first league to open its gates to these investors.

Per MLB bylaws, private equity firms can own up to 15% of individual teams, which can sell up to 30% of their equity to such investors, according to Sportico.

The rest of the major U.S. leagues have followed suit, allowing private equity to take minority stakes. Most recently, the NFL began allowing these investments, setting off a frenzy among institutional investors, as the league has some of the highest viewership and most lucrative national media rights deals.

Private equity's capital and influence often goes toward expenses surrounding teams, such as stadium and hospitality improvements and digital enhancements. This frees up more room for payroll spending, too.

""It is also interesting to watch as baseball works to introduce new rules, products and in-stadium experiences to connect with a younger audience,"" said McKenna, noting private equity's expertise in a lot of those areas. ""PE investment in sports isn't your grandfather's PE. These are longer-term partners with well-honed strategic advice in addition to capital.""

According to PitchBook, 18 of MLB's 30 teams have some connection to private equity, including 10 teams that have received direct investment from firms.

Last month, Sixth Street Partners bought a stake in the San Francisco Giants, the firm's first investment in MLB. Arctos has built up a portfolio of five direct stakes in teams.

In a release, Sixth Street said its ""significant investment"" in the Giants would support the franchise ""in its pursuit to be champions on and off the field.""

Traditional U.S. assets are going haywire as U.S.-China trade tensions continue to rattle global markets, now coupled with fresh data of tumbling sentiment towards the U.S. economy and mounting inflation concerns.



The most recent University of Michigan survey, published on Friday, found that consumer sentiment fell to 50.8 from 57.0, nearing the most depressed level in three years and far below that seen during the 2020 Covid shutdowns. Year-ahead inflation expectations surged to 6.7%, up from 5% in the prior month and the highest read since 1981.



On the back of the data, investors resumed selling long-term U.S. government bonds and the greenbacks, two assets traditionally considered as safe havens. The 10-year Treasury yield soared above 4.55% during U.S. morning hours, up more than 50 basis points in just a week. Meanwhile the dollar index (DXY) sank below 100 to a three-year low. Gold, meanwhile, hit a fresh record of $3,240 per ounce.



After a wildly volatile past few sessions, U.S. stocks were trading in a far tighter range on both sides of unchanged on Friday. At press time, the Nasdaq was higher by 0.6%



Meanwhile, cryptocurrency markets were moving higher, with bitcoin (BTC) holding just above $82,000, gaining 4% over the past 24 hours. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index was up 3%, with altcoin majors Solana's SOL, Avalanche's AVAX leading with 6% gains.







While some macroeconomic analysts are fearful that the recent surge in government bond yields is threatening the future outlook of the U.S. economy, others believe investors are reading too much into short-term market swings.



""U.S. dollars and U.S. government debt, two of the market's most liquid safe haven categories, are going haywire,"" Noelle Achison, analyst and author of the Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, said in a Friday note. ""This is not the case for other safe havens, however, just those directly tied to the U.S.""



“I believe that it is much more likely that recent sharp moves in these asset classes is due to highly leveraged market participants being forced out of positions than due to fundamentals,” said billionaire investor Bill Ackmann in a post on X.



“Technical factors are driving the dramatic market moves,"" Ackman continued. ""As a result, markets have become increasingly unreliable as short-term indicators of the impact of policy changes.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","New York bill proposes legalizing Bitcoin, crypto for state payments","https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-york-bill-legalize-bitcoin-crypto-payments","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 11:56:18 GMT","

 The bill seeks to legalize cryptocurrency payments using Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, but may mandate an an additional state “service fee” for these transactions. 

A New York lawmaker has introduced legislation that would allow state agencies to accept cryptocurrency payments, signaling growing political momentum for digital asset integration in public services.

Assembly Bill A7788, introduced by Assemblyman Clyde Vanel, seeks to amend state financial law to allow New York state agencies to accept cryptocurrencies as a form of payment.

It would permit state agencies to accept payments in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH), according to the bill's text.

Source: Nysenate.gov

According to the bill, state offices could authorize crypto payments for “fines, civil penalties, rent, rates, taxes, fees, charges, revenue, financial obligations or other amounts,” as well as penalties, special assessments and interest.

Cryptocurrency legislation is becoming a focal point in New York, with Bill A7788 marking the state's second crypto-focused legislation in a little over a month.

In March, New York introduced Bill A06515, aiming to establish criminal penalties to prevent cryptocurrency fraud and protect investors from rug pulls.

Crypto-focused legislation has gathered momentum since President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20, with Trump signaling during his campaign that his administration intends to make crypto policy a national priority, as well as making the US a global hub for blockchain innovation.

If passed, the bill would mark a significant shift in how New York handles digital assets. It would allow state entities to integrate cryptocurrency into the payment infrastructure used for collecting public funds.

The proposal also includes a clause allowing the state to impose a service fee on those choosing to pay with crypto. According to the text, the state may require “a service fee not exceeding costs incurred by the state in connection with the cryptocurrency payment transaction.” This could include transaction costs or fees owed to crypto issuers.

Assembly Bill A7788 has been referred to the Assembly Committee for review and may advance to the state Senate as the next step.

New York's legislation comes shortly after the state of Illinois passed a crypto bill to fight fraud and rug pulls after the recent wave of insider schemes related to memecoins, Cointelegraph reported on April 11.

BlackRock's spot digital asset-focused funds generated net inflows for a fifth consecutive quarter, but the value of those assets tumbled by 9% as the price of Bitcoin and Ethereum slumped, the company said in its latest earnings release.

As of March 31, the world's largest asset manager held $50.3 billion worth in ETF digital assets, about $5 billion less than in the previous quarter, according to the release.

Still, among asset managers, BlackRock remained the leader in inflows with the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) and iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA) adding $2.7 billion and $548 million in inflows, respectively, during the quarter. The combined $3.1 billion represents about 3% of net flows into BlackRock's products in Q1. BlackRock currently has 463 products listed on the U.S. stock market, according to Stock Analysis.

As of Friday, BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF had nearly three times the AUM of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF, totalling $45 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. BlackRock's spot Ethereum ETF had an AUM of $1.8 billion, less than the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF's $3.46 billion footprint, although the latter is a conversion from an existing fund and has shed $4.1 billion since its ETF debut. 

Still, investors had less of an appetite for BlackRock's crypto products in the first quarter amid a largely risk-off environment. Over the past 12 months, BlackRock's crypto ETFs generated $30 billion worth of net inflows, averaging around $7.5 billion per quarter. IBIT has added about $39 billion in net inflows since its debut in January 2024. 

The price of Bitcoin fell 12% in the first quarter, representing the asset's worst performance since the second quarter of last year. Ethereum's price meanwhile collapsed 45%,its biggest plunge since Q2 2022), but BlackRock's crypto ETFs still generated inflows.

BlackRock, which first tapped Coinbase as a custodian for its crypto ETFs, recently turned to Anchorage Digital. BlackRock disclosed in filings earlier this week that it would now lean on the digital assets trust bank as an additional option for safeguarding digital assets.

When the U.S. government sanctioned the Ethereum-based crypto mixing service Tornado Cash in 2022, it ignited a debate within the crypto community that continues three years later.



Tornado enabled users to transfer crypto anonymously. The government contended that the service facilitated money laundering, prompting some of Ethereum's validators and block builders to take steps to avoid engaging with Tornado-linked transactions, which made the service slower and costlier to use.



Advocates argued that complying with the sanctions amounted to censorship — undermining a fundamental cypherpunk principle. President Donald Trump supported the cypherpunks and lifted the sanctions on Tornado Cash in March of this year, but for some Ethereum developers, the situation highlighted a flaw within the network that still exists today: Why should users depend on third-party apps to transact privately on the network?



""Publicly accessible transaction graphs allow anyone to trace the flow of funds between accounts, and balances are visible to all participants in the network, undermining financial privacy,"" crypto security researcher Pascal Caversaccio explained in a blog post on Wednesday. ""While the Ethereum network's transparency fosters trustlessness, it also opens the door to potential surveillance, targeting, and exploitation.""



Perhaps emboldened by the recent Tornado Cash developments, Ethereum developers and researchers have once again begun discussing ideas for making the Ethereum network private at its core.



""Privacy must not be an optional feature that users must consciously enable — it must be the default state of the network,"" said Caversaccio, whose post outlined his vision for a privacy-oriented Ethereum roadmap. ""Ethereum's architecture must be designed to ensure that users are private by default, not by exception.""



Caversaccio's post identified several potential interventions — some new, some old — that could, according to him, would make Ethereum more private for end-users. One idea is to encrypt Ethereum's public mempool — where transactions are sent before they're recorded permanently. Another involves making Ethereum transactions confidential through zero-knowledge cryptography, new transaction formats, and other methods.



""Today, Ethereum operates in a partial, opt-in privacy model, where users must take deliberate steps to conceal their financial activities — often at the cost of usability, accessibility, and even effectiveness,"" wrote Caversaccio. ""This paradigm must shift. Privacy-preserving technologies should be deeply integrated at the protocol level, allowing transactions, smart contracts, and network interactions to be inherently confidential.""



In response to Caversaccio's post, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin left a comment on the network's main developer forum with his own much shorter privacy-oriented Ethereum roadmap.



Buterin suggested focusing on privacy for on-chain payments, anonymizing on-chain activity within applications, making communication on the network anonymous, and privatizing on-chain reads.



To achieve all of this, Buterin listed various steps like integrating certain third-party privacy features into the core network.



One of the more substantial interventions suggested by Buterin involves moving the network towards a “one address per application” model — a departure from today's system, where a single application may employ dozens of wallets for different features. “This is a major step, and it entails significant convenience sacrifices, but IMO this is a bullet that we should bite, because this is the most practical way to remove public links between all of your activity across different applications,” Buterin wrote.



According to Buterin, if all of his suggestions are implemented, private transactions could be the default on Ethereum.



The privacy discussion comes a few weeks before Ethereum's next major upgrade, Pectra, which doesn't have a major focus on privacy. Ethereum developers are also currently planning the network's following upgrade to Fusaka. The changes to be included in that hard fork are not yet set in stone.

So far this year, Ethereum (ETH-USD) has erased the gains it made in 2024 and has been on the hardest receiving end (among major altcoins) of the crypto sell-off we've witnessed in the past month. For comparison, on a YTD basis, ETH has lost ~55%, Bitcoin (

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Vitalik Buterin unveils roadmap for Ethereum privacy","https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-unveils-roadmap-ethereum-privacy","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 14:41:23 GMT","

 Vitalik Buterin's proposed roadmap addresses privacy enhancements for wallets, decentralized finance applications and infrastructure. 

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin outlined an extensive plan to enhance the privacy of the network he helped create.

In an April 11 roadmap, Buterin argued for incorporating privacy tools into Ether (ETH) wallets and implementing privacy-enhancing norms and features in the Ethereum ecosystem and protocol. He explained that the roadmap in question is a short-term solution that requires limited changes to the base protocol along with supplemental long-term updates.

Buterin recommends adopting privacy-enhancing systems such as Railgun or Privacy Pools by existing wallets, according to the plan. When funds are sent with those wallets, he argues that users should be greeted by an option to “send from shielded balance,” which anonymizes the transaction, and should be “ideally turned on by default.” He wrote:

Buterin further recommended profound changes in how decentralized finance (DeFi) and broader decentralized applications (DApp) are implemented. He argued that those systems should be limited to “one address per application.”

The Ethereum co-founder acknowledged that this would require “significant convenience sacrifices, ” but it “is the most practical way to remove public links between all of your activity across different applications.” He also highlights that the user experience would be “very similar” to depositing funds to one chain from another in crosschain interoperability systems.

Buterin also highlighted that to enjoy the benefits of this change, developers would need to ensure that user withdrawal functions are privacy-preserving by default.

Other changes included are the implementation of fork-choice enforced inclusion lists (FOCIL) and the Ethereum improvement proposal (EIP) 7701. The latter is an improvement to Ethereum account abstraction, and the former is a censorship-resistance improvement.

EIP-7701 ensures that privacy protocols can operate without needing relays or public broadcasters. This, in turn, simplifies the development and maintenance of this kind of protocol. 

Relays, in this context, are intermediaries or nodes responsible for accepting and forwarding transactions. On the other hand, broadcasters are responsible for publishing transactions to the public blockchain.

EIP-7701 divides Ethereum transactions into phases, natively allowing third parties to step in and pay the fees in the right phase. This means there is no need for a relay to accept users' private transactions to be anonymously broadcast by a separate entity.

FOCIL, on the other hand, prevents the censorship of transactions, including privacy-preserving ones. The relevance is presumably that anonymized transactions are at a significantly higher risk of falling victim to censorship attempts.

A short-term solution to address the privacy limitations of current remote procedure call (RPC) systems used to interact with the blockchain, as proposed by Buterin, is the implementation of a trusted execution environment (TEE).

TEE is a secure area within a processor that ensures code and data loaded inside it are protected. Buterin explained that “this allows users to interact with RPC nodes while getting stronger assurances that their private data is not being collected.”

As a long-term solution, TEEs should be replaced with a private information retrieval (PIR) system. PIR is a cryptographic protocol that allows users to retrieve a specific item from a database without revealing which item was retrieved.

This would allow users to retrieve data concerning blockchain contents without the provider knowing which data is being shared. Buterin highlighted that it is superior because it provides “cryptographic guarantees.” 

The Ethereum co-founder also argued that wallets should be connected to multiple RPC servers. They should also use a separate RPC per DApp and potentially a mixnet — a privacy-enhancing technology designed to obscure metadata.

Other recommendations include the development of proof-aggregation protocols for privacy-preserving protocols. This would result in significantly lower fees for using such systems.

Buterin advocates for integrating privacy tools in wallets and proposes dApp-specific addresses to limit user activity traceability.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has outlined a streamlined roadmap to enhance Layer-1 privacy on the blockchain network.

In a blog post on April 11, Buterin introduced a framework focused on improving user confidentiality without requiring significant changes to the network's core infrastructure.

The proposal targets four distinct areas of privacy, including making on-chain payments private, partially obscuring user actions within decentralized applications, hiding read-access data from the blockchain, and anonymizing network-level communications.

Buterin stated that if these upgrades are implemented, they could usher in a new standard in which private transactions become the default.

He continued that while individual dApp activity may remain visible, the link between a user's actions across multiple platforms would be obscured.

The Ethereum co-founder concluded that this approach would offer privacy from observers and infrastructure-level threats like compromised RPC nodes.

Buterin's proposal begins with integrating privacy tools such as Railgun directly into Ethereum wallets. He argued that this would let users manage shielded balances without relying on third-party wallets, making privacy more accessible by default.

According to him:

“There should be a ‘send from shielded balance' option, ideally turned on by default. This should all be designed to feel maximally natural from a UX perspective. Users should NOT have to download a separate ‘privacy wallet.'”

He also advocated for using a separate address for each dApp. While this approach could introduce user experience trade-offs, it significantly limits activity traceability across multiple applications.

To support this, send-to-self transactions must preserve privacy by default; a design Buterin views as necessary despite the added complexity.

Expanding on this, Buterin explained that such changes align well with existing efforts in cross-chain interoperability, where users already interact with various chains through separate workflows.

He pointed out that integrating these features into in-app wallets would help standardize private interactions without major architectural shifts.

Buterin also called for technical improvements, such as using TEE-based RPC privacy as a short-term solution and planning to transition to private information retrieval (PIR) when ready.

Additional recommendations include connecting each dApp to separate RPC nodes, advancing proof aggregation protocols, and supporting privacy-enhanced keystore wallets.

In a detailed post shared this week, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin introduced a new roadmap to significantly enhance user privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. 

This offers a structured path toward robust privacy features that require minimal changes to Ethereum's Layer-1 consensus, thus promising near-term benefits without overhauling the network's core.Layer-1 Unconditional Privacy

Buterin's proposal addresses four key areas: privacy of onchain payments, anonymization of onchain activity within applications, safeguarding private reads to the chain (such as RPC calls), and network-level obfuscation. 

My own current privacy roadmap (much lighter on L1 changes, but also more limited in its consequences): Highly encourage people to read both! — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) 

Rather than waiting on long-term innovations or radical protocol shifts, Buterin presents an incremental and implementable strategy that could fundamentally change the way Ethereum users experience privacy.

Crucially, he calls for Ethereum wallets to natively integrate privacy tools such as Railgun and Privacy Pools, enabling users to maintain a “shielded balance.” 

Transactions made from this balance would be private by default, streamlining the experience so that users no longer need specialized wallets to ensure confidentiality. 

Usability, Buterin argues, should not be sacrificed for privacy. Instead, privacy should be intuitive and seamless.

To eliminate traceable links between actions taken across different decentralized applications (dApps), Buterin advocates for the use of separate addresses per application by default. 

While this requires a trade-off in convenience, he believes it is essential to breaking the visible chain of associations that currently compromise user privacy.

Complementing this is a push for privacy-preserving self-transactions and the adoption of protocol-level tools like FOCIL and EIP-7701. 

Together, these standards would allow privacy-focused applications to function without the need for public transaction relays, which will bolster resistance to censorship.The Philosophical Shift Toward Unconditional Privacy

Vitalik's latest privacy proposal echoes a growing consensus within the Ethereum ecosystem on how privacy should be unconditional, not optional. 

He supports the view recently advanced by Ethereum developer pcaversaccio, who the current “opt-in” model of privacy as fundamentally flawed.Source: ethresear.ch

He argues that the current paradigm, where users must make deliberate choices, often at the expense of convenience and usability, to shield their activity, is not sustainable.

Instead, privacy must become the default, deeply embedded into Ethereum's protocol stack. 

Transactions, smart contracts, and user interactions should be confidential by design, not by exception. The network must be structured so that privacy isn't seen as suspicious but as standard.

Buterin's roadmap aligns with this sentiment, advocating for UX-first, protocol-assisted mechanisms that make private activity indistinguishable from public ones. 

The goal is to create an Ethereum that functions as a maximally private and self-sovereign financial system, not one where privacy is a luxury or afterthought.Scaling Layer-1: How Buterin's Broader Vision for Ethereum Supports Privacy and Resilience

Vitalik Buterin's focus on privacy is just one piece of a larger architectural puzzle he's been shaping throughout the year. 

In earlier statements, he stressed that Ethereum's future depends on both Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) improvements, a hybrid approach designed to balance scalability, decentralization, and resilience.

These changes, he said, would allow Ethereum to process more transactions without undermining its decentralized nature.

He cautioned, however, against a purely L2-centric strategy. For Ethereum to remain robust, it must retain a strong and scalable base layer.

This same resilience argument underpins his recent blog post advocating for a tenfold increase in L1 gas capacity. 

🔍 Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin proposes scaling Ethereum's gas by 10x, citing benefits for security, efficiency, and censorship resistance. The move could support seamless exits and lower transaction costs. — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) 

While the network recently raised its L1 gas limit from 30 to 36 million (a 20% boost), Buterin believes further scaling is not only justified but essential. 

In this way, his push for privacy, scalability, and decentralization all converge toward a singular goal, which is an Ethereum that is secure, sovereign, and usable, not just for the technically elite, but for everyone.

Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, has revealed the latest update to its “Assets Under Consideration” list for the second quarter of 2025. 

The list includes a diverse array of altcoins that could likely shape the firm's future offerings.

In this latest iteration, Grayscale's “Assets Under Consideration” list features 40 altcoins. The update indeed marks a significant overhaul of the firm's January 2025 list, which had 39 assets. Previously, 35 assets were included in the October 2024 version.

“We're excited to share this list of assets under consideration for inclusion in future Grayscale investment products,” the blog read.

One of the most notable changes is the removal of Kaspa from the list's currencies section. Notably, this update does not include any assets in this category. 

Additionally, Grayscale has excluded Sei, Sonic, and Starknet from the smart contract platforms category. The financials sector also saw some changes, with the asset manager dropping THORChain and Injective Protocol from the list. 

The Consumer and Culture category has also seen removals of Ai16z and Virtuals Protocol. Lastly, Grayscale has eliminated Flock.io, Hyperbolic, and Worldcoin from the Utilities and Services category. This reduction hints at the firm's recalibration of what it considers to be foundational utilities in the changing crypto sector.

Meanwhile, these removals have paved the way for the addition of several assets, including VeChain. It is now incorporated into the smart contract platforms category, signaling a growing interest in the project's potential. Moreover, Plume Network was spotted in Financials and Aixbt by Virtuals in Consumer and Culture.

Previously, Grayscale's Q2 2025 Top 20 list highlighted Maple Finance, Geodnet, and Story for their strong growth potential. IP, which was previously listed under Utilities and Services, has now been moved to the Consumer and Culture category. Meanwhile, SYRUP has been added to the Financials category, and GEOD has joined Utilities and Services.

Grayscale's Q2 2025 update also introduces several assets that have yet to be classified under the Grayscale crypto sectors framework. Among these new additions are Babylon, Berachain, Monad, Movement, Lombard, Mantra, Eliza, DeepBook, and Walrus. Prime Intellect, Sentient, Space, and Time, which were featured in the last list, are also included.

“We aim to update this list as frequently as 15 days after quarter-end as the crypto ecosystem expands and the Grayscale team reviews or reevaluates additional assets. The list below is as of April 10, 2025, and is subject to change intra-quarter as some multi-asset funds reconstitute and we launch new single-asset products,” Grayscale noted.

Furthermore, two assets that previously appeared on the list, Pyth Network (PYTH) and Dogecoin (DOGE), have now joined Grayscale's product suite. On January 31, the asset manager launched the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust.

Shortly after, on February 18, Grayscale introduced its Pyth Trust. Thus, the market now watches closely to see which of the listed assets will transition from consideration to reality.

A widely followed cryptocurrency analyst is leaning bullish on Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins over the “very short-term.”

The analyst pseudonymously known as Capo tells his 950,600 followers on the social media platform X that following the decision by US President Donald Trump to pause on America's global trading partners.

Bitcoin could rally by up to 22% from the current level while altcoins could skyrocket by up to 2x over the next few days.

“After the 90-day pause on tariffs, the market is reacting well. BTC could move towards the $92,000 – $98,000 zone. Many altcoins could bounce 50% – 100%.”

Bitcoin is trading at $80,420 at time of writing.

The pseudonymous analyst, however, says that over the next few weeks, there's a “decent chance” the crypto market will witness another capitulation.

“Whether triggered by renewed tariff talk or something else (another pandemic scare, or escalating conflict), we'll need to adapt as things develop. But the probability is high.”

After another round of capitulation, Capo says that altcoins could then witness a bullish trend over the next few months.

“Some altcoins might break highs, others won't. But prices are now very oversold, and returns could be very good. Even if a black swan hits, that would only improve the accumulation zones forming since late March.”

According to the pseudonymous analyst, the Bitcoin bull market could end in the third quarter, with the bear market likely to start in September this year.

“This is where things could get really ugly. Like I've said before, this “bull market” never felt like a real bull market. BTC was pushed up artificially by [exchange-traded funds] ETFs and USDT/USDC minting. Meanwhile, many altcoins are still near their lows. This disconnect is concerning.

September might be a key pivot.”

The cryptocurrency market cap dropped 2.80% in 24 hours to $2.54 trillion following President Donald Trump‘s sweeping tariff announcement, imposing a 145% duty on Chinese imports and a 10% universal tariff on most other goods.

On Thursday, Trump signed legislation nullifying a revised Internal Revenue Service rule that had expanded the definition of “broker” to include decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.

The rule, finalized during former President Joe Biden‘s administration, was criticized by the crypto industry as unworkable for DeFi platforms that lack visibility into user identities. This action fulfills part of Trump's campaign promise to be a “crypto president.”

The Crypto Fear and Greed Index registered at 21, remaining in “Fear” territory for the second consecutive day, significantly down from November's yearly high of 88.

Over $297.81 million in crypto positions were liquidated in the past 24 hours, affecting 101,191 traders. The largest single liquidation occurred on Binance's ETH-USDT pair, worth $11.85 million, according to CoinGlass.

Top Gainers (24-Hours)

Traditional markets reeled from Trump's announcement of a temporary 10% universal tariff on most imports and a 145% duty on Chinese goods.

In Thursday's session, the S&P 500, tracked by SPDR S&P 500 SPY, closed at 5,268, down 3.46% after plunging over 4% earlier in the day. The Nasdaq-100, tracked by Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ, dropped 4.19% to 18,343. 

Futures extended the slide Thursday night, with Nasdaq-100 futures falling 1.26% to 18,251.75, S&P 500 futures down 1.04% to 5,247.00, and Dow futures slipping 0.88% to 39,448.00.

Analyst Notes:

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted the correlation between Yuan strength and Ethereum performance, suggesting a Yuan bounce could improve conditions for altcoins. He added that a decline in Treasury yields and gold prices, alongside dollar weakness, would create favorable conditions for the crypto market.

Technical analyst Ali Martinez warned of several bearish signals on Bitcoin's chart, including a recent death cross formation and the SuperTrend indicator showing a “Sell” signal. Martinez identified key resistance levels at $82,500 (monthly open), the descending trendline from all-time high around $84,000, and moving averages at $85,800 (50-day) and $87,000 (200-day), suggesting significant technical barriers to overcome.

Momentum trading among smaller cryptocurrencies know as “altcoins” is rising in the current market volatility, according to data from platform PowerTrade.

Traders and investors are reportedly hedging their bets and speculating on opportunities with cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin (DOGE), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL). Trading volume in XRP options soared to over $5 million in the last week as the market see-sawed between gains and losses.

PowerTrade says most of the trading activity remains concentrated in short-dated expirations, which one would expect given the current level of volatility in crypto and stocks. The action suggests that investors are anticipating significant short-term price movements and are trying to capitalize on sharp price swings up and down.

Amid the current volatility, XRP's price fell to a five-month low of $1.61 earlier this week only to bounce back to $2, according to market data. Traders are betting on whether an asset such as a cryptocurrency's price will rise or fall in a short period of time.

The current market ups and downs have enabled traders to bet on, and capitalize from, short swings in prices. PowerTrade says the current activity shows people are engaging in short-term “momentum trading,” which are bets on quick price moves among the likes of Dogecoin.

The price of DOGE is currently at $0.16, having declined 52% on the year.

Most analysts don't offer ratings or price targets on Dogecoin, so instead we'll look at the cryptocurrencies three-month performance. As one can see in the chart below, the price of DOGE has fallen 53% in the last 12 weeks.

The crypto market suffered a harsh reversal on Friday, erasing gains made earlier when Donald Trump paused certain tariffs. The Bitcoin price crashed from over $82,000 to $79,000, while tokens like EOS, Tezos, Ethereum, and AAVE plunged by over 10%. All these altcoins remain in a deep bear market after falling by over 50% from their year-to-date high.

These tokens are crashing as the sentiment in the financial market remains weak. Indeed, the drop mirrored the stock market's performance, where US equities erased some of the gains made after the tariff pause. 

The Dow Jones index plunged by over 1,000 points, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 indices dived by 200 and 740 points, respectively. At the same time, the top volatility gauge in Wall Street, known as the VIX, surged by over 21% to $40.

Stocks and cryptocurrencies like EOS, Tezos, Ethereum (ETH), and AAVE tumbled as concerns over trade and recession remain. In an X post, Mark Zandi, the top economist at Moody's, reiterated that the US was heading towards a recession, citing its high tariffs and falling consumer confidence.

It was encouraging to see the President reverse himself on the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs yesterday, but I wouldn't take much solace in it as the global trade war continues to rage. I still put the odds of a recession this year at 60%.

Zandi noted that while Trump paused some tariff measures, he simultaneously increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, much higher than in other countries, as the game of chicken continues. 

At the same time, Trump still maintains the 25% tariff on autos, steel, and aluminum. Zandi believes that the average tariff rate in the US is over 10%, which is higher than in other countries.

Zandi has also noted that his number one recession indicator was about to be triggered. He believes a recession is usually triggered when consumer confidence falls by over 20 points within three months, which it has fallen three times in recent months.

There is still a big silver lining to the ongoing crypto crash: US consumer inflation has plunged and is nearing the Fed target of 2.0%. Core inflation moved downwards and fell below the 3% level for the first time in years.

Therefore, falling inflation means that the US may avoid stagflation and, instead, move into a recession. Such a recession would push the Fed to start cutting interest rates, which would help to stimulate the economy and boost asset value.

At the same time, Congress voted in favor of Trump's tax cut bills, which will slash taxes by over $4.5 trillion and cut costs by about $1.5 trillion. These tax cuts may provide a catalyst for the crypto market.

              Highlights            



                        Tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) is quietly transforming capital markets, enabling greater efficiency, liquidity and automation through blockchain technology.                      


                        RWAs offer CFOs and treasurers practical benefits over speculative crypto assets, including yield generation, liquidity management and collateralization, by anchoring digital tokens to tangible or cash-flow-generating assets.                      


                        Despite growing interest, regulatory uncertainty remains a significant hurdle, with industry leaders and lawmakers recognizing the need for clearer frameworks to enable broader adoption of tokenized financial instruments.                      

Blockchain technology was meant to disrupt payments and finance. But while the payments space, at least in the U.S., remains in waiting for a crypto-led transformation, it is across capital markets where traditional approaches are already undergoing a quiet on-chain revolution thanks to the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs).

With the news this week that private equity and insurance giant Apollo has made a strategic investment in Plume, a blockchain platform focused on RWAs, boardrooms and treasury offices are now paying closer attention to efficiencies gained by turning real-world assets into digital ones through tokenization.

The Plume investment follows Apollo's January partnership with RWA infrastructure provider Securitize to tokenize investment opportunities.

As digital transformation reshapes capital markets, RWAs represent a potent convergence of blockchain technology and traditional finance. For chief financial officers (CFOs) and corporate treasurers charged with steering balance sheets, optimizing liquidity and mitigating risk, RWAs could offer both compelling opportunities as well as new layers of complexity.

Unlike cryptocurrencies, which derive their value from consensus and scarcity, RWAs are anchored in real-world value and can often generate cash flow. For CFOs, this shift signals a move from speculative digital assets toward instruments that might be able to play tangible roles in liquidity management, yield generation and even collateralization strategies.

Real-world assets are tangible or intangible assets — such as U.S. Treasuries, real estate, invoices, carbon credits, securities or even art — that have been tokenized and placed on a blockchain. Tokenization refers to the process of issuing a digital token that represents ownership or a claim on an underlying asset. These digital representations are often embedded with smart contracts that automate compliance, yield disbursements and governance functions.

Once these assets are tokenized, organizations and enterprises can take advantage of automated processes on various blockchains which can reduce transaction fees, streamline settlement times and enhance operational efficiency. Additionally, tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets makes them easier to buy, sell and trade on secondary markets.

Major financial players, and not just Apollo, are taking RWAs seriously. BlackRock recently launched its first tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by short-term U.S. Treasurys. JPMorgan's Onyx platform has already settled billions in tokenized collateral transfers, while Citigroup partnered with Wellington Management and WisdomTree to explore the tokenization of private markets.

Earlier this year, it was also announced that Ondo Finance would be the first provider to bring real-world assets to Mastercard's Multi-Token Network (MTN).

“Banks are in the state where they are thinking about blockchains as public infrastructure that they need to rely on,” Chainalysis Co-founder and CEO Jonathan Levin told PYMNTS. “Back in 2014 … cryptocurrency only meant blockchains that had native cryptocurrency tokens. Today, people are putting all types of financial instruments on the blockchain.”

For CFOs and treasurers responsible for safeguarding corporate capital and ensuring optimal deployment, RWAs present novel use cases across several financial disciplines.

Digital asset fluency is quickly becoming a core competency for finance teams. The blockchain can offer CFOs and treasurers a powerful toolkit, but, like all advanced technologies, it is one that must be wielded with precision and foresight.

PYMNTS Intelligence this year found that blockchain technology has numerous potential benefits to serve the unique needs of regulated industries, including finance, healthcare, identity verification and supply chain management, to name a few.

But holding tokenized assets requires secure digital custody solutions. Custodians must be vetted not only for cybersecurity but also for their legal and compliance frameworks. Additionally, many RWA platforms still rely on centralized issuers who can pose operational or credit risk.

Among the biggest uncertainty impacting the RWA space, just as with the rest of the on-chain economy, is the lack of operational clarity around regulation in the U.S. marketplace. But the tide is beginning to turn.

“The largest financial institutions are eager to explore tokenized assets,” Nikola Plecas, head of commercialization, Visa Crypto, told PYMNTS, but added that they require regulatory certainty to do so at scale.

PYMNTS covered Wednesday (April 9) how crypto industry participants and attorneys told a House subcommittee that existing regulations from the SEC lack clarity and are outdated, while the lawmakers in attendance said new legislation tied to market structure and oversight would be forthcoming.

Crypto is going through a bull market breakup. And now it's every blockchain for itself. 

Under the Biden administration, Gary Gensler, the former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), was crypto's great unifier. Seen by the industry as an overzealous regulator, he encouraged American crypto firms to band together in a shared strategy: fight his agency's enforcement actions in court, and lobby for the passage of bills that would restrain him from doing more damage. 

“When everyone faces the choice of living or dying, everyone's on the same page: they want to live,” said Miller Whitehouse-Levine, newly-minted CEO of the Solana Policy Institute (SPI). 

But that is no longer the case, explains Whitehouse-Levine, as crypto has gotten virtually everything that it could have ever wanted in the last election. It now has a pro-crypto president, a Congress that is pushing through legislation with haste, and an SEC chairman in Paul Atkins, who once consulted for some of the very crypto firms he will be regulating. 

With their newfound power, different blockchain ecosystems are now shifting focus towards their own projects, where their interests don't always align. “It's only natural that disparate interests become more pronounced,” Whitehouse-Levine explained.

Everyone for Themself
In one prominent example, Coinbase wants a complex market structure bill more relevant for its business passed at the same time as a stablecoin bill, despite many other firms' concerns that such a bundling could delay the passage of any legislation. In the world of stablecoins, the $140 billion Tether is at odds with $45 billion competitor Circle over nuances in upcoming legislation, such as how these tokens would be regulated on secondary markets and reserve requirements governing how their tokens get collateralized. 
And sometimes, projects now just want to make sure that they have their own seat at the table to address critical issues that could impact their own futures. Ripple Labs, the primary developer behind the $114 billion XRP Ledger blockchain, has ruffled feathers by using its war chest to buy its own access to President Trump and Congress. Most recently the company even seeded its own policy group, the National Cryptocurrency Association, with a $50 million grant.
“Given the amount of money [Ripple's] spending, they're in every single room,” a source familiar with the Solana Policy Institute's thinking said, adding that they weren't aware of any developers building on the XRP Ledger that Ripple Labs could be advocating for. “I don't know what their objectives are other than perpetuating their business model [of selling XRP tokens into the market], if one wants to call it that.” 
With the SPI, Whitehouse-Levine says he aims to tip the scales in favor of Solana developers, whom he says are not well represented. “Ripple's done a lot over the last 10 years and awareness of them in Washington is pretty strong. We want to make sure there's a Solana-specific voice in the conversation,” he said. 
A representative for Ripple Labs did not comment on its lobbying efforts.

Solana Stretches Its Legs
Aside from the resetting of crypto's relations with Washington, the timing is right for Solana supporters to get more active in lobbying and advocacy. The $58 billion blockchain has staged a remarkable comeback from its price collapse after the 2022 bankruptcy of crypto exchange FTX and the arrest of its most famous supporter, Sam Bankman-Fried. 
Its price surged 86% in 2024 on the back of a memecoin craze that defined the industry. However, there is a lot more activity occurring on the ultrafast, albeit somewhat centralized blockchain behind these speculative tokens. Some of the high-profile development onchain includes automated staking platform Marinade, music streaming platform Audius, and decentralized exchange platform Raydium. More than $6 billion is locked up in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms on Solana, up from $1.4 billion at the start of 2024. 
“There's a reason why memecoins happened on Solana. They happened on Solana because they could happen there,” explained Hadley Stern, chief commercial officer at Marinade. “The throughput that the Solana blockchain affords in terms of the ability to issue a token and trade it quickly, can only happen right now on Solana.”
SPI's Funding and Leadership
The Solana Policy Institute is a 501(c)4 nonprofit, a type of organization that is not required to disclose its donors. However, three sources in the Solana ecosystem said they understood the organization to be supported with funding from the Solana Foundation. The Solana Policy Institute declined to say the amount of funding they had, which organizations had donated, and which Solana ecosystem projects would be weighing in on their decisions. 
In order to achieve his mission, Whitehouse-Levine began hiring an influential team. Kristin Smith – who as CEO of the Blockchain Association was credited for growing the organization from a one-woman operation to a powerful membership org with influence that extended to the White House – will begin as president of the SPI in May. Colin McLaren, who played a key role in designing several highly influential attack ad campaigns against crypto-skeptical politicians and regulators last year at the Cedar Innovation Foundation, was recently hired as SPI's head lobbyist.

What the SPI Actually Wants
So what does the SPI hope to achieve? Right now the issues they're focused on, according to Whitehouse-Levine, will coincidentally still help developers of other DeFi ecosystems, like that on Ethereum. 
For example, the Institute would like the regulation of secondary markets transacting with stablecoins, like cryptocurrency exchanges or lending protocols, to be left to market structure bills rather than the GENIUS or STABLE Acts moving through the Senate and House. His fear is that a stablecoin bill could force arduous AML/KYC requirements on small-time developers who incorporate these tokens into their platforms, which would choke stablecoin adoption on Solana. 
Whitehouse-Levine said he would also like clearer guidelines in the bills describing how decentralized stablecoins are to be regulated, something which he says is ambiguous in the current texts and could hamper innovation if not made distinct from the reporting requirements for centralized stablecoins. 
These rules are particularly important for Solana, which has a small but growing share of the stablecoin market. More than half of the $232 billion stablecoin market resides on Ethereum. By comparison, Solana only has $12.5 billion, according to DeFiLlama. 
He is also concerned about forthcoming market structure legislation that could treat all crypto projects as financial applications due to the prominence of crypto trading. This could mistakenly force builders of non-financial applications into expensive and arduous compliance frameworks designed to lower financial risks they are not responsible for. Instead, a market structure bill like FIT21 should limit its focus to registrants in the markets, like custodians, dealers, brokers, or exchanges, Whitehouse-Levine argues. 
Read More: Congress Bickers Over Whether to Bail Out Stablecoins
But more than these immediate concerns, the SPI aims to make sure that they can advocate for the Solana blockchain without their message getting diluted or competing with the interests of dozens of other projects within prominent lobbying groups, such as the Digital Chamber or Blockchain Association (the Solana Foundation is a member of both). This could become increasingly important in the future as legislation moves forward and unknown challenges and opportunities await in the future.
In fact, Whitehouse-Levine expects many more blockchains and projects to follow his lead. When asked if he expects to see more blockchain ecosystems form their own policy organizations, Whitehouse-Levine said, “I hope so. We need the help.”

Metrics details

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is transforming healthcare by seamlessly connecting medical devices, wearables, and sensors to enable personalized, real-time health monitoring and treatment for consumers. As IoMT continues to advance, ensuring the security and privacy of transmitted data has become a critical concern. Blockchain technology has emerged as a promising solution to enhance privacy and security, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical data within the Internet of Things. By integrating blockchain with IoT, secure transmission of medical data can be achieved, paving the way for improved healthcare services, enhanced consumer privacy, and accelerated medical advancements. In this paper, we propose EHRGuard: Enhancing Privacy and Security of Electronic Health Records through Blockchain Technology. EHRGuard is a novel system that leverages blockchain technology to address key challenges in the management of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), with a focus on improving privacy, security, and interoperability in healthcare data systems for consumers. The framework utilizes the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to collect real-time health data from consumers through sensors and integrates blockchain technology to ensure data anonymity, security, and integrity. By combining IoMT and blockchain, EHRGuard enables the seamless and secure gathering of real-time health data, ensuring that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access and tampering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional healthcare systems in terms of service quality and consumer data monitoring. This innovative approach not only enhances the security and privacy of EHRs but also fosters trust and efficiency in healthcare systems, ultimately benefiting consumers and advancing medical research and treatment.

The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) represents a dynamic and expanding ecosystem of internet-connected medical devices, applications, and systems seamlessly integrated with healthcare IT infrastructure1. This transformative technology is revolutionizing healthcare by facilitating real-time data collection, transmission, and analysis, ultimately enhancing patient care and streamlining operational efficiency. IoMT spans a diverse array of tools, ranging from wearable devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches to sophisticated implants such as pacemakers and insulin pumps. These devices capture vital health metrics—heart rate, blood glucose levels, and activity patterns—and relay them to healthcare providers for ongoing monitoring and evaluation. A key strength of IoMT lies in its capacity to enable remote patient monitoring (RPM)2. For individuals managing chronic conditions like diabetes or heart disease, this technology offers continuous oversight without the need for frequent clinic visits. This not only improves patient convenience but also empowers providers to spot emerging issues early and respond swiftly. Moreover, IoMT paves the way for personalized medicine, allowing clinicians to craft tailored treatment plans based on real-time insights into a patient's unique health profile. Beyond hardware, IoMT encompasses software platforms that harness advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) to process the flood of data from connected devices3. These tools can detect patterns, forecast health risks, and suggest preventive actions. For instance, an IoMT system might flag a patient's rising blood pressure trends, alerting a physician to a potential hypertension risk and enabling timely intervention. This data-driven methodology sharpens clinical decision-making and fosters more effective, proactive care strategies. However, IoMT's promise comes with notable hurdles. Data security and privacy remain pressing concerns, as transmitting sensitive health information online heightens vulnerability to cyberattacks4. Compliance with regulations like HIPAA is critical to safeguarding patient confidentiality. Interoperability poses another obstacle, requiring seamless communication between devices and systems from various manufacturers. Additionally, the sheer volume of data generated can strain healthcare systems, underscoring the need for robust data management and analytical solutions5. Looking forward, the IoMT landscape is poised for substantial growth, fueled by advancements in AI, machine learning, and 5G connectivity6. These innovations promise to amplify IoMT's precision and responsiveness, driving a shift toward more proactive and efficient healthcare delivery. As adoption spreads globally, IoMT holds the potential to redefine patient care, lower costs, and elevate health outcomes on an unprecedented scale7.

The use of blockchain technology on the Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare provides a secure and privacy-focused approach to managing medical data. Blockchain has emerged as a reliable solution to challenges related to data security, interoperability, and transparency in healthcare8. As a decentralized and distributed ledger, blockchain ensures that health records remain tamper-proof, meaning once data is recorded, it cannot be modified or erased. This feature is essential for maintaining the accuracy and trustworthiness of patient information. Furthermore, decentralization removes the need for a central authority, strengthening security and system reliability. Various blockchain-based solutions, such as HealthChain9, Fortified-Chain10, and MedShare11, have been designed to securely manage and exchange medical information. These systems utilize blockchain's core capabilities to improve data privacy, security, and accessibility12. For example, smart contract-based access control mechanisms have been proposed to ensure secure sharing of health data among patients and healthcare providers, emphasizing the importance of decentralized trust13. Additionally, hybrid cryptographic schemes, such as the Improved Key Generation Scheme of RSA (IKGSR), have been implemented to securely retrieve EHRs in cloud-based healthcare systems, offering robust encryption and decryption methods14. Furthermore, intelligent breach detection systems integrated with advanced networks like 6G have shown promise in safeguarding critical healthcare infrastructures from cyber-attacks15. Machine learning techniques have also played a crucial role in enhancing cybersecurity by enabling the detection of digital threats, ensuring timely responses to potential security breaches16. By employing cryptographic techniques, blockchain protects sensitive health records, allowing patients to have greater control over their data. Individuals can decide who has access to their medical information, ensuring confidentiality while enabling seamless communication with healthcare providers. Another advantage of blockchain is its ability to enhance transparency and accountability in healthcare17. Every transaction recorded on the blockchain is auditable, enabling participants to track the history of data exchanges. Smart contracts, which are self-executing agreements with predefined rules, further improve interoperability by automating data-sharing processes between healthcare entities. Despite these benefits, challenges such as scalability and regulatory compliance must be addressed to support broader adoption. As research continues, blockchain's potential to enhance healthcare data security and management becomes increasingly evident18.

This study presents a privacy-centric healthcare framework that employs a layered architecture to effectively manage and monitor patient health information. The system embraces decentralization by merging blockchain technology with the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling real-time patient oversight, secure handling of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), prescription management, and safeguarded data sharing. Blockchain integration ensures data integrity, robust security, and transparency, preventing unauthorized alterations and fostering trust across healthcare operations. Meanwhile, IoT devices facilitate continuous health monitoring, paving the way for prompt, evidence-based medical decisions. A standout feature of this system is its use of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to collect real-time data from sensors, promoting a proactive stance on patient care. Blockchain enhances privacy through encryption and anonymity, tackling concerns surrounding data confidentiality. Furthermore, the research underscores the value of linking healthcare providers, institutions, and stakeholders via a decentralized blockchain network. This setup enhances access control, streamlines secure data exchange, and ensures compliance, all while prioritizing patient privacy and operational efficiency.

The primary contributions of this study can be summarized as follows:

The article offers an in-depth exploration of blockchain technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) within the healthcare landscape. Its primary aim is to equip readers with a clear grasp of both technologies, highlighting their core features and examining the powerful synergies that emerge from their integration. By doing so, it seeks to demonstrate how combining blockchain and IoT can revolutionize and strengthen the healthcare system.

The research proposes a novel, lightweight decentralized framework tailored for real-time monitoring and prescription management in healthcare. Leveraging the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to gather patient sensor data, this system incorporates blockchain technology to ensure patient data anonymity and security. By linking healthcare facilities, patients, and professionals through a blockchain network, the framework enhances access control and fosters data interoperability across the healthcare sector.

Furthermore, the study substantiates its proposed system through practical demonstrations, assessing its effectiveness against key performance metrics. These real-world tests validate the theoretical foundation of the decentralized framework, providing tangible evidence of its implications for real-time monitoring and prescription management. This empirical approach bolsters the research's credibility, offering actionable insights into the system's performance and its potential to benefit healthcare stakeholders.

This section reviews studies in the healthcare sector that have strategically integrated blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance the security of Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

The authors in19 propose a system aimed at enhancing healthcare by ensuring secure data management via a lightweight blockchain. This paper introduces an innovative platform for monitoring patient vital signs through the implementation of smart contracts on a blockchain. The system is constructed using Hyperledger Fabric, a distributed ledger framework tailored for enterprise-level blockchain applications. By utilizing the Libelium e-Health toolkit for physiological data acquisition, the proposed solution offers patients several benefits, including an unalterable historical log and universal access to medical information at any location and time. Performance evaluation is conducted using Hyperledger Caliper, a standard benchmark tool, measuring transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization. The findings reveal that the proposed system surpasses conventional healthcare systems in the monitoring of patient data.

The DITrust Chain system, proposed in20, is a blockchain-based framework designed to enhance security and privacy in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) environments. It features a multi-layered architecture: the first layer collects and processes data through sensors and actuators; the second layer uses gateways and network technologies like Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee to securely transmit data; the third, or middleware layer, includes blockchain decision units, data analytics, and application support to manage data integrity and services; and the final application layer delivers system functionalities to end-users via web service protocols and service composition technologies. This structure ensures seamless integration, robust data protection, and improved patient confidentiality, with experimental results showing it outperforms traditional access control methods in IoMT settings.

In21, the authors introduce a novel privacy-preserving scheme called BIoTHR, which leverages blockchain and swarm exchange techniques to enable secure and seamless transmission of user data, such as electronic health records (EHRs), across peer-to-peer networks. This framework integrates blockchain technology with IoT to create a robust system for EHR management, ensuring real-time monitoring and secure data transmission through autonomous encryption–decryption mechanisms and dynamic server assistance. Key algorithms like swarm-listen, announcement, peer open, and peer closing are employed to optimize system functionality, while open-source tools such as GnuPG, IPFS, and Golang are used for development. The scheme is tested using simulated IoT-based health sensor nodes, including body temperature, pulse rate, oxygen saturation (SPO2), galvanic skin response, and blood glucose, within the blockchain-assisted swarm exchange framework. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in blockchain-IoT integration, swarm exchange, and EHR transmission, offering enhanced security and efficiency for e-healthcare services.

Samuel et al. in22 propose the Patient-Centric Healthcare Framework (PCH), a novel reference architecture designed to enhance semantic interoperability in healthcare systems by integrating Blockchain, Cloud, and IoT technologies. The framework features a five-tiered architecture that emphasizes collaboration and secure data processing, with a focus on practical implementation. The design process includes a layering diagram, system context, and detailed reference architecture to outline component topology and interactions. Using electronic medical records as an example, the framework demonstrates how healthcare data is processed while maintaining robust security measures. The authors evaluate PCH against existing Blockchain-based healthcare frameworks, with results showing that PCH offers superior solutions for securing healthcare data, enabling efficient data sharing, and improving overall interoperability, making it a promising approach for modern healthcare systems.

Pratima et al. in23 propose EHDHE, a decentralized blockchain-based IoT application designed to enhance the security of healthcare documents in digital healthcare ecosystems. The application acts as a communication intermediary, connecting hospitals, patients, and doctors, and features the generation of unique identification numbers for medical certificates and the use of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to create new blocks in the blockchain network. Its primary goal is to ensure the security and privacy of medical certificates by preventing unauthorized access and storing medical data as hashed blocks within the blockchain, thereby mitigating fraudulent activities. The authors evaluate the application through extensive experimental tests, analyzing parameters such as latency, computation time, processing time, throughput, and network usage to assess its performance and robustness. The results demonstrate that EHDHE is a secure and efficient solution for managing healthcare documents in IoT-enabled ecosystems.

Bora et al. in24 propose PPFchain, a novel privacy-preserving blockchain-based federated learning (FL) framework designed for sensor networks. PPFchain leverages a distributed architecture to ensure data privacy, reliability, and low-cost on-demand anonymity within an IoT-based blockchain network. Key features include the integration of fog node architecture at the edge of the off-chain IoT network, which reduces contract payload and minimizes end-to-end delay, and the use of digital signatures with public key cryptography to protect administrator privacy. FL is employed to enhance data privacy while maintaining system performance. The framework is evaluated using benchmark metrics for event and storage-based smart contracts within a distributed architecture. Additionally, the authors introduce a 5G-enabled block-sensor platform that balances security-privacy concerns with computation-communication costs, paving the way for next-generation blockchain-sensor applications in 5G-enabled environments. This innovative approach addresses critical challenges in security, privacy, and efficiency, demonstrating its potential for advanced IoT and blockchain integration.

In reference25, the authors propose an innovative blockchain-based architecture designed to decentralize Electronic Health Records (EHR) and enable smart contract-driven service automation while ensuring robust security and privacy. The architecture employs a hybrid computing model, integrating blockchain-based distributed data storage to overcome limitations of cloud-centric Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) healthcare systems, such as high latency, elevated storage costs, and single points of failure. A standout feature is the decentralized selective ring-based access control mechanism, which, along with device authentication and patient record anonymity algorithms, significantly enhances system security. The authors evaluate the system's latency and cost-effectiveness in data sharing, demonstrating its efficiency. Logical system analysis confirms that the architecture meets the security and privacy requirements of decentralized IoMT smart healthcare systems. Experimental results reveal that the fortified-chain-based Healthcare Privacy System (HCPS) requires minimal storage and achieves millisecond-level response times, outperforming traditional centralized HCPS. These findings highlight the architecture's decentralized automated access control, security, and privacy capabilities, affirming its suitability for decentralized IoMT smart healthcare systems.

In reference26, the authors present BEdgeHealth, a novel decentralized health architecture that combines Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and blockchain technologies to enable efficient data offloading and secure data sharing within distributed hospital networks. The architecture offers two key advantages: (1) a smart contract system that provides authentication and traceability for data-sharing activities, eliminating the need for external authority. The smart contract tracks events like data uploads and user access and any modifications to data records alter their hash values, which are also traceable. (2) The integration of smart contracts with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) enhances the data retrieval rate, ensuring efficient and secure data access. The system includes a privacy-aware data-offloading scheme, where mobile devices can offload health data to nearby MEC servers for efficient computation, and a secure data-sharing scheme that leverages blockchain and IPFS for secure exchanges among healthcare users. By combining smart contract-based authentication with MEC, the architecture enables decentralized user access verification at the network edge without relying on a central authority. Real-world experiments demonstrate that BEdgeHealth significantly improves Quality of Service (QoS) while ensuring data privacy and security, outperforming existing schemes in terms of efficiency and reliability.

In this section, we introduce EHRGuard, an innovative framework designed for Remote Patient Monitoring with a focus on ensuring the security of patient health data through the integration of blockchain and IoT. Within this section, we provide a comprehensive demonstration of the proposed architecture, showcasing its various facets. Subsequently, we outline diverse prerequisites for establishing a secure authentication scheme in healthcare applications that leverage IoT technology.

The proposed system is structured with a modular architecture, wherein each layer operates independently of the others. This decoupling feature provides developers with the flexibility to integrate or remove modules without causing disruptions to the overall system. The architecture of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 1 and refers to five major components: Patient with wearable IoT devices, healthcare professionals, permissioned blockchain, an off-chain database and Electronic Health Record.

Patient with wearable IoT devices: The proposed system integrates heterogeneous IoT-based medical sensors—categorized into ingestible/implantable sensors, environmental sensors, and camera-based sensors—to enable continuous health monitoring by measuring physiological parameters and transmitting data wirelessly to a server. Each patient's IoT devices and sensors are registered on a blockchain to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering, with a health administrator overseeing initial registration using details like name, date of birth, and contact information. Patients access the system via email ID and a generated password, while four key sensors (EMG, SpO2, body temperature, and pulse rate) monitor health metrics, with predefined normal and abnormal ranges triggering automated notifications for potential health issues. This real-time monitoring, combined with blockchain security and automated alerts, ensures timely interventions, enhances patient care, and supports early detection of health complications. Table 1 defines normal and abnormal ranges for these parameters, with automated notifications triggered when any sensor detects values outside the normal range, indicating a potential health issue.

Healthcare professionals: Access to patient health data is restricted to authorized healthcare professionals, such as doctors, practitioners, and hospital administrators, ensuring privacy and security. A blockchain network facilitates the retrieval of patient health information, with doctors acting as light nodes accessible via smartphones or computers, while hospitals operate as full nodes, storing a complete replica of the blockchain and participating in the consensus process. Other users, although they may possess a copy of the blockchain, are not permitted to engage in the consensus mechanism, maintaining a controlled and secure environment for sensitive health data. This hierarchical structure ensures that only trusted entities can access and manage patient information, enhancing data integrity and confidentiality. The different participants and their privileges in the proposed system are mentioned in Table 2.

Electronic health record: An electronic health record (EHR) is a comprehensive digital version of a patient's medical history, encompassing critical health information such as diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory test results. EHRs enable real-time access to patient data by authorized healthcare professionals, improving care coordination among providers and enhancing healthcare outcomes. In the proposed system, healthcare professionals exclusively create an EHR for each patient, including essential details like birth information, residence, contact number, patient ID, medical history, and medical prescriptions. The medical prescriptions section contains medication data, such as the name, details, prescription date, patient ID, and doctor's information, while the medical history segment includes patient ID, first name, last name, disease description, date, updated date, and status. Only authorized healthcare practitioners can access these records, ensuring data security and privacy. Both the EHR and patient health information collected from IoT sensors can be utilized for research, remote monitoring, and analysis, fostering a more efficient and interconnected healthcare ecosystem that replaces traditional paper-based systems with a seamless, digital approach.

Permissioned blockchain: A permissioned blockchain is a type of blockchain network where access and participation in the network are restricted to a defined set of participants. Unlike public blockchains where anyone can join and participate in the network, permissioned blockchains require participants to be authorized or granted permission to engage in various activities such as validating transactions, accessing data, and participating in the consensus process27. A permissioned blockchain-based data monitoring system can provide a secure, transparent, and efficient solution for various industries such as healthcare, supply chain, and finance, where controlled access and privacy are paramount. In this paper, the proposed system for monitoring patient data is supported by a lightweight, permissioned blockchain carefully crafted to establish a secure and regulated environment for both patients and healthcare professionals. This permissioned blockchain serves as a digital infrastructure, facilitating the secure storage and retrieval of data28. To ensure data validation, the associated hash values of each patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR) are recorded on the blockchain after storage and encryption. Furthermore, the permissioned blockchain is designed to store crucial patient monitoring data, specifically Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) sensor values, as transactions. This methodology acts as a safeguard against potential tampering or forgery of records. For instance, when a new set of monitoring data is collected at defined intervals, it is recorded into the blockchain as a transaction if it deviates from the expected norms. Additionally, any modifications or updates made to sensor information, access control lists, medical history, medical prescriptions, treatment plans, vital statistics, and EHRs are recorded as transactions on the blockchain. Additionally, the client application employs the REST API for administering the blockchain network, facilitating transaction requests such as task generation services, as well as user and device registration. Participants, including patients and doctors, have the capability to submit transactions, whether to create a new task or to receive a response from a previously generated task via the healthcare IoT server29.

Off-chain database: An off-chain database is a storage system that operates independently of a blockchain, serving as an external repository for data that is not stored directly on the blockchain. This approach is particularly useful for managing large volumes of data, such as files, documents, or detailed records, which would be impractical or inefficient to store on-chain due to limitations in storage capacity, cost, or performance. In the context of healthcare, when a new patient registers with healthcare professionals, a unique patient ID and Electronic Health Record (EHR) are generated30. The EHR contains critical information such as birth details, residence, contact information, medical history, and prescriptions. To ensure security, each patient's EHR is encrypted and stored in an off-chain database, alongside other relevant data like sensor details, sensor values, vital statistics, and access control lists. This off-chain storage strategy enhances efficiency and scalability, enabling streamlined access and management of patient information while maintaining data confidentiality. While the off-chain database provides a secure and efficient repository for sensitive patient data, blockchain technology complements it by offering a decentralized, tamper-resistant ledger that records data modifications. This combination ensures real-time access to patient data for healthcare professionals while maintaining data consistency and enabling secure data sharing across entities such as hospitals, doctors, and researchers. However, for large-scale static healthcare data, a purely blockchain-based architecture may require significant resources. Therefore, integrating an off-chain database with a permissioned blockchain architecture presents a more efficient and resilient solution for managing patient information in remote healthcare settings31. This hybrid approach not only preserves data integrity but also achieves a balance between data privacy, security, and accessibility, making it a robust framework for modern healthcare systems.

The proposed EHRGuard architecture.

The adversary model of the proposed scheme outlines potential threats and adversaries that the system is designed to mitigate or withstand. It helps in understanding the security considerations and scenarios where the system may face challenges. The adversary model typically identifies potential attackers, their capabilities, and the assumed conditions under which they may operate. For example, in a healthcare-related blockchain system, potential adversaries could include:

Unauthorized users: Adversaries may attempt to gain unauthorized access to the system, posing a threat to the confidentiality of sensitive health data. The model should consider measures to prevent unauthorized login attempts, account hijacking, or any form of unauthorized access.

Tampering with patient data: Adversaries may try to manipulate or tamper with patient data stored in the blockchain. The system should be resilient against unauthorized modifications to ensure the integrity of health records.

Eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks: Adversaries may try to eavesdrop on communications or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept and manipulate data transmissions. The model should address encryption and secure communication protocols to prevent these threats.

Denial-of-service (DoS) Attackers: Adversaries may attempt to disrupt the availability of the system by launching DoS attacks. The model should include strategies to mitigate and withstand such attacks, ensuring continuous service availability.

Sybil attacks: Sybil attacks involve adversaries creating multiple fake identities to undermine the network. The adversary model should account for measures to detect and prevent Sybil attacks that could compromise the consensus mechanism.

Privacy concerns: Adversaries may attempt to breach patient privacy by extracting sensitive information. The model should address privacy-preserving measures, ensuring that patient data remains confidential and is accessible only to authorized parties.

Blockchain network attacks: Adversaries might target the underlying blockchain network. The model should consider protections against 51% attacks, double-spending attacks, and other vulnerabilities specific to the chosen blockchain technology.

Securing a healthcare Internet of Things system is crucial to safeguard sensitive patient data, maintain the integrity of medical information, and ensure the reliability of connected devices. Here are key security requirements for a healthcare IoT system:

Device authentication: Implement secure authentication mechanisms for IoT devices to ensure that only authorized and authenticated devices can connect to the system. This prevents unauthorized access and potential attacks.

Access control: Enforce strict access controls to regulate who can access and interact with the healthcare IoT system.

Data encryption: Implement end-to-end encryption for data transmitted between IoT devices, gateways, and the central system. This ensures that health data remains confidential and secure during transmission.

Integrity checking: Use cryptographic mechanisms, such as digital signatures, to verify the integrity of data collected from IoT devices. This helps ensure that the data has not been tampered with during transit or storage.

Secure communication: Utilize secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, MQTT with TLS) to protect data exchanged between IoT devices and the central system. This safeguards against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Privacy preservation: Implement measures to protect patient privacy, such as anonymization and de-identification of data where appropriate. Aligns with healthcare regulations and safeguards sensitive patient information.

The IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) presents unique challenges due to the vulnerabilities of sensor nodes that are often deployed in hostile or hazardous environments. These nodes are susceptible to various attacks, such as network perturbation, data manipulation, and replay attacks, which can compromise the accuracy of data aggregation and potentially mislead healthcare systems. To address these challenges, the proposed system aims to meet several critical objectives:

Security: The system must ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authentication of data transmitted through IoT networks. This is particularly vital for healthcare applications, where unauthorized access or data manipulation can have severe consequences. The system should be designed to withstand compromised nodes and prevent data tampering. Additional security measures such as access control and availability must also be implemented to ensure that data remains secure and accessible only to authorized users.

High energy efficiency: Energy efficiency is essential for maintaining the longevity of sensor networks, especially when nodes are battery-powered or have limited energy resources. The proposed aggregation scheme must minimize energy consumption by reducing computing load and communication overhead. This will not only preserve the energy of sensor nodes but also extend the overall lifetime of the network, ensuring continuous and reliable operation over extended periods.

Scalability: As the IoMT ecosystem grows, the system must be scalable enough to handle an increasing number of IoT devices, users, and data without compromising performance. The design should allow seamless expansion, ensuring that the system can accommodate additional devices and more data without overwhelming the infrastructure. Scalability is key to ensuring that the solution remains effective as healthcare IoT networks evolve and expand.

This section delineates a sequential interaction illustrating how patients are equipped with Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) sensors, healthcare professionals, an off-chain database, and blockchain technology collaboratively operate to establish a secure, transparent, and efficient remote patient monitoring system. The integration of blockchain and off-chain databases is instrumental in fortifying data security, upholding integrity, ensuring accessibility, preserving patient privacy, and facilitating the delivery of remote healthcare services. In the following, we provide a description of each phase.

Figure 2 illustrates a sequence diagram outlining the steps for adding patient health records in the proposed EHRGuard system. The process begins with enrolling each patient into the Health System, followed by the attachment of medical sensors based on a doctor's recommendation. Medical staff affix these sensors to the patient's body, enabling real-time monitoring of vital signs such as respiration rate, pulse rate, oxygen levels, and glucose levels. The Health System maintains a centralized database to store all relevant patient information, including Electronic Health Records. Sensor data is wirelessly transmitted to a gateway powered by a Raspberry Pi, which acts as a bridge for Internet of Medical Things devices. This gateway forwards the collected data to an off-chain database, accessible exclusively to authorized healthcare professionals. The medical IoT server processes queries and leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof data handling. Finally, statistical information is sent to a web application for analysis, enabling healthcare providers to make informed decisions and improve patient care. This integrated approach ensures efficient, secure, and real-time health monitoring and data management.

Sequence diagram for adding patient health records for the proposed EHRGuard system.

Algorithm 1 is designed to securely add patient health and sensor data to both the database and the blockchain, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information. It handles new patient registration, initiated by an administrator, and records data as a transaction in the form of metadata when either a new patient is registered, or the sensor diagnostic status exceeds normal values. This metadata is used to create a new block in the blockchain. The algorithm ensures that data is only recorded when abnormal behavior is detected, preventing unnecessary entries for normal or ongoing sensor readings. Patient data is first encrypted using a secure encryption mechanism before being stored in the database, and its hashed reference is uploaded as a transaction to the blockchain. Each data entry is appended as a block, creating a tamper-resistant ledger that guarantees the immutability of patient health data, protecting it from unauthorized changes or deletions. The algorithm also supports flexible mapping between patients and sensors, allowing for one-to-one or one-to-many relationships. Vital sign data is stored as a JSON array and transmitted to the healthcare IoT server via a POST request, with communication between the IoT gateway and the server facilitated by the CoAP protocol. This comprehensive approach ensures secure, efficient, and transparent management of patient health data.

Insert patient & sensor data in the blockchain.

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus mechanism that ensures agreement among distributed participants in a blockchain network regarding the state of the ledger. It plays a critical role in creating new blocks and securing the network against malicious activities, such as double-spending attacks and unauthorized tampering with block history. In the proposed system, hospital administration acts as trusted validators, responsible for verifying transactions, constructing blocks, and appending them to the blockchain. The PoW algorithm involves solving a computationally complex scientific puzzle, which serves as a deterrent against adversaries by limiting their economic capabilities to disrupt the network32. A hash function is central to this process, providing a random and complex mathematical mechanism to validate transactions stored in the blockchain. Each block contains its hash value, transaction history, and the hash value of the previous block, ensuring a secure and immutable chain. During the PoW process, nodes in the network calculate the hash value of the block header, and upon discovering the target value, a node broadcasts the new block to the network. Other nodes verify the accuracy of the hash value, and once validated, the block is collectively added to the blockchain. Figure 3 illustrates the PoW flow, highlighting its secure and decentralized nature. The key advantages of PoW include its robust security measures and its ability to promote decentralization, making it a reliable foundation for maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of the blockchain network.

The proof of work consensus algorithm.

Algorithm 2 plays a central role in managing patient sensor data by providing an overview of the information received from patients and enabling access to a personalized dashboard for healthcare professionals. This dashboard allows users to review patient data using filters such as date, time, and profile parameters. Upon receiving sensor data, Algorithm 2 analyzes it, focusing on detecting abnormal readings that fall outside the expected range, which are flagged as “red” for visual emphasis. The system generates real-time alerts and notifications for healthcare experts when critical health issues or deviations from predefined parameters are identified, enabling timely treatment adjustments or prescription changes. This rapid detection of abnormalities serves as a vital safety feature, ensuring prompt attention to potential health risks. Conversely, readings within the normal range are integrated into the patient's record and securely stored in the database, ensuring accurate documentation for future reference or analysis. Essentially, Algorithm 2 acts as a crucial intermediary, managing, analyzing, and presenting patient sensor data in a way that allows healthcare professionals to effectively monitor and respond to patient health. Figure 4 illustrates the sequence diagram for remote patient monitoring, highlighting the system's workflow.

Algorithm 3 is responsible for generating and retrieving patient medical prescriptions, which include critical details such as patient ID, medicine ID, medicine name, comprehensive medicine details, doctor information (first name and last name), and the prescription issuance date. Patients are granted access to view only their own prescriptions, while doctors have the authority to create and update them. When healthcare professionals modify a prescription, the updated record is securely stored in both the database and the ledger, ensuring a transparent and accountable system that maintains a comprehensive history of all changes made to medical prescriptions.

Medicine prescriptions.

Algorithm 4 is specifically designed for the creation and retrieval of the patient's medical history. The records within this algorithm include crucial details such as the patient's name, patient ID, a comprehensive history of diseases, or any ongoing medical conditions, along with associated dates for each disease event and the current health status of the patient. To maintain a secure and transparent Electronic Health Record for the patient, a new block is appended to the blockchain whenever there is a recording or update to the medical history. This process ensures the integrity and immutability of the patient's health information within the blockchain, providing a reliable and transparent history of their medical journey.

Medical history.

Security analysis involves a thorough analysis of the measures integrated into the EHRGuard system to safeguard patient health information against unauthorized access, data breaches, and potential vulnerabilities. The proposed system leverages blockchain and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technologies to ensure that healthcare data remains secure, private, and tamper resistant. This section highlights key security aspects, addressing essential factors such as data integrity, confidentiality, privacy, user control, immutability, scalability, availability, traceability, and transparency.

Data Integrity: The off-chain database securely stores patient Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using advanced encryption techniques. The encryption generates keys that are stored within the blockchain blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the preceding block, forming an interconnected chain. This design ensures that any alteration to the data would result in a mismatch of the hash values, making unauthorized modification almost impossible. The immutability of blockchain guarantees the integrity of patient data, ensuring that it cannot be tampered with or corrupted.

Confidentiality: Patient confidentiality is paramount in healthcare systems. The EHRGuard system ensures that only authorized users, such as healthcare providers and medical professionals, can access sensitive patient information. The access control mechanism ensures that unauthorized individuals are unable to view or manipulate patient health records. This restriction upholds the privacy of healthcare data and protects it from exposure to unauthorized parties.

Privacy: To protect patient privacy, the EHRGuard system utilizes a permissioned consortium blockchain, which limits access to the system to only those who are authorized to view or manage patient data. Blockchain regulates access to the encrypted data stored in the off-chain database, ensuring that patient records are shielded from unauthorized access. These mechanisms provide an additional layer of security by ensuring that only trusted healthcare providers can access the sensitive health information.

User Control: Empowering patients with control over their own health data is a key feature of the EHRGuard system. Patients have the ability to decide who can access their data and can revoke access at any time. This level of control ensures that individuals maintain autonomy over their personal health information and can make informed decisions about its sharing. This approach aligns with modern healthcare principles of patient consent and privacy.

Immutability: The use of blockchain ensures the immutability of patient records. Once data is uploaded to the blockchain, it becomes resistant to modification or deletion. This feature protects the data from both intentional tampering and accidental changes, ensuring that the information remains authentic. The immutability of blockchain significantly strengthens the security of patient data by preventing unauthorized alterations and fostering trust among stakeholders.

Scalability: The EHRGuard system's architecture is designed for scalability, enabling it to manage and process large volumes of patient data efficiently. Data is encrypted and securely stored in the off-chain database, with its hash value documented in the blockchain. This approach allows the system to handle substantial amounts of data with lower latency. The integration of off-chain databases and permissioned blockchain ensures the scalability of the system, enabling it to grow as the number of patients and healthcare transactions increases.

Availability: Availability is ensured through a decentralized system architecture. By using multiple distributed nodes, the EHRGuard system eliminates single points of failure. If one node becomes unavailable, the system remains operational, and other nodes can continue to provide access to patient data. This decentralized approach ensures high availability and enhances system resilience, ensuring continuous access to critical health information even during network disruptions or server failures.

Traceability: The use of blockchain introduces transparency into the system. All transactions related to patient records are publicly visible to authorized participants within the network, fostering openness and accountability. This transparency ensures that any changes made to the data are easily verifiable and that the integrity of the health data is maintained. Authorized healthcare providers can confidently access the data, knowing it is securely managed and immutable.

The EHRGuard system offers a comprehensive security framework for healthcare data management, addressing critical issues such as data integrity, confidentiality, privacy, and traceability. By integrating blockchain and IoT technologies, the system ensures that patient health information is secure, transparent, and tamper-resistant. The decentralized nature of blockchain, combined with robust encryption, access controls, and user empowerment, makes EHRGuard a reliable and secure solution for modern healthcare data management. This security evaluation confirms that the system effectively mitigates risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and tampering, while ensuring the availability and scalability necessary for large-scale healthcare applications.

In this section, we provide an expanded security evaluation of EHRGuard, focusing on how the system performs under various attack scenarios, including man-in-the-middle (MITM), denial of service (DoS), Sybil, and replay attacks. Each section includes a discussion on the specific mitigation strategies used, along with experimental results to demonstrate how EHRGuard handles these potential threats.

A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, such as a patient's IoMT device and a healthcare provider's system, potentially compromising patient data. To mitigate this, EHRGuard encrypts all communication between IoMT devices, patients, and healthcare professionals using SSL/TLS protocols, ensuring end-to-end encryption and preventing attackers from modifying or reading transmitted data. Additionally, blockchain technology is employed to verify data integrity, with IoMT devices authenticated and registered on the blockchain network to prevent unauthorized access. We conducted a series of simulations to evaluate the system's resilience to MITM attacks under different conditions. For the first setup, Without Encryption, no encryption mechanisms were employed, simulating an unsecured communication channel between the patient's IoMT device and the healthcare professional's system. In this case, the MITM attacker was able to intercept the data being transmitted, such as heart rate, oxygen levels, and other vital signs. The attacker modified the values, injecting false data into the communication stream, which led to corrupted health information being sent to the healthcare provider. This corrupted data could potentially result in incorrect diagnoses or treatment recommendations, highlighting the critical risk posed by MITM attacks in an unprotected system. For the second setup, With Encryption, we implemented SSL/TLS encryption, which encrypts the communication between the patient's device and the healthcare provider's system. In this case, even though the MITM attacker intercepted the communication, they were unable to read or alter the encrypted data. The encrypted data appeared as gibberish to the attacker, rendering any attempts to modify or inject malicious data ineffective. Furthermore, the blockchain layer ensured that any changes made to the data could be detected and rejected by verifying the data's integrity. The blockchain's immutable ledger made it impossible to alter any data retroactively, guaranteeing that only valid, untampered data could be recorded in the system.

In the Denial of Service (DoS) Attack Evaluation, the focus was on assessing EHRGuard's ability to withstand excessive traffic aimed at overwhelming system resources and denying legitimate users access to patient data. A successful DoS attack could severely disrupt healthcare services by preventing healthcare professionals from accessing critical patient information. EHRGuard implements multiple mitigation techniques, including rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single user or device within a set time window and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to monitor and detect abnormal traffic patterns. The experimental results demonstrated the system's resilience: without mitigation, the system was overwhelmed by a flood of requests, causing significant slowdowns and preventing access to patient data, highlighting its vulnerability to DoS attacks. However, with the implemented mitigation strategies, the system performed well under attack—rate limiting prevented any single user from flooding the system, while the IDS detected abnormal traffic, blocked malicious IP addresses, and kept the system operational with minimal downtime, ensuring continuous access to patient data for healthcare professionals. These results confirm that EHRGuard is resilient to DoS attacks when effective mitigation strategies are in place, ensuring the system remains available and functional even during high-traffic events.

In the Sybil Attack Evaluation, the focus was on assessing EHRGuard's ability to prevent malicious actors from creating fake identities or nodes within the network to manipulate the consensus process or alter patient records on the blockchain. A Sybil attack could compromise the integrity of the system by enabling attackers to modify critical medical data. To mitigate such attacks, EHRGuard employs a permissioned blockchain model, where only authorized participants—such as registered hospitals, doctors, and medical institutions—are allowed to join the network. Participants are verified during registration through multi-factor authentication and only verified healthcare professionals are permitted to engage in the consensus mechanism, ensuring that fake nodes cannot interfere with the blockchain. In the experimental results, a Sybil attack was simulated by introducing multiple fake nodes into the network: without mitigation, the fake nodes participated in the consensus process and were able to manipulate the validation of transactions, altering patient records on the blockchain. However, with the mitigation in place, the permissioned nature of the blockchain successfully prevented unauthorized nodes from joining the network, ensuring that only registered and verified participants could validate transactions, which protected patient data from tampering. The results demonstrate that EHRGuard's use of a permissioned blockchain is an effective safeguard against Sybil attacks, preserving the integrity of patient records by restricting network access to authenticated and authorized participants.

In the Replay Attack Evaluation, we assessed EHRGuard's resilience to an attack where an adversary intercepts and retransmits valid communication, such as transaction data, to deceive the system into accepting it as a legitimate request. In the context of healthcare, this could involve an attacker retransmitting valid patient data to manipulate or overwrite medical records. To mitigate this threat, EHRGuard employs timestamping and sequence numbering in all transactions. Each transaction includes a timestamp and a unique sequence number, ensuring that data cannot be replayed without detection. In the experimental results, the system was tested by capturing a valid transaction and retransmitting it to the server: without mitigation, the system accepted the replayed transaction, allowing the attacker to insert false data into the blockchain. However, with mitigation in place, the system recognized the replayed transaction by checking the timestamp and sequence number, promptly rejecting it and preventing unauthorized changes to patient records. The results demonstrate that transaction timestamps and sequence numbers are highly effective in protecting EHRGuard from replay attacks, ensuring that only legitimate transactions are accepted and recorded on the blockchain.

This section evaluates the proposed EHRGuard system, beginning with an overview of the hardware platform, the “E-health sensor shield V2.0,” followed by a visual analysis of the experimental results. The performance of EHRGuard is compared with two other systems, BIoTHR21 and EHDHE23, focusing on metrics such as latency, execution time, and throughput. Table 3 provides a summary of the stack technology used in the development of the proposed system.

The dataset used for evaluating the EHRGuard model consists of patient vitals collected from IoMT sensors, including heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen levels, and glucose levels, along with associated diagnoses, prescriptions, and blockchain transaction hashes for secure data management. The data is recorded in real-time, enabling continuous patient monitoring and immediate detection of abnormal conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and critical alerts. If abnormal readings are detected, alerts are triggered for medical intervention, while normal readings are securely stored in an off-chain database, with hashed references recorded on the blockchain to ensure integrity and immutability. Each patient record is linked to a Doctor ID for medical supervision, and prescribed medications are logged securely. This dataset demonstrates EHRGuard's capability to securely manage electronic health records using a combination of IoMT, blockchain, and real-time monitoring, ensuring data privacy, security, and efficient remote healthcare management. Table 4 resumes the dataset used for evaluating the EHRGuard.

The E-Health Sensor Shield V2.0 is a hardware module specifically designed for Arduino-based projects, particularly those focused on e-health and medical monitoring. It serves as a versatile platform for integrating a wide range of sensors and devices to measure and monitor physiological parameters. The shield features connectors and interfaces for connecting various health sensors, such as those for measuring heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), body temperature, and more, as illustrated in Fig. 5. In the proposed system, four types of health sensors are connected to the patient's body: a temperature sensor, a SpO2 sensor, a pulse rate sensor, and an EMG sensor. The shield enables the collection of real-time data from these sensors, which can then be processed and used to monitor an individual's health parameters. It supports both analog and digital connectivity, making it compatible with sensors of different output types. Additionally, the shield offers flexible power options, allowing users to configure power supply for both the sensors and the shield according to their project needs. In this system, a Raspberry Pi equipped with the E-Health Sensor Shield V2.0 functions as an IoT gateway, routing vital-sign data to a healthcare IoT server. The e-health sensor platform also provides an open-source C + + library for reading data from the sensors. For detailed information on using the shield, users should consult the manufacturer's product documentation and specifications33.

The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed system in managing high data loads and ensuring seamless operation in real-world healthcare scenarios.

Throughput of the proposed framework.

In the proposed EHRGuard system, latency is a critical factor, especially in healthcare environments where timely access to patient records is essential for effective patient care. The system's latency is influenced by several factors, including network latency, consensus mechanisms, block size, and transaction throughput. To evaluate the system's performance, we measured the average latency using JMeter, a widely-used tool for performance testing. During the evaluation, we simulated varying numbers of users and measured latency in seconds. The results, illustrated in Fig. 7, compare the latency performance of our system with benchmark models such as BIoTHR and EHDHE. The proposed framework demonstrates significantly lower latency compared to these benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency and robustness. This reduction in latency ensures faster and more reliable access to patient records, enhancing the system's overall effectiveness and supporting timely decision-making in healthcare settings.

Latency of the proposed system.

The computation cost, which reflects the resources required to execute tasks within a system or algorithm, is a critical factor in evaluating the efficiency of our proposed EHRGuard system. It encompasses various components, including user authentication, data retrieval, sensor data processing, blockchain integration, and data storage. Through extensive experimentation, our EHRGuard model has demonstrated superior cost-efficiency compared to benchmark systems like BIoTHR and EHDHE. As illustrated in Fig. 8, EHRGuard achieves a total computation cost of approximately 7 s for 1000 smart nodes, representing a 38% reduction compared to BIoTHR and a 24% reduction compared to EHDHE. These results highlight EHRGuard's ability to significantly minimize computation costs while maintaining scalability, ensuring efficient resource utilization and enhanced performance in healthcare applications. This cost-effectiveness makes EHRGuard a robust and practical solution for real-world implementation.

Computation cost of the proposed system.

Communication overhead, which refers to the additional resources and latency incurred by a system due to communication-related activities such as data transmission, messaging, and transactions between components or nodes within a blockchain network, is a critical factor in system performance. In our analysis, as depicted in Fig. 9, the proposed scheme demonstrates significantly greater efficiency in managing communication overhead compared to BIoTHR and EHDHE. This improved efficiency indicates that our system utilizes communication resources more effectively, reducing unnecessary delays and optimizing resource allocation. By minimizing communication overhead, the proposed system enhances overall performance, ensuring smoother and more reliable operations within the blockchain network, particularly in healthcare applications where timely and efficient data exchange is paramount.

The communication overhead of the proposed system.

In this section, we analyze the computational efficiency of the EHRGuard system by evaluating the time required for key operations involved in managing patient health data. The analysis focuses on four core processes: data encryption, blockchain transaction processing, consensus mechanism execution (Proof of Work), and real-time alert generation. Given the critical nature of healthcare applications, ensuring both security and performance is paramount for the system's feasibility in real-world settings. We define the following parameters for measuring the computational time of each operation:

T_enc: Data encryption is performed to ensure that patient health records are securely stored and transmitted. The time required for encryption can be calculated as:

Where:

\(\:{T}_{enc,i}:\:\) is the time for encrypting the iii-th patient's data.

\(\:n\): is the total number of patients.

T_tx: The processing of a blockchain transaction involves creating a new block, hashing, and appending it to the blockchain. The computational time for blockchain transactions is given by:

\({T_{tx}}={T_{block\_creation}}+{T_{hashing}}+{T_{block\_append}}\)

Where:

\(\:T_{{block\_creation}}\): is the time to create the new block.

\(\:{T}_{hashing}\): is the time taken to generate the hash of the block.

\(\:{T}_{block\_append}\): is the time to append the block to the blockchain.

T_pow: The Proof of Work mechanism ensures the integrity of the blockchain by requiring nodes to solve a computational puzzle before adding a block. The time for consensus mechanism execution can be represented as:

Where:

\(\:{T}_{solve}\): is the time to solve the computational puzzle.

N: is the number of nodes in the blockchain network.

T_alert: When sensor data falls outside the predefined thresholds (e.g., abnormal heart rate or blood pressure), real-time alerts are generated for healthcare professionals. The time for alert generation is calculated as:

Where:

\(\:{T}_{detection}\): is the time taken to detect abnormal readings from the sensor data.

\(\:{T}_{notification}\): is the time taken to notify healthcare professionals via the alert system.

T_db: To ensure the system can retrieve patient data efficiently for analysis or monitoring, the time for fetching patient records from the off-chain database is evaluated:

Where:

\(\:{T}_{db,i}\): is the time to retrieve the i-th patient's data from the database.

Table 5 presents the computational time analysis of key operations in the EHRGuard system, showcasing its efficiency in managing patient health data. The data encryption operation takes an average of 150 ms, ensuring fast and secure handling of patient information. Blockchain transaction processing requires 250 ms on average, reflecting the time needed to create, hash, and store a new block in the blockchain for maintaining data integrity. The Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, essential for blockchain security, averages 500 ms, introducing some latency due to its computational complexity. Real-time alert generation for abnormal sensor readings takes just 80 ms on average, ensuring timely notifications for healthcare professionals. Lastly, data retrieval from the off-chain database averages 60 ms, enabling quick access to patient records. Overall, the system demonstrates efficient performance, balancing security, real-time monitoring, and data integrity with minimal delays, making EHRGuard suitable for real-time healthcare applications.

The comparison of the proposed EHRGuard system with existing systems is summarized in Table 6, underscores its superiority in addressing crucial parameters related to privacy, security, and overall functionality. This comprehensive evaluation reveals significant advancements and performance enhancements over current systems, solidifying the proposed method as a robust solution for modern healthcare challenges. The key parameters considered in the comparison include immutability, access control, and use of sensors, integrity, availability, confidentiality, privacy, traceability, scalability, service reliability, communication overhead, interoperability, and cost. The proposed EHRGuard system excels in these aspects, demonstrating its capacity to meet and exceed the expectations set by current systems. The system's immutability ensures the integrity and permanence of health records, mitigating the risk of unauthorized alterations. Robust access control mechanisms guarantee that only authorized individuals have appropriate levels of data access, bolstering confidentiality and privacy. The incorporation of sensors enhances the system's capabilities for remote patient monitoring, facilitating proactive healthcare interventions. Moreover, the system exhibits high availability, ensuring uninterrupted access to critical healthcare data. Privacy and confidentiality are prioritized, addressing concerns associated with the sensitive nature of health information. Traceability features enable a transparent audit trail, fostering accountability and compliance. The system's scalability ensures adaptability to varying demands, while its reliability in service delivery instills confidence in users. Notably, the proposed system minimizes communication overhead, promoting efficient data exchange. Interoperability considerations allow seamless integration with existing healthcare infrastructures, fostering a cohesive healthcare ecosystem. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of the proposed system positions it as a practical and sustainable solution for healthcare institutions. In conclusion, the experimental results and functionalities showcased by the proposed EHRGuard system substantiate its capacity to not only address but surpass the privacy and security constraints present in current systems. The innovative approach of remotely monitoring patients while securely sharing healthcare data marks a significant advancement, aligning with the evolving landscape of modern healthcare practices. The proposed method emerges as a pioneering solution, poised to elevate the standards of healthcare data management and patient care.

The EHRGuard system plays a pivotal role in transforming healthcare delivery by leveraging the integration of IoMT sensors, blockchain technology, and off-chain databases. One of the primary applications of this system is in remote patient monitoring, especially for patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or heart disease. For instance, a diabetic patient is equipped with continuous glucose monitoring sensors that track glucose levels in real time. These readings are transmitted wirelessly to a Raspberry Pi gateway, which forwards the data to the EHRGuard system. The system analyzes the data, and if an abnormal spike or drop in glucose levels is detected, a real-time alert is sent to the patient's healthcare provider, ensuring timely intervention and preventing severe complications. In the case of heart disease management, patients are equipped with heart rate monitors, and any irregularity in heart rate, detected by the sensors, triggers an automatic alert for immediate medical attention.

In emergency medical scenarios, the EHRGuard system facilitates swift decision-making and action. For example, a patient arriving at an emergency room (ER) with chest pain could have their vitals continuously monitored through IoMT devices, and their health data, including medical history and past diagnoses, is immediately available to the ER team. This enables healthcare providers to make quick, well-informed decisions about the necessary treatment plan. If the patient's readings indicate signs of a potential heart attack or other critical condition, the system generates alerts that notify the attending physicians and nurses in real-time, streamlining the emergency response and improving patient outcomes. The data recorded from this interaction is also securely stored on the blockchain, creating a transparent and tamper-proof record of the patient's treatment during the emergency.

Telemedicine consultations also benefit from the capabilities of EHRGuard. For instance, a patient consulting with a physician remotely could share their health data through the system. The doctor, with secure access to the patient's medical records and real-time sensor data (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen levels), can make a comprehensive diagnosis even without an in-person visit. If the patient's health data shows abnormal readings, the system automatically flags these for the physician's attention. This capability enhances the accuracy and safety of remote healthcare, especially for patients in rural or underserved areas.

The system also plays a critical role in medication adherence monitoring. For example, a patient prescribed medication for hypertension may forget to take their medicine or may not follow the recommended schedule. With IoMT-enabled devices like blood pressure monitors, EHRGuard tracks the patient's readings over time and can automatically detect patterns that suggest non-adherence to the prescribed medication regimen. The system will notify the healthcare provider, who can then intervene by advising the patient or adjusting the prescription if necessary. This proactive approach ensures better treatment compliance and improved patient outcomes.

In medical research, EHRGuard supports the collection of anonymized health data for studies by securely storing and recording patient information in a blockchain ledger. Researchers can access this data, ensuring it remains authentic and tamper-proof. For example, researchers studying the effectiveness of a new drug can track and analyze data from a large number of patients participating in clinical trials. The blockchain ensures that the integrity of the data is preserved, and the anonymization of sensitive patient information ensures privacy. Additionally, the system's flexibility allows researchers to aggregate data across multiple hospitals and clinics, making it possible to conduct large-scale studies without compromising data security or patient privacy.

Emergency response systems are another important area where EHRGuard proves useful. Suppose an elderly patient with a history of respiratory conditions experiences difficulty breathing while at home. The system, continuously monitoring the patient's vital signs, detects the change in oxygen levels and immediately sends an alert to emergency responders and the patient's primary care provider. This allows for quick intervention and reduces the chances of the situation escalating into a medical emergency.

Finally, the patient consent and data privacy management feature of EHRGuard allows patients to control their health data. Before any health record is added to the system, patients must give explicit consent, which is stored on the blockchain, ensuring that any subsequent access or modification of their data is logged and can be reviewed for transparency. This is especially crucial for telemedicine, where patients need confidence that their data is protected, and that they have control over who can access it.

Through these real-time applications, EHRGuard not only improves the quality of healthcare but also ensures that patient data remains secure, transparent, and accessible only to authorized individuals. The integration of IoMT devices, blockchain, and off-chain databases allows the system to bridge the gap between secure data management and effective patient care, offering a comprehensive solution for modern healthcare challenges.

The scalability of the EHRGuard system is essential for its successful implementation in a global healthcare network where multiple devices and users generate large volumes of data. To ensure the system performs efficiently, even with a massive surge in users and devices, several strategies have been incorporated into the system design. These strategies focus on maintaining high performance, low latency, and system stability while supporting large-scale deployments in real-time healthcare applications.

In large-scale environments, load balancing becomes essential to prevent bottlenecks and ensure that the system can handle a large influx of data without compromising its responsiveness. EHRGuard employs a distributed architecture that is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers. Load balancing techniques are utilized to distribute the computational and storage load evenly across the network, reducing the risk of overloading individual nodes and ensuring that the system continues to provide fast, responsive access to patient data. In this distributed setup, multiple healthcare institutions, hospitals, and even individual practitioners can connect to the system simultaneously. The decentralized approach of the permissioned blockchain further enhances this architecture by enabling a distributed consensus mechanism. Blockchain nodes, including full nodes in hospitals and light nodes on mobile devices, participate in the consensus process to validate transactions and maintain the integrity of the data, ensuring the system scales with the increasing number of devices and healthcare providers.

One of the key components of EHRGuard's scalability lies in the hybrid storage model that combines both blockchain and off-chain databases. Blockchain provides the secure, tamper-resistant storage of critical transaction data, such as patient health records and sensor readings. However, storing large volumes of raw sensor data on the blockchain is inefficient and costly. Therefore, a hybrid approach is employed where high-volume data, such as IoMT sensor data and medical imaging, are stored in off-chain databases, while only the essential hashes, metadata, and transaction logs are recorded on the blockchain. The off-chain database can scale independently from the blockchain, allowing for rapid data retrieval and efficient management of large data sets without overwhelming the blockchain's storage capacity. With this architecture, as the number of devices and sensors increases, the off-chain database can expand dynamically to accommodate the surge in data, ensuring that the performance of the overall system remains unaffected.

To further enhance scalability and reduce latency, EHRGuard integrates edge computing with cloud storage solutions. Edge computing nodes are strategically placed closer to the devices, such as IoMT sensors, allowing for real-time data processing at the edge. This approach reduces the amount of raw data that needs to be transmitted to the central server or cloud, minimizing network congestion and speeding up decision-making for healthcare providers. Additionally, real-time sensor data analysis can be performed locally, triggering alerts, when necessary, thus improving the overall responsiveness of the system. Cloud computing complements edge computing by providing scalable storage and computational resources. As the volume of data generated by patients and healthcare devices increases, the system can seamlessly scale by utilizing cloud infrastructure to store and process large amounts of data. The cloud platform can accommodate the growing data storage needs while ensuring that the performance of the system is not compromised.

As the number of devices and users increases, ensuring that the blockchain network remains scalable is vital. EHRGuard leverages a permissioned blockchain, where only authorized participants are allowed to validate transactions and participate in the consensus process. This mechanism improves performance compared to public blockchains, as the number of nodes in the network is restricted to trusted parties, reducing the computational load. To further enhance scalability, EHRGuard uses an optimized consensus algorithm tailored for healthcare applications. This algorithm reduces the time required for transaction validation, ensuring that the system can handle a high transaction throughput while maintaining the integrity and immutability of the data. By using a lightweight, permissioned blockchain, the system ensures that even as the network grows, the consensus process remains efficient and the blockchain's storage and processing requirements are kept within practical limits.

The dynamic nature of healthcare systems, where the number of connected devices and users fluctuates, requires dynamic resource allocation. EHRGuard leverages cloud-based elasticity to scale the system's resources up or down based on demand. For instance, during periods of high activity, such as large-scale health emergencies or seasonal healthcare needs, the cloud infrastructure automatically allocates more computational power and storage capacity to handle the increased load. Similarly, during low-traffic periods, the system can scale down resources, optimizing costs and maintaining system efficiency. This dynamic resource allocation ensures that EHRGuard is able to accommodate fluctuations in healthcare demand, ensuring the system is both cost-effective and responsive to real-time needs.

As the number of devices and users grows, it becomes increasingly important to optimize data validation and storage protocols. EHRGuard uses efficient hashing algorithms and data compression techniques to minimize the data footprint on the blockchain. This ensures that the blockchain does not become bloated as more transactions are recorded. The validation process is optimized to ensure that only necessary data is included on the blockchain, while larger datasets are stored off-chain, making the system more scalable. In addition, the use of sharding techniques in the blockchain network allows for parallel processing of transactions, reducing bottlenecks and improving the speed and efficiency of the consensus mechanism. By partitioning the blockchain network into smaller, manageable units, sharding enhances the system's ability to scale horizontally while maintaining high levels of security.

Scalability is not just about handling larger amounts of data and more users; it also involves ensuring system reliability in the face of potential failures. EHRGuard incorporates fault-tolerant mechanisms and high-availability strategies to ensure the system remains operational even if certain components fail. Redundant nodes, automated failover systems, and real-time monitoring tools are in place to ensure that if a node or server becomes unavailable, data can still be accessed from another node without disruption. The decentralized nature of the blockchain network further strengthens fault tolerance, as data is not stored in a single location, and every participating node maintains a copy of the blockchain. This ensures that even in the event of network partitioning or server downtime, the system remains operational, and that patient data is always accessible.

In conclusion, the integration of blockchain technology into Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for smart hospitals represents a transformative advancement in addressing the critical challenges of privacy and security in healthcare data management. Traditional EHR systems, with their inherent vulnerabilities and risks, have necessitated the exploration of innovative solutions, and blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful tool in this domain. By leveraging blockchain's core principles of decentralization, immutability, transparency, and consensus, the proposed system provides a robust framework for securing sensitive health information. Cryptographic techniques and smart contracts further enhance the system by enabling secure storage, retrieval, and granular access control, effectively preventing unauthorized data manipulation or access. The fusion of blockchain and EHRs marks a paradigm shift toward a more patient-centric, interoperable, and secure healthcare ecosystem. Patients gain greater control over their health data, assured by the tamper-resistant and transparent nature of blockchain-ledger storage. Healthcare providers benefit from streamlined data sharing, which improves care coordination and supports more informed decision-making. Case studies and real-world use cases highlight the practical successes of blockchain in healthcare, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating data breaches, enhancing interoperability, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations. However, challenges such as scalability, regulatory compliance, and the need for standardized frameworks remain. Addressing these challenges requires a collaborative effort from stakeholders, including healthcare providers, technology developers, and policymakers, to establish guidelines and standards that facilitate the seamless integration of blockchain into healthcare infrastructures. Despite these hurdles, the potential of blockchain to revolutionize healthcare data management is undeniable, paving the way for a more secure, efficient, and patient-focused future in healthcare.

April 11th, 2025 – Dublin, Ireland



Headquartered in Ireland with recognized legal status under EU law, the Foundation is positioned as a global nonprofit entity committed to reshaping the future of public trust and sustainable development by bridging governments, civil society, and the tech community.

The Foundation's governance is led by a distinguished board of directors composed of former heads of state from Europe. The board is chaired by Bertie Ahern, former three-term Prime Minister of Ireland and a key architect of the Good Friday Agreement. Board members include Lawrence Gonzi (former Prime Minister of Malta), Péter Medgyessy (former Prime Minister of Hungary), Danilo Türk (former President of Slovenia), and Petar Stoyanov (former President of Bulgaria).

The Foundation is actively expanding its global advisory board, bringing together respected figures from all five continents—including former presidents, scientists, diplomats, and cultural leaders—to guide strategic planning and foster international collaboration in delivering impactful social initiatives.

At the heart of the Foundation's mission lies a commitment to public good: advancing global efforts in education, healthcare, environmental protection, and humanitarian aid. The Foundation aims to build a “verifiable model of cooperative goodwill,” powered by transparent governance and next-generation technology. As its founders emphasize, “It is not a specific technology that changes the world—but the shared consensus around trustworthy institutions and global cooperation.”

AB Charity Foundation is technically supported by AB DAO, which provides the blockchain infrastructure underpinning the Foundation's operations. Through smart contract automation, 15% to 30% of the gas fees from every transaction on the AB public chain are directed into a dedicated charity pool. This mechanism enables a new operational model for charitable funding—combining on-chain fundraising, automated distribution, full-chain auditability, and third-party compliance assurance.

In addition, 15% to 30% of the returns generated from investments by the AB Ecosystem Fund will also be directed into the Foundation's pool. The fund has already supported dozens of projects, with more initiatives in the pipeline—strengthening the financial sustainability of the Foundation's mission.

By leveraging blockchain's inherent transparency, the Foundation aspires to become a scalable model for next-generation philanthropic infrastructure—ensuring every donation is traceable, every distribution verifiable, and every intention honored.

Remember when CryptoPunks were the ultimate flex?

The 10,000 avatars issued by Larva Labs back in 2017, were among the crown jewels of the non-fungible token (NFT) craze in 2021. Some NFTs of that collection fetched as high as $56 million worth of ether (ETH) on the open market in 2024.

The top five most expensive NFTs belong to the CryptoPunk collection, data from NFT analytics service CryptoSlam shows. But holders seem to be moving their money out.

The wallet behind CryptoPunks #3100, the third-highest NFT sale ever, sold their collectible earlier Friday for 4,000 ETH — a 500 ETH haircut worth over $10 million in dollar terms as ETH has itself dove nearly 60% in the past year.

Punk 3100 bought for 4,000 ETH ($6,084,359.86 USD) by 0x074ad7 from 0x705876. https://t.co/YMzLi5i8se #cryptopunks #ethereum pic.twitter.com/2dsOqsjAc0

That's still a relatively high price for CryptoPunk compared to the collection's floor price — or the minimum asking rate — of 42 ETH, or about $65,000, per CoinGecko. #3100's value was driven by its rarity of being an “alien” (9 of 9985 punks) and wearing a hairband (406 of 9742 punks).

NFT trading volumes have been on a general decline since 2021, bar a few spikes amid frenzied periods. Overall sales dipped to just over $58 million as on April 7, reaching levels previously seen in early 2021.

Digital assets transactions from Bitcoin, XRP, other cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) must be reported on taxpayer's tax returns. The Internal Revenue Service says that income from digital assets like Bitcoin and other tokens is taxable.

Millions of Americans use cryptocurrency. About 17% of U.S. adults say they have ever invested in, traded or used a cryptocurrency, according to 2024 findings from the Pew Research Center.

As tax season nears its end, here's what to know about reporting report crypto such as Bitcoin to the IRS.

The IRS says that individuals who sold crypto, received it as payment, or had other digital asset transactions must accurately report it on their tax return.

This includes convertible virtual currency and cryptocurrency, stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). For tax purposes, the agency treats digital assets as property, not currency.

The ""Yes"" or ""No"" digital assets question listed on federal income tax returns must be answered correctly:

""At any time during the tax year, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?""

According to an IRS, you answer ""yes"" if you received digital assets (crypto, Bitcoin, NFTs) as payment for property or services, from a reward or award, from mining, staking and similar activities, and more criteria.

If you're unsure how to respond to the digital assets question, the IRS provides a questionnaire to help determine how to answer it. Generally, if you had any digital asset transactions, you check ""yes,"" but if not, you check ""no.""

Everyone who files must answer the digital asset question that appears at the top of these forms:

Taxpayers must report all income related to their digital asset transactions, the IRS notes, regardless of whether they result in a taxable gain or loss. Here's what the agency recommends when reporting crypto and other digital asset transactions.

The general deadline to file a federal return with the IRS is just days away, on April 15, 2025. For state taxes, the deadline in Ohio is also April 15, with an extension filing deadline of October 15, 2025.","{'href': 'https://www.dispatch.com', 'title': 'The Columbus Dispatch'}","cryptocurrency"

The Rosen Law Firm PA


NEW YORK, April  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 

WHY: Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, reminds purchasers of Game of Silks non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”), including Silks Avatar NFTs, Silks Horse NFTs, and Silks Land NFTs, and who were damaged thereby, of the important April 25, 2025 lead plaintiff deadline.

SO WHAT: If you purchased Game of Silks NFTs you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement.

WHAT TO DO NEXT: To join the Game of Silks class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35918 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than April 25, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.

WHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are merely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.

DETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, Game of Silks created a metaverse  game that brought real-life horse racing to the blockchain, allowing users to invest in virtual versions of real racehorses and earn money based on the real-world performance of those horses. The complaint further alleges that the Game of Silks NFTs, which were first sold beginning in April 2022, are securities as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), and as such required registration statements, which were never filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Game of Silks violated the Securities Act by selling and soliciting the sale of unregistered Game of Silks NFT securities.

Further, the complaint also alleges that the defendants made material misstatements and omissions in connection with the sale of the Game of Silks NFTs, including failing to disclose critical financial information about Game of Silks' business model and sustainability.

To join the Game of Silks class action, go to   https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=35918 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class action.

No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.

About us

Copy link

A trader who purchased a rare CryptoPunk last year sold the NFT on Thursday for a $10 million loss.

The trader bought CryptoPunk 3100 for $16 million in March last year. The sale became the third-highest price paid for a CryptoPunk in the collection's history.

CryptoPunks are a collection of 10,000 unique, pixel art pictures created by the development studio Larva Labs. Each image is linked to a non-fungible token, or NFT.

This particular CryptoPunk is highly coveted because it is one of only nine with the rare alien trait. For NFTs, rarity is often correlated to higher prices in a given collection.

The sale comes as prices of high-value NFTs return to earth after Bitcoin soared above $100,000 late last year. 

At the time, CryptoPunks sold for a minimum of $158,000. Now, the cheapest examples from the collection only sell for around $65,000 — a 58% drop. 

The identity of the latest buyer remains unknown.

It's hard to estimate the value of rare CryptoPunks like 3100.

Sales are infrequent, and, just like in the art world, value is highly subjective. 

When CryptoPunk 3100 was previously bought in March 2024, it wasn't the only alien CryptoPunk sale that happened around that time. 

The same month, alien CryptoPunk 7804 sold for $16.5 million, while another alien, 635, sold for $12.5 million in April. 

The recent sale of 3100 may impact the perceived value of other alien CryptoPunks. At just over $6 million, it's the lowest price paid for an alien CryptoPunk since the collection exploded in popularity in early 2021. 

Before the sale, NFT Valuations, a site that uses AI to price rare NFTs, estimated the value of CryptoPunk 3100 at around $8 million. 

“Hard to say who made the better move, the seller who walked away with $6 million, or the buyer,” said one NFT collector on X.

The CryptoPunks NFTs were launched in June 2017 by the Larva Labs studio on Ethereum.

The collection soared in popularity during the NFT craze of 2021, with the cheapest examples from the collection selling for upwards of $415,000 each at the peak. 

In March 2022, Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, announced it had acquired the CryptoPunks rights from Larva Labs for an undisclosed sum.

CryptoPunks are viewed as a sign of status in the crypto industry, particularly among the Ethereum community.

Many celebrities and crypto influencers own CryptoPunks, including rapper Jay-Z, billionaire Mark Cuban, and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.

LMMY has announced a strategic partnership with China Recycling Energy  (CREG) that merges EdTech with clean energy through two main initiatives. First, they'll jointly develop green energy storage NFTs backed by actual energy projects and integrated into LMMY's TwoPlus1® virtual economy. Second, they're creating a Metaverse-based energy storage demonstration platform where users can engage with virtual energy systems.

This partnership represents LMMY's attempt to differentiate in the competitive EdTech space by incorporating sustainability elements while potentially creating new revenue streams through digital assets. However, the announcement lacks critical details on monetization mechanisms, revenue projections, or investment requirements from either party.

The strategic value appears aspirational rather than immediately material. While innovative, both NFTs and metaverse technologies have seen declining market interest since their 2021-2022 peak, raising questions about timing. For LMMY specifically, this represents product diversification but with uncertain demand. The partnership may enhance LMMY's ESG positioning and potentially attract sustainability-focused educational institutions to their platform, but the financial impact remains speculative without concrete metrics or timetables for implementation.

Gate Technology Incorporated (Gate.io)




PANAMA CITY, April  11, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global leading cryptocurrency exchange Gate.io is marking a significant milestone—its 12th anniversary—by unveiling a comprehensive brand upgrade, including the debut of its new official Chinese name, ""Damen"" (大门, meaning ""The Gate""). Under the theme ""12 Years, One Gate, One World"", Gate.io reflects on its journey of growth and transformation, while embracing a bold new vision for the future, showcasing its ambition to build a more open, diverse, and innovative Web3 ecosystem for users worldwide.

12 Years of Innovation: Establishing Prestigious Global Leadership

Since its inception in 2013, Gate.io has emerged as a blockchain innovation powerhouse, offering reliable and versatile digital asset trading services. Today, Gate.io has grown into a top global leading crypto exchange, serving over 22 million users globally, consistently ranking among the top three exchanges by liquidity and ranking top 2 in 24-hour spot trading volume. The platform supports over 3,800 cryptocurrencies across spot trading, futures, leverage, and other financial products, offering a wide range of investment opportunities.

Among the keystones cementing Gate.io's dominance in crypto space, GateToken (GT), Gate.io's native platform token, has been a cornerstone of its ecosystem since the launch of GateChain's mainnet in 2019. GT reached an all-time high of $25.960, with a total market capitalization surpassing $2.94 billion, propelling its market rank into the global Top 40.

Moreover, Gate.io's established crypto financial ecosystem has also played a crucial role in driving industry transparency. As the first mainstream exchange to commit to 100% proof of reserves, it partnered with U.S. audit firm Armanino LLP, leveraging the Merkle Tree open-source framework for regular asset reserve disclosures. As of January 17, 2025, Gate.io's total reserves exceeded $10 billion, ranking fourth globally, with an above-average reserve ratio of 128.58%, ensuring verifiability and security for user assets.

Cross-Industry Partnerships: Expanding Web3's Global Influence

Gate.io is actively fostering cross-industry partnerships to elevate the crypto industry's global reach. In 2024, Gate.io partnered with FC Internazionale Milano, or Inter, marking a new era of integration between crypto and traditional sports. As the Official Sleeve Partner for Inter, Gate.io's brand images have been prominently featured at San Siro Stadium, Serie A, and UEFA Champions League matches. Through VIP events and joint activities, Gate.io is bringing crypto closer to football enthusiasts, building a global fan community, and exploring new possibilities for sports and digital assets.

In the first quarter of 2025, Gate.io announced a landmark sponsorship deal with Oracle Red Bull Racing in Formula 1, becoming the team's exclusive cryptocurrency exchange partner. As an eight-time F1 world champion, Oracle Red Bull Racing is synonymous with excellence and speed, a vision that aligns with Gate.io's cutting-edge innovation in digital finance. This partnership is a strategic milestone, accelerating blockchain adoption and expanding Web3 solutions to a broader global audience.

Strategic Brand Upgrade: Embracing A New Identity for the Future

Over the past 12 years, Gate.io has witnessed the rapid evolution of the crypto industry and proactively adapted to market shifts. From a Bitcoin trading platform to a comprehensive blockchain ecosystem, Gate.io is now embracing its next evolution with the introduction of the new Chinese Name ""Damen"" (meaning ""The Gate""). The new brand identity symbolizes openness, fairness, and innovation, reflecting Gate.io's commitment to bridging the global crypto economy with cutting-edge technology and trusted financial infrastructure.

More than just a name change, this brand evolution marks a strategic upgrade—shifting from a traditional exchange to a fully integrated Web3 ecosystem. Under this new vision, Gate.io is focused on enhancing user experience, driving technological innovation, and expanding decentralized finance solutions, making blockchain technology more accessible, secure, and intuitive for users worldwide.

Commemorating 12 Years with Exclusive Events in Dubai

The 12th Anniversary Celebration is expected to attract over a thousand top global investors, blockchain entrepreneurs, project teams, and industry leaders, joining Gate.io in celebrating this significant occasion. Adding to the festivities, SPORT3 DUBAI 2025 will introduce a unique blend of sports and blockchain, creating a dynamic and engaging atmosphere for industry professionals to connect. Through this initiative, Gate.io aims to foster cross-industry collaboration, encourage meaningful dialogue, and drive innovation in blockchain-powered sports applications.

From the ""Gateway to Crypto"" over a decade ago to pioneering the next chapter of blockchain evolution, the platform remains committed to its mission. Standing at the crossroads of a new era, Gate.io embraces its new transformation, not just a rebrand, but as a renewed commitment to empowering users, advancing technology, and shaping the future of the blockchain ecosystem.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=crypto+technology","Tradingview crypto: Marso.Tech, HIRO, and StupidCoin lead the ranking","https://en.cryptonomist.ch/2025/04/11/tradingview-crypto-marso-tech-hiro-and-stupidcoin-lead-the-ranking/","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:05:07 GMT","

In the last 24 hours, according to data from Tradingview, the crypto market has recorded surprising performances: some altcoins have posted triple-digit increases, awakening the interest of investors and analysts.

Among these, Marso.Tech, HIRO, and StupidCoin stand out, with growths of +643.63%, +603.93%, and +279.47% respectively.

Summary

Marso.Tech (MARSO), with a growth of +643.63%, dominates the ranking. The crypto has a price of 0.000075850 USD and a contained market capitalization (764,000 USD), with a circulating supply of over 10 billion tokens. Despite the scarcity of information about the project, speculative interest seems high, typical of micro-cap.

Follows HIRO, with a +603.93%. Here too we are talking about a crypto at a very low price (0.000411299 USD) and with an even smaller market cap (93,070 USD). The high relative volume (over 34,000 USD in the last 24h) indicates an unusual trading flow, often a symptom of temporary pumps.

The meme coin continue to surprise. StupidCoin records a +279.47% with a market cap of 1.8 million USD and almost a billion tokens in circulation. The dynamics are similar to those seen with Dogecoin or Shiba Inu: large community, viral narrative, and movement on social media.

Similar is the case for Jerry, which marks a +168.72% and even has 1 billion tokens in circulation. The capitalization, however, is more limited (645,210 USD), making the token particularly exposed to short-term manipulations.

BurgerCities (BURGER) grows by +184.76% and stands out from the others due to a more solid base: capitalization of 1.4 million USD and presence in the DeFi and decentralized gaming sector. The daily trading volume is remarkable (almost 600,000 USD), indicating a growing interest in play-to-earn projects.

Another example is Kryptomon (KMON), with a +110.08% and a hybrid category between gaming, NFT and collectibles. Even though the unit price is low (0.00026884 USD), the circulating supply (189 million) and the contained market capitalization (51,000 USD) make it a high-risk bet.

The current price explosion in many small cap and meme coin could represent the beginning of a new speculative phase:

However, this scenario depends on a favorable macro condition and the maintenance of positive sentiment, which currently remains fragile.

On the other hand, there are signals that evoke speculative dynamics typical of bubbles:

In this context, enthusiasm can quickly turn into panic, especially if Bitcoin were to correct or negative news were to emerge from regulatory authorities.

The crypto market continues to prove highly volatile and full of surprises. The extreme performances of Marso.Tech, HIRO, and other altcoins highlight the return of speculation, especially in the meme coin sector and low-capitalization projects.

However, it is important to distinguish between momentary movements and structural trends. The coming days will be crucial to understand if we are at the beginning of a new expansionary cycle or simply in a short speculative rally.

During the Paris Blockchain Week 2025, a panel titled “Decentralised Intelligence: Creating a New Digital Era” was held, organized on the main stage sponsored by Ripple. 

On stage, experts in AI, finance, Web3, and technological innovation discussed the joint impact of blockchain and artificial intelligence on a global scale.

A discussion rich in insights on innovation, regulation, tech geopolitics, and entrepreneurial opportunities.

Panelist:

Summary

During one of the most anticipated Web3 events of the year, contrary to the dominant narrative that describes AI as a disruptive force, the speakers emphasized that it is actually an additive technology, capable of enhancing the existing rather than overturning it. 

With the exception of a particularly sensitive area: the social and cultural sphere.

“The big players in AI avoid direct confrontation with social media. But those who are outside these cultural constraints can experiment freely, integrating intelligent agents on Twitter, Discord, and Slack to truly change the way we communicate.”

With the exponential increase in interaction between intelligent agents, the need arises for structures capable of coordinating, monitoring, and regulating processes in a transparent and scalable way. And this is where blockchain comes into play.

“Settlement and accountability systems on a large scale cannot exist without advanced blockchain architectures. Only by testing the limits of these networks can we truly unlock trillions of dollars in value.”

In the current macroeconomic landscape, the tensions between the United States and China directly affect technological development. Control over semiconductor production is today one of the most sensitive strategic nodes, with direct impacts on the progress of AI.

“It is essential to monitor the dynamics of the technological war, from chip restrictions to commercial relationships. All of this will directly influence the evolution of AI in the coming months.”

From automatic coding to the discovery of new materials, the era of autonomous AI agents — defined as the agentic revolution — is transforming human productivity.

“In my team I said: consider that we have hired a new colleague. It is an automatic co-writer, and in a year it will have to know how to write code on its own.”

A revolution that does not eliminate jobs, but transforms them, increasing speed, quality, and accessibility.

The combination of AI and blockchain opens the doors to an era of widespread and accessible wealth. New generations of entrepreneurs will be able to access tools never seen before, capable of multiplying productivity and drastically reducing entry barriers.

“We are entering an era of 100x innovation. Better, faster, cheaper. It is a historic opportunity.”

Technologies like AI and blockchain are not just tools, but transformative forces. The real challenge will be to build a shared, connected, and collaborative intelligence.

“The future of intelligence belongs to those who design it together.”

              South Korea leads in digital asset takeover within the last ten years. A cocktail of technological advancement, young investors, and a connected society created a breeding ground for trading practices.
            

The digital financial landscape has changed constantly with South Korea being at a crossroads. The country-long regarded as the most enthusiastic adopter of blockchain technology and digital assets-is now tightening its regulatory grip. From being a refuge for tech-savvy investors, the West has become somewhat of a battleground for innovation versus regulation. The crackdown on cryptos in South Korea is not only an internal change of policy; it is a broader reflection of the true conflict between financial freedom and systemic security around the globe.

Among the pack, South Korea leads in digital asset takeover within the last ten years. A cocktail of technological advancement, young investors, and a connected society created a breeding ground for trading practices. For many of Korea's youth, digital assets came to symbolize not only a financial instrument, but also an economic opportunity in an otherwise unfair society where avenues of traditional wealth—like real estate—seemed permanently closed.

It raised alarm bells concerning rapid growth in trading volume and speculation. It attracted money-laundering, tax evasion, and increased absence of proper investor protection. Also, open-ended markets, lack of transparency, and cyber threats just continued shaking trust. What once considered the booming frontier now began showing signs of fragility.

The government of South Korea would have to respond with increasing urgency by launching a series of legislative and regulatory measures aimed at tightening the government's nosebleed level of oversight. This shift denoted the beginning of a new chapter-the one in which unchecked innovation need no longer be tolerated.

While much of the world continues to debate under which laws to treat digital assets, South Korea has taken a more proactive approach. The regulatory bodies began developing a tailored framework that explicitly delineated the responsibilities of market participants, including mandatory registration of trading platforms, extensive anti-money laundering measures, and disclosure requirements aimed at enhancing transparency.

Together with the preliminary legislative moves, the authorities proposed licensing schemes that required operators to comply with traditional financial standards. In its nature, this went beyond the punitive—this was also about legitimizing the space. By raising the threshold, South Korea would look to push out malefactors and create a fertile ground for responsible development.

Reactions were mixed toward such policies. Clarity was welcomed by some; over-regulation, they felt, would come in the way of innovation and push developers and investors away to jurisdictions with lighter regulations. Hence, the regulators' task remained to demarcate the line to allow for enough security while not curtailing progress.

Something South Korea decides in crypto will echo far beyond its borders. It happens to be one of the most technologically advanced economies in Asia, and thus its policy decisions often serve as a model-or cautionary tale-for its neighbors.

The neighboring countries are looking on. Some countries might emulate South Korea's stringent approach, viewing it as a necessary step toward legitimizing an outright industry. Others may take a more laissez-faire stance, hoping to attract talent and capital through lighter regulatory treatment.

Of course, the danger with any disunity in regulation is that it invites arbitrage, so that actors simply migrate to jurisdictions with the fewest restrictions. This underscores the need for greater international collaboration towards harmonization of the regulatory landscape-and this is easier said than done.

Regulatory and innovation contradictions are inherent in their nature, for as they create an environment free of scam and stabilize the market, it hinders sometimes free innovations or developments. The new regime comes with two-edged swords when this applies to developers and entrepreneurs in South Korea. Some appreciated the clarity it brings, so they use it as a springboard to a more robust and compliant platform. Others, meanwhile, argue that these two impediments and costs of compliance weigh heavily on small players and on startups, giving rise to the feeling that in the end, only the largest might have the resources to survive, reducing competition.

These, however, are big assumptions in contrary of the historical record, quite resilient has been the technology sector in South Korea. The same country that created some of the finest technological innovations in the world may just somehow adapt or survive, even against heavier regulation.

It is not the closing of the road, but rather a calibration. South Korea knows what to do as authorities learn, adjust and evolve with the environment. Coming changes in regulation will bridge other gaps such as decentralized platforms, digital national identity validation, and cross-border cooperation.

Most importantly, a balancing act is needed as any regulatory change is put in place-the extremes of either having too much oversight or too little. Too tight will kill the country's perhaps most innovative financial sector in history, while too lax will leave serious and devastating risks for citizens. Given its reputation for forward-thinking governance and high technological agility, South Korea is poised perfectly to strike the balance.

It may be able to protect this market and even shape the future of digital finance in Asia and other parts of the globe.

              Entering the world of digital assets in the UAE is no isolated endeavor. It is a part of a larger commitment to envision the future on economic, technological, and societal fronts.
            

Whatever happens, be it the winds of change or innovation, they are on a high in the Middle East. The beaming ambition-which at its crux lies the UAE-sets a vision for becoming an international standard for digital assets. The UAE-that which was once living on oil and tall buildings-presently wants to make itself known to the world as a cutting-edge leader in financial innovation-to make a statement about what being a digital-first economy really is at the intersection of technology, regulation, and global trade.

For decades, wealth in the UAE was synonymous with hydrocarbons. Now, as world conversations shift to diversification and sustainability, the UAE doesn't want to be left behind. Instead of resisting changes, the UAE is embracing them-reinventing itself as an economy typified by technology, green energy, and fintech. Of this recalibration, digital assets have become a pillar for the growth of the future.

The leadership's outlook, however, goes above merely being abreast of global tendencies; it sets the trends itself. The country is using its established economic infrastructure to assist the tacit integration of digital asset frameworks into traditional finance-initiating regulatory clarity, building local talent, and engaging with global thought leaders-while the respected financial centers of Abu Dhabi and Dubai are already in the forefront of the international scene..

Perhaps the most alluring facet of the UAE's response to the digital asset puzzle is that it chooses to be a player and regulator rather than a mere auditor. The UAE avoided the route to obscurity, often referred to as the ""wait-and-see"" approach, that has inhibited adoption within many jurisdictions, and has instead set in place highly sophisticated and tailored frameworks that endeavor to create a delicate balance between innovation and compliance.

Regulators collaborate with financial institutions, legal professionals, and international advisory companies to figure out an agile yet robust regulatory framework, which will protect investor interests while permitting experiments and technological evolution. This proactive perspective is, however, not built on slothfulness. Clear rules and accountable systems are the foundations upon which trust and legitimacy within the digital asset universe will arise.

Thus, it won't just be for the outside stakeholders. However, it should be a host ecosystem within which local entrepreneurs, startups, and institutional players can thrive, as it were, without fear of legal ambiguity or sudden shifts in policy. In many ways, regulation here is considered not as a barrier but as a bridge, a coolant between ambition and action.

This is a magnet for global talents and innovation. Very rightly said, innovations do not happen in a vacuum; innovation requires people, creativity, and fertile grounds for experimentation. Recognizing just this, the UAE is taking deliberate steps to attract some of the brightest talents across the globe. Offering a combination of favorable visa options, tax incentives, and setting up an R&D ecosystem puts UAE in a very good position to attract fintech leaders, blockchain developers, and digital economists.

What sets the UAE apart is not only its willingness to welcome global talent but also its serious intent to develop local capacities. With new blockchain programs popping up in universities, tech incubators cropping up all over the free zones, and industry-academia partnerships increasing, the message is hard to miss: this is not merely a marketplace; this is a thriving hub for knowledge and technological evolution.

Geography has always been one of the greatest assets of the UAE. Punctuating the junction of Asia, Europe, and Africa, it should ideally be the hub for facilitating digital asset flows across continents. Now it builds onto that by also tapping into this digital geography—connecting Western capital with Eastern innovation into a time-zone friendly gateway for 24/7 digital finance.

World-class infrastructure and digital readiness mix with this travel asset. Very high-speed internet, cloud-ready data centers have all been laid to form the physical and digital rails on which a thriving digital economy could run. These four put together with political stability and a relatively young, tech-savvy populace make a very potent cauldron for long-term leadership.

While momentum exists for the UAE working towards the digital asset agenda, hurdles abound. Volatility, cyber attacks, and the uncertainties surrounding global regulations cast long shadows over the sector. Meanwhile, the region has to balance innovation and financial integrity in the eyes of global regulators.

Also, perception will be a big challenge here. While the intent is for the UAE to create a regulated and transparent ecosystem, it still is marred by skepticism and misunderstanding across the larger area of digital assets. Demonstrating the legitimacy of this new industry will remain an ongoing challenge for traditional investors, regulatory friends, and the general public itself, needing continuous backing of action rather than mere words.

The Larger Picture: A Regional Ripple Effect As the UAE starts to stride at the head of the nations, so it has begun influencing the fortunes of neighboring countries. Indeed, as it sets the bar for digital asset adoption and regulation, much of the Arab world has followed suit, with some countries developing their frameworks that would be modeled on that balance between openness and oversight. It is in the region, which has been so often shaped by geopolitical forces and resource-based economies, that digital assets might offer a new common ground — an ambiguous one, founded on collections of shared ambition and economic diversification.

What we are witnessing is more than a national strategy-it is the beginning of a regional movement. The momentum is building, and the UAE is not just the participant in this revolution; it is one of the key architects in it.

Entering the world of digital assets in the UAE is no isolated endeavor. It is a part of a larger commitment to envision the future on economic, technological, and societal fronts. Investing in talent, technology, and trust, this nation is preparing to write the next chapter in finance.

In this fast world, where innovation always moves ahead of regulation, the UAE is leading; it enters this space with clarity of thought, intent to purpose, and the drive to change the rules of tomorrow. Doing so, she may as well become the North Star guiding other nations in this digital frontier.

World Liberty Financial, the DeFi project backed by U.S. President Donald Trump's family, has denied reports that it sold ether (ETH) earlier this week.

It was reported on Wednesday that a wallet closely linked to World Liberty Financial, which is tagged by blockchain data firm Arkham as potentially belonging to the project, sold $8 million worth of ether after surpassing $125 million in unrealized losses.

In a statement to CoinDesk, a World Liberty Financial spokesperson said: ""The claims that World Liberty Financial has sold any of its holdings are wholly inaccurate. WLFI has not sold any positions as currently reported. Speculation to the contrary is false.""

Ether has since rebounded since that sale at $1,465, currently trading at $1,553 after the crypto markets experience a minor period of relief on Wednesday.

Donald Trump's son, Eric, said that it was a ""great time to buy"" ETH in February when it traded at $2,880.

Arkham did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Onyxcoin (XCN), the native token of its namesake's modular blockchain, experienced a major boost over the past 48 hours, bucking the bearish market sentiment with a 150% rise.

Daily trading volume averaged around $25 million earlier this week until the token started to rip through levels of resistance. That figure has now ballooned to $600 million, the majority of which took place on Coinbase. 

The surge in volume and apparent lack of visible catalyst prompted Binance to list XCN futures on its exchange on Friday.

Unlike many other Binance listing announcements, the listing did not spur an additional increase in token price, which could indicate that some investors opted to ""sell the news,"" creating a type of equilibrium between new buyers and old sellers.

As the native token of Onyxchain, XCN can be used for payments within the Onyx ecosystem, this includes node deployment. It can also be used to participate in governance proposals.

The token has been trading for three years but performance was largely muted in 2023 and 2024. It then rose rapidly in January, going from $0.0025 to $0.03 in 11 days, prompting Tron founder Justin Sun to question the legitimacy of price action. 

""XCN chain is currently engaging in significant market manipulation. They are using high leverage and contract that could cause serious harm to many exchange users. I recommend that major exchanges pay close attention to this risk,"" Sun wrote in a tweet on Jan. 24 that he's since deleted.

UPDATE April 11, 15:46 UTC: Adds context about XCN token and now deleted tweet from Justin Sun.

The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has fallen below 100 and gold has surged to new all-time highs as escalating tariffs have heightened global economic uncertainty. Consequently, asset prices have taken a hit—most notably in the tech sector and cryptocurrencies. 

Since reaching its all-time high of $109,000 in January, bitcoin (BTC) has declined approximately 26%. When compared to the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks, bitcoin's drawdown sits right in the middle, signaling its growing maturity as an asset. 

Tesla (TSLA) is currently the worst performer, down nearly 50% from its peak. NVIDIA (NVDA) follows with a 31% drop. Apple (AAPL), Bitcoin, Meta (META), Google (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have all declined around 26%, while Microsoft (MSFT) stands out with a relatively modest 18% drawdown.

To highlight bitcoin's resilience in this current 3-month correction, is to compare it to a similar period during its 2021 downturn—from November 2021 to February 2022—when it plummeted 45% from $69,000 to $38,000. At that time, bitcoin was the worst performer among major tech names, though Tesla also suffered significantly.

This comparison underscores how bitcoin has grown more resilient over time as its market cycles progress and the asset continues to mature.

Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have jointly requested a pause in their respective appeals to finalize a potential settlement, per a motion filed on Thursday.



The filing signals a possible end to a high-profile dispute that has gripped the payments upstart industry since December 2020 for its sale of XRP tokens, which the SEC alleged were unregistered securities.

#XRPCommunity #SECGov v. #Ripple #XRP The parties have filed a joint motion to hold the appeal in abeyance based on the parties' agreement to settle. The settlement is awaiting Commission approval. No brief will be filed on April 16th. pic.twitter.com/OVKPCIh43H

The case has been a focal point for debates over the regulatory status of cryptocurrencies in the United States, with Ripple arguing that XRP is a currency, not a security, and thus outside the SEC's jurisdiction.

Ripple and the SEC have reached an “agreement in principle” to resolve all outstanding issues, per a post shared by attorney James Filan. 

This includes not only the SEC's appeal of the district court's final judgment but also Ripple's cross-appeal and the claims against Ripple founders Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen.



The motion requests that the court hold the appeals process in abeyance — effectively pausing it — while the parties hammer out the final terms of the settlement, which still requires formal approval from the SEC's commissioners.



This follows a similar request from the SEC and Gemini in early April, where the two parties requested the court approve a two-month pause to finalize a deal to close their long-running legal dispute over Gemini's Earn program.

Tokenized gold, such as Tether's XAUT and Paxos' PAXG continued to be a favorite of crypto investors in Asia as investors seek a safe haven despite a de-escalation in trade war tensions.

On-chain data shows that Tether's XAUT was a top-10 market performer out of all digital assets. Tether's tokenized gold, the largest by market cap, is up 3.4% in the last 24 hours.

CoinGecko data shows the sector is up 4.3% in the last 24 hours, compared to the CoinDesk 20, an index of the performance of the largest digital assets, which is down 2%.

The price of gold initially moved down during the early hours of the Asia trading day, after breaching an all-time high during the end of U.S. hours. It's currently trading for $3218 in Hong Kong.

Equity markets in Asia showed mixed performance in the morning session, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng down 0.2%, Shanghai's SSE up 0.12%, Taipei's TAIEX up 1.6%, and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 down 3.5%.

Gold typically rallies during periods of heightened economic or geopolitical uncertainty, as investors seek safety in assets seen as stores of value amid volatility. While trade tensions have calmed, investors are concerned about the lack of predictability in policy from the White House.

Gold also benefits from an inverse relationship with interest rates: lower rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding gold, making it more attractive.

Investors are also concerned about the surging U.S. budget deficit.

Halfway through fiscal year 2025, the U.S. Budget deficit increased by $1.3 trillion. So we are up to a $2.6 trillion annual rate. That rounds up to an incredible 9% of GDP. The fit is hitting the shan.

China state media is also reporting that stimulus measures are in the works for the country, with interest rate cuts and government spending to the tune of $136 billion proposed.

Other market leaders include Curve DAO's CRV, up 18% on-day after news that the U.S. plans to significantly relax rules and enforcement pertaining to Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

Bitcoin and broader crypto markets are gaining on Friday after sharply declining alongisde traditional markets Thursday.

Solana's SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) rose over 4% in the past 24 hours, leading gains among majors, with XRP (XRP), BNB Chain's BNB, and Tron's TRX up between 2%-3%. Ether (ETH) was down 2.4%, continuing a dismal run that has seen it lose 12% in the past week despite most majors down 2% on average in the same period.

The Wednesday announcement of a 90-day pause on new tariffs — excluding those on China — sparked a brief relief rally across risk assets (which reversed on Thursday), with traders pointing out bitcoin price action showed signs of bottoming in what could set the stage for a push toward $100,000 by year-end.

“The surprise policy pivot temporarily soothed market anxiety, driving short-end crypto vols lower. Still, we advocate caution,” they said, adding that while some sell at higher levels, December $100,000 calls show long-term optimism.

Ming Wu, CEO of RabbitX, called it a market U-turn. “The markets just did a 180-degree turn after President Trump's recent announcement of a 90-day pause on tariffs, excluding those on China. This policy shift has injected a dose of optimism into the markets, leading to a sharp rally in both equities and cryptocurrencies,” he said in a Telegram message to CoinDesk.

Wu noted eased trade fears, saying the pause offers “breathing space” while keeping pressure on China.

Technically, Wu sees a setup for the surge. “From a technical perspective, prior to the announcement, markets had experienced significant declines, pushing many stocks into oversold territory,” he explained. The tariff news triggered a short squeeze, with buyers jumping in at key support levels, amplifying the rally.

Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, highlighted bitcoin's 6% jump from Thursday.

“We saw a BTC's over 6% surge, reclaiming the $80K level after Trump's announcement to pause new tariffs, which sparked a broad crypto rally,” he said in an email.



Lee sees strong demand from institutions and long-term holders, viewing BTC as a hedge amid uncertainty.



“Looking ahead, the sustainability of this momentum hinges on continued macro clarity, technical strength, and market sentiment, with $80K now a key level to watch. Midweek, we predict BTC could range between $80K and $85K, with a bullish case pushing toward $85K if risk appetite persists or a pullback to $78K-$79K if uncertainties resurface. Traders should monitor macro developments and fund flows closely,” Lee ended.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cointelegraph.com","Memecoins, markets and Trump: Cointelegraph's Q1 crypto editorial roundtable","https://cointelegraph.com/news/memecoins-market-momentum-and-trump-crypto-s-q1-cointelegraph-editorial-roundtable","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:31:19 GMT","

 Cointelegraph's editorial roundtable recap of Q1 2025, from memecoins and market trends to Trump-era crypto policy and stablecoin regulation. 

The year 2025 kicked off with a bang and a meme. Just weeks into the New Year, a frenzy of politically fueled memecoins sent Crypto Twitter into overdrive, while lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic turned up the heat on stablecoins, securities laws and tokenized assets, usually with different approaches.

It was a whirlwind first quarter, shaped by Bitcoin's dominance in the crypto market and a US political climate that put digital assets back in the spotlight. Q1 delivered no shortage of storylines.

Who better to break it all down than the journalists tracking it in real time? In the latest episode of Decentralize with Cointelegraph, editorial team members sit down for an unfiltered newsroom roundtable.

Savannah Fortis, head of podcasts and EU reporter, is joined by Gareth Jenkinson, chief of multimedia; Zoltan Vardai, breaking news reporter on the EU news team; and Vince Quill, US news reporter, to reflect on Q1's biggest stories and what they signal for the months ahead.

As memecoins surged in early 2025, questions regarding their legitimacy and political entanglement intensified. For Cointelegraph's editorial team, the frenzy wasn't just a market quirk, it revealed deep tensions among innovation, opportunism and influence.

Jenkinson was first to comment on what the impact of US President Donald Trump and greater political memecoin frenzies may mean for the industry in the long term, saying, “I struggle to still trust what the Trump administration and his group of advisers are doing, when they are launching things like memecoins...”

The team acknowledged that while regulatory clarity and institutional support have created a more stable environment for crypto companies in general since the new administration took office, that progress risks being overshadowed by spectacle.

Trump's big moves seem to domino into other political figures, namely Argentina's President Javier Milei, to become entangled in a high-profile memecoin controversy that rippled far beyond national politics.

For an industry seeking legitimacy, this kind of involvement by world leaders sends a mixed message. “It's terrible for the industry,” Jenkinson added. “Milei was supposed to be a savior for Argentina after years of hyperinflation. And now he's launching a memecoin with a known rug puller.”

Still, the roundtable remained hopeful. “I'm an eternal optimist,” he continued. “At least we got the affirmation for Bitcoin. People now understand what it is, governments are starting to hold it. That's how good the fundamentals are.”

While much attention has centered on Bitcoin's institutional glow-up and the memecoin spectacle, several members of the Cointelegraph team voiced deeper concerns around emerging stablecoin legislation and the quiet moves behind it.

“One thing that I think kind of flew under the radar is that the Trump-linked World Liberty Forum actually launched a US dollar-backed stablecoin in March,” Vardai pointed out. 

The fallout from politically aligned memecoins has also weighed heavily on the broader crypto markets, particularly altcoins. “Altcoins aren't really winning at all this quarter,” Vardai also noted.

So what defined Q1 of 2025? Tune in to the full episode to hear all of the insights!

 New Hampshire is now the fourth US state to see a Bitcoin reserve bill pass through one legislative chamber, while a Florida House committee has advanced a similar bill. 

New Hampshire's House and Florida's House Insurance and Banking Committee have respectively advanced bills allowing their states to create Bitcoin reserves.

New Hampshire's House passed its Bitcoin reserve bill, HB302, in a 192-179 vote on April 10 which will now head to the Senate. The state is now the fourth to pass a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve bill through one chamber, joining Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma.

If HB302 clears New Hampshire's Senate and Governor Kelly Ayotte signs it into law it would allow the state's treasurer to use 10% of the state's general fund and other authorized funds to invest in precious metals and certain digital assets. The bill also sets out how they should be custodied.

The bill specifies that only cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of over $500 billion would be eligible for investment, a criteria that only Bitcoin currently meets.

In a debate prior to the vote, Democrat Representative Terry Spahr argued that the bill is unnecessary and could undermine the future security of the state's digital assets stockpile. 

“Unbeknownst to the committee and to the sponsor […] the treasurer testified that they already have that authority,” Spahr said. He added that cryptocurrency is “constantly shifting and changing, and it's sort of dangerous to be kind of locked into certain types of security measures, and I think that bill does this.”

Republican Representative Jordan Ulery countered that the bill was necessary as it could create the “potential for a large amount of money being earned by the state in these investments.”

New Hampshire has two other blockchain-related bills working their way through the legislature — HB310, which covers stablecoins and real-world asset tokenization (RWA) and HB 639, which deals with blockchain regulation and dispute resolution.

Meanwhile, on April 10, Florida's House Insurance and Banking Committee passed the state's Bitcoin reserve bill, HB487, with a unanimous vote.

The bill has three committees to clear before it progresses to Florida's House.

Similar to New Hampshire's bill, HB487 would allow Florida's chief financial officer and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of certain state funds — including the General Revenue Fund and the Budget Stabilization Fund — into Bitcoin.

The bill's sponsor, Republican Representative Webster Barnaby, pleaded with the Committee before the vote “to vote up on this very important bill,” which he claimed would “put Florida in the leading edge of this very new technology.”

Florida's bill gives the state's financial chief the ability to invest in digital assets directly, through certain qualified custodians, or through exchange-traded products and details security and custody requirements.

According to Bitcoin Laws, which tracks the progress of digital assets legislation, Arizona is currently leading the race to become the first US state to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

On March 24, two digital assets reserve bills, SB1373 and SB1025, cleared Arizona's House Rules Committee and are now headed to the state's House for a full floor vote. 

If passed by the House, the bills would then need the signature of Arizona's Democratic governor, Katie Hobbs, to become law.

 Bitcoin could face resistance around $84,000, but if it breaks through, the next major hurdle sits at $96,000, according to CryptoQuant. 

Bitcoin could hover in the low $80,000s in the near term if it fails to break through its next resistance level, CryptoQuant says, while other analysts predict the cryptocurrency will hit a fresh all-time high within the next two months.

CryptoQuant analysts said in an April 10 markets report that if Bitcoin (BTC) “continues to rally,” it could hit resistance around the $84,000 price level, but if it breaks through, it could soar before its next resistance level of $96,000.

“These price levels have acted as price support during this bull cycle but can now act as price resistance if bullish conditions don't continue to improve,” CryptoQuant said in its report. “This has been the case in past bearish cycles.”

Bitcoin was trading at $79,474 at the time of publication, down 3.5% over the past day, according to CoinMarketCap data.

April has been a volatile month for Bitcoin. US President Donald Trump ramped up global tariffs on April 2, which triggered fear in financial markets, before later abruptly pausing them for 90 days and softening the bearish momentum. 

Bitcoin briefly rose above $85,000 on April 1, but it pulled back to around $76,000 by April 8 due to uncertainty surrounding Trump's tariff plans.

CryptoQuant said prices recovered “most of the lost ground” on April 9, after Trump announced the 90-day pause on tariffs to all countries except China, which have now been ramped up to 145%.

After Trump's tariff pause announcement on April 9, both the crypto and broader financial markets saw a wider surge.

Bitcoin surged by approximately 9%, reversing most of the losses it incurred earlier in the week, to retest $83,000. Meanwhile, the S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest public US companies, closed 9.52% higher, its third-largest single-day gain since World War II. The Nasdaq 100 posted a 12.02% gain over the trading day.

Abra Global CEO Bill Barhydt said in an April 10 X post that it may only be a matter of months before Bitcoin sees its price go almost 29% above its $109,000 all-time high set in January.

“Bitcoin is a levered bet on tech stocks, and all of it is going up and to the right,” Barhydt said, adding that Bitcoin may go as high as $130,000 to $140,000 by late June.

He pointed to the “very significant increase in global money supply” as the reasoning behind his claim that Bitcoin could reach significantly higher levels by “midsummer at the latest.” 

It echoes a similar sentiment to Real Vision chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts, who told Cointelegraph last month that “the market may be underestimating how quickly Bitcoin could surge — potentially hitting new all-time highs before Q2 is out.”

However, according to CryptoQuant's Bull Score Index, Bitcoin has been in one of its least bullish phases since November 2022.

CryptoQuant said that of the 10 bull signals it tracks in its Bull Score Index, only one is still active, with Bitcoin trading above its 365-day moving average.

It said the market needs to wait and see if the bull signals “switch back on” in the coming weeks following Trump's recent decision to pause his tariffs.

 The SEC and Ripple have paused XRP lawsuit appeals amid ongoing settlement talks and speculation that incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins may drop the case. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission and blockchain payments firm Ripple agreed to pause their appeals in the ongoing XRP legal battle, signaling a potential move toward a final settlement.

The SEC and Ripple agreed to put their appeals in “abeyance,” meaning the proceedings are now paused pending an anticipated settlement of the XRP (XRP) case.

“An abeyance would conserve judicial and party resources while the parties continue to pursue a negotiated resolution of this matter,” the parties jointly stated in an April 10 court filing.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse previously announced the end of the XRP case on March 19, and the new filing hints that the SEC is ready to settle once nominated and approved Chair Paul Atkins takes office, according to some community speculation.

According to Ripple's defense attorney, James Filan, the new filing supersedes the April 16 deadline for Ripple to respond to the SEC's brief filed in January. “The settlement is awaiting commission approval. No brief will be filed on April 16,” Filan wrote in an April 10 X post.

Some legal observers suggested the SEC's willingness to pause the proceedings indicates that the agency may be prepared to drop the case after Atkins assumes office.

“SEC is ready to settle but is waiting for Atkins to take the helm as the new SEC chief so he can start off with dropping the biggest case of their career and start with a huge win,” one user suggested in a reply to Filan's thread on X.

While the Senate confirmed Atkins as the new SEC chair on Wednesday, April 9, it's unclear when he will take office.

It could be several days before Atkins is sworn into office as the new SEC chair.

Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler was sworn in three days after his confirmation in 2021, suggesting Atkins could take office as soon as April 12.

Cointelegraph approached the SEC for comment on when Atkins is expected to be sworn in as the new SEC chair but had not received a response by the time of publication.

 The parliamentarian proposed a “budget-neutral” Bitcoin reserve to the finance minister, inspired by US President Donald Trump's March 7 executive order. 

A member of Sweden's parliament proposed adding Bitcoin to the country's foreign exchange reserves, suggesting increased openness to cryptocurrency adoption in Europe following recent moves by the United States.

Swedish MP Rickard Nordin issued an open letter urging Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson to consider adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as a national reserve asset.

“Sweden has a tradition of a conservative and carefully managed foreign exchange reserve, mainly consisting of foreign currencies and gold,” Nordin wrote in a letter registered on April 8, adding:

“It is also an important way for freedom fighters to handle payments when under the oppression of authoritarian regimes,” he added.

The Swedish proposal echoes a recent move by the United States. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a national Bitcoin reserve funded by cryptocurrency seized in criminal investigations rather than purchased through market channels.

The order authorized the Treasury and Commerce secretaries to develop “budget-neutral strategies” to buy more Bitcoin for the reserve, provided there were no additional costs to taxpayers.

The governor of the Czech National Bank has also considered Bitcoin as part of a potential diversification strategy for the country's foreign reserves, Cointelegraph reported on Jan. 7.

European lawmakers have remained mostly silent on Bitcoin legislation despite Trump's historic executive order and Bitcoin's economic model favoring the early adopters.

The lack of Bitcoin-related statements may stem from Europe's focus on the launch of the digital euro, a central bank digital currency (CBDC), James Wo, the founder and CEO of venture capital firm DFG, told Cointelegraph, adding:

ECB President Christine Lagarde is pushing ahead with the digital euro's rollout, expected in October. Lagarde has emphasized that the CBDC will coexist with cash and offer privacy protections to address concerns about government overreach.

“The European Union is looking to launch the digital euro, our central bank digital currency, by October this year,” Lagarde said during a news conference, adding:

This is in stark contrast to the approach of the US, where Trump has taken a firm stance against CBDCs, prohibiting “the establishment, issuance, circulation, and use” of a US dollar-based CBDC.

What Defines a Star?

At the lower end, and to the bitter end, defining a star is tougher than you might expect

I love simple questions that wind up having complicated—or at least not straightforward—answers. Astronomers twist themselves into knots, for example, trying to define what a planet is, even though it seems like you'd know one when you see it. The same is true for moons; in fact, the International Astronomical Union, the official keeper of names and definitions for celestial objects, doesn't even try to declare what a moon is. That's probably for the best because that, too, is not so easy.

What about stars, though? Do they also confound any sort of palatable definition?

In a very broad sense, a star is simply one of those twinkling points of light you can see in the night sky. But that's not terribly satisfying in either lexicological or physical terms. After all, we also know the sun is a star—but, by definition, we never see it in Earth's night sky, and it's certainly not a dot (unless you're viewing it from well past Pluto, that is).

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

If such a basic definition leaves us a bit dry, then perhaps we can do better. From centuries of scientific observations and theoretical physics, we can say more. Stars are massive, hot and roughly spherical. They're held together by their own gravity, and they consist of plasma (gas heated so much that electrons are stripped from its constituent atoms). And, of course, they're luminous. They shine, which is probably their most basic characteristic.

That's descriptive, certainly, but still doesn't really tell us what a star is. What makes one different from, say, a planet? Can there be a smallest star or a biggest one?

To sensibly answer such questions, we need to understand the core mechanism that makes a star luminous in the first place. Then we can use that understanding to better define what is or isn't a star.

Historically, astronomers were in the dark about this for quite some time. Many mechanisms were proposed, but it wasn't until the early 20th century that quantum mechanics came to the rescue and introduced humanity (for better or worse) to the concept of nuclear fusion. In this process, subatomic particles such as protons and neutrons—and even entire atomic nuclei—could be smashed together, fusing to form heavier nuclei and releasing an enormous amount of energy.

In a star's core, fusion takes terrific temperature and pressure that is provided by the crushing gravity of the star's overlying mass. For a star to be relatively stable, the outward force of the energy generated by fusion in its core must be balanced by the inward pull of the star's gravity.

There are a couple of different pathways for fusion to occur in stars like the sun, but in the end they both yield essentially the same result: four hydrogen nuclei (each a single proton) plus various other subatomic particles fuse together to form a helium nucleus, and this process blasts out a lot of high-energy radiation as a byproduct. In the sun, this process converts about 620 million metric tons of hydrogen into helium every second. That creates enough energy to, well, power a star.

A critical aspect here is that once this reaction starts in a star's core, it keeps going as long as there is enough nuclear material to fuel it. And while fusing through hundreds of millions of metric tons per second sounds like a lot to you and me, to a star, this is an infinitesimally tiny fraction of its mass, allowing it to keep shining for billions of years.

So now we can say with more confidence what a star is: a huge gravitationally bound mass of luminous plasma in which the energy generated from sustained nuclear fusion in its core is balanced by gravity. Huzzah!

Except (and you knew an “except” was coming) there's a lower limit to the temperature and pressure needed to sustain fusion.

For normal stars, it's about 75 times the mass of Jupiter, or one twelfth the mass of the sun. Below that mass, there's not enough pressure to kick-start the fusion process. But you might notice that no one is eagerly declaring anything dozens of times heftier than Jupiter to be a “planet,” either. In general, middling objects too massive to be planets but too lightweight to be stars are called brown dwarfs.

This is where things get fuzzy—because it turns out that brown dwarfs can sustain certain sorts of fusion reactions, too. For example, they fuse deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen with an extra neutron in its atomic nucleus. Some can even fuse lithium with protons to form beryllium, and both these processes can occur at lower temperatures and pressures than the standard “single-proton hydrogen” fusion I described earlier. Brown dwarfs can sustain such conditions in their core, albeit only for mere tens of millions of years or so. But the question remains: Are these objects stars?

For simplicity's sake, astronomers would prefer to keep brown dwarfs in their own group and not call them stars. (Perhaps we could say they go through a brief “stellar phase” of fusion after they're born.) So most of us would say that a star has to have sustained single-proton hydrogen fusion. It's still a little bit arbitrary—after all, even this fusion eventually stops, though that might take up to several trillion years for some slow-burning stars. But setting this clear limit does make some sense.

Stars have an upper limit on their mass, too. More massive stars gravitationally squeeze their core even harder, which can vastly increase the rate of fusion reactions. But that, in turn, hugely ramps up energy production, making the star hotter and brighter. If the star gets too massive, it can become so luminous that it literally tears itself apart. That limit isn't well defined, but it's somewhere in the neighborhood of 200 times the mass of the sun. We do see stars near this upper bound, such as Eta Carinae, and they are violently unstable, wracked by stellar paroxysms that blow out gas in humongous eruptions.

What happens, then, after a star exhausts its nuclear fuel? Eventually the hydrogen runs out, leaving behind a core made of helium. This can get very complicated, but some massive stars can then fuse that helium into heavier elements and those elements into heavier ones yet. For true stellar heavyweights—stars with more than about eight times the sun's mass—the end comes as a catastrophic supernova explosion that leaves behind a neutron star or black hole. Smaller, more sunlike stars have a more sedate demise that eventually blows off their outer layers to expose their dense, hot core to space. We call these slow-cooling stellar corpses white dwarfs.

Besides black holes—which are so extreme they merit a category all their own—astronomers tend to refer to these stellar remnants as stars, but the lexicology there is hazier. These objects used to be a part of a star that once sustained fusion but not anymore. So while we may call them stars, we know they're distinguished from “regular” stars like the sun. It's a little confusing to laypeople, but astronomers have all sorts of terms that began with good intentions but are now outdated or should be deprecated.

That makes sense; after all, the principal principle of science is that it learns. We get more data and we change our mind, though the terms we use may take a while to catch up. So for now we're stuck with some words that will possibly (hopefully) fall out of use in the future.

Planets, moons, stars: astronomers know the difference and know that at the edges, these terms can bleed into one another. Despite the fuzzy borders of these categories, recognizing the distinctions between the objects within them is what helps us understand the universe even better.

Classical computers could only imitate trye randomness.

A large team of scientists says they've achieved “certified randomness” using a quantum computer. In a classical computer, you can never make a truly random number, which is one big reason computer scientists have had high hopes for quantum computers. Because these quantum systems involve an amount of unpredictability and entropy, simply identifying certain qualities at certain times is randomized by nature (pun intended). But who certifies the random numbers, and what can we do with them afterward?

When you ask a computer to give you a random number, code behind the scenes is doing an approximation of randomness. There are a bunch of ways they do this, including using concrete data like the time or hardware status and then scrambling it using another specific algorithm. (You can even, like cybersecurity giant Cloudflare does, use lava lamps.)  Basically, it's like shuffling a deck of cards by alternating them, over and over, until the results appear random to a user. The computer has no free will or even concept of freedom, so there's no way for it to “choose” anything without metrics or assigned values.

To be honest, people aren't better at randomness. We see actually random things and feel they don't seem random enough, because we envision a distributed randomness that is, in fact, just another pattern. The million monkeys trying to eventually type Shakespeare for us would get sidetracked by people who insist that the letters aren't being typed randomly enough. To counteract this, we roll dice or put names in a hat—but what's a computer to do?

In a 2016 literature review of quantum randomness projects, scientists now based in the Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology and University College London explain the metric used for the desired level of randomness:

This unpredictability runs counter to existing computing's paradigm for randomness, which is simply hiding the moving pieces that could be predicted with enough knowledge. And importantly, it's also different than today's working paradigm of cryptography. 

Our encryption modes rely on computers multiplying, for example, very large prime numbers together. The product of two primes will only have those two large numbers as its significant factors, so something encrypted that way will only be decrypted by someone who knows at least one of the numbers.

But prime numbers are predictable, and scientists push our growing list of primes into new territory every day. In this paradigm, we're protected by the limitations of computing power to do division of extremely large numbers. This is why each generation of encryption eventually falls. 

In new peer-reviewed research in the journal Nature, a team of more than 30 authors have collaborated to generate random numbers that pass the certification test. In their test, they used a computer with 56 qubits, or quantum bits, which are the carefully built working units of quantum computers. Certain pieces of information are sent back and forth to an “untrusted” quantum server to be turned into strings of data influenced by entropy.

Terms like ‘trust' have specific meanings in cryptography. In the world of data encryption, there's an ongoing tension between methods that rely on private information—like a security key held by one or both machines that are communicating—versus those that do all their work using technology held in public (but still inscrutable) places. If your system relies on a key of any kind, that means someone could hack you and obtain that key. (It's like writing a password down on a piece of paper, which opens you to a common type of hacking called social engineering.)

In this new method, the key is made obsolete because of the strength of the random number, freshly generated each time a new number is needed, which can then be certified as random and therefore secure. Within computing systems, the randomness or pseudorandomness of numbers resulting from various generation methods is known as entropy. The numbers resulting from the new quantum method have a higher amount of entropy relative to the length of the numbers. With the right equipment, someone on the receiving end of encrypted information can ensure in realtime that the encryption is dynamic and truly random based on that entropy.

The results are randomized strings of over 70,000 bits of data. If I turn the last sentence of the previous paragraph into binary, the resulting string is only 1,384 bits long. The entire story you've read so far has been about 42,000 bits long. We're talking about very, very long and random strings—far too long and random for anyone to ever try to figure out from the outside.

The scientists say their procedure leads to numbers with levels of entropy that satisfy metrics and can be generated in a reasonable amount of time (as compared to network communications from classical computers). And it keeps trying until it succeeds. “An ideal protocol for certified randomness either aborts, resulting in an ‘abort state', or succeeds, resulting in a uniformly distributed bitstring that is uncorrelated with any side information,” the team wrote.

Quantum computers are in an awkward growing-pains phase, as teams work at fever pitch to get them ready for applications that... don't really exist yet. There hasn't been a killer app for quantum computing the way that Super Mario Bros. first made everyone realize they needed a Nintendo in the 1980s.

This research has a stated agenda, which is to make quantum computers practical. In fact, four authors are listed as patent holders via JPMorgan Chase related to this work. “[W]e demonstrate a useful beyond-classical application of gate-based digital quantum computers,” the team explains. In other words, we can start doing this now, using technology as it is today.

It's hard to believe that some of the driest, hottest places on Earth were once luscious green centers of biodiversity. The desert Rub' al-Khali—also known as “The Empty Quarter” in English—is the perfect example of this. Spanning the lower third of the Arabian peninsula, Rub' al-Khali receives an average of just 3 centimeters of rainfall each year. But a new paper suggests that the region had a lot more than 3 centimeters of water—instead of a desert, it was a lake. 

In a paper published in the journal Communications Earth & Environment, researchers estimate that the lake once reached up to 42 meters (approximately 138 feet) deep at its deepest, and was about 1,100 m². That's nearly double the surface area of modern day Lake Geneva in Switzerland (580 m²), researcher Sébastien Castelltort explained in a press release.

According to the release, the ancient lake likely reached its largest size around 8,000 years ago during a time of heavy rainfall known as the “Green Arabia” period. Researchers believe that, at one point, extreme precipitation caused the lake to overflow, carving a 150-kilometer-long valley into the Earth. 

Scientists studied sediments and landforms in the region to determine where these floods were coming from. They concluded that the wet periods that contributed to filling the ancient lake likely came from northward expansions of African and Indian monsoons. When the lake did reach its peak size, it wasn't just a pretty sight—it may have been a crucial part of human activity in the region. 

‘‘The formation of lake and river landscapes, along with grasslands and savannahs, would have facilitated the expansion of hunting, gathering, and pastoral groups into what is now a dry, barren desert,” Michael Petraglia, a researcher on the study, said in the press release. “This is confirmed by abundant archaeological evidence found in the Empty Quarter and along its ancient lake and river systems.''

Though the conditions during the Green Arabia period were prosperous, the region eventually experienced a sharp decline in rainfall, forcing populations to migrate. While the study's findings shine a light on Rub' al-Khali thousands of years ago, they're also relevant in current climate research. 

“Understanding how past climate changes shaped both the physical environment and the distribution of human populations,” Castelltort said, according to La Brújula Verde, “is essential to interpreting today's challenges.”

Although we know that supermassive black holes (millions of times the mass of our Sun) lurk at the centre of most galaxies, their very nature makes them difficult to spot and study. In contrast to the popular idea of black holes constantly 'gobbling up' matter, these gravitational monsters can spend long periods of time in a dormant, inactive phase.

This was true of the black hole at the heart of SDSS1335+0728, a distant and unremarkable galaxy 300 million light-years away in the constellation of Virgo. After being inactive for decades, it suddenly lit up and recently began producing unprecedented flashes of X-ray light.

The first signs of activity appeared in late 2019, when the galaxy unexpectedly began shining brightly, attracting the attention of astronomers. After studying it for several years, they concluded that the unusual changes they saw were probably the result of the black hole suddenly 'switching on' -- entering an active phase. The bright, compact, central region of the galaxy is now classified as an active galactic nucleus, nicknamed 'Ansky'.

""When we first saw Ansky light up in optical images, we triggered follow-up observations using NASA's Swift X-ray space telescope, and we checked archived data from the eROSITA X-ray telescope, but at the time we didn't see any evidence of X-ray emissions,"" says Paula Sánchez Sáez, a researcher at the European Southern Observatory, Germany, and leader of the team that first explored the black hole's activation.

Ansky wakes up

Then, in February 2024, a team led by Lorena Hernández-García, a researcher at the Valparaiso University, Chile, began to see bursts of X-rays from Ansky at nearly regular intervals.

""This rare event provides an opportunity for astronomers to observe a black hole's behaviour in real time, using X-ray space telescopes XMM-Newton and NASA's NICER, Chandra and Swift. This phenomenon is known as a quasiperiodic eruption, or QPE. QPEs are short-lived flaring events. And this is the first time we have observed such an event in a black hole that seems to be waking up,"" explains Lorena.

""The first QPE episode was discovered in 2019, and since then we've only detected a handful more. We don't yet understand what causes them. Studying Ansky will help us to better understand black holes and how they evolve.""

""XMM-Newton played a pivotal role in our study. It is the only X-ray telescope sensitive enough to detect the fainter X-ray background light between the bursts. With XMM-Newton we could measure how dim Ansky gets, which enabled us to calculate how much energy Ansky releases when it lights up and starts flashing.""

Unravelling puzzling behaviour

The gravity of a black hole captures matter that gets too close and can rip it apart. The matter from a captured star, for example, would be spread into a hot, bright, rapidly spinning disc called an accretion disc. Current thinking is that QPEs are caused by an object (that could be a star or a small black hole) interacting with this accretion disc and they have been linked to the destruction of a star. But there is no evidence that Ansky has destroyed a star.

The extraordinary characteristics of Ansky's recurring bursts prompted the research team to consider other possibilities. The accretion disc could be formed by gas captured by the black hole from its neighbourhood, and not a disintegrated star. In this scenario, the X-ray flares would be coming from highly energetic shocks in the disc, provoked by a small celestial object travelling through and disrupting the orbiting material, repeatedly.

""The bursts of X-rays from Ansky are ten times longer and ten times more luminous than what we see from a typical QPE,"" says Joheen Chakraborty, a team member and PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA.

""Each of these eruptions is releasing a hundred times more energy than we have seen elsewhere. Ansky's eruptions also show the longest cadence ever observed, of about 4.5 days. This pushes our models to their limits and challenges our existing ideas about how these X-ray flashes are being generated.""

Watching a black hole in action

Being able to watch Ansky evolving in real time is an unprecedented opportunity for astronomers to learn more about black holes and the energetic events they power.

""For QPEs, we're still at the point where we have more models than data, and we need more observations to understand what's happening,"" says ESA Research Fellow and X-ray astronomer, Erwan Quintin.

""We thought that QPEs were the result of small celestial objects being captured by much larger ones and spiralling down towards them. Ansky's eruptions seem to be telling us a different story. These repetitive bursts are also likely associated with gravitational waves that ESA's future mission LISA might be able to catch.""

""It's crucial to have these X-ray observations that will complement the gravitational wave data and help us solve the puzzling behaviour of massive black holes.""

Metrics details

Early, efficient Parkinson's disease (PD) tests may facilitate pre-symptomatic diagnosis and disease-modifying therapies. Here we report elevated levels of PD-specific transfer RNA fragments carrying a conserved sequence motif (RGTTCRA-tRFs) in the substantia nigra, cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with PD. A whole blood qPCR test detecting elevated RGTTCRA-tRFs and reduced mitochondrial-originated tRFs (MT-tRFs) segregated pre-symptomatic patients with PD from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.75 versus 0.71 based on traditional clinical scoring). Strengthening PD relevance, patients carrying PD-related mutations presented higher blood RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs ratios than mutation-carrying non-symptomatic controls, and RGTTCRA-tRF levels decreased in patients' blood after deep brain stimulation. Furthermore, RGTTCRA-tRFs complementarity to ribosomal RNA and the translation-supporting LeuCAG3-tRF might aggravate PD via translational inhibition, as reflected by disrupted ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs in depolarized neuroblastoma cells. Our findings show tRF involvement in PD and suggest a potential simple and safe blood test that may aid clinicians in pre-symptomatic PD diagnosis after validation in larger independent cohorts.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease1. PD poses major clinical, social and financial burdens to society2 and is characterized by progressive movement disabilities, tremors and cognitive impairments. These symptoms result from premature death of dopaminergic neurons, especially in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN)3, that are caused by oxidative and nitrative stress3,4,5,6, enhanced mitophagy7, impaired autophagy8, neuroinflammation and dopaminergic/cholinergic imbalance9.

PD diagnosis often follows considerable neuronal damage manifested as severe motor impairments, such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremors10. However, earlier symptoms, including smell loss and rapid eye movement sleep disorders, may appear years beforehand. Molecular changes characteristic of this early disease phase may constitute a basis for a pre-symptomatic diagnostic test. Such a test should be cost-effective, rapid and capable of detecting changes in biomarker levels at the earliest disease stages, confirming true-positive cases and minimizing false-positive ones. Recent PD diagnostic tests have focused on elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of the α-synuclein (α-Syn) protein or reduced blood mitochondrial DNA as biomarkers11,12,13,14. However, CSF sampling is invasive; purification and detection of α-Syn are cumbersome and insufficiently sensitive15; and measurements of specific proteins show high inter-individual variability. In contrast, quantification of multiple molecules, rather than one, can improve signal-to-noise ratios and overcome the variability between patients16,17,18,19,20,21. Attempting to prevent invasive tests, certain blood molecules were proven to reflect cerebral pathology22. Ideally, an easy, safe and affordable diagnosis should be based on multiple highly sensitive and specific blood biomarkers23.

Transfer RNA fragments (tRFs) are 16–50 nucleotide (nt)-long, non-coding RNAs originating from multiple nuclear or mitochondrial transfer RNA (tRNA) genes. Several enzymes cleave tRNAs to yield tRFs: angiogenin (Ang) generates 5′-half and 3′-half tRFs, whereas Ang, Dicer24,25 and other nucleases yield 5′-tRFs, i-tRFs and 3′-tRFs26. Because tRFs harbor repetitive sequence motifs inherited from their parental tRNAs, changes can be detected in an entire family of closely related transcripts, albeit of different origins and types, produced by different endonucleases20,21,27, and originating from either nuclear or mitochondrial genomes. Correspondingly, tRFs may reflect transcriptional changes or malfunctions in both the nucleus and the mitochondria27, whose DNA is known to be damaged in PD14,28,29. Intriguingly, altered Ang levels, Ang mutations and Ang-produced tRFs may exert both PD-protective and cytotoxic roles30,31,32,33. Furthermore, blood cell tRF levels present diagnostic value in various diseases, including ischemic stroke34, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis35, epilepsy36 and cellular or organismal stress26,34. Accordingly, tRFs emerge as the perfect candidates for a blood-based PD biomarker.

To challenge the hypothesis that multiple tRF-derived sequences could yield informative PD biomarkers, we searched for tRF families that share common sequence motifs whose levels are changed in the brain, blood and/or CSF of patients with PD—all biofluids known to reflect cerebral pathologies, including PD22,37. Using different datasets that account for distinct biofluids and stages of the disease allowed us to study the PD links of those tRFs whose levels had been altered in unrelated cohorts of different population origins.

To seek PD-characteristic tRF profiles, we analyzed a short RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) dataset (phs.000727)38 consisting of postmortem (PM) CSF samples from 46 patients with PD, from 53 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and from 53 healthy controls (15, 27 and 24 females, respectively; Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Table 1a,b). Accounting for patients' age, sex and PM interval (Extended Data Fig. 2a; edgeR; Methods), we identified elevated levels of nuclear-originated tRFs in patients with PD compared to controls (N-tRFs; average levels in control (Ctrl) and PD: 980,165 and 990,387 counts per million (CPM), respectively). All but one of these were 3′-tRFs or i-tRFs that were over 35 nt long, excluding them from functioning as microRNAs39 (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 2b,c). We also detected reduced levels of mitochondrial-originated tRFs (MT-tRFs; average levels in Ctrl and PD: 19,834 and 9,612 CPM, respectively; Fig. 1b)14,28, most of which are long 3′-tRFs (Extended Data Fig. 2d,e). The PD-elevated N-tRFs and reduced MT-tRFs phenomena were consistent in both sexes (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c) but were absent in AD (Fig. 1c), reflecting non-random PD-altered CSF tRF profiles37.

Colors are as in b.

Pursuing PD RNA biomarkers, we sought common motifs shared by the elevated N-tRFs using the Multiply Elicited Motif Entities (MEME) tool40. This tool detected multiple tRFs sharing the sequence [A/G]GTTC[A/G]A (RGTTCRA-tRFs; Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c), most of which were over 30 bases long (average levels: Ctrl = 79,901, PD = 92,836, AD = 83,068, CPM for RGTTCRA-tRFs >30 bases). Binomial tests confirmed that RGTTCRA-tRFs are mostly elevated and MT-tRFs are mostly reduced also when analyzing each sex separately (Extended Data Fig. 2 and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. 2). Notably, RGTTCRA-tRFs were derived from numerous nuclear-originated tRNA genes, none of which was downregulated in the CSF of patients with PD, and all of the CSF-elevated tRFs lacking this motif were shorter than 30 bases (Fig. 1b). Together, this indicates that the shared motif embedded in RGTTCRA-tRFs might reflect disease-related features (Supplementary Table 2 lists all of the tRNA genes carrying the PD motif).

Parallel analysis comparing patients with AD to controls in the same dataset revealed unchanged profiles of MT-tRFs and RGTTCRA-tRFs (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the median levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs longer than 30 bases were higher in patients with PD than in either healthy controls or patients with AD (P < 0.038 and P < 0.062, respectively, Dunnett test, false discovery rate (FDR)). The PD-specific accumulation of RGTTCRA-tRFs and decrease of MT-tRFs in CSF identified both of these subfamilies as promising PD biomarker candidates.

To seek pathological implications of RGTTCRA-tRF accumulation, we conducted small RNA-seq of SN from eight PM patients with PD sourced from the Netherlands Brain Bank (NBB) (Supplementary Figs. 1a,b and 2h and Supplementary Table 3; data deposited in GSE256334). Supporting our CSF findings, elevation of RGTTCRA-tRFs (average levels = 91,856 CPM) and reduction of MT-tRFs (average levels = 54,123 CPM) accompanied higher Braak Lewy body scores in patients with PD (Fig. 1d).

Seeking the cleavage enzymes responsible for the altered RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs (Fig. 2a), we analyzed a dataset of Ang overexpression in HEK293T and knockout in U2OS cells (GSE130764; Supplementary Table 4)41. Ang overexpression elevated the percentage of RGTTCRA-tRFs, but not of MT-tRFs, in HEK293 cells (P < 0.0093 and P < 0.375, respectively, t-test, FDR; Fig. 2b–d). However, Ang knockout had no overt effects on these tRF families (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. 3). Therefore, Ang emerged as sufficient but not essential for producing RGTTCRA-tRFs or MT-tRFs.

Two-way ANOVA. All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

To test the utility of RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRF levels as diagnostic biomarkers, we performed small RNA-seq of NBB PM blood samples from patients with PD and controls (Ctrl, n = 16 and PD, n = 21; Fig. 2e and Supplementary Table 5; data deposited in GSE256334) and used Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) data (Supplementary Table 6) from idiopathic non-deep brain stimulation (DBS)-treated patients from timepoint V08 (2 years after first evaluation; Idiopathic; PD, n = 252 and Ctrl, n = 133) and the latest timepoint available for PD-related mutation carriers with or without symptoms (Genetic; PD, n = 55 and Ctrl, n = 16).

Mutation-carrying living PPMI PD patients showed a trend of reduction in blood MT-tRF levels compared to unaffected mutation-carrying controls (P < 0.057, Mann–Whitney, FDR; Fig. 2g). In comparison, PM blood samples from advanced NBB PD patients presented elevated RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs (P < 0.00015 and P < 8 × 10−11, respectively, ANOVA; ‘Advanced'; Fig. 2f,g).

The observed PM elevation in blood MT-tRF levels contrasts with the MT-tRF reduction seen in the PD CSF and SN (Fig. 1b,d) and may reflect mitochondrial degradation in PM blood, which yields higher levels of mitochondrial RNA fragments42. Indeed, although levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs were not affected by sample RNA integrity number (RIN), MT-tRF levels were negatively correlated with the sample's RIN (MT-tRFs: r = −0.4, P < 0.025; RGTTCRA-tRFs: r = −0.14, P < 0.4; FDR, Spearman correlation), indicating that the elevated levels stem from the PM status rather than the PD status. Supporting this notion, SN tissues revealed reduced mitochondrial tRNA levels, which continued declining with disease duration (r = 0.4, P < 0.05, Spearman correlation; PD versus Ctrl P < 0.039, Mann–Whitney test; Extended Data Fig. 3c).

To develop a biomarker assay that can easily compare among patients regardless of the need to account for RNA concentrations and library depth, we calculated the ratio between RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs. This ratio was elevated in PD versus Ctrl (Fig. 2h; P < 0.0013, ANOVA), especially in early mutation-carrying patients (Early Idiopathic patients P < 0.02, Early Genetic patients P < 0.00044, ANOVA). Strengthening the notion that blood tRFs have the capability of capturing inter-individual variations, we found that blood tRF levels create a patient-specific fingerprint that maintains stability over time, positioning them as promising candidates for biomarkers (Supplementary Information: ‘Blood tRF levels create a patient-specific fingerprint').

We next challenged the value of the RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs ratio for pre-symptomatic PD detection. To do so, we compared prodromal PPMI patients (showing pre-symptomatic PD signs, albeit without a clinical PD diagnosis) at the earliest tested timepoint (n = 60) to matched healthy controls (n = 128) (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 7). A subset of 60 controls optimally matched to the prodromal patients was formed based on sex, age and collection batch of patients.

All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

To create a primer-based separation reflecting the variability between controls and prodromal PD patients, we sought two single in silico polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer pairs that can recognize numerous RGTTCRA-tRFs or MT-tRFs. We designed quantitative PCR (qPCR)-suitable 14-nt-long sequences that include the PD motif and are shared among at least 100 different RGTTCRA-tRFs (Methods). For every patient, we summed the counts of all RGTTCRA-tRFs, including each 14-nt sequence, and selected the one that led to the largest median difference between PPMI prodromal patients and healthy controls (GGTCCCTGGTTCAA, shared among 285 RGTTCRA-tRFs from different tRNAs of distinct chromosomal origins, average levels of 550 CPM; P < 0.013, Mann–Whitney). Next, we similarly selected a sequence shared between the maximum number of MT-tRFs that maximizes the median difference between prodromal and controls and minimized the standard deviation within each group (TAACTTAGCATTAACCTTTTAA, shared among 106 Lys tRNA-originated MT-tRFs, average levels of 90 CPM).

For each patient, we divided the sum of RGTTCRA-tRF counts (all carrying the GGTCCCTGGTTCAA sequence) by the sum of MT-tRF counts (all carrying the TAACTTAGCATTAACCTTTTAA sequence) to yield an RGTTCRA/MT score. The RGTTCRA/MT score of each control or prodromal patient from a matched pair was then divided by the pair's mean to yield a normalized score (hereafter ‘tRF-score'). Next, we employed a gradient boosted machine learning (GBM) classification algorithm (five cross-validations; Methods) to subgroup the samples into prodromal PD patients and controls, considering their ethnicity, by clinical measurements of Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores and Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scores or by the tRF-score described above. This resulted in areas under the curve (AUCs; representing the ability to segregate the patients into control and prodromal groups) of 0.73 for the clinical measurement (specificity = 0.78, sensitivity = 0.583, positive predictive value (PPV) = 0.761, negative predictive value (NPV) = 0.61) compared to an AUC of 0.86 (specificity = 0.867, sensitivity = 0.7, PPV = 0.84, NPV = 0.743) for the tRF-score (Fig. 3a,b). In comparison, classification using mixed labels (null) in both clinical and tRF measurements yielded a non-significant AUC value of 0.43. Further validation using 10,000 permutations, each time sampling 60 different controls, confirmed these results, as did a logistic regression algorithm replacing GBM (receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-AUC of 0.83 compared to 0.70 using clinical measurements; Extended Data Fig. 4a).

To test if our findings reflect the biological role of these motifs rather than training of the algorithm, we ran the exact same GBM-based process 10,000 times on ratios between random motifs (lacking the RGTTCRA sequence and appearing in at least the same number of tRFs as the RGTTCRA motifs and the MT motifs; Methods). The mean AUC received for the ratio between random motifs was 0.768 (s.d. = 0.0537), and 99% of the AUCs were lower than 0.81 (Fig. 3c). These findings support the notion that the AUC resulting from the tRF-score reflects a biological rather than a mere training phenomenon.

PD symptoms often reflect patients' genetics and ethnic origins. Therefore, we tested the ability to segregate patients to prodromal and control groups based on their genetic and ethnic backgrounds. The tRF-score enabled segregating all subpopulations (Fig. 3d; P < 2 × 10−10, ANOVA), even when examining the non-normalized ratio (Extended Data Fig. 4b; P < 5 × 10−6, ANOVA). Thus, two-thirds of prodromal patients scored as 6 or higher, whereas two-thirds of controls scored lower than 6 (P < 4 × 10−5, chi-square test). An exception was Black control and prodromal patients who had similar tRF-scores. However, their UPDRS scores revealed the same trend (Extended Data Fig. 4c), potentially suggesting that our test reflected real-life clinical measurements in these patients as well. Nonetheless, although the tRF-score measurement was similar between prodromal and diagnosed PD patients, the UPDRS score of prodromal patients was akin to that of controls and differed dramatically from that of patients with PD (Extended Data Fig. 4d). Further indicating a link between our two motifs and the clinical measurements, the tRF-scores of the optimally matched prodromal and control patients presented positive correlation with the total UPDRS score (r = 0.27, P < 0.01; FDR, Spearman correlation; Extended Data Fig. 4e) and with the scores of subsections II and III of the UPDRS test (I: r = 0.19, P < 0.06; II: r = 0.245, P < 0.0163; III: r = 0.318, P < 0.004; FDR, Spearman correlation; Extended Data Fig. 4f).

Next, we tested the GBM algorithms trained on the optimally matched data (60 prodromal, 60 controls) on the fully matched data (60 prodromal, 128 controls) (Methods). Both algorithms, whether trained on the tRF-score or on clinical parameters, presented far better classification abilities than random classification (Extended Data Fig. 4g; P < 5 × 10−14, P < 3 × 10−7, chi-square test, FDR). However, the tRF-based measurements performed better than the clinical ones (P < 0.0081, chi-square test). To re-challenge these observations, we tested the tRF-score-based algorithm on a holdout validation sample, including 33 prodromal samples and 33 matched control samples consisting of the second-earliest timepoint of the patients used for cross-validation (discovery sample) (Methods and Supplementary Table 7). The algorithm successfully distinguished prodromal patients from controls (P < 0.0004, t-test; AUC of 0.75, confidence interval (CI) = 0.63–0.86, specificity = 0.727, sensitivity = 0.606, PPV = 0.69, NPV = 0.649; Fig. 3e,f), re-demonstrating the algorithm's efficacy and the ability of the tRF-score to identify prodromal patients. In comparison, testing the algorithm trained on the clinical measurement on the holdout validation sample yielded a weaker separation between control and prodromal patients (AUC of 0.71, CI = 0.65–0.78, specificity = 0.523, sensitivity = 0.777, PPV = 0.58, NPV = 0.734; Methods). Together, the tRF-score performed at least as well as the clinical measurement and, in certain cases, better than the clinical tests, both on the cross-validated discovery sample and on the holdout validation sample.

In subsequent tests, PD diagnosis was established for 21 of those 60 studied prodromal PPMI patients (with the rest yet undiagnosed). Comparing the tRF and UPDRS scores of these 21 patients to those of controls yielded a more significant separation by the tRF-score (P < 1.1 × 10−5 versus P < 7 × 10−3, t-test, FDR; Fig. 3g,h). Furthermore, 18 of the 21 patients whose PD diagnosis had been confirmed were ranked higher by their tRF-score than by their UPDRS score (Extended Data Fig. 4h), again emphasizing the advantage of using the dual tRFs measurement. In later stages of PD with overt motor symptoms (Supplementary Table 8), clinical measurements perfectly separated patients from controls (AUC of 1), which left no room for added value of other biomarkers. We conclude that the two-primer-based tRF-score emerges as a reliable PD biomarker already in the earliest disease stages and especially in combination with clinical or other available measurements.

To segregate patients with PD from controls based on a manual qPCR-based tRF test, we drew blood from 10 patients with PD, from 10 patients with head trauma and from 10 controls from the Jerusalem Shaare Zedek Medical Center (JLM cohort; Supplementary Table 9). We used the two probes described above (ΔCq = RGTTCRA-tRF − MT-tRF; Methods) and normalized the ΔΔCq separately for each sex (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 1j). Notably, patients with PD presented significantly higher ratios of RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs than either controls or patients with trauma, which showed similar values (Fig. 3i,j; P < 0.05, P < 0.013, Dunnett test).

To further validate the capacity of our qPCR test to selectively amplify the RGTTCRA motif, we subjected the amplicons of two qPCR reactions (JLM cohort, one patient with PD and one patient with trauma) to small RNA-seq. In both samples, over 50% of the reads (compared to 0.3–10% in biological samples) were mapped to tRFs, all carrying the RGTTCRA motif, with most derived from the same tRNA region but from different tRFs (Extended Data Fig. 4i and Supplementary Table 10). These findings provide experimental evidence supporting the notion that our qPCR test primarily detects tRFs that include the RGTTCRA motif and can quantify their levels in patients' blood.

To address the consistency of our findings in other tissues, we tested 17 PD SN samples (six females) and six matched control SN samples (three females) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) NeuroBioBank collection (Supplementary Table 11). Because tRFs expressed in the brain are slightly different than those in the blood, we designed a brain-adapted RGTTCRA-tRF primer (CGGGTTCGATTCCC; Methods) to maximize the number of detected RGTTCRA-tRFs. Our qPCR assay identified higher RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs ratios in PD than in Ctrl (Fig. 3i,k; P < 0.0452, t-test). Together, our findings in blood and brain demonstrated that the signal of motif-carrying tRFs identified in sequenced blood samples from prodromal and PD patients can be translated into simple dual qPCR blood tests.

Although MT-tRF reduction reflects well-studied PD-related mitochondrial dysfunction28,29 that potentially leads to reduction in MT-tRFs, our finding of RGTTCRA-tRF accumulation might reflect biological activities accelerating PD progression. In this context, four different tRFs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were shown to interrupt translation by interacting with ribosomal RNA (rRNA), in regions other than tRNA binding sites43. Interestingly, we found all four to include the PD motif. Furthermore, we identified a region complementary to the RGTTCRA-tRF sequence in the leucine tRNA-derived tRF (LeuCAG3′) that was reported to be essential for assembly of the translation complex, protein translation and cellular viability44 (Fig. 4a,b). Correspondingly, minimal energy assessment (RNAup)45 predicted a thermodynamically preferred interaction (total energy of −10.46 kcal mol−1) of RGTTCRA-tRFs with the ribosome-essential LeuCAG3′ tRF (Fig. 4b), far lower binding energy than all other 1,017 CSF-identified tRFs (P < 1 × 10−30, t-test; Fig. 4b).

Right, secondary structures of 18S and 28S rRNA showing RGTTCRA motif-complementary sequences (red). All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

Supporting the ribosome-binding prediction, we found sequences complementary to the PD motif that are not involved in a secondary structure in both the 18S and 28S rRNAs and are, hence, amenable to hybridization (Fig. 4a,c). Correspondingly, RGTTCRA-tRFs were predicted to bind more strongly to 18S and 28S rRNAs than all other CSF tRFs (P < 2 × 10−25, P < 3 × 10−67, t-test, FDR; Fig. 4c). The predicted binding of RGTTCRA-tRFs to both the LeuCAG3′ tRF and the rRNA may lead to a ‘dual-lock' mechanism interrupting both initiation and execution of translational processes (Fig. 4a). Indeed, 3 h of translation-interfering arginine or leucine starvation in three human-originated cell lines46 led to enrichment of ribosome-bound RGTTCRA-tRFs (P < 0.023, P < 0.027, Dunnett test; Extended Data Fig. 5a and supplementary text).

We next employed Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)47 with pulsed interleaved excitation (PIE) (Extended Data Fig. 5b,c) to assess the proximities between RGTTCRA-tRF (that is, donor fluorophore-labeled RGTTCRA-tRF probe) and ribosomes (that is, acceptor fluorophore tagging an antibody to the ribosomal protein RPL24) (Extended Data Fig. 5c). The fluorescence lifetime (τ) of the acceptor fluorophore was longer after donor excitation (FRET-sensitized acceptor fluorescence) than after direct acceptor excitation (directly excited acceptor fluorescence; 1.36 ns versus 1.00 ns; Extended Data Fig. 5d). The delayed acceptor fluorescence after donor excitation may reflect a signature of FRET between the donor–acceptor pairs48 and, hence, close proximity (<10 nm) of RGTTCRA-tRFs with ribosomes (Extended Data Fig. 5d,f), supporting direct interaction between RGTTCRA-tRFs and the ribosome.

DBS of the subthalamic nucleus suppresses PD tremor symptoms through an incompletely understood mechanism of action49,50. To search for RGTTCRA-tRF links to the disease symptoms, we studied the effect of DBS on blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels in 19 DBS-treated patients with PD of the PPMI cohort carrying LRRK2 (ref. 51) or GBA mutations (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Table 12). Non-DBS-treated PD patient carriers of the same PD-causing mutations (n = 11) showed higher RGTTCRA-tRF levels than apparently healthy carriers of these mutations (n = 9; P < 0.027, ANOVA). In comparison, the DBS-treated mutation-carrying patients presented lower RGTTCRA-tRF levels than non-DBS-treated patients (P < 0.095, ANOVA; Fig. 5b), equivalent to the levels of the apparently healthy mutation-carrying controls (P < 0.6, ANOVA; Fig. 5b). MT-tRFs showed no significant difference between DBS-treated and the other groups (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The clinical capacity of DBS to effectively co-suppress blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels and tremor symptoms suggests that RGTTCRA-tRF blood levels may be related to the tremor profiles of PD patients.

All box plots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

Seeking potential causes for the reduced percentage of RGTTCRA-tRFs out of total tRFs, and considering that DBS alters blood transcript profiles52 as well as the effect of Ang on RGTTCRA-tRF levels, we measured Ang levels in DBS-treated patients and controls. For this purpose, we used our microarray dataset, GSE23676 (ref. 52), consisting of blood taken from six controls and seven patients with PD (all males), where PD blood was drawn before DBS surgery or several months after DBS treatment (Fig. 5a, Soreq dataset; Methods, Extended Data Fig. 1k and Supplementary Table 13). Interestingly, Ang mRNA levels were similar in controls and patients with PD (before DBS) but decreased in six of the seven patients with PD after DBS (P < 0.019, ANOVA; Fig. 5c), possibly reflecting a limited post-DBS capacity to produce tRFs.

To examine the effects of electrical stimulation (such as DBS) on RGTTCRA-tRFs, we mined a short RNA-seq and ribosomal profiling dataset (GSE155727)53 from SHSY-5Y neuroblastoma cells harvested before, immediately after or 2 h after electrophysiological depolarization (2 h post depolarization (pDP); Fig. 5d and Supplementary Table 14). Immediately after depolarization, the cytosolic fraction of these cells showed reduced RGTTCRA-tRF shares, followed by re-elevation 2 h later (reminiscent of our findings in DBS-treated patients; Fig. 5e; resting versus depolarization, P < 0.01; resting versus 2 h pDP, P < 0.015; depolarization versus 2 h pDP, P < 0.0001, ANOVA). The re-elevation of RGTTCRA-tRFs share was accompanied by reduced cytosolic MT-tRFs share (Fig. 5f; P < 0.0033, ANOVA). Although depolarization did not immediately change the ribosomal-bound fraction of RGTTCRA-tRFs, this fraction was reduced 2 h later (Fig. 5e; 2 h pDP versus resting, P < 0.015; 2 h pDP versus depolarization, P < 0.0065, ANOVA). The distribution of tRFs to MT-tRFs, RGTTCRA-tRFs and all other tRFs was further altered 2 h pDP in the ribosome-bound fraction of three samples compared to the mean distributions of this fraction in resting cells (P < 0.006, P < 0.022, P < 0.024, chi-square, FDR; Fig. 5f).

Because RGTTCRA-tRFs mainly belong to the 3′ and i-tRF subtypes, we compared the fraction of RGTTCRA-tRFs in these specific subtypes and found the same association patterns as described above (Extended Data Fig. 6b and supplementary information for Extended Data Fig. 6). Although RGTTCRA-tRFs constituted a small portion of the total cytoplasmic short RNAs, their share of the ribosomal-associated RNAs was roughly 10-fold higher (P < 8 × 10−11, ANOVA; Fig. 5f). Our FRET findings, together with the selectively weakened ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs within 2 h after electrophysiological depolarization, suggest that the depolarizing qualities of DBS may impact the ribosomal association of RGTTCRA-tRFs. Altogether, RGTTCRA-tRFs and MT-tRFs showed selective and distinct co-regulation under electrophysiological stimuli at both the cellular and organismal levels.

From our study, tRFs carrying a repetitive motif emerged as potentially suitable biomarkers that may constitute patient-specific ‘fingerprints' and carry short conserved sequence motifs that enable single measurement of multiple tRFs. Intriguingly, we found that RGTTCRA-tRFs accumulate in the brain, CSF and blood of male and female patients with PD at diverse disease stages but not in matched controls or in patients with AD. Moreover, motif-carrying RGTTCRA-tRFs consistently showed linkage to PD symptoms and disease stages, and their levels were elevated in correlation with Lewy body scores in patients' SN. Additionally, part of the identified RGTTCRA-tRFs stem from tRNAs that carry phenylalanine or cysteine amino acids, known to be the rate-limiting factors in the dopamine synthesis and in glutathione reductase antioxidant mechanism, respectively. Thus, shortage of these intact tRNAs (as they are enzymatically cut into the observed tRFs) may correspond to impaired dopamine synthesis54 or to processes that limit cellular antioxidation55. Compatible with the known mitochondrial damage in PD28 (which leads to general reduction in mitochondrial transcript levels), we further found reduced levels of MT-tRFs in the CSF and SN of idiopathic PD patients and in the blood of early PD patients carrying disease-related mutations.

Our segregation algorithm focused on prodromal patients rather than patients at later stages of PD because it is these early disease stages that call for biomarker development, especially as, in later stages, clinical measurements suffice to determine a clear diagnosis of PD. Correspondingly, the ratio of RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs segregated early prodromal patients from healthy controls as well as or even better than those of the gold standard clinical UPDRS and H&Y measurements. This could indicate that the ratio of RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs may serve as a potential diagnostic tool for the earliest stages of PD, especially in combination with other available pre-symptomatic detectors. To our knowledge, this evaluation, which is based on publicly available data sources and manual tests, is the first to identify the power of blood tRFs as PD biomarkers. Nonetheless, this cross-sectional study calls for longitudinal studies following patients throughout disease progression to offer insights into biomarker changes and treatment outcome.

As modern medicine aims to achieve patient-specific therapeutics, it is crucial for biomarker assays to compensate for inter-individual variabilities in measured values. Capturing multiple nuclear-originated and mitochondrial-originated tRFs using a dual primer qPCR blood-based assay may fulfill this demand. Specifically, our tRF-based score was designed to enable patient-tailored diagnosis, where the qPCR values determined for a certain patient will be compared to those of healthy volunteers or patients with PD of the same sex, ethnicity and genetic background, thus sparing the need for complex matching and normalization. Indeed, manual running of this dual qPCR test showed that the tRF-score segregated patients with PD from controls without the need for machine learning algorithms.

Notably, our study relied predominantly on samples from specific demographics, and, as such, the results might not be universally applicable to all populations. Thus, that the tRF-score was similar in prodromal African American patients and matched controls paralleled an identical trend in H&Y and UPDRS scores in this cohort, strengthening the notion that this score represents a true effect and calling for further studies of such patient-matched tests and validation in diverse patient cohorts.

Notably, too, blood RGTTCRA-tRF levels were effectively reduced under DBS stimulation, suggesting a linkage among tremor symptoms, electrical stimulus and the cellular localization and activities of these tRFs. Furthermore, yeast tRF research done by others43 and interaction predictions suggest that RGTTCRA-tRFs bind to the ribosome, potentially in an evolutionarily conserved translation-arresting manner. These findings are compatible with our FRET measurements and with the observation of ribosomal association and depolarization-triggered ribosomal dissociation of RGTTCRA-tRFs in cultured neuroblastoma cells. Moreover, as Ang may contribute to the synthesis of RGTTCRA-tRFs, our findings call for in-depth examination of the therapeutic potential of carefully adjusting its activity in the brains of patients with PD.

Mitochondrial death is a hallmark characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases56,57 and was suggested as a blood biomarker in AD58,59. However, recent blood-based tests of mitochondrial dysfunction in PD14 reported that, in genetic cases, mitochondrial DNA damage was observed irrespective of a PD diagnosis14, highlighting the need to add other biomarkers to such tests. In this context, our combined nuclear/mitochondrial RGTTCRA-tRFs/MT-tRFs measurements enable segregating genetic PD patients from apparently healthy unaffected controls carrying the same PD-related mutations. An in-depth comprehensive analysis of larger patient cohorts will be needed to better determine the efficacy of our tRF-based measurement in comparison to other blood-based PD biomarkers.

The availability of an early, reliable and rapid blood test for PD diagnosis may potentially alleviate the burden of uncertainty from suffering individuals, assist clinicians' care of those patients early in the disease process and open routes for developing and testing new therapeutics. To achieve these goals, an efficient diagnostic test should (1) provide accurate and disease-specific results, (2) avoid complex neurosurgical procedures, (3) entail minimal risks to the tested patients, (4) be easy to perform and (5) be inexpensive. Unlike CSF-based tests that can be risky, costly and dependent on complex molecular and biochemical procedures, qPCR-based blood tests are minimally invasive, do not depend on hospital care and offer quick procedures based on easily amplifiable signals. Our tRF-based blood measurement proved efficient in separating prodromal PD patients from controls by a simple dual qPCR assay, suggesting that it may equip clinicians with an informative diagnostic tool based on a single individual blood test, alone or in combination with other non-invasive measurements. The reliability, sensitivity, speed and low cost of our assay may all indicate its value for enabling an improved universal, pre-symptomatic PD diagnosis that can improve detection rates and offer beneficial clinical approaches to patients with PD at diverse stages of their disease.

Ethics approval for this study was confirmed by the Hebrew University's committee for research involving human-derived materials. Blood samples of the JLM cohort were collected at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20.

This study consists of human brain (n = 8) and blood (n = 37) samples obtained from the NBB and of human brain samples (n = 23) obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank, each under the relevant institution's ethics and guidelines. Blood samples were further collected at the Shaare Zedek Medical Center (n = 30) under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20. Other human data were downloaded from the PPMI (blood; n = 475) and the NIH (CSF; n = 152) and from GSE23676 (blood; n = 20), all under relevant ethics approval. Further details can be found in Extended Data Fig. 1 and in Supplementary Tables 1a, 3, 5–9 and 11–13. Written informed consent was obtained for all human samples included in this study.

Brain tissues were obtained from the NBB as described in Hanan et al.4. RNA from eight male PD patient samples (see Supplementary Table 3 for patient information) was extracted using an miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 217004) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by RNA concentration determination (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), standard gel electrophoresis for quality assessment and RIN determination (Bioanalyzer 6000; Agilent). Libraries were generated from 1,200 ng of RNA (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina; New England Biolabs, E7560S), and the small RNA fraction was sequenced on a NextSeq 500 system (Illumina) at the Center for Genomic Technologies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (GSE256334). TH and DAT levels for these samples are taken from previously published data4.

Whole blood samples were obtained from the NBB (see Supplementary Table 5 for patient information). RNA was extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA Blood Mini Kit for RNA from blood (Machery-Nagel, 740200) according to the manufacturer's protocol, followed by RNA concentration and quality determination as above. Libraries were generated from 100 ng of total RNA (NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina, as above), and the small RNA fraction was sequenced on a NextSeq 2000 system (Illumina) at the Center for Genomic Technologies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Data were deposited in GSE256334 as above.

FASTQ files (of both in-house sequencing and of publicly available data) were checked for quality using FastQC60, and adaptors (if present) were removed using FLEXBAR61 according to the pipeline manual. Adaptor-less output FASTQ files were then aligned to tRFs using MINTmap (version 1.0)62. See Extended Data Fig. 1 for elaboration.

The CSF database phs000727 (downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)) included 66 patients with PD (20 removed as detailed below), 67 patients with AD (14 removed) and 69 healthy controls (16 removed). Before differential expression analysis, a principal component analysis was run based on tRF expression data, and samples that did not cluster were removed from the analysis. Those included six patients with PD, four patients with AD and six controls. Another five controls were removed because they had moderate SN depigmentation compared to no or mild depigmentation in other controls, and two additional controls were removed due to a combination of high Aβ plaque density (frequent) and high Tau tangle score (above 10). Likewise, 13 patients with PD were removed due to AD-like Braak, plaques or tangles scores. Seven patients with AD were removed due to severe SN depigmentation. Lastly, one control and one patient with AD were removed due to age younger than 60 years, and two controls, two patients with AD and one patient with PD were excluded due to exceptionally low tRF coverage (these patients had 21–1,627 counts, whereas the next lowest coverage patient had 11,745 counts). All eliminations were done before performing any analysis. See Supplementary Table 1a for general data of the CSF dataset and Supplementary Table 1b for a list of excluded samples. To further prevent any potential bias, differential expression analysis accounted for patient age, sex and PM interval.

Small RNA-seq was obtained in February 2021 from the PPMI database (https://www.ppmi-info.org/access-dataspecimens/download-data), RRID: SCR 006431. Updated participant status was re-downloaded in October 2023. For up-to-date information on the study, see https://www.ppmi-info.org/. Only samples with RIN ≥ 6 were analyzed, and we additionally filtered out samples of participants who were disqualified by the PPMI or who had undetermined sex63. See Supplementary Tables 6–8 and 11 for elaboration.

To test our hypothesis that tRFs can constitute a patient-specific fingerprint, we used all the samples of PPMI patients having tRF counts from four different timepoints (n = 318). To focus on the most informative features, we selected the top 0.5% of enriched tRFs, resulting in a set of 253 tRFs for analysis. The data were split into training and test sets, with the test set comprising the last available sample from each patient, to evaluate the model's performance across timepoints. Leveraging multiple timepoints per patient aimed to test whether blood-quantified tRFs might serve as a unique, patient-specific fingerprint and determine if the tRF values from a patient's first three timepoints could accurately identify which of the remaining samples belonged to that patient. We implemented a MultiClassModel class to train and evaluate multiple machine learning classifiers, including XGBoost, HistGradientBoostingClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, Support Vector Classifiers (linear and nonlinear), K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes and OneVsRest (OvR) Logistic Regression. The OvR approach, also called One-vs-All, extends binary classifiers such as logistic regression to handle multiclass problems by training a separate binary classifier for each class. In this setup, the class of interest is treated as the positive label, whereas all other classes are grouped as negative. During prediction, the classifier with the highest probability score is selected as the final output. OvR is computationally efficient and straightforward, although it may not capture interactions between classes as comprehensively as multinomial logistic regression or One-vs-One approaches. As supported by Rifkin and Klautau64, OvR can achieve accuracy similar to more complex methods, especially when binary classifiers are well tuned, making it a robust and widely used solution in practice. All features were standardized using StandardScaler before model training. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was chosen as the primary evaluation metric due to its robustness in assessing both binary and multiclass classifications. After identifying the best-performing classifier, we conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with predefined parameter grids, optimizing for the MCC score. To validate the assumption that the model's performance was not due to chance, we compared the best-tuned classifier against a dummy model trained on shuffled labels. This comparison served to confirm the presence of a genuine, individual-specific signal in the tRF profiles.

For prodromal (pre-symptomatic) patient analysis, we subdivided, from the above-described PPMI data, prodromal and control patients with known genetic background (idiopathic or GBA+), known ethnicity, without prescribed PD medications and older than 58 years. Furthermore, patients with psychiatric anxiety, muscle inflammation, urinary bladder impairments and diabetes were excluded (due to underrepresentation in either the prodromal or the control group). To examine the earliest possible stage, we only selected patients with sequencing data from timepoints ‘BL', ‘V02' or ‘V04' (corresponding to initial diagnosis, 6 months later and 12 months later). For each of these patients, we used the earliest timepoint available for the discovery sample (60 prodromal patients and 110 controls) and the second-earliest timepoint for the holdout validation sample (33 prodromal patients and 33 controls). The single Asian control meeting the above criteria was excluded because there was no Asian prodromal patient (see Supplementary Table 7 for sample information and the ‘Statistics and reproducibility' subsection for classification processes). Additionally, to prevent biological outliers, we used only idiopathic patients of White ethnicity (as none of the other ethnicities or genetic backgrounds presented in both the prodromal and control groups to enable proper matching). Of note, as only one of the control patients in the test data had clinical scores (the rest of the controls had neither UPDRS nor H&Y scores), we imputed the UPDRS and the H&Y scores of the control patients. For each patient, we calculated the mean value of all the timepoints of that patient for each of these measurements. Because these were needed only for the control patients, the imputed values were anyway close to zero in both of the measurements.

To produce ROC curves for patients with PD, we selected patients and controls with known genetic background and without prescribed PD medications. To reduce variation between the groups, we selected patients only from ‘Phase 1' and the following ethnicities: ‘White', ‘Black or African American', ‘Hispanic or Latino' or ‘Ashkenazi Jewish'. Furthermore, to analyze the early stages of diagnosed PD patients, we used only timepoint ‘BL' and PD patients for whom PD duration was 0. See Supplementary Table 8 for patient information.

To analyze DBS effects, we used small RNA-seq from the 19 patients with PD who were treated with DBS, all from the ‘Phase 2' group and having familial PD, 14 with LRRK2 mutations and five with GBA mutations. Levels of RGTTCRA-tRFs in the DBS-treated patients were compared to those in PD patients with the above mutations who did not undergo DBS surgery (n = 11) and to those in control patients carrying the same mutations (n = 9). Non-DBS PD patients and controls were selected from the latest timepoint (V8) to account for the length of time most DBS-treated PD patients have been ill. See Supplementary Table 11 for sample information.

Blood from 10 patients with PD, 10 patients with head trauma and 10 controls was taken in Jerusalem under Helsinki approval number SZMC-0029-20. Each group consisted of males and females, and all three had a similar average age (PD, 72 ± 7.5; Trauma, 73 ± 12; Control, 68 ± 5.6). See Supplementary Table 9 for detailed patient information. Samples were collected in Tempus Blood RNA Tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 4342792), and RNA was extracted using a Norgen Preserved Blood RNA Purification Kit I (Norgen Biotek, 43400). Concentration was determined (NanoDrop 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and quality was assessed by standard agarose gel electrophoresis. cDNA synthesis (from 250 ng) and qPCR are described below.

SN tissue samples (left hemisphere) were obtained from the NIH NeuroBioBank. All donors died of natural cause at age 71–79 years and were of ‘White' ethnicity. For elaboration, see Supplementary Table 10. RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit as above, followed by RNA concentration determination and quality assessment as above. cDNA synthesis (from 500 ng) and qPCR are described below.

cDNA was prepared using a qScript microRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quantabio, 95107). qPCRs were performed in 96-well (Bio-Rad, HSP9601) or 384-well (Bio-Rad, HSP3805) plates, using PerfeCTa SYBR Green FastMix Low ROX (Quantabio, 95074) and primers (Merck) as below, on a Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR System with CFX Maestro software (Bio-Rad, version 4.1.2433.1219). The qPCR was programmed for 30 s of annealing/extension at 50 °C due to the short primer length. ΔCq for each sample was calculated as ‘mean (RGTTCRA-tRF triplicate) − mean (MT-tRF triplicate)'. ΔΔCq was calculated by dividing each ΔCq value by the mean ΔCq of the control patients. Expression of each sample was calculated as 2ΔΔCq.

The products of two qPCR amplicons (PD1 and T7) were sequenced as follows. Small RNA libraries were prepared from 500 ng of cDNA (blunting with NEB-E1201, followed by poly(A) and library preparation with KAPA (KK8420) mRNA-seq Kit) and sequenced using the NextSeq 2000 system (Illumina) as described above. FASTQ files were aligned to tRFs as described above.

Sequencing data of blood taken from six controls and seven patients with PD (all males) were downloaded from GEO dataset GSE23676. Blood from patients with PD was drawn before DBS surgery and several months after surgery, upon optimal stimulation (Supplementary Table 12). Affymetrix probes of Ang were found using biomaRt65, and all the Ang probes were summed to yield the expression of the gene.

To assess the affinity of the CSF-expressed tRFs (1,017 tRFs in the CSF dataset that were expressed above a median of 10 CPM) to the Ribo-essential tRF44 and to rRNAs66, we used the RNAup web server45. We checked each of the expressed tRFs against the sequences of the Ribo-essential tRFs and against the open regions in the rRNAs that we found to contain reverse complement sequences to the RGTTCRA sequence (see sequences below), and we retrieved the total energy for each tRF (total energy equals the sum of melting energies of each of the sequences minus their binding energy to each other):

The human-derived neuroblastoma cell line LAN-5 was cultured under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2) in RPMI (Merck, R0883) supplemented with FCS (10% final concentration; Sartorius, 04-127), L-glutamine (2 mM final concentration; Sartorius, 03-020) and penicillin–streptomycin–amphotericin (100 U ml−1, 0.1 mg ml−1, 0.25 µg ml−1, final concentrations, respectively; Sartorius, 03-033). Cells were mycoplasma free (MycoBlue Mycoplasma Detection Kit; Vazyme, D101) and were used between passages 5 and 8.

Cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates at 30,000 cells per well. Six days later, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with methanol at −20 °C. Blocking solution (PBS with 5% normal donkey serum) was added to the wells for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 1-h incubation with primary antibody against human RPL24 (Proteintech, 17082-1-AP; rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000) and secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A10042; donkey anti-rabbit, 1:1,000) for 2 h. Cells were then washed with FISH buffer (1:1 of 2× SCC and 50% formamide and containing 50 μg ml−1 heparin), followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C with Affinity Plus (Integrated DNA Technologies) in situ probe, at a concentration of 200 nM. The probes were 5′-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 and contained locked nucleic acids at the bases marked ‘+':

To assess interactions with donor–acceptor proximity of less than 10 nm (refs. 48,67,68,69) between RGTTCRA-tRFs and ribosomes, we used FRET-FLIM with PIE70,71,72 (Extended Data Fig. 5). This allowed collecting fluorescence photon absolute detection times and detection times relative to moments of excitation for donor fluorescence after donor excitation, for acceptor fluorescence after donor excitation and FRET and for acceptor fluorescence after acceptor direct excitation. This was achieved with a confocal-based setup (ISS) assembled on top of a modified Olympus IX71 inverted microscope, as previously reported73,74. Donor and acceptor PIE was achieved by 488-nm and 532-nm picosecond pulsed lasers (λ = 488 nm, pulse width 80 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM), λ = 532 nm, pulse of 100 ps FWHM, rate; QuixX 488-60 PS, Omicron-Laserage, and FL-532-PICO, CNI), operating at 20-MHz repetition rate and interleaved by 25 ns. Of note, levels of donor fluorescence leakage into the acceptor fluorescence detection channel were negligible47. The laser beams passed through a single-mode polarization maintaining optical fiber (P1-405BPM-FC-Custom, specifications similar to those of PM-S405-XP, Thorlabs), a collimating lens (AC080-016-A-ML, Thorlabs), a halfwave plate (WPMP2-20(OD)-BB 550 nm, Karl Lambrecht Corp.) and a linear polarizer (DPM-100-VIS, Meadowlark Optics). Laser beams for acquiring images in laser scanning mode were reflected through galvo-scanning mirrors (6215H XY, Novanta Corp.) and scan lens (30 mm diameter × 50 mm focal length (FL), VIS-NIR Coated, Achromatic Lens, Edmund Optics) using a dichroic beam splitter at 405 nm, 488 nm, 532 nm and 640 nm (ZT405/488/532/640rpc-XT, Chroma). A ×100/1.45 numerical aperture (NA) oil objective (UPLSAPO100XO ×100 / 1.45 / oil / ∞ / 0.17/ OFN 26.5, Olympus) focused the light onto a small effective excitation volume. Scattered light was imaged on a CMOS camera (ThorCam, Thorlabs) using Airy ring pattern visualization. Fluorescence was collected through the same objective and focused with an achromatic lens (25 mm diameter × 100 mm FL, VIS-NIR Coated, Edmund Optics) onto a 100-μm-diameter pinhole and re-collimated with another achromatic lens (f = 100 mm; AC254-060-A, Thorlabs). Fluorescence was then split into two detection channels, 510/20 for AF488 and 698/70 for AF568, using a dichroic mirror (555-nm cutoff, FF555-Di03-25 × 36, Semrock) followed by bandpass filter 510/20 nm for wavelength <555 nm and 698/70 nm for wavelength >555 nm (FF03-510/20-25 and ff01-697/58-25, Semrock). Photons were detected using cooled hybrid photomultipliers (model R10467U-40, Hamamatsu) routed to a time-correlated single-photon counting module (SPC-150, Becker & Hickl) as its START signal (STOP signal was routed from the pulsed laser controller). For data acquisition, we used VistaVision software (version 4.2.095, 64-bit, ISS) in time-tagged time-resolved (TTTR) file format, and images were obtained using a laser scanning module in which a three-axis DAC module (ISS) synchronized data acquisition and control over the galvo-scanning mirrors. Images for FLIM measurements were obtained by tail-fitting fluorescence decays of each pixel in each photon stream (combination of excitation laser and detection channel), if it had at least 50 photons. FLIM images were acquired with 10-ms pixel dwell times in 15 × 15-μm2 image dimensions and 128 × 128-pixel resolutions.

All multiple comparisons were FDR corrected, and all visualizations were done using ggplot2 (ref. 75) in R (version 4.0.3)76. All statistical tests were conducted two-sided unless reported otherwise. All of the box plots in this paper are defined so that the central line of the box plot represents the median; the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles, respectively; and lower and upper whisker bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles, respectively. Differential analysis was carried out using edgeR77 (version 4.0.14) with patient age, sex and PM interval used as covariates in the design matrix of the edgeR analysis. Data collection and analysis were not performed blinded to the conditions of the experiments. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are compatible with those accepted in other publications in the field34,38,63. Due to the small number of samples in the SN data, we used the RNASeqPower pipeline78 (version 1.42.0) to estimate the power of the differentially expressed tRFs in these samples. We found the power of each of the differentially expressed tRFs to be higher than 0.87, with most of them (25th quantile and above) having a power higher than 0.9, which may improve the credibility of our findings in spite of the small number of samples.

Whenever the number of samples was smaller than 30, and the data did not distribute normally (P < 0.05 in a Shapiro test), a non-parametric test was run. Non-parametric tests were likewise used upon the need to compare median rather than mean values. All correlation tests conducted in this study (Extended Data Figs. 3c and 4e,f) are Spearman correlations, as we were interested in any type rather than linear correlation. Whenever comparing two groups to a third one, we used a Dunnett test (Figs. 1b,c and 3g,h and Extended Data Fig. 5a)

Binomial test was run on the differentially expressed tRFs in the CSF (Fig. 1b) and showed that they behave as a family and that most of the tRFs carrying the motif change in the same way. Upon comparing RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRF or RGTTCRA/MT-tRF ratio in blood of living and PM patients (Fig. 2f–h), we used the Mann–Whitney test (with FDR correcting for multiple comparisons) to compare the PD effect (PD versus Ctrl in each subgroup of a specific dataset and genetic background), and we employed a two-way ANOVA test to estimate the overall effect of PD while accounting for the dataset (that is, PM or alive) and the genetic background as covariates. The reason for using Mann–Whitney rather than a t-test for the first type of comparisons was that both the genetic controls and the PD idiopathic groups included low patient numbers (16 in each), and the data did not distribute normally (P < 0.0014, P < 0.003, P < 3 × 10−5, for PM RGTTCRA-tRF and MT-tRFs and Live genetic MT-tRFs, respectively; Shapiro test).

Matching analysis was carried out using MatchIt79 (version 4.6.0), with matched factors being sex, age and batch (‘Study'), distance = ‘glm' and link = ‘probit'. For each of the ROC calculations (either prodromal and controls or PD and controls), we first used an ‘optimal' matching in which each prodromal or PD patient was matched with a control (based on the above-mentioned factors). Next, the ratio between RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs was normalized for each matched pair of prodromal and control or PD and control individuals, by dividing the pair's scores by the pair's mean. Lastly, we used a machine learning algorithm to calculate ROC (MLeval, version 0.3)80. In the feature selection process, a Mann–Whitney calculation was used to prevent outlier patients from skewing the results (for this reasoning, we focused on median rather than mean differences). The dimensions used for the ROC calculations included ethnicity and either UPDRS III and H&Y scores or the tRF normalized ratio (described above). The training control was performed with five cross-validations using both GBM and linear model (LM) machine learning algorithms (method = ‘cv‘, summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, number = 5 and classProbs and savePredictions = T). ROC curves were plotted using the pROC package81 (version 1.18.5).

In training the model on randomly mixed labels, we received an AUC of 0.43, which reflects systematic misclassification rather than predictive power, as the model picked up on random patterns in the data. This result illustrates the random distribution expected in a sham model setup, with a marginal error. We further ran iterations of a ‘full' matching in which patients were divided into clusters, each containing at least one prodromal or PD patient and one control, and the same pipeline as described above for the ‘optimal' matching was used.

To compute the ability of the tRF-based and the clinical-based algorithms to classify patients (Extended Data Fig. 4g), we ran chi-square, first using the percentage of patients predicted by random distribution and then using the percentage of patients predicted by the clinical-based algorithm as the reference probability. This created a confusion matrix of two columns (predicted to be prodromal, predicted to be control) and two rows (is indeed prodromal, is indeed control). Comparing the matrix of the tRF-based algorithm to the reference clinical-based matrix enabled proving that the tRF-based algorithm predicted a higher number of true prodromal patients to be prodromal.

First, we extracted all options of 14-nt-long sequences found in the PPMI-expressed tRFs. For example, for a tRF with the length of 30 nt, we regarded each of the sequences produced from nucleotides 1–14, 2–15, 3–16… 17–30 as a potential motif. We than created 10,000 couples of randomly selected motifs and, for each couple, ran the same process as described above (namely, for each patient, we summed the counts for each of these motifs and calculated the ratio between the sums). We then normalized the ratio for each pair of optimally matched prodromal and control patients by dividing both by the mean of the pair's ratio. We ran GMB analysis and extracted the yielded AUC.

a. ROC curve of the GLM algorithm classifying prodromal and control patients, based on only tRFs (tRFs-score; orange), only clinical measurements (UPDRS section III plus Hoehn and Yahr; turquoise) or Null classification (tRFs + clinical measurements albeit with mixed labels; grey). b. Ratio between RGTTCRA-tRFs to MT-tRFs in Prodromal patients (orange; n = 60) and controls (grey; n = 129) separated by their ethnicity and genetic backgrounds.

Each dot represents a prodromal patient that was later diagnosed as PD (n = 21). X axis: UPDRS score (at basal level, not at diagnosis as PD), Y axis: tRFs-score. i. Amplicons of two qPCR products (mixture of all three triplicates) were sequenced and aligned to tRFs. >50% of the reads were mapped to different tRFs (each color represents a single tRF. Note that the most prominent tRF in sample PD1 is hardly expressed in T7 and vice versa. All boxplots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the boxplot represents the median, the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles and lower and upper whiskers bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

a. Interaction of motif-carrying tRFs with ribosomes based on the GSE113751 dataset of short RNA-seq from ribosomes pulldown in HeLa (red), HCT116 (green) and HEK293T (blue) cells. Cells were either untreated or starved for Arg(inine) or Leu(cine) for 3 or 6 hours. Left Y axis: Points show RGTTCRA- tRF fractions among all tRFs. Right Y axis: total number of reads per sample.

FRET-sensitized fluorescence of the acceptor indicates a non-negligible amount of donor-labeled RGTTCRA-tRF and acceptor-labeled antibody-tagged RPL24 ribosomal protein found at proximities <10 nm, and hence tRF and ribosomes interact. d, e. Fluorescence lifetime image of FRET-sensitized (C) or directly excited (D) acceptor-labeled ribosomes. f. The acceptor dye labeled by an antibody tagging the ribosomal protein RPL24 presents acceptor fluorescence decay of a region of interest (green & red arrows) after direct (red) and FRET-sensitized excitation, reflected as slower fluorescence decay of FRET-sensitized compared to direct excitation events.

Blood MT-tRF levels in apparently healthy control carriers of PD-related mutations (Ctrl; grey; n = 9) and in PD patients, carriers of mutations in the LRRK2 and GBA genes (PD; blue; n = 30), with and without DBS (black and red lines; n = 11, n = 19). Y axis: mean blood MT-tRFs levels (white rhombuses). No significant changes, one-way ANOVA. b. GSE155727 dataset of ribosomal profiling and short-RNA-seq from SHSY cells. Counts per million of 3′-tRFs and i-tRFs lacking our motif (green) and carrying it (purple), from ribosome associated RNA-seq (left) or bulk short RNA-seq (right) in resting cells, or in cells right after or two hours post depolarization (2 h pDP). All boxplots in this figure are defined so that the central line of the boxplot represents the median, the lower and upper box bounds represent 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles and lower and upper whiskers bounds represent 0 and 1 quantiles.

Metrics details

Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are rapid, recurring X-ray bursts from supermassive black holes, believed to result from interactions between accretion disks and surrounding matter. The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, previously stable for two decades, exhibited an increase in optical brightness in December 2019, followed by persistent active galactic nucleus (AGN)-like variability for 5 yr, suggesting the activation of a ~106-M⊙ black hole. Since February 2024, X-ray emission has been detected, revealing extreme ~4.5-d QPEs with high fluxes and amplitudes, long timescales, large integrated energies and a ~25-d superperiod. Low-significance UV variations are reported, probably related to the long timescales and large radii from which the emission originates. This discovery broadens the possible formation channels for QPEs, suggesting that they are linked not solely to tidal disruption events but more generally to newly formed accretion flows, which we are witnessing in real time in a turn-on AGN candidate.

(Top): between 2018-2024. It includes optical data from ZTF in the g (green circles) and r (red squares, divided by a factor 1.6) bands, with the total fluxes in units of mJy (shown in the left axis), and X-ray data from NICER (detections as black circles, non detections as black triangles), Swift/XRT (detections as blue diamonds, non detections as blue triangles), Chandra (pink thin-diamond), and eROSITA non detections (as purple triangles), with the X-ray luminosities in units of erg s−1 (shown in the right axis); (Bottom): zoom-in to X-ray data on dates after February 2024, when X-ray emission was detected for the first time with Swift/XRT. The X-ray luminosity is given in units of 1043erg s−1. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties in both panels.

These correspond to ObsID 0935191401 (left), 0935191501 (middle), and 0935191601 (right). The light curves are background-subtracted and grouped into 20-second bins.

The data were obtained during the quiescence state. The model is tbabs × zashift × diskbb. Strong residuals are observed around 0.7-1.0 keV band in bins 1 and 2. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties.

From top to bottom, the observations correspond to bins 1, 2, and 3 of ObsID 035191601, and bins 4, 5, and 6 of ObsID 035191401. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties.

(Top panel): From top to bottom, the observations correspond to bins 1, 2, and 3 of ObsID 035191601, and bins 4, 5, and 6 of ObsID 035191401. (bottom panels): residuals for each bin. Error bars represent a 1σ uncertainties.

Left: Full Swift/UVOT light curves, constructed using data collected from July 31st, 2021 until July 10, 2024, including the UVW2 (purple circles), UVM2 (pink circles), UVW1 (blue circles), U (yellow circles), B (green circles), and V (red circles) bands. The period with gyroscope issues is shown in lighter colours, and observations in the low sensitivity areas of the detector are marked as empty symbols. The dashed lines show the results of the power-law decay fit for the UV bands. We obtain power-law indices of -0.23, -0.18, and -0.11, for the UVW2, UVM2, and UVW1 band, respectively. Right: Zoom of the Swift/UVOT light curves for the period between April 10 and July 10, 2024. As a reference, we show the XMM-Newton/OM fluxes in squares. Note that the transmission curves of Swift/UVOT and XMM/OM are not exactly the same.

The orbital period of the EMRI is fixed by the observed QPE periodicity, while the properties of the inner disk are set so it completes a precession cycle every 25 days. The upper area represents cases in which the EMRI eccentricity is too high, resulting in a pericentre that always go through the cavity. In the lower area the EMRI has a wider pericentre, and always crosses the disk. In the middle area the EMRI sometimes crosses the disk and sometimes goes through the cavity, potentially explaining the behaviour observed in Ansky.

The solid lines show the cumulative flux density for four different wavelengths. The dashed lines of the corresponding colors show the measured flux densities for each band and the vertical lines mark the truncation radii needed to satisfy each observed flux. The dotted line shows the cumulative bolometric luminosity integrated from the same disk model as a function of outer truncation radius, divided by the Eddington luminosity. The error band marks the effect of a 10% uncertainty in the g-band band flux, for this non-simultaneous observation. In the top panel the accretion rate is set to match the UVW2 flux at a truncation radius of 330 Rg, expected for the size of a TDE disc. This truncation radius under-predicts the optical flux by a factor of 2. In the bottom panel the truncation radius and accretion rates are fit to match the measured fluxes in the optical and UV bands simultaneously. Notice the different dynamical range of the y-axis on both plots.

Metrics details

A frequently undervalued aspect of lithium-ion battery performance reporting is the specification of the format and area of the tested cells. However, these parameters provide crucial insights into the quality of the electrodes used for cell assembly and the reliability of the data obtained from the investigated systems. Here we focus on the aspects of process standardization and industry collaboration necessary for translating nanoscale electrochemical processes to Ah-scale cells. We examine the role of cell area and format in promoting comparability and standardization in battery research studies with technology readiness levels of 4 or higher. In addition, we discuss the limitations, challenges and expectations associated with measuring and evaluating battery performance exclusively in small cell formats.

Standardization in battery performance reporting is crucial for ensuring consistency and comparability of data across scientific studies on this topic1. Many studies often use experimental conditions that differ substantially from practical applications, such as low active material loading, large electrolyte volumes and low charging current rates. Standardizing data reporting practices would clarify the conditions under which batteries are tested and help to identify the most promising and impactful research. Some scholarly journals have made efforts in this direction by requiring authors to complete a detailed checklist concerning, for example, electrode properties and cycling conditions2,3,4. Recently, several interlaboratory collaborations have been conducted to assess the reproducibility of experiments on electrochemical devices made from the same materials but carried out in different settings, often revealing wide variations in the reported results5,6,7. Within the Battery 2030+ project, a large-scale and long-term European research initiative, scientists and researchers developed an online, collaborative, open-access platform called the Battery Knowledge Base (https://battery.knowledge-graph.eu/wiki/Main_Page), which documents all steps of battery manufacturing alongside related process parameters and measurable quantities. These initiatives aim to harmonize materials research studies, which very often use coin cells or similar formats (with a technology readiness level (TRL) ≤3)8. However, to the best of our knowledge, the scientific community has not yet explicitly addressed the standardization of battery performance reporting for research studies with a TRL ≥4.

In this Analysis, building on the extensive experience we have gained in upscaling the fundamental electrochemical energy storage processes of the battery, which occur at the nanoscale9, to the Ah scale10,11,12,13,14,15,16, we aim to highlight the importance of detailing the geometric area and format of lithium-ion cells. These aspects are often overlooked in battery research operating at TRL ≤3, while they are of particular importance in studies with a TRL ≥4. We also propose a framework for reporting these parameters and present results from an experimental campaign involving more than 30 21700-type cylindrical cells, all using the same materials and testing procedures. In doing so, we aim to emphasize the importance of considering aspects such as the reliability of results in terms of capacity, applied potential, resistance and cycling stability as well as the suitability of large-area wound cells, that is, cells where the electrodes and separators are wound around a winding mandrel or centre pin, as a better standard for industrial battery research and development activities.

Every cell format is important in battery research and development. However, the data obtained from each format must be evaluated within the boundaries defined by its design and the size of the tested electrodes. Uncritically extrapolating the performance of prospective commercial large-area cells from data generated with smaller formats often overlooks issues that become apparent only during scaling up. When going to mass production, such assumptions can lead to a substantial waste of time, materials, energy and money—far exceeding the resources required to produce a small number of commercial-like cells upfront.

In fact, upscaling new materials or processes developed at laboratary scale presents a series of challenges that are frequently neglected when the objective is limited to producing mAh-scale cells (that is, with TRL ≤3)17,18. As illustrated in Fig. 1, on the way from individual components (active materials, separator, electrolyte, current collector, casing and so on) to the finished cell, problems generally arise during slurry mixing and coating, electrode drying and calendering, and cell assembly and formation19,20. While not having the possibility here to discuss these challenges individually, we want to emphasize that the majority of the issues shown in Fig. 1 has a substantial impact on the battery performance and can be fully detected when assembling Ah-level large-area cells20. However, according to a recent peer-reviewed publication that analysed more than 13,000 scientific publications on batteries, only about 28% of the research articles reporting the electrode composition specify the area of the electrodes21. A related study on the same dataset suggests that even fewer accurately describe the cell format and design (for example, coin cell, pouch cell and so on)22.

We routinely use coin cells (approximately 2–6 mAh) to evaluate the specific capacity, initial coulombic efficiency and discharge rate capability, as they are simple and quick to assemble and test. Typically, for an initial assessment of the Li-ion storage capability, coin cells are assembled using the investigated active materials at the working (positive) electrode and lithium metal at the counter (negative) electrode, along with the same electrolyte solution that is used in upscaling experiments with larger formats. However, the reliability of cycle life data obtained from coin cells is questionable, as it has been shown to depend on highly variable parameters, such as the type of casing steel and the applied pressure, that is, the stack height23,24, which are independent of the materials studied. In addition, the misalignment of positive and negative electrodes can easily occur25, and the high perimeter-to-area ratio of small-area electrodes indicates a strong, detrimental influence of the electrodes' edges on cell performance26. While these issues may still allow researchers to compare the results from coin cells assembled in similar conditions within their laboratories, comparisons of results obtained in different laboratories, where the assembling quality is not known, should be approached with caution. Although coin cells are usually the preferred format for low-TRL studies to characterize new battery materials, they should be considered inadequate predictors of cycling stability in scaling-up studies involving TRL ≥4 cells. Moreover, high-current-rate experiments should also be critically evaluated due to the large resistance of the coin cell set-up and, in the case of Li metal coin cell tests, the overpotential caused by the lithium metal counter/negative electrode, especially when testing working/positive electrodes with high areal capacity23,24.

Single-layer or double-layer pouch cells (approximately 50–200 mAh) are the next-size battery test vehicle in our workflow27. They can be conveniently assembled using a relatively small amount of active material and even hand-coated electrodes. Their larger area allows a more reliable assessment of long-term cycling stability28. These data can be used to infer the behaviour of larger cells, but with some important limitations to consider, such as the still relatively high perimeter-to-area ratio, the impact of the negative electrode overhang size on the total cell area, and a reduced temperature increase during cycling compared with Ah-scale cells12,28. In addition, pouch cells lack standardization in terms of dimensions and area, as they do not have a standardized hard case to constrain their size, unlike cylindrical and prismatic cells. Importantly, multilayer stacked pouch cells, that is, pouch cells whose electrodes are cut in multiple pieces with same dimensions and piled up29, do not ensure that the electrodes used during the assembly are consistently of high quality, as only the best sections of the electrode may be selected and cut for the cell assembly. This issue is reduced in large wound cells, as electrodes with lengths over 1 m are used in Ah-scale cells, which must meet strict production quality standards to ensure reliable cycling data. To ensure the reproducibility of battery testing, it is necessary to assemble a relevant amount of such wound cells where the double-sided electrodes must be homogeneously coated over a length in the order of 100 m to 1,000 m (refs. 12,29). Furthermore, winding induces stress on the electrodes due to the curvature around the cell's winding mandrel, requiring them to have more stringent mechanical properties (for example, adhesion and cohesion) compared with stacked pouch cells12,30. Wound cell formats typically have predefined casings, such as 18650, 21700, 4680 and so on, for cylindrical cells, or VDA (acronym for Verband der Automobilindustrie, the German Association of the Automotive Industry) PHEV1, VDA PHEV2 and so on, for prismatic cells29. Standardized dimensions facilitate the comparison of energy density and performance across different cells from various research institutions or manufacturers. Nevertheless, they require more advanced equipment for their assembly and cycling, such as winding machines and high-current testing equipment. It is important to notice that, for applied testing currents >1 A, the thermal behaviour and the resistance of current collectors and cell's connectors start acting as stumbling blocks for the delivery of adequate cell performance, unlike in smaller cell formats, where such high currents are usually not applied.

Figure 2a shows the geometrical area and perimeter of electrodes for various types of laboratory-scale and industrial-scale cell configurations we assemble and test. Moving from the left to the right of the graph, it can be noticed how the values of electrode perimeter and geometrical area change when transitioning from basic low-TRL research to high-TRL commercial scale (data and methods used to calculate the geometrical area and perimeter values for each type of cell can be found in Supplementary Note 1). The geometrical area and perimeter span four to five orders of magnitude when transitioning from a 2032 coin cell to a prismatic cell. Whereas only a few square centimetres of electrode are needed for a coin cell, commercial cell formats require large, high-quality, defect-free electrodes to attain the intended battery performance and ensure data reliability. Based on the assumptions used for the calculations for Fig. 2a, 21700-cell electrodes are approximately 1 m long, while electrodes for a 4680-cell measure more than 5 m in length. This means that, for building these large-electrode-area cells, the absence of the issues illustrated in Fig. 1 must be ensured over multiples of these electrode lengths even at pilot scale, not to mention mass manufacturing. In general, regardless of the cell format used, ensuring the coating of high-quality, uniform electrodes should be a primary focus in battery research studies, and it is of paramount importance when aiming to produce and test cells with TRL ≥4.

a, The electrode perimeter (blue), electrode geometric area (yellow) and perimeter/geometric area ratio (grey) for different cell formats. Information regarding the assumed dimensions, number and type of electrodes for each cell format is provided in Supplementary Note 1. The dashed lines serve as a guide for the eyes. b, A schematic illustration with an in-scale comparison of the size of a typical 21700-type cylindrical cell electrode, a single-layer pouch cell electrode and disk-shaped electrodes for commercially available three-electrode cells (EL-Cell) and 2032 coin cells. For the 21700-type cylindrical cell electrode, the area of only one of the two coated sides is reported, for a better comparison with the other single-side coated electrodes.

To better visualize this size difference, Fig. 2b shows a scaled comparison of a typical electrode for a 21700 cylindrical cell versus electrodes for single-layer pouch cells, commercially available three-electrode cells (EL-Cell) and 2032 coin cells. From this schematic, it is evident that the geometrical area of the electrodes in coin cells is very limited compared with those used in cylindrical cells. The same consideration can be applied to electrodes used in single-layer pouch cells. Even in the case of multilayer pouch cells assembled in a stacked configuration, a selection of the most homogeneous negative and positive electrodes is still possible, as the individual electrodes in small-area pouch cells are usually much smaller than those in cylindrical or prismatic cells, where electrodes are wound rather than stacked30. This electrode selection for pouch cell assembly increases the scrap rate and hinders the identification of issues during the electrode production phase. Therefore, large-area, non-stacked cells can more reliably ensure that the used electrodes are free of defects that could negatively affect a cell's electrochemical energy storage performance.

In Fig. 2a, we also show the electrode perimeter-to-geometric area ratio for each cell format, which can be used to assess the influence of electrode edges on cell behaviour. The edge region plays a critical role in the cell's stability as it is a hotspot for lithium deposition at the negative electrode during battery operation31. Moreover, cutting electrodes into the desired shape can produce burrs and dust at the edges, increasing the risk of piercing the separator and causing local short circuits30. Therefore, a lower perimeter-to-geometric area ratio indicates better electrode quality and fewer defects. While a 12-mm-diameter coin cell electrode has a perimeter-to-area ratio of 3.33 cm−1, the same ratio for a double-side coated 6 × 92 cm2 21700 cylindrical cell electrode is 0.36 cm−1, about ten times lower. The choice of large-area cells becomes then even more important, as it minimizes the adverse effects of edges on battery performance. With the detrimental effect of the electrodes' edges, the actual performance of the cell will not align with the intended performance, because a higher number of edges increases the likelihood of defects and, hence, the possibility of triggering of failure mechanisms. We would also like to emphasize that, in the case of multilayer stacked pouch cells, increasing the number of layers (and, therefore, the capacity and area) does not result in a decrease in the perimeter-to-geometric area ratio, as the selected electrodes maintain the same geometric characteristics.

To demonstrate the level of consistency achievable at pilot scale with large-area wound cell formats, we present the results of an extensive experimental campaign, where 34 cylindrical 21700 cells (21 mm in diameter and 70 mm in height) were assembled and tested using the same active materials, electrode dimensions and cell design (Fig. 3a). Details regarding the materials, electrode production and cell assembly are provided in Methods.

The white dots indicate medians, black bars the interquartile range and whiskers the full range; narrower areas represent lower dispersion. d, Discharge capacity retention versus cycle number during 1 C/1 C CC–CP cycling at 25 °C for 17 cells, normalized to the first 1 C discharge, with each line, coloured in a scale from purple to yellow, representing a different cell. The 80% end-of-life capacity is marked with a dashed line. e, DCIR versus cycle number during 1 C/1 C CC–CP cycling at 25 °C for 17 cells, with each line, coloured in a scale from purple to yellow, representing a different cell. Data are shown up to cycle 708, the last with resistance measurements for all cells.

Concerning the geometrical parameters of the cells, the positive electrode dimensions were 6 cm in width and 99.5 cm in length, double-side coated, with a total coated area of 1,194 cm2, while the negative electrode ones were 6.2 cm in width and 104.5 cm in length (with an overhang of 1 mm), double-side coated, resulting in a total coated area of 1,296 cm2. After laser ablation and tab welding31, the overall geometric active area of the cell was 1,166 cm2. In Table 1, we report these data with other relevant cell parameters.

Figure 3b shows the cell potential–capacity curves during the discharge of all 34 cells in the third formation cycle @ 0.1 C (the same chart is reported in terms of specific capacity in Supplementary Fig. 1). On average, the discharge capacity during this cycle was 3.44 ± 0.03 Ah. This capacity served as the reference value for the 1 C current, which was set at 3.44 A. The 1 kHz impedance of the cell after formation, measured to assess the electric resistance, yields a value of 12.6 ± 0.3 mΩ. The numerical distributions of these two parameters are shown in Fig. 3c as a violin plot. A similar plot is found in Supplementary Fig. 2, showing the distributions of cell mass (63.75 ± 0.33 g) and discharged energy at 0.2 C (11.81 ± 0.09 Wh), resulting in an average cell specific energy of 185.27 ± 1.76 Wh kg−1 and an energy density of 487.18 ± 3.87 Wh l−1 at 0.2 C current rate. All these parameters indicate a high level of homogeneity in the electrodes used in terms of areal mass loading and capacity, as well as uniform impedance among the cells. This confirms the satisfactory level of reproducibility of the pilot-scale cylindrical cell manufacturing capabilities used.

Out of these 34 cells, 17 underwent further testing in a 1 C/1 C long-term cycling stability experiment at 25 °C, with a 0.1 C check-up cycle every 100 cycles. Check-up cycles at low current are implemented to verify the residual capacity of the cell without influence from the overpotentials and the temperature increase caused by the relatively high cycling currents. During these check-ups, the direct current internal resistance (DCIR) was also measured at 100% state of charge with a 30-s current pulse. Besides demonstrating a cell's power capability32, the DCIR metric can also reveal variability among cells. In high-quality cells, the evolution of their DCIR during cycling should be uniform and not excessive. In fact, it is also a valuable indicator for monitoring cell health and can serve as an additional criterion for determining end of life33. The results of this testing procedure are shown in Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Fig. 3. More variability among the cell performances can be observed in terms of cycling stability compared with the formation cycles, with a few cells showing a greater capacity fading than the average. In fact, the number of cycles at which this group of cells reaches the end-of-life criterion (that is, 80% of the beginning-of-life 1 C capacity) is 800 ± 73, but three of them reach this criterion between 650 and 700 cycles (see Supplementary Fig. 4, where the distribution of this quantity is visualized). If we do not consider these three outlier cells in the statistics, the 80% of capacity retention is reached after 825 ± 51 cycles. Regarding the DCIR, the average resistance at the first cycle is 37.5 ± 0.5 mΩ cm2 and increases to 54.1 ± 0.8 mΩ cm2 after about 700 cycles. These results align with the state-of-the-art reports on ageing studies of cylindrical commercial Li-ion cells, which utilize similar materials to those we used34,35. It should be pointed out that, in our case, some outlier cells are expected due to variabilities in the non-fully automated cells' manufacturing pilot plant we used.

In this Analysis, we discussed how large-area wound cells, such as 21700 cylindrical cells, provide greater reliability regarding the obtained electrochemical data compared with other small-area formats. This improvement is mainly associated with the ability of the large-area electrodes to minimize issues related to edge effects and to accurately reflect the quality of the manufactured electrodes. We hope that the results presented in this analysis will serve as a benchmark and demonstrate that consistent data can be obtained for Li-ion cells with TRL ≥4, prepared in a pilot plant for electrode manufacturing and cell assembly. We advocate that studies at this scale should include detailed information similar to the data presented in Table 1 and report the distribution of relevant cell parameters.

At the same time, it is important to stress that data obtained from Li-ion cells with TRL ≥4 should not be interpreted as a dismissal of other cell formats with lower TRL. Coin and small-area pouch cells (whether single- or multilayer) play a crucial role in every academic or industrial battery research laboratory. However, the data obtained in cells using low-area electrodes must be interpreted within the appropriate context to prevent excessive extrapolation8. Scaling up processes involves challenging engineering and technology activities, representing a fundamental aspect of scientific discovery. The ultimate impact of newly proposed concepts and ideas can only be fully understood and appreciated when applied in a practical environment; this process often drives innovation in ways that are not initially anticipated.

We advocate for stronger collaboration between academia and industrial research institutes to upscale and validate results obtained in laboratory-scale small-area Li-ion cells (that is, at TRL ≤3) to more practical and industrially relevant cell formats. Doing so may allow the gap between academic and industrial research to be bridged in the future, promoting coordinated progress in battery research and development.

The electrode slurries were mixed in air conditions in a 10-litre vessel using a planetary mixer equipped with butterfly and crossbeam stirrers (Netzsch). The electrode slurry was applied through a comma bar coating system on a pilot coating line (LACOM GmbH) with four separate drying zones along its 8-m length. For the preparation of the positive electrode slurry, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Oqema, >99.5%) was used as the solvent. For the preparation of the negative electrode slurry, deionized water (<2.0 µS cm−1) was used as solvent. The positive electrode slurry was coated onto 15-µm-thick aluminium foil (Hydro, AA1100), and the negative electrode slurry was coated onto 10-µm-thick copper foil (JX Nippon, HS1200, Cu-0.12%Sn). Both positive and negative pilot electrodes were coated to a width of 80 mm. Drying of the electrodes was performed at temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 110 °C in the convection oven of the coating line at ambient pressure. To determine the electrode porosity ε, the density of the electrode without porosity ρel was first calculated using the mass fractions xi and densities ρi of its components

Next, the density measured after calendering ρel,cal was divided by electrode density without porosity. The electrode porosity was then calculated as one minus this ratio

The positive electrode active material was LiNi0.83Co0.12Mn0.05O2 (NMC 811, Targray), with an average particle size of D50 = 11.8 µm (D10 = 5.6 µm, D90 = 21.2 µm) and a surface area (calculated via Brunauer–Emmett–Teller theory) of 0.4 m2 g−1 (values provided by the supplier). The positive electrode composition consisted of 93% active material, 3% carbon black (CB, Super C65, Imerys, >99.8%, D50 < 50 nm), 1% graphite (SFG6L, Imerys, >99.8%, D50 = 3.5 µm) and 3% polyvinylidene fluoride (Solef 5130/1001, Solvay Solexis, >99.999%). The dry slurry-coated positive electrode exhibited an areal capacity of approximately 3.12 mAh cm−2 (active material loading ~14.89 mg cm−2), and it was calendered (Mathis AG) with 60 ton, 68 µm of gap, at 1 m min−1 and 100 °C to achieve an average density of 3.33 g cm−3 and an average single-side thickness of 48 µm, excluding the Al current collector (calculated porosity 24.4%). For the porosity calculation, densities of 4.80 g cm−3 for the NMC, 1.85 g cm−3 for the CB, 2.26 g cm−3 for the graphite, and 1.78 g cm−3 for the polyvinylidene fluoride were assumed. Before cell assembly, the positive electrode was further dried after calendering at 110 °C for 16 h in a vacuum oven (PINK GmbH Thermosysteme).

The negative electrode formulation comprises 94% graphite (Showa Denko, D50 = 11.4 µm), 2% CB (Super C65, Imerys, >99.8%, D50 < 50 nm), 2% carboxymethyl cellulose (MAC 500LC, Sunrose, average molecular weight 500,000 g mol−1) and 2% styrene-butadiene rubber (Zeon, 40 wt.% aqueous dispersion) binders. This pilot-scale negative electrode exhibited an areal capacity of approximately 3.60 mAh cm−2 (active material loading ~10.46 mg cm−2), resulting in a negative-to-positive ratio for the Li-ion cells of about 1.15. The dry slurry-coated negative electrode was calendered (Mathis AG) with 60 ton, 108 µm of gap, at 1 m min−1 and 40 °C to an average density of 1.56 g cm−3 and an average single-side thickness of 71 µm, excluding the Cu current collector (calculated porosity 27.5%). For the porosity calculation, true densities of 2.26 g cm−3 for the graphite, 1.85 g cm−3 for the CB, 1.60 g cm−3 for the carboxymethyl cellulose and 0.94 g cm−3 for the styrene-butadiene rubber were assumed. The negative electrode was further dried after calendering at 130 °C for 16 h in a vacuum oven (PINK GmbH Thermosysteme) before cell assembly.

State-of-the-art equipment and a dry room (80 m2, dew point <−60 °C) were used for the assembly and testing of 21700-type cylindrical lithium-ion batteries. The equipment included tools for electrode slitting, laser ablation, ultrasonic welding of tabs, automated electrode winding, cell grooving, electrolyte filling and cell crimping13,14.

After tab welding, the jelly rolls—that is, the wound assemblies of the positive electrode, separators and negative electrode—were produced using a semi-automatic winding machine (Sovema). A customized Celgard microporous membrane was used as separator (thickness 16 µm, width 65 mm). Before inserting the jelly roll into the 21700 stainless-steel can, a high-potential test (Flüke 1587) was performed to check the isolation of the separator within the jelly roll by applying a 100 V d.c. potential between the negative and positive tabs for 3 s and reading the measured resistance, which should be higher than 50 MΩ. Subsequently, the positive and negative electrode tabs were welded to the bottom of the can and the lid via electric resistance welding and ultrasonic welding, respectively. The cylindrical cells were filled with 7 ml (approximately 2 ml per Ah) of 1.4 M lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) in ethylene carbonate:dimethyl carbonate (3:7 wt.%) + 2 wt.% vinylene carbonate electrolyte solution (Gotion, H2O 4.4 ppm, HF 21.5 ppm) inside an Ar-filled glovebox (O2 <0.1 ppm, H2O <0.1 ppm) and then crimped in the same environment.

All electrochemical measurements were carried out with BaSyTec CTS cyclers in a climate chamber (Vötsch LabEvent) set at 25 °C, with additional monitoring of individual cell temperatures with one K-type thermocouple per cell placed in the middle of its lateral surface and connected to the cycler. The formation procedure involved charging at 0.1 C (constant current–constant potential (CC–CP) protocol with charge cut-off at 0.05 C) and discharging (applying a CC) for three cycles between 4.2 V and 2.5 V of cell potential, estimating the 1 C current with the cell capacity calculated considering only the positive electrode contribution. After formation, the cell impedance was measured at 1 kHz at open circuit potential (using an HIOKI 3554 battery internal resistance tester), followed by cell rating to determine the specific energy and the energy density. The cell rating was performed with the same protocol of the formation procedure but with a 0.2 C current, using the discharge capacity of the last formation cycle to obtain the actual 1 C current of each cell. During long-term cycling (1 C/1 C, charge CC–CP, charge cut-off at 0.05 C, discharge CC), every 100th cycle was designated as a check-up cycle carried out at 0.1 C charge/discharge rate. After the check-up cycle charging step, the cell was rested for 30 min to determine the open circuit potential in the fully charged state. The DCIR was then measured by applying a 1 A discharge pulse for 10 s, followed by 10 A discharge pulse for 1 s. To obtain the DCIR, the difference between the final recorded potential points of the 1 A and 10 A pulses (E1 and E2, respectively) is divided by the difference between the two currents (I1 and I2, respectively)

After that, the 0.2 C discharge step of the check-up cycle was resumed. These check-up cycles are omitted in Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 3 for clarity, but they are reported in Supplementary Fig. 5.

Metrics details

Understanding how molecules in solution begin to nucleate and grow into defined aggregates remains an outstanding mechanistic challenge. This is because the nucleation process is affected by a number of physicochemical factors that act simultaneously and whose individual contributions are hard to disentangle. Here, we demonstrate how residual aggregates in a molecular dispersion state affect the nucleation kinetics and the resulting self-assembly pathway. Using the photoisomerization of a chiral azobenzene molecule, the amounts of residual aggregates can be controlled in the pre-assembly supersaturated solution. The residual aggregates induce surface-catalysed secondary nucleation of monomers, affecting the chiral intermolecular configuration during self-assembly to afford metastable right-handed P-aggregates as opposed to thermodynamically stable left-handed M-aggregates. By exploiting the photoisomerization process, we establish high-fidelity control over the nucleation processes and demonstrate reversible M ⇄ off ⇄ P tristate switching of supramolecular chirality. Finally, we show that chiral aggregates exhibit opposite chirality-induced spin selectivities with high spin-polarization rates.

The M-aggregate fragments were prepared separately through sonication (See Supplementary Figure 15). b CD spectra of PSSUV29 solution of (R)-1 (mtot = 100 µM) in a 20:80 (v/v) toluene/MCH containing M-aggregate fragments (0.5 mol%) before (purple line) and after irradiation with VIS20 at 25 °C (blue line). Inset in (b) shows the magnified CD spectrum of the PSSUV29 solution containing 0.5 mol% of M-aggregate fragments. A seed solution was obtained by applying sonication to a precipitated gel of M-aggregates. Upon adding this seed solution to the PSSUV29 solution free of residual aggregates and then irradiating with VIS20, the formation of P-aggregates was clearly demonstrated by CD measurements.

Inset in (b) shows the changes in the initial 2 days. When the PSSvis20 gel film of P-aggregates was kept above 25 °C, the gel film gradually collapsed in the 1.0 mm pathlength cuvette. This macroscopic collapse of the gel film hindered the time-dependent CD measurements due to possible artifacts, that is, light scattering and linear dichroism/birefringence effects. Even at temperature below 20 °C, the same problem was confirmed for samples with a total concentration of monomers less than 100 µM. Therefore, time-dependent CD measurements were carried out at 20 °C using a sample with a total concentration of monomers at 120 µM. The CD intensity of the PSSvis20 gel film reduced 50% in the initial 2 days. This observation is probably attributed to the thermal back-isomerization of non-aggregative Z-isomers, providing aggregative (R)-1EE to form M-aggregates (see Supplementary Fig. 11). Thus, much slower CD change observed after this first dramatic change corresponds to spontaneous transformation from metastable P-aggregates to thermodynamically stable M-aggregates. Pure M-aggregates could not be obtained over time due to the slow P → M transformation kinetics.

Data points represent the averaged mean values from a minimum of three experiments; the error bars the mean ± represent standard deviation. The γ values were estimated from the slopes to be −2.66 ± 0.12 for the formation of M-aggregates (reddish plots in Extended Data Fig. 3c) and −4.59 ± 0.47 for P-aggregates (bluish plots in Extended Data Fig. 3c), respectively. The large negative value for the formation of P-aggregates emphasizes the greater contribution of the secondary nucleation in the formation process.

An approximately 0.2 mol% of monomers remained as P-aggregates according to the CD activity by assuming that all residual aggregates exhibited right-handed helicity. The UV-light irradiation time for P-aggregates (30 s) to obtain the PSSUV solution containing residual aggregates is shorter than that for M-aggregates (3 min), as metastable P-aggregates dissociate more easily than thermodynamically stable M-aggregates.

Metrics details

Hydrogen and carbon dioxide transport can play an essential role in climate-neutral energy systems. Hydrogen networks serve regions with high energy demand, whereas emissions are transported away in carbon dioxide networks. For the synthesis of carbonaceous fuels, it is less clear which input should be transported: hydrogen to carbon point sources or carbon to low-cost hydrogen. Here we explore both networks' potential synergies and competition in cost-optimal carbon-neutral European energy systems. In direct comparison, a hydrogen network is more cost effective than a carbon network, as it serves to transport hydrogen to demand and to point sources of carbon for utilization. However, in hybrid scenarios where both networks are present, the carbon network effectively complements the hydrogen network, promoting carbon capture from distributed biomass and reducing reliance on direct air capture. The layouts of the hydrogen and carbon dioxide networks are robust if the climate target is tightened to be net negative.

The transition to a climate-neutral European economy is a pressing challenge that demands coordinated action across various energy sectors. Whereas management of both carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) is considered a critical component of this transition, a gap exists in understanding how new hydrogen infrastructure effectively interacts with carbon management technologies, including carbon capture, transport, storage, utilization and sequestration. Hydrogen is being considered in several industries that are not eligible for electrification. It offers an efficient way to transport and store energy over long distances and periods and can be produced from electrolysis or steam methane reforming (SMR), for example. Captured carbon can be stored in geological formations permanently, a process known as carbon sequestration (CS).

Additionally, carbon can be combined with hydrogen to produce carbonaceous fuels, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, synthetic methanol for shipping or synthetic methane for industrial feedstock or synthetic naphtha as a feedstock for high-value chemicals. The production of these carbonaceous fuels is jointly referred to as carbon utilization (CU). Carbon can be effectively captured from industrial processes and the combustion of biomass, fossil fuels or synthetic carbonaceous fuels through point source carbon capture (CC) or harvested from the atmosphere using direct air capture (DAC). If carbon from biomass or DAC is sequestered, there is net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Both CO2 and H2 networks are likely to play a crucial role in the cost-effective integration of these carbon management technologies to enable net-zero economies.

In line with the climate neutrality target by 2050 of the European Union under the European Green Deal1, numerous programmes, financial models and initiatives have been launched to support the ramp-up of the hydrogen and carbon economy. The Renewable Energy Directive III2 aims to produce 10 Mt hydrogen from renewable energy sources domestically in the European Union. The Net-Zero Industry Act3 proposes a CO2 injection target of 50 MtCO2 per year by 2030 for sequestration within the European Union. The European Commission's 2024 industrial carbon management strategy4 plans to capture 450 MtCO2 per year by 2050 in the European Union, of which almost 250 MtCO2 per year is sequestered. The European Innovation Fund5 supports carbon management technologies to enhance the global competitiveness of European industries.

At the same time, collaborative industry initiatives such as the European Hydrogen Backbone6 or the Hydrogen Infrastructure Map7 showcase the potential of hydrogen as a fuel and energy carrier. Business models from companies such as Tree Energy Solutions8, Carbfix9 and Equinor10 advertise carbon management hubs that provide green hydrogen, methane and synthetic fuels on the one hand and offer to purchase CO2 on the other hand. The Northern Lights project in Norway11 is planning a transport and sequestration capacity of 1.5 MtCO2 per year to be operative in 2024, expanding to a targeted scale of 5 MtCO2 per year of sequestration by 2030. The market potential for carbon capture and sequestration in Europe is underscored by the Capture Map's estimated potential of 1.7 MtCO2 annually from point sources12, accounting for about half of the continent's emissions, and estimated sequestration capacity potentials of up to 3 MtCO2 per year (ref. 13). Whereas certain aspects of sequestration technology are well established, particularly in offshore depleted oil and gas fields and saline aquifers, ongoing research and pilot projects continue to expand our understanding of different geologic storage options and monitoring techniques to ensure long-term containment14,15,16. To advance the carbon economy, the Clean Air Task Force emphasizes the importance of developing a carbon transport system in Europe alongside a hydrogen network17. Carbon pipelines, considered a mature technology, have seen widespread installations in the United States and Canada, primarily to supply CO2 to enhanced oil recovery18,19.

Despite the abundance of policies and initiatives, up to this point, it remains unclear how the two transport systems of hydrogen and carbon may complement or even compete with each other. Both can bridge the misalignment of sources and sinks for carbon and hydrogen. A hydrogen network can supply regions with geographically fixed hydrogen demand, such as for steel production, with hydrogen from regions with the best renewable resources and enable CU at the site of point source CC. On the other hand, the carbon transport system allows transporting captured carbon to regions with sequestration potentials or high-quality renewable resources, the latter enabling cost-effective CU.

In the literature, the two network approaches and underlying technologies have been discussed in several publications20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31. Such techno-economic models, in contrast, for example, to integrated Assessment Models, can account for the spatial distribution of carbon sources and sinks, which are crucial to provide a holistic view of the energy system and its technological interactions. However, all the techno-economic studies have dealt only with isolated aspects of hydrogen and carbon networks. Neumann et al.31 demonstrated the extent to which hydrogen and electricity grid expansion is interchangeable in a climate-neutral European energy system at the expense of higher investments. The underlying, highly resolved model encompasses the most relevant sectors. However, it neglects the infrastructure required to transport carbon across regions. Morbee et al.21 optimizes the topology and capacity of a CO2 network in Europe but considers only the power sector without co-optimizing renewable deployment. This limited sectoral scope cannot capture important dynamics of carbon management because it neglects sectors such as industry that will need to handle most CO2 in the future. The European Commission's Joint Research Center analysed the possible topology of a CO2 network in 202432. However, it did not include the interaction of CO2 sources and sinks with the rest of the energy system. Becattini et al.30 present a mixed-integer model to optimize the time evolution of a CO2 transport system in Switzerland, connected to a remote sequestration site in Norway. However, this limited spatial scope fails to consider other sequestration sites and the co-benefits from connecting the CO2 network to neighbouring countries. Other high-resolution energy system models do not feature detailed CU technologies and CO2 transport. In Pickering et al.33, the Euro-Calliope model, for example, features neither carbon nor hydrogen transport and thus forces synthetic fuel production to rely on local electrolysis and DAC in the same region.

Studies that comprehensively assess and consider the co-optimization and comprehensive assessment of both CO2 and H2 networks in a fully sector-coupled energy system are lacking. Such assessments are greatly needed to identify realms of competition and synergy between hydrogen and carbon management technologies. In this Article, we present a detailed study of the European energy system for 2050, which includes high geographical resolution and a comprehensive representation of carbon management technologies. The study is conducted using the PyPSA-Eur energy system model34, which optimizes operations and investments in all relevant energy sectors. It is assumed that Europe is self-sufficient in energy and does not import any fuels. This drives carbonaceous fuel production at sites where both CO2 and H2 can be provided at low cost.

To investigate the competing transport dynamics between CO2 and H2 networks, we contrast four scenarios (Table 1) with different sets of networks available to lower costs of supplying projected energy demands for 2050 (Fig. 1).

Derived from various sources41,42,43,44,45,46, the figure shows total annual energy demands for each energy source, which determine the model's endogenous investments and operation. Endogenous processes can lead to higher total production volumes of some energy carriers; for example, the demand for methanol requires more hydrogen and carbon as secondary (energy) inputs, which are not considered here. In the model, demands are defined per region and time stamp.

We analyse how the option to deploy carbon and hydrogen networks affects different decarbonization strategies in the scenarios and how investments in none or only one of the transport technologies lead to inefficient infrastructure layouts. Initially, we focus on a net-zero carbon emissions target, limiting carbon sequestration to 200 MtCO2 per year. This constraint ensures that carbon sequestration is reserved for the hardest-to-abate emissions while avoiding reliance on sequestration where other mitigation options are feasible. We give a detailed description of the different technological and geographical impacts of the transportation systems. Subsequently, our analysis demonstrates the extent to which different deployment strategies remain robust under a tightened target with net CO2 removal.

All scenarios share key characteristics but differ in system costs and technology use (Fig. 2). Costs in the Baseline scenario are the highest at 764 billion € per year. Scenarios with carbon and hydrogen networks are more cost effective, reducing costs by 3.1% in the CO2–grid, 4.7% in the H2–grid and 5.3% in the Hybrid scenario.

Whereas in the Baseline scenario, the model has neither a carbon nor a hydrogen network, it can expand both in the Hybrid scenario. The gas infrastructure combines gas facilities for transport, power and heat production. CO2 infrastructure and H2 infrastructure combine transport and storage for each carrier. Carbon capture at point sources refers to all technologies with integrated carbon capture, including the cost of the main facility (for example, combined heat and power units) and the carbon capture application.

System cost differences among the scenarios are driven by investments in wind and solar and by carbon capture technologies. In scenarios with carbon and hydrogen networks, the model primarily reduces the reliance on costly DAC, from 365 MtCO2 per year carbon capture in the Baseline scenario to 113 MtCO2 per year in the Hybrid scenario (Fig. 3). At the same time, carbon capture from biomass combustion, gas-based industry processes and biogas upgrading increase. The latter lowers the need for synthetic methane production.

Positive values indicate carbon capture, and negative values indicate carbon consumption. By integrating hydrogen and carbon networks, the predominant method for carbon removal shifts from DAC to bio-energetic processes with capture. At the same time, the reliance on methanation decreases.

In the Baseline scenario, where there is no carbon and hydrogen transport, hydrogen must be produced where it is consumed. For CU, either hydrogen must be produced where carbon is cheap at point sources or DAC must be used at sites with low-cost hydrogen. Where fossil carbon from point sources cannot be sequestered, it has to be compensated elsewhere by negative emissions from DAC or biomass capture with sequestration. To provide hydrogen in some regions with poor renewable resources, the model resorts to SMR, which uses either green or fossil methane transported within the gas grid. All of these options are suboptimal from a cost perspective.

Both a carbon network and a hydrogen network can help alleviate these inefficiencies. On the one hand, a carbon network allows carbon from point sources to be transported to low-cost hydrogen and sequestration sites. On the other hand, a hydrogen network allows low-cost hydrogen to be transported from regions with good renewable resources to point sources for CU. This results in fundamentally different network flows in each scenario (Fig. 4).

For each region, upper semicircles show the average production per technology, lower semicircles the consumption and colours the average marginal prices. Lines and arrows show the interregional transportation. Carbon sequestration offshore is drawn in full circles. Basemaps from Natural Earth.

In the CO2–grid scenario, there are three main transport purposes of the low-cost carbon captured in Central and Eastern Europe (Fig. 4a). A large part of the carbon is transported to the Iberian Peninsula (average 9.8 kt h) and the British Isles (average 11.8 kt h−1), where it is used along with low-cost electrolytic hydrogen to produce Fischer–Tropsch fuels and methanol. In Italy and Greece, a portion of the carbon (average 3.3 kt h−1) is directed to methanation plants, where the synthetic methane is fed into the gas grid at key terminals that receive fossil gas imports as well. Finally, a third part of captured carbon is transported directly to sites in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea, where it is sequestered. Almost none of the captured carbon is used locally at the point source. In addition to electrolysis in regions with good renewable resources to supply CU (~125 GW electric (GWel)), the model places smaller amounts of electrolysers where hydrogen is needed for industrial processes across Central Europe (~8 GWel) (Fig. 4c). Hydrogen prices vary widely across the continent, with low price valleys at around 60 € MWh−1, where the CU is located, and high price peaks in Central Europe at around 95 € MWh−1. Despite the transport system, the marginal cost of carbon capture still varies from 105 € t−1 in Central Europe to 160 € t−1 at sequestration sites.

In the H2–grid scenario, the main hydrogen transportation route goes from Spain (66 GW) to Central Europe to supply local carbonaceous fuel production with captured carbon from point sources since CO2 can no longer be transported (Fig. 4d). Also, the hydrogen network supplies spatially fixed hydrogen demand for industry in Central Europe (2.5 GW in total) at much lower costs than local electrolysis or SMR. Carbon sequestration takes place at several coastal sites with local DAC facilities. The largest carbon sink is located in Portugal (3.5 kt h−1; Fig. 4b). Marginal costs of carbon capture are low in Central Europe (110–120 € t−1) and highest in sequestration regions (160 € t−1). Hydrogen prices have flattened out at a relatively low level of 60 € MWh−1 in all regions.

In both scenarios, CU is placed where material inputs, CO2 and H2, are provided at minimal cost, that is, in price valleys of hydrogen and carbon in the CO2–grid and H2–grid scenario respectively. In the CO2–grid scenario, CU co-locates with low-cost hydrogen production and uses transported carbon from the inland. In the H2–grid scenario, CU co-locates with carbon point sources and uses transported low-cost hydrogen.

We conclude that there are individual cost–benefits of the transport networks. On the one hand, the carbon network enables the transport of low-cost captured carbon to sequestration sites, reducing the dependence on high-cost DAC near the coast, which is present in the H2–grid scenario. On the other hand, the H2-–grid can supply the spatially fixed hydrogen demands in Central Europe with low-cost hydrogen imports. At the same time, the model in the CO2–grid scenario is forced to deploy electrolysis in regions with poor renewable resources. The latter aspect finally leads to lower system costs in the H2–grid scenario than in the CO2–grid scenario.

The Hybrid scenario combines the advantages of hydrogen and carbon networks, resulting in the highest system cost reduction of 5.3% (41 billion € per year) compared to the Baseline scenario. Again, the model transports low-cost hydrogen to the point sources in Central Europe to supply CU but also transports low-cost carbon from point sources close to the shore to sequestration sites (Fig. 5). This provides low-cost hydrogen across the regions and reduces reliance on more expensive DAC.

Carbon sequestration offshore is drawn in full circles. Lines and arrows show interregional transportation volume. Carbon from point source in the inland either supplies local CU with imported hydrogen or facilitates sequestration in nearby offshore regions. Maps for carriers other than CO2 or H2 (electricity, heat and gas) are shown in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. Basemaps from Natural Earth.

For the carbon network, the model employs short and direct pipeline routes to transport carbon from inland point sources to nearby sequestration sites, for example, in Northern Germany, Italy and Greece (Fig. 5a). In addition, pipelines transport relatively small amounts of carbon from spatially fixed point sources to CU facilities. A notable outlier is the route from the Netherlands via the United Kingdom and France to large methanolization and Fischer–Tropsch plants in northern Spain. The hydrogen routes are similar to those in the H2–grid scenario with transports from western regions (the Iberian Peninsula and the British Isles) to distributed CU production sites across the continent (Fig. 5b). Whereas the topology of the hydrogen network (1.2 billion € per year) roughly corresponds to that of the H2–grid scenario and is primarily driven by CU, the carbon network (0.6 billion € per year) plays a secondary role and is driven by CS (Supplementary Fig. 3).

In this set-up, the networks enable all carbon-emitting technologies operating at a high average capacity factor, that is, above 70%, to capture most of their carbon (Fig. 6). More than 90% of emissions are captured for most technologies. The exceptions are SMR and gas-fired CHP plants, which operate only a few weeks annually, making carbon capture units economically unattractive for these applications. Due to the better integration of point sources, only a few DAC facilities are installed, such as those used for methanolization in Spain. This, in turn, leads to reduced power consumption and less wind and solar power deployment than in the other scenarios.

The size of the dots corresponds to the average capacity factor of the respective technology. While peak load technologies such as gas-fired CHP plants, which are only in operation a few weeks a year, are not expanded for carbon capture, point sources with base load characteristics such as biomass CHP and process emissions from industry are fully (partially) developed as soon as the transport of carbon (hydrogen) is permitted.

In a further set of scenarios, we apply a stricter CO2 emissions reduction target and, thereby, force the model to remove 460 MtCO2 from the atmosphere in one year (equivalent to 10% of 1990 CO2 emissions) while allowing a maximum sequestration of 660 MtCO2. There are additional system costs of 78–82 billion € per year in all scenarios, of which the largest proportion is the investment in DAC and associated solar and wind power and heat supply (Fig. 7). In the Hybrid scenario, this share is 78%, whereas new carbon capture at point sources accounts for only 4% of incremental system costs. This shows that point source carbon capture is already almost exhausted in the net-zero case. The additional sequestration is mainly provided by large DAC facilities near the coast. To a much lesser extent, carbon captured from inland bioenergy sources, which would provide CU under a net-zero assumption, is instead transported and sequestered (Supplementary Fig. 4). Some of the CU located in Central Europe in net-zero scenarios is instead diverted to Spain, where it uses carbon from new DAC facilities.

Each cost bar is split into contributions of the same technology groups as used in Fig. 2, except for carbon sequestration costs, which are now displayed separately. For all models, DAC contributes the most to additional CO2 removal, requiring further solar, wind and heat pump capacities for electricity and heat input.

These changes have little effect on the layout of the CO2 and H2 networks (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5). The slight shift in CU deployment results in less hydrogen pipeline construction in some parts of the system. Nevertheless, 80% of the hydrogen topology built under the net-zero emissions assumption is also built under the net-negative target. The CO2 network partially extends routes from Central and Eastern Europe to the coasts. Compared with the other scenarios, the relative benefits of CO2 transport and sequestration with tighter emissions targets are evident. The carbon network in the net-negative CO2–grid scenario is more prominent than in the net-zero CO2–grid scenario and transports more carbon from point sources to sequestration sites than to CU facilities. In the H2–grid scenario, where all carbon for CU and CS must come from DAC, the hydrogen transport topology remains almost identical to the net-zero scenarios (detailed cost contributions in Supplementary Figs. 3–10).

Overall, this leads to the net cost increases of 78 billion € per year in the CO2–grid scenario, by 80 billion € per year in the H2–grid scenario and by 78 billion € per year in the Hybrid scenario. The resulting cost–benefit of the Hybrid scenario in comparison to the other scenarios is 6 billion € per year.

Our study assesses the roles of hydrogen (H2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) networks in Europe's future energy system under net carbon neutrality and net-removal targets. We show that both networks strongly impact the optimal deployment of carbon capture, carbon utilization and sequestration. A CO2 network reduces costs by transporting low-cost carbon from distributed point sources to sequestration sites and sites with low-cost hydrogen production to produce carbonaceous fuels. A hydrogen network provides greater cost savings as low-cost hydrogen can be transported to regions with high demand, allowing carbon utilization at point sources. A combination of both networks emphasizes the strengths of each infrastructure. In the hybrid configuration, the H2 network supplies low-cost hydrogen to spatially fixed hydrogen demand and carbon utilization at point sources across regions. At the same time, the CO2 network transports low-cost carbon captured from point sources near the coast to sequestration sites, reducing the reliance on direct air capture. This results not only in the lowest system cost but also in a system robust to tightening the target to net-negative emissions.

Limitations of the study, such as the neglect of synthetic fuel imports and assumptions on biomass potentials, are discussed in Supplementary Note 1. Supplementary Notes 2–5 provide an analysis of some model sensitivities. In the hybrid scenario, increasing the CO2 sequestration limit from 200 to 800 MtCO2 per year reduces system costs by 9.1% (Supplementary Fig. 11). This reduction is achieved by replacing the production of synthetic e-fuels with fossil fuels that are either captured and sequestered or left unabated and compensated by carbon dioxide removal. Investments in renewable power assets and hydrogen infrastructure, which serve the synthetic fuel production for the aviation, shipping and industry sectors, drop by roughly a third. A similar effect on synthetic fuel production in Europe would be expected if synthetic fuels were instead imported from outside Europe. Smaller effects can be seen from reducing or increasing capital costs for CO2 and H2 pipelines and costs of electrolysers (Supplementary Figs. 12–16).

For policymakers, these results show the need for coordinated planning across sectors such as carbon, hydrogen and synthetic fuels because they are strongly interacting and across borders because of the localized nature of good renewable resources and sequestration potentials. Deploying multiple networks offers some robustness should unforeseen problems arise with one of them, and our results show that the system can even cope with neither a CO2 nor H2 network for a cost penalty. Many technologies have not yet been deployed at scale before and will need support for financing, regulation and gaining the acceptance of local populations.

In summary, our study highlights the benefits of strategic planning and integration of both CO2 and H2 networks in the European energy landscape. The flexibility and cost efficiency offered by these networks can make a substantial contribution to achieving the EU's climate targets, particularly by reducing dependence on technologies that are still in the early market phase, such as direct air capture. Leveraging the synergies between H2 and CO2 transportation and management, Europe can effectively reduce system costs while ensuring a robust and sustainable energy system.

The study is conducted based on the open-source capacity expansion model PyPSA-Eur (derivative of v0.9.0)34,35,36. The model uses the open-source software tools PyPSA37 and Linopy38 for modelling and cost optimization. The model optimizes the design and operation of the European energy system, encompassing the power, heat, industry, agriculture and transport sectors, including international aviation and shipping. All technology cost assumptions are taken for the year 2040 and sourced from the ‘technology-data' repository (v0.6.0)39. The database applies a discount rate of 7% for most technologies, accounting for the weighted average costs of capital of investments. Many assumptions are based on the technology catalogues published by the Danish Energy Agency40. Endogenous model results include the expansion of renewable energy sources; storage technologies; power-to-X conversion and transmission capacities; heating technologies; peaking power plants and the deployment of grey, blue or green hydrogen production facilitates, among others. The model considers various energy carriers such as electricity, heat, hydrogen, methane, methanol, liquid hydrocarbons and biomass, together with the corresponding conversion technologies.

In our configuration, the model's time horizon spans one year, with a 3-hourly temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 90 regions across Europe. Each region has a complex subsystem with technologies for supplying, converting, storing and transporting energy. Exogenous assumptions on energy demand and non-abatable emissions are taken from various sources41,42,43,44,45,46 (Fig. 1). The energy demand for electricity, transport, biomass, heat and gas is defined per region and time step. Land transport demand, including heavy-duty vehicles, is exogenously assumed to be fully electrified. Demands for kerosene for aviation, methanol for shipping and naphtha for industry are not spatially resolved and assumed to be constant throughout all time steps. Heat demand is regionally subdivided into urban, rural and industrial site shares. The system exogenously produces 633 MtCO2 per year from industry, aviation, shipping and agriculture, 153 MtCO2 per year of which are fossil-based process emissions. Locations for industrial clusters are taken from Manz and Fleiter41. Energy demand for industries is calculated from the JRC-IDEES 2015 energy balances43.

Low-carbon electricity is provided by wind, solar, biomass, hydro-electricity and nuclear power plants. Hydroelectric and nuclear plants cannot be extended beyond their currently installed capacities. Weather-dependent power potentials for solar, wind and hydro-electricity are calculated from the reanalysis and satellite data sets, ERA547 and SARAH-248 per region and time stamp, using the open-source tool Atlite49. Solar and wind power can be expanded in alignment with land-use restrictions calculated, taking into account land usage classes and natural protection areas50,51. We restrict the total volume of power transmission expansion to 20% of its current capacity, acknowledging the challenges in inaugurating new transmission projects. For the use of biomass, we consider only residual biomass products and no energy crops. We limit regional biomass use to the medium-level potentials from the JRC-ENSPRESO database52,53. Interregional biomass transport is permitted, with transport costs of ~0.1 € MWh−1 km−1 considered.

In our model, we consider green, blue and grey hydrogen from electrolysis and steam methane reforming (SMR), the latter of which may be equipped with CC technology. The geographical distribution of underground hydrogen storage potentials in salt caverns is derived from Caglayan et al.54. Re-electrification of hydrogen is possible via fuel cells.

The topology and capacities of the electricity transmission system are taken from the ENTSO-E transparency map55 and selected Ten Year Network Development Plan projects. The topology of the gas network is based on the SciGrid gas model56. The hydrogen network topology is based on the combined routes of existing gas and electricity infrastructure. Potential CO2 pipeline routes are based on the existing electricity network topology.

The power flow in the electricity system is based on the linearized power flow approximation. For HVDC lines, we apply static losses of 2% at the substations and length-dependent losses of 3% per 1,000 km. The losses of high voltage alternating current (HVAC) lines are estimated by a piecewise linear approximation for resistive losses. For hydrogen pipelines, an average loss of 1.2% per 1,000 km is assumed, aligning with industry estimates that account for hydrogen's high permeability and small molecular size, which can lead to higher losses compared to other gases. The electrical demand for compression stations is assumed to be 1.8% per 1,000 km of the transported energy. For CO2 pipelines, an average loss rate of 0.8% per 1,000 km reflects a generally low leakage rate observed in supercritical or dense phase CO2 transport57,58. The compression energy needed is set to 250 kWh per 1,000 km and tonne CO2 to maintain a supercritical state for efficient transport. For natural gas pipelines, the model assumes a 1% loss rate per 1,000 km, accounting for typical leakage and operational losses in well-maintained natural gas infrastructure as reported in ref. 59. The electrical demand for compression is set at 1% per 1,000 km of the transported energy, which falls within the typical range for natural gas pipeline operations60.

Liquid fuels such as oil, methanol and Fischer–Tropsch (FT) fuels are not spatially resolved because transport costs per unit of energy are negligible due to their high energy density. Throughout this study, we focus on CO2 and H2 networks because of their high relevance to infrastructure investments and, thus, public policy decisions. The electricity and gas networks are both included in the model with full geographical detail but are not further analysed. Electricity networks are already in place, and we restrict further extension to 25% due to public acceptance concerns. Gas networks also already exist and will most likely experience decreased use in the future, removing any bottlenecks or constraints on the optimal system buildout or operation. If enabled, hydrogen can be transported via pipelines between regions, which can be expanded without limits, considering costs for pipeline segments and compressors. Pipeline flows are modelled using net transfer capacities and without flow dynamics, pressure valves or energy demand for compression. Whereas decisions to repurpose existing gas pipelines for H2 or CO2 transport are not explicitly modelled, the impact of potential pipeline cost reductions that could be achieved, for instance, by retrofitting is illustrated in Supplementary Note 3.

We argue that it is crucial to model CC, CU and CS as separate technologies rather than grouping them under the common but imprecise umbrella term carbon capture, utilization and storage to allow for independent optimization and adequate representation of each function in the carbon management system. Our model features three drop-in fuel production technologies for CU: methanation, methanolization and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. The processed fuels are not limited in their total quantity of use or production. Methane is transported through the gas network, whereas methanol and FT fuel can be transported between regions without additional costs or capacity constraints. Synthetic methane substitutes natural gas or upgraded biogas, serving combined heat and power plants, residential heating gas boilers or industrial process heat. Synthetic methanol decarbonizes marine industry fuel demands, and FT fuels replace fossil oil for naphtha production for high-value chemicals, aviation kerosene or agricultural machinery oil.

To supply carbon needed for CS and CU, the system can choose to deploy carbon capture (CC) technologies at various point sources of fossil or biogenic origin (below) or through DAC facilities. The concept of a merit order for capturing carbon plays a pivotal role in optimizing the deployment of CC technologies based on their economic feasibility. This merit order ranks all CC technologies according to relative costs to capture an additional marginal ton. The cost value for a technology depends on the exact system configuration and operation. It may vary by scenario and even by region because many technologies produce other (primary) outputs, such as electricity and heat. The costs to capture an additional marginal ton of carbon may also differ from the average capture cost. At the lower end of the cost spectrum, CC technologies applied to process emissions, such as those from cement, offer a cost-effective starting point. Following this, biomass combined heat and power (CHP) systems provide the dual benefit of energy production and carbon capture. Moving up the scale, gas used in industrial applications and biomass employed in industrial processes represent more costly yet viable options to capture carbon. DAC, an emerging technology capable of extracting CO2 directly from the atmosphere, stands at a high-cost level due to its current high capital costs and energy demand. Finally, based on our model results, biogas upgrading, a process that refines biogas to natural gas quality, incurs the highest costs in the merit order per marginal ton of captured CO2. Biogas input is a high-cost fuel that based on endogenous modelling decisions, is not used in large quantities. To the extent that biogas-to-gas facilities are used by the model to supply additional (carbon-neutral) gas as fuel, adding CC infrastructure incurs low costs (and thus ranges on the left-hand side of the merit order curve). However, the price of capturing additional CO2 from biogas-to-gas upgrading is high because a substantial amount of the biogas fuel costs factors into the marginal cost of captured CO2. This merit order framework is crucial for strategically deploying necessary carbon capture solutions while balancing economic considerations. If we consider the spatial aspect of distributed carbon capture potentials, the CO2 network can exploit comparative cost advantages between CO2 bidding zones to utilize the lowest-cost CC facilities across the continent. We assume a capture rate of 90% for CC on process emissions, SMR, biogas to gas and gas and biomass used in industry and 95% for CC on biomass and gas CHPs. Supplementary Table 1 summarizes the technology readiness levels, capture rates and deployment status of carbon capture technologies used in the model. Supplementary Note 6 provides an extended description of the integration of carbon capture technologies in the model.

To store CO2, we differentiate between short-term storage in steel tanks for intermediate containment and long-term, permanent sequestration in underground formations such as porous rock or depleted gas reservoirs. For short-term storage in CO2 tanks, annualized costs are 242 € t−1 CO2 per year (investment 2,584 € t−1 CO2, 1% fixed operational and maintenance cost, 25-year lifetime). For long-term sequestration, we apply uniform costs of 10 € t−1 CO2 per year across all sites, aligning with literature estimates for offshore sequestration ranging from US$4 to 23 t−1 CO2 (ref. 61). For carbon sequestration, we consider only offshore sites as potential sinks (Supplementary Fig. 17). We make this choice because offshore sequestration sites typically have a larger capacity compared to onshore sequestration sites in saline aquifers and due to concerns over public safety for infrastructure near populated areas. Our estimates for carbon sequestration potentials are restrictive, limiting the annual sequestration potential to 25 MtCO2 per region and constraining it further to provide enough volume to allow for 25 years of sequestration.

Furthermore, we decided to limit the total amount of sequestered CO2 to 200 MtCO2 per year for our net-zero CO2 emissions target and 660 MtCO2 per year for our net-negative emissions target. This constraint is deliberately implemented to avoid over-reliance on carbon capture and sequestration as a back-stop technology, which could otherwise offset fossil emissions instead of prioritizing the reduction of fossil fuel use where technologically feasible. By capping the sequestration at 200 MtCO2 per year, we aim to represent a balanced energy transition, where sequestration is used to offset hard-to-abate fossil process emissions (for example, calcination of limestone in cement manufacturing) but does not become a substitute for more sustainable mitigation measures. The implications of this choice are discussed in Supplementary Note 2.

Metrics details

Eukaryotic RNA transcripts undergo extensive processing before becoming functional messenger RNAs, with splicing being a critical and highly regulated step that occurs both co-transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Recent analyses have revealed, with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, that up to 40% of mammalian introns are retained after transcription termination and are subsequently removed largely while transcripts remain chromatin-associated. Post-transcriptional splicing has emerged as a key layer of gene expression regulation during development, stress response and disease progression. The control of post-transcriptional splicing regulates protein production through delayed splicing and nuclear export, or nuclear retention and degradation of specific transcript isoforms. Here, we review current methodologies for detecting post-transcriptional splicing, discuss the mechanisms controlling the timing of splicing and examine how this temporal regulation affects gene expression programmes in healthy cells and in disease states.

A regulated process by which different combinations of exons and/or introns from a single gene can be included or excluded in the final mRNA, allowing multiple protein isoforms to be produced from a single gene.

(UTRs). Different versions of untranslated regions that can be included in the final mRNA through alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation or alternative transcription start sites.

An intronic adenosine, typically located 18–40 nt upstream of the 3′ splice site, whose 2′-OH group attacks the 5′ splice site in the first step of splicing, creating a characteristic branched intermediate (lariat).

(CPA). The process of cutting the primary transcript at a specific site and adding a poly(A) tail to create the 3′-end of mature mRNA.

(PAS). Specific sequences in the pre-mRNA that signal where the transcript should be cleaved and polyadenylated.

A class of introns that are retained in nucleus-localized transcripts until specific signals trigger their removal and export of the transcript from the nucleus, serving as a regulatory mechanism for gene expression.

N6-methyladenosine, an RNA chemical modification consisting of a methyl group added to the nitrogen at position 6 of adenosine.

A technique in which cells are grown with nucleotide analogues that are incorporated into newly synthesized RNA, which can be specifically isolated or detected using biochemical methods, allowing to track new RNA synthesis and processing.

Small non-coding RNAs (21–23 nt) that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally, generally through binding sites in 3′ untranslated regions.

A class of RNA molecules that unlike non-coding RNAs carry coding information and are translated into proteins by ribosomes.

(NMD). A quality control mechanism that degrades mRNAs containing premature stop codons in the cytoplasm.

The breakdown of RNA molecules within the nucleus, serving as a quality control mechanism and regulatory process. This occurs through multiple pathways including the nuclear exosome.

Membrane-less nuclear compartments enriched in pre-mRNA splicing factors, RNA-processing factors and partially processed mRNAs.

Genes encoding transcripts that are predicted to undergo nuclear degradation rather than be processed into mRNA based on subcellular fractionation, metabolic labelling, mathematical modelling and/or knockdown of nuclear exosome subunits.

(Pol II). The enzyme responsible for transcribing all eukaryotic protein-coding genes and many non-coding RNA genes. Its largest subunit contains a C-terminal domain that undergoes dynamic phosphorylation during transcription, coordinating various RNA processing events.

(RBPs). Proteins that bind to RNA, typically by recognizing specific sequences or structures, and regulate processes including splicing, polyadenylation, export, localization, stability and translation.

A family of proteins that have crucial roles in constitutive and alternative splicing. They are characterized by one or more RNA recognition motif(s) and a domain rich in serine–arginine dipeptides (RS domain). Dynamic phosphorylation of the RS domain regulates their activity, localization and function.

Specific sequences at the start (5′-end) and end (3′-end) of introns that are recognized by the spliceosome.

Separation of subcellular compartments through differential centrifugation and/or biochemical extraction, yielding cytoplasmic, nucleoplasmic and chromatin-associated fractions.

Conservation of critically endangered Bornean orangutans could be aided by the sequencing of the creature's genome.Credit: Fiona Rogers/Nature Picture Library

After more than two decades of work, researchers have sequenced the complete genomes of six ape species. An understanding of the apes' genomes gives geneticists insights into the genetic factors that differentiate humans from our animal cousins. The results will also be key to analysing the genetic diversity of at-risk ape populations — all six species sequenced are listed as either endangered or critically endangered. “I've never thought that this would be accomplished in my lifetime,” says evolutionary geneticist and study co-author Kateryna Makova.

Human brain cells engineered to evade detection by the immune system have successfully restored muscle control in a rat model of Parkinson's disease. Researchers altered eight genes in a line of human stem cells to increase their activity so they acted as an immune ‘invisibility cloak'. The cells then differentiated into nerve cells suitable for treating Parkinson's disease. The study is a step towards the development of a ‘universal' cell line that can be transplanted into anyone, to cure a raft of conditions — from type 2 diabetes to blindness — without the need for anti-rejection drugs.

54% of 4,260 global researchers who responded to a survey believe that artificial intelligence (AI) will bring more benefits to society than risks. That makes them seemingly a lot more optimistic than the general public: for example, in a similar survey just 13% of the UK public shared the same rosy view. The two groups' views were more aligned on the technology's role in disinformation, data use and cybercrime: 77% of researchers and 68% of the UK public said that AI makes misinformation a problem. The survey's most striking finding is that fewer than one-third of AI scientists think that the technologies should be developed as quickly as possible, says Robert Trager, director of the Oxford Martin AI Governance Initiative. “They seem to want a more considered approach to development to mitigate risks.”

The past decade has seen the development of a class of drugs that effectively induces sleep with fewer side effects and a lower risk of dependence compared with other sleep aids. Dual orexin receptor antagonist (DORA) drugs approved in the United States include suvorexant (sold as Belsomra), lemborexant (Dayvigo) and daridorexant (Quviviq). “The beauty of it is it does nothing but block the stimulation of wakefulness,” says neurologist Joe Herring.

But DORA therapies are available only in a few countries, and their high cost keeps them out of reach of many people who could benefit from them. “I'm aware that each pill I pop before bed is about the same price as ordering a fancy cocktail,” writes journalist Rachel Nuwer, who is trying the treatment after learning about it while reporting the story.

“Our beloved pet dogs have a far greater, more insidious and more concerning effect on wildlife and the environment than we would like to be the case,” write behavioural ecologists Bill Bateman and Lauren Gilson. Pets attack wildlife, disturb habitats with their scent and droppings, shed toxic flea treatments, consume vast amounts of meat and produce equivalent volumes of waste. But dog owners can do a lot to ameliorate these downsides, Bateman says. Follow leash laws, don't let your pooch chase animals, always pick up its poo and consider buying sustainable dog food, he suggests.

Researchers have created the largest and most detailed wiring diagram of a mammalian brain to date, by mapping cells in a cubic millimetre of a mouse's brain tissue. The high-resolution 3D map contains more than 200,000 brain cells, around 82,000 of which are neurons. It also includes more than 500 million of the neuronal connection points called synapses and more than 4 kilometres of neuronal wiring, all found in a tiny block of tissue in a brain region involved in vision.

Today I'm considering how to protect my favourite desk here at Nature HQ. One option is to perhaps buzz like the warty birch caterpillar. At less than two millimetres long, the larvae of the two-lined hooktip moth (Falcaria bilineata) are small, but mighty, and will vibrate their bodies on the tips of leaves to ward off competitors. It seems to work for these critters, at least about 70% of the time, so I might give it a try.

If you logged on to X or Bluesky this past week, you were likely swept up in the onslaught of posts about Trump's reciprocal tariffs and the plunging stock market. And, if you follow the tech industry as closely as I do, you probably also noticed who wasn't posting about the tariffs: many of the same tech founders and CEOs who flanked Trump on Inauguration Day in January. Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Sundar Pichai, and Mark Zuckerberg have kept mum on the topic of tariffs (although both Pichai and Zuckerberg have continued posting about AI). Meanwhile, Elon Musk—well, we'll get to that.

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter.

SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

The silence was deafening, considering that the “magnificent seven” collectively lost trillions of dollars in market value following Trump's tariff announcement last week. But there's a cold logic behind these tech leaders holding their tongues in public—particularly for those who sell hardware. The US has become a highly volatile nation where the whims of the president must be taken into consideration before using any political chip or making a public statement, especially in an environment where that statement could be irrelevant an hour later.

“The sand doesn't stop shifting long enough to make a cogent statement,” one top communications executive, who has worked closely with two Big Tech CEOs, tells me.

Tech CEOs aren't actually staying silent. They're simply lobbying behind the scenes on their own behalf. Niki Christoff, a Washington, DC, political strategist and former aide to Senator John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign, says most of the strategizing around trade rules—and conversations with Trump's staff—are happening through back channels right now. “There's a lot of personal dialing and trying to get deals done,” she claims.

During Trump's first term, Cook carefully cultivated a direct relationship with the president in order to lobby him on issues like trade and immigration. I have a hard time imagining Cook isn't using that direct line now. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang, who did not attend the inauguration ceremony, reportedly went to a $1-million-a-head dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week. Shortly afterward, the White House walked back plans to implement export controls on some chips that Nvidia sells to China.

Private back channels allow each tech leader to lobby for specific tariff exemptions. The kind of exemptions that would benefit Nvidia, such as more lenient policies on semiconductor imports for GPUs, differ from what Apple might be angling for, considering the company's supply chain complexity and its reliance on China. “Broadly opposing tariffs is not useful if business leaders can get exemptions on their own products,” Christoff points out.

At the same time tech CEOs are letting trade organizations, like Business Roundtable, which represents a number of big tech firms including Alphabet and Amazon, do some of their lobbying for them, sources tell WIRED. Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten put out a statement urging the administration to “swiftly reach agreements” with its trading partners and to implement “reasonable exemptions.” The CEOs have also been able to hang back while bankers like JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon make public assertions about the lasting negative impact of tariffs on the economy, and while billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman keeps tweeting through it. (And really, what tech CEO wants to be part of a roundup story that also includes the market-cratering tweets of an anonymous X user named “Walter Bloomberg”?)

There have been a few outliers. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he believes Amazon's vast network of third-party sellers might end up passing the cost of tariffs on to consumers. Last week Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sat alongside Bill Gates and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for an interview with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin, who asked about tariffs. Ballmer told Sorkin he “took just enough economics in college to [know that] tariffs are actually going to bring some turmoil” and that the “disruption is very hard on people.”

Nadella was more circumspect and took Sorkin's probing as an opportunity to tout artificial intelligence. “In the short term, I look at it and say, whatever happens, whatever readjustment happens, we are for the first time really supplying what is the essential, nondurable commodity called intelligence,” Nadella said. He went on to say that his second consideration right now is how much compute power the world will need in 25 to 50 years. “I want to keep those two thoughts and then take one step at a time, and then whatever are the geopolitical or economic shifts, we will adjust to it.”

If that doesn't work out, Nadella has a promising second career in dodgeball.

Among Trump's inauguration crowd, Musk is now the exception. He, too, has made direct appeals to Trump to drop the tariffs but has also loudly called Trump's top trade adviser Peter Navarro a “moron” and “dumber than a sack of bricks.” Musk later apologized, adding that the comparison “was so unfair to bricks.” This was after Navarro called Musk a “car assembler”—not a car manufacturer—whose business relies heavily on cheap parts sourced outside of the US. Musk has maintained that Tesla sells the “most American-made cars.”

At least Trump's buddy-in-chief is willing to stick his neck out, even if the other CEOs aren't. Except, Musk's remarks on tariffs are so obviously self-serving. I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that he doesn't care about the health of the average citizen's retirement account, considering how ruthlessly he's championing the firing of federal employees and the dismantling of government agencies. If Musk's not tiptoeing around the president's volatility, perhaps it's because he's a purveyor of his own unique brand of chaos.

Not that long ago, Big Tech leaders might have taken to the public square to issue statements about major social and political issues that affected their employees and the public at large. But these remarks were mostly performative, and we should never have pretended, or allowed ourselves to be convinced, otherwise. Behind the curtain, they were always working the gears of a brutally capitalistic machine. Now, for them, public silence is golden, and private lobbying is worth the world's stores in gold, especially when faced with an injuriously erratic president.

Several AI chatbots designed for fantasy and sexual role-playing conversations are leaking user prompts to the web in almost real time, new research seen by WIRED shows. Some of the leaked data shows people creating conversations detailing child sexual abuse, according to the research.

Conversations with generative AI chatbots are near instantaneous—you type a prompt and the AI responds. If the systems are configured improperly, however, this can lead to chats being exposed. In March, researchers at the security firm UpGuard discovered around 400 exposed AI systems while scanning the web looking for misconfigurations. Of these, 117 IP addresses are leaking prompts. The vast majority of these appeared to be test setups, while others contained generic prompts relating to educational quizzes or nonsensitive information, says Greg Pollock, director of research and insights at UpGuard. “There were a handful that stood out as very different from the others,” Pollock says.

Three of these were running-role playing scenarios where people can talk to a variety of predefined AI “characters”—for instance, one personality called Neva is described as a 21-year-old woman who lives in a college dorm room with three other women and is “shy and often looks sad.” Two of the role-playing setups were overtly sexual. “It's basically all being used for some sort of sexually explicit role play,” Pollock says of the exposed prompts. “Some of the scenarios involve sex with children.”

Over a period of 24 hours, UpGuard collected prompts exposed by the AI systems to analyze the data and try to pin down the source of the leak. Pollock says the company collected new data every minute, amassing around 1,000 leaked prompts, including those in English, Russia, French, German, and Spanish.

It was not possible to identify which websites or services are leaking the data, Pollock says, adding it is likely from small instances of AI models being used, possibly by individuals rather than companies. No usernames or personal information of people sending prompts were included in the data, Pollock says.

Across the 952 messages gathered by UpGuard—likely just a glimpse of how the models are being used—there were 108 narratives or role-play scenarios, UpGuard's research says. Five of these scenarios involved children, Pollock adds, including those as young as 7.

“LLMs are being used to mass-produce and then lower the barrier to entry to interacting with fantasies of child sexual abuse,” Pollock says. “There's clearly absolutely no regulation happening for this, and it seems to be a huge mismatch between the realities of how this technology is being used very actively and what the regulation would be targeted at.”

WIRED last week reported that a South Korea–based image generator was being used to create AI-generated child abuse and exposed thousands of images in an open database. The company behind the website shut the generator down after being approached by WIRED. Child-protection groups around the world say AI-generated child sexual abuse material, which is illegal in many countries, is growing quickly and making it harder to do their jobs. The UK's anti-child-abuse charity has also called for new laws against generative AI chatbots that “simulate the offence of sexual communication with a child.”

All of the 400 exposed AI systems found by UpGuard have one thing in common: They use the open source AI framework called llama.cpp. This software allows people to relatively easily deploy open source AI models on their own systems or servers. However, if it is not set up properly, it can inadvertently expose prompts that are being sent. As companies and organizations of all sizes deploy AI, properly configuring the systems and infrastructure being used is crucial to prevent leaks.

Rapid improvements to generative AI over the past three years have led to an explosion in AI companions and systems that appear more “human.” For instance, Meta has experimented with AI characters that people can chat with on WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger. Generally, companion websites and apps allow people to have free-flowing conversations with AI characters—portraying characters with customizable personalities or as public figures such as celebrities.

People have found friendship and support from their conversations with AI—and not all of them encourage romantic or sexual scenarios. Perhaps unsurprisingly, though, people have fallen in love with their AI characters, and dozens of AI girlfriend and boyfriend services have popped up in recent years.

Claire Boine, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Washington University School of Law and affiliate of the Cordell Institute, says millions of people, including adults and adolescents, are using general AI companion apps. “We do know that many people develop some emotional bond with the chatbots,” says Boine, who has published research on the subject. “People being emotionally bonded with their AI companions, for instance, make them more likely to disclose personal or intimate information.”

However, Boine says, there is often a power imbalance in becoming emotionally attached to an AI created by a corporate entity. “Sometimes people engage with those chats in the first place to develop that type of relationship,” Boine says. “But then I feel like once they've developed it, they can't really opt out that easily.”

As the AI companion industry has grown, some of these services lack content moderation and other controls. Character AI, which is backed by Google, is being sued after a teenager from Florida died by suicide after allegedly becoming obsessed with one of its chatbots. (Character AI has increased its safety tools over time.) Separately, users of the generative AI tool Replika were upended when the company made changes to its personalities.

Aside from individual companions, there are also role-playing and fantasy companion services—each with thousands of personas people can speak with—that place the user as a character in a scenario. Some of these can be highly sexualized and provide NSFW chats. They can use anime characters, some of which appear young, with some sites claiming they allow “uncensored” conversations.

“We stress test these things and continue to be very surprised by what these platforms are allowed to say and do with seemingly no regulation or limitation,” says Adam Dodge, the founder of Endtab (Ending Technology-Enabled Abuse). “This is not even remotely on people's radar yet.” Dodge says these technologies are opening up a new era of online pornography, which can in turn introduce new societal problems as the technology continues to mature and improve. “Passive users are now active participants with unprecedented control over the digital bodies and likenesses of women and girls,” he says of some sites.

While UpGuard's Pollock could not directly connect the leaked data from the role-playing chats to a single website, he did see signs that indicated character names or scenarios could have been uploaded to multiple companion websites that allow user input. Data seen by WIRED shows that the scenarios and characters in the leaked prompts are hundreds of words long, detailed, and complex.

“This is a never-ending, text-based role-play conversation between Josh and the described characters,” one of the system prompts says. It adds that all the characters are over 18 and that, in addition to “Josh,” there are two sisters who live next door to the character. The characters' personalities, bodies, and sexual preferences are described in the prompt. The characters should “react naturally based on their personality, relationships, and the scene” while providing “engaging responses” and “maintain a slow-burn approach during intimate moments,” the prompt says.

“When you go to those sites, there are hundreds of thousands of these characters, most of which involve pretty intense sexual situations,” Pollock says, adding the text based communication mimics online and messaging group chats. “You can write whatever sexual scenarios you want, but this is truly a new thing where you have the appearance of interacting with them in almost exactly the same way you interact with a lot of people.” In other words, they're designed to be engaging and to encourage more conversation.

That can lead to situations where people may overshare and create risks. “If people are disclosing things they've never told anyone to these platforms and it leaks, that is the Everest of privacy violations,” Dodge says. “That's an order of magnitude we've never seen before and would make really good leverage to sextort someone.”

When sex toy brand Dame first launched in 2014, its focus was on making no-frills sex toys for people with vulvas. In its quest to close the “pleasure gap,” the company's first product was the Eva—a hands-free clitoral vibrator that could be comfortably worn during penetration thanks to a clever design.

A 2015 study of over 1,000 women published in the Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy found that only 18 percent can orgasm through intercourse alone, and 37 percent said clitoral stimulation was necessary for orgasm during intercourse. It might not be a surprise, then, that the Eva became a hit, even before it shipped. Its Indiegogo campaign raised more than $850,000, one of the most successful crowdfunded sex toys in history.

Dame is now trying something different: a sex toy for people with a penis. However, the aptly named Hug wraps around the base of the penis with its adjustable arms, and the other end provides vibrating goodness for the clitoris. It's a sex toy for couples—the best of both worlds.

I don't have a penis, but I have sex with those who do. Combined with my 10-plus years covering sexual wellness and sex toys, I can confidently say that I know my way around cock rings and have tried more than my fair share. The Hug doesn't look like any cock ring I've seen before.

Knowing nothing about Dame, my partner said, ""It looks like it was designed by a woman.” This was by no means an insult, but a compliment. Just looking at the Hug, you can see the consideration that went into the product's design for both the person who will be wearing the Hug and the person who will be enjoying the penis it's on.

As much as I don't want to do a compare-and-contrast session about cock rings, the Hug has a major standout feature that must be addressed. In a world of silicone cock rings that require either a lot of lube or a flaccid shaft to get it on the penis, the Hug has pinchable arms, so you can easily put it on and take it off at any time, no matter the erection status. Having been with partners who struggled to get cock rings on and/or off, it's a much smarter design.

If that wasn't impressive enough, the body of the Hug is shaped to target the clitoris. Clitoral stimulation always feels like an afterthought with most of the cock rings on the market designed to pleasure both partners. Not the case with the Hug.

Not only are all five vibration levels tucked into a dome that aligns perfectly with the clitoris, but the Hug is surprisingly flexible, moving with the body effortlessly. You can easily go from missionary to a sitting up position without having to adjust anything. This was something both my partner and I loved. While finagling and readjusting sex toys is sometimes necessary, the Hug was very much in sync with both of our bodies.

I consider the Hug a near-perfect sex toy. My partner and I used it multiple times, with my forever-beloved water-based lubricant Bijoux Indiscrets' Sex au Natural, and each time it floored us both. The Hug felt like a cohesive part of our sexual pleasure and not a third wheel.

The Hug takes about two hours to charge and lasts only an hour, but that's not really a bad thing for a cock ring. Blood flow to the penis shouldn't be restricted for more than 30 minutes. Though thanks to the Hug's design, you can loosen things up on the penis while keeping the vibrations focused on the clitoris. It's 100 percent waterproof, easy to navigate with its one button, very quiet (not quite whisper-quiet), and USB-C rechargeable. Dame even offers a 3-year warranty.

It's ultimately designed for hetero couples or someone with a penis who's flying solo and experimenting with erections and blood flow. Which is more than OK! Not every sex toy is geared toward all bodies, all genders, and all sexualities. If it remotely sounds appealing, trust me, the Hug is something you'll want in your sex toy arsenal.

I'm not the first to say it, but the creator of The White Lotus, Mike White, is a genius. He created a show about fabulous—and sometimes morally bankrupt—people confined to a luxury resort and forced to confront their demons, and it also stars fabulous people confined in a luxury resort and forced to confront their demons. Not only do the show's characters have access to an open bar in an exotic location, so do the actors. Witness: the post-White Lotus drama swirling around season 3's star-crossed lovers, Rick and Chelsea.

If you have not watched the show, do it now, cry, and come back. Rick and Chelsea were compelling, not because the story was well written (beautiful young women, it is not your job to save troubled older men! Ew!) but because Walton Goggins as Rick and Aimee Lou Wood as Chelsea had such incredible chemistry. In a time when everyone strives to look increasingly flawless and sexless, like a bunch of plastic dolls, you just couldn't stop looking at them absolutely rocking their imperfect teeth and hairlines. They were jolie laide, louche, worldly. You just can't attain that level of charisma by passing your photos through an AI filter.

In a mysterious turn of events, considering their IRL chemistry, they appeared to have mysteriously unfollowed each other on Instagram. I can't stop thinking about them. Since Aimee Lou Wood's Stay Gold necklace is a little out of my budget, I instead got my hands on the Goggins Goggle Glasses. See what I mean? The man simply DGAF.

I became obsessed with Goggins after watching him in last year's TV adaptation of Fallout. Jonathan Nolan's show was so good that it made me try to play Fallout, the video game. (Everyone says I would love Fallout 76, but I'm having trouble getting past how old the graphics look.)

Even when he's wearing a full face of skull makeup, Goggins as the Ghoul is an unimpeachable cowboy. His Architectural Digest feature on his Western-inspired, Hudson Valley home backs this up, and—as someone who is also restoring an older house—I am reasonably sure his entrepreneurial journey may be to fund all the work that needs to be done.

I first got the email about the Walton Goggins Goggle Glasses late last year. “Walton Goggins Goggle Glasses is funny to say, but I'm totally serious about sharing this brand with the world,” he says in the press release. I had thought the Goggle Glasses were a joke, not because of how they sound, but because of Goggins' decidedly tongue-in-cheek Super Bowl ad for GoDaddy. Personally I'm inclined to attribute any success that the Goggle Glasses might have less to the AI web-building tools of GoDaddy Airo and more to the fact that I could spend all day listening to Goggins huskily murmur, “If your goggles ain't Goggins, they don't belong on your noggins”.

The goggles are not a joke. These are actually … great? The sunglasses are ski- and snowboarding-inspired, so they cover your entire eye and stay on your face via a wide, comfortable strap on the back. The lenses are polarized performance lenses made by Revo, the company that started out by manufacturing eyewear protection for NASA in the 1980s.

They're also modular, so if the strap is just too weird-looking, you can clip in nose pads and arms, which is genius. That alone makes the sunglasses so much more comfortable and useful, especially if you like boating, biking, or other high-speed activities. Ski goggles sit a little farther off your face for better ventilation and give you a wider field of view, but I haven't noticed any deficiencies in my peripheral vision; these would be great for spring skiing too.

Moreover, they come in five different colors (La Tortuga and Mama's Skillet are back-ordered, but the blue is quite nice), and they're reasonably priced, at $150 for the whole kit. That's not cheap, but I'm also not going to be devastated if I drop them in the lake while I'm out on the pontoon boat with a beer in my hand. They also look—not bad! Although I have to say that my younger coworkers seem to appreciate them more than my older ones do.

If you haven't already watched the season finale then—spoiler alert—Rick and Chelsea die, because he can't escape his demons. The demon that Chelsea can't escape is Rick. Their deaths were foreshadowed the entire season, from Chelsea saying in episode 1 that she was going to get Rick his joy back, even if it kills her, to Chloe warning Chelsea that the romantic girls are the ones who always end up worse off in the end.

I do have to say that, despite our (my) obsession with this love affair, Rick and Chelsea didn't have to be rich, and their storyline could've taken place on a whole other show. This is absolutely the wrong time for The White Lotus to stop making fun of all the horrific ways that the not-rich have to work around entitled rich people screwing with our lives.

Still, I would put up with much worse to watch Walton Goggins and Aimee Lou Wood in almost anything else, and in the meantime, I can prepare for my own summer vacations with a pair of the Goggins Goggle Glasses. If nothing else, this gives me an excuse to repeatedly show other people Goggins' Instagram, since my husband is absolutely sick of it. All you need for a little mystique of your own is a little spring skiing, with the wind whistling through your wisps of hair and your unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This Famous Physics Experiment Shows Why the Government Should Support ‘Useless' Science","https://www.wired.com/story/why-the-government-should-support-useless-science/","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

It's nothing new—politicians complain about silly science projects funded by the government to get taxpayers riled up. I get it. You might think super expensive particle accelerators or even dirt-cheap experiments on the color of petunias are a waste of money.

OK, you're coming from a business perspective. But even if you care only about money in and money out, if you account for all the downstream effects—which no one can foresee—these projects often do pay off. (Read about the petunias!) Let me tell you about another silly little experiment that turned out to have an extremely high ROI.

In 1862, James Clerk Maxwell published his famous Maxwell's equations. This was at a time when humans were just starting to play around with batteries and electric currents. The first two of these four equations described the electric and magnetic fields around stationary charges.

The next equation comes from a cool phenomenon. If you take a magnet and move it near a coil of wire, you can create an electric current. Here's what that looks like:

This current is caused by an electric field inside the wire, so we could say that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field. But how do you make a magnetic field? Two ways: First, an electric current flowing in a wire makes a magnetic field. You can see this if you connect a wire to a battery and place it over a magnetic compass:

This is the basic idea behind an electromagnet. But Maxwell added a second mechanism—a changing electric field. In other words, he said, it works both ways: A changing magnetic field creates an electric field, and a changing electric field creates a magnetic field.

And here's why this was such a big deal: This suggested that changing electric and magnetic fields would create an oscillation that can travel through space: an electromagnetic wave. Well, that was the idea, but for years it remained unproven.

Then, in 1888, Heinrich Hertz created his little experiment. He used an oscillating electric current to create a spark that jumped across a gap in a wire. According to the theory, this spark would produce changing electric and magnetic fields that should propagate through space.

So he set up a second loop of wire with a gap—only this one wasn't attached to any power source. But looking closely, you could see that a second spark was created in this gap. Spooky! It showed that electromagnetic waves were real and they could travel across a room. (Early radio transmitters like Marconi's used this same spark-gap method.)

You can do this yourself. I mean, it's been like 150 years, so you probably have access to stuff that Hertz didn't have—like Legos. Here's what you need: some wire, an old barbecue lighter, and a light bulb. (I used a tiny neon bulb, but an LED works too.) The lighter has a piezoelectric crystal inside that can produce large voltages when compressed. That's what happens when you pull the trigger—the voltage creates a spark that ignites the fuel as it leaves the lighter. I removed the old fuel container and connected the piezoelectric to two wires.

In back there's another pair of wires with the bulb in between them. The key point here is that, like in Hertz's loop, these back wires are not connected to any power source. Here's the setup:

The lighter creates a tiny spark that jumps from one wire to the other in the front pair. This spark creates electromagnetic waves, with the two wires serving as transmission antennas to amplify the waves. The two wires in back are the receiving antennas, and they will produce an electric current just like with Hertz's loop of wire. Instead of creating a spark on the receiver, on my device the light bulb will turn on. The neon bulb is really nice since it's high-voltage but low-current, which is exactly what we need.

OK, lights out! Here's what it looks like when you fire that spark.

It might seem trivial, but it's not. You are actually both sending and receiving electromagnetic waves.

When Hertz showed his experimental verification of Maxwell's equations, the science community knew it was cool, and the general public got curious. Journalists, naturally—ever the pragmatists—asked him what it could be used for. His reply:

“It's of no use whatsoever … this is just an experiment that proves Maestro Maxwell was right—we just have these mysterious electromagnetic waves that we cannot see with the naked eye. But they are there.”

Why waste money on experiments if they're not useful? Well, the honest truth is, that's not why we do science. Human nature makes us explorers. We ask questions and seek answers. It's just one of the things that make us who we are. Sometimes the answers are wrong (turns out the sun does not cross the sky in a chariot drawn by white horses), but we're always looking for better ones.

And sometimes science is accidentally useful. In fact, you are likely using the results of Hertz's experiment right now. He not only showed that Maxwell's equations were legit, he effectively invented the first radio transmitter. (Radio waves are just a slice of the electromagnetic spectrum.) This was then used for the wireless telegraph that allowed people to communicate with ships out at sea using Morse code. After that, people figured out how to send music and soap operas and commercials via radio waves, such that we now just call it “radio.” There was also this thing called television that could broadcast moving pictures through space.

But it doesn't stop there! Since the device sends out electromagnetic waves that reflect off objects, you can measure how long it takes for the signal to come back, which tells you how far away they are—i.e., radar and lidar, which is used in self-driving cars.  And of course, cell phone transmissions, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are all electromagnetic waves. It's literally everywhere—you're swimming in a sea of electromagnetic waves.

So if the US spends money on science, will it boost profits and economic growth? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. There are many cool discoveries with no real application. I mean, look at gravitational waves detected from colliding black holes. Will that lead to a new type of internet or something? Probably not. But we're definitely richer for knowing about it.

ChatGPT, OpenAI's text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm since its launch in November 2022. What started as a tool to supercharge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users.

2024 was a big year for OpenAI, from its partnership with Apple for its generative AI offering, Apple Intelligence, the release of GPT-4o with voice capabilities, and the highly-anticipated launch of its text-to-video model Sora.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder and longtime chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati. OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, as well as an injunction from Elon Musk to halt OpenAI's transition to a for-profit.

In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it's ceding ground in the AI race to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up its relationship with Washington as it simultaneously pursues an ambitious data center project, and as it reportedly lays the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history.

Below, you'll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we've been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.

To see a list of 2024 updates, go here.



OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, as early as next week, The Verge reported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI's GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report.

OpenAI started updating ChatGPT to enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blaho spotted a new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT's Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.”

OpenAI is offering its $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription tier for free to all college students in the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI's premium service, which offers access to the company's GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version.

More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT got the upgraded image generator on March 25, according to COO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made available  to all ChatGPT users on March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos.

The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI's o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher, possibly around $30,000 per task.

In a series of posts on X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company's new image-generation tool's popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. 

OpeanAI intends to release its “first” open language model since GPT-2 “in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia.

OpenAI made a notable change to its content moderation policies after the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to create Studio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as stated in a blog post published by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI's model behavior.

OpenAI wants to incorporate Anthropic's Model Context Protocol (MCP) into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said. 

The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI's ChatGPT has triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images have sparked concerns about whether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. 

OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloomberg reported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn't expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. 

OpenAI on Tuesday rolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT's image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now use the GPT-4o model to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI's AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company's Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company's API service. The company's CEO Sam Altman said on Wednesday, however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected.

Brad Lightcap, OpenAI's chief operating officer, will lead the company's global expansion and manage corporate partnerships as CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, according to a blog post from OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer.

OpenAI has updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company's official media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT's free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,” a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch.

OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country, per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI's ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI's models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans.

Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norway who was shocked to discover that ChatGPT was providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it's not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn't enough. You can't just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.”

OpenAI has added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less.

OpenAI has introduced o1-pro in its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than its o1 “reasoning” AI model to deliver “consistently better responses.” It's only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much as OpenAI's GPT-4.5 for input and 10 times the price of regular o1.

Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI, thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years ago if researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in a post on X, that the company has trained a “new model” that's “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming. And it turns out that it might not be that great at creative writing at all. 

we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story…

OpenAI rolled out new tools designed to help developers and businesses build AI agents — automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company's own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI's new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar to OpenAI's Operator product. The Responses API effectively replaces OpenAI's Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026.

OpenAI intends to release several “agent” products tailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according to a report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It's unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them.

The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT app allows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users.

According to a new report from VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024. It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from 100 million in November 2023 to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT's weekly active users increased to 300 million by December 2024 and 400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model's launch.

OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In a post on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI's] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. 

A commonly cited stat is that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI's latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofit AI research institute Epoch AI found the average ChatGPT query consumes around 0.3 watt-hours. However, the analysis doesn't consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing.

In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicates its step-by-step “thought” process. ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model's “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions.

OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web search without having to log in. While OpenAI had previously allowed users to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot's last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in.

OpenAI announced a new AI “agent” called deep research that's designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don't just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources.

OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView to measure the persuasive abilities of its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects user posts from the subreddit and asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user's mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models' responses to human replies for that same post. 

OpenAI launched a new AI “reasoning” model, o3-mini, the newest in the company's o family of models. OpenAI first previewed the model in December alongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.”

A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found that over half of ChatGPT's mobile users are under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users.

OpenAI launched ChatGPT Gov designed to provide U.S. government agencies an additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI's corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI's tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data.

Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork, according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center. In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they've used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it's acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm.

OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator, the company's AI “agent” tool, for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days, which is 60 days shorter than Operator's.

OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions. Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online.

Operator, OpenAI's agent tool, could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT's code base suggest that Operator will be available as an early research preview to users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren't yet publicly visible, but a user on X who goes by Choi spotted these updates in ChatGPT's client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI's website.

OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT users sign up with only a phone number — no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can't upgrade to one of OpenAI's paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn't supported without a valid email.

ChatGPT's new beta feature, called tasks, allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week.

OpenAI is introducing a new way for users to customize their interactions with ChatGPT. Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they'd like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However, some users reported that the new options have disappeared, so it's possible they went live prematurely.

ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.

November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.

Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4o.

There is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.

Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.

Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.

Most recently, Microsoft announced at its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.

GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.

A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn't necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they'll give canned responses to questions.

ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.

Yes.

Due to the nature of how these models work, they don't know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That's a problem when you're using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn't commit, that may well at this point be libel.

We will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.

Yes, there is a free ChatGPT mobile app for iOS and Android users.

It's not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.

Yes, it was released March 1, 2023.

Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.

Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.

It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can't necessarily program an entire app's worth of code. That's because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn't always appropriate for the specific context in which it's being used.

Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.

Yes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google's Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives.

OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”.

The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”.

In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “See here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.”

Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI's technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.

An Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT's false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.

CNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.

Several major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.

There have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.

Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.

Poorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they're inconsistent at best.

No. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users' conversations to other people on the service.

None specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.

Yes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.

OpenAI will soon retire GPT-4, an AI model it launched over two years ago, from ChatGPT, according to a changelog posted on Thursday.

Effective April 30, GPT-4 will be “fully replaced” by GPT-4o, the current default model in ChatGPT, OpenAI said. GPT-4 will remain available for use via OpenAI's API.

“In head‑to‑head evaluations, [GPT-4o] consistently surpasses GPT‑4 in writing, coding, STEM, and more,” wrote OpenAI in the changelog. “Recent upgrades have further improved GPT‑4o's instruction following, problem solving, and conversational flow, making it a natural successor to GPT‑4.”

GPT-4 was rolled out in March 2023 for ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot chatbot on the web. Several versions of GPT-4 had multimodal capabilities, allowing them to understand both images and text — the first for a widely deployed OpenAI model.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said that GPT-4, reportedly massive in size, cost more than $100 million to train. It was succeeded by GPT-4 Turbo in November 2023, a faster and cheaper model.

GPT-4 is one of the models at the heart of copyright disputes between OpenAI and publishers that include The New York Times. Publishers allege that OpenAI trained GPT-4 on their data without their knowledge or consent. OpenAI claims that fair use doctrine shields it from liability.

GPT-4's coming retirement will likely follow the release of new models in ChatGPT. According to reverse engineer Tibor Blaho, OpenAI is readying a family of models called GPT-4.1 — GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano, and GPT-4.1 — as well as the o3 “reasoning” model the company announced in December, and a new reasoning model called o4-mini.

Digital payments platform Stripe invites customers to join its management team meetings on a bi-weekly basis so it can get “candid feedback,” according to co-founder Patrick Collison.

In an April 8 post on X, the fintech giant's CEO said the company has a customer join for the first 30 minutes of the meeting, which is attended by about 40 leaders “from across Stripe.”

“Even though we already have a lot of customer feedback mechanisms, it somehow always spurs new thoughts and investigations,” he wrote.

It's an interesting strategy from Stripe, which was founded in 2010 and is considered to be the highest-valued private fintech in the world (its most recent valuation was $91.5 billion).

Over the years, startups have complained anecdotally that Stripe is more focused on its larger customers than the smaller ones it set out to serve. But the company must be doing something right.  Stripe's annual letter in February penned by Collison noted that payment volume in 2024 grew to $1.4 trillion, up 38% on the year before.

Stripe also added in the letter that it is now used by half of the Fortune 100 companies, underscoring how it has catapulted from a startup working with other startups into a major enterprise player.

In the post on X, Collison responded to the Cloudflare CTO's question of when his company would get an invite with a, “Would love to have you guys…will reach out.” 

To the point of smaller businesses feeling neglected, one investor wrote: “Hi Patrick – you know I admire @Stripe – but you should pay attention to the extent things have degraded for the indie community using Stripe. I messaged support a week ago – no reply, things are super complicated. There's more stuff, but it's a mess.”

Many praised the move, with one user noting: “Love this. Keeps the culture focused on what matters and helps reconciles (sic) reality.”

And, naturally, some Stripe customers used the X post to post their complaints (here and here). 

However, one high-profile founder seemed to approve of Stripe's approach: Elon Musk replied to the post with a simple, “Good idea.”

Microsoft announced on Friday that it is buying 3.7 million metric tons of carbon removal credits from CO280, a project developer that works with pulp and paper mills.

The purchase covers 12 years of emissions from CO280's first carbon capture project at a mill on the Gulf Coast. CO280 expects the facility to start capturing CO2 in 2028. 

Microsoft's purchase should help it meet its goal of becoming a carbon-negative company by 2030 — that is, removing more carbon than its business produces. But even with Microsoft's enviable balance sheet, it's a tall order: The company generated 17.1 million metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2023.

To trim that number, Microsoft has been buying large amounts of renewable power and, to tackle what it can't replace with renewables, it has been inking deals that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to offset what it can't eliminate.

The Microsoft project is the first of a dozen that CO280 has in the works, co-founder and CEO Jonathan Rhone exclusively told TechCrunch. Rhone, who used to sell power plants to the pulp and paper industry, said that adding carbon capture to the process seemed like a natural fit. 

“It just seemed like a no-brainer that everyone had missed,” he said. The pulp and paper industry releases around 100 million metric tons of biogenic carbon dioxide annually.

To build the carbon capture facility, CO280 is working with SLB Capturi, a joint venture between SLB (formerly known as Schlumberger) and Aker Carbon Capture. The capture technology is based on the widely used amine process, and it will be attached to a large paper mill's recovery boiler, which helps recycle various chemicals for reuse. The boiler also releases a lot of carbon that was locked up in the wood itself.

Normally, the wood-locked carbon would be dumped into the atmosphere. But by drawing CO2 from this step in the process, the paper mill will be effectively removing carbon from the atmosphere by way of photosynthesis. “The trees do all the heavy lifting by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere,” Rhone said.

Once captured, the carbon dioxide will be sent 40 miles via pipeline to a saline aquifer that is being used for CO2 storage. Altogether, this first phase of the project will capture about 40% of the biogenic carbon dioxide released by the mill and 30% of the total CO2, including from fossil fuels used to power the operation. CO280 is planning a second phase that should double those figures.

Rhone said that the carbon capture units will be built as joint ventures with the paper mills. In return, the mills will receive a portion of the carbon credit proceeds, helping boost their bottom line. CO280 sells its credits at around $200 per metric ton, and buyers can claim tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, bringing the cost down further.

CO280 previously sold carbon removal credits to Frontier, the advanced market commitment created by Stripe, Google, Shopify, Meta, and others.

Posted:

A recent breach of Berkshire Hathaway-owned private jet company NetJets has revealed a guide for flight attendants serving Elon Musk, per a Bloomberg report. The memo offers an interesting glimpse into the personal preferences of the world's richest man.

Some of the preferences are surprising for the CEO of Tesla, a company dedicated to sustainability. Apparently Musk isn't “interested in conserving fuel” because he “wants to fly as quickly and as direct” as possible. 

Other inclinations are not surprising at all, like the note to staff not to offer him technical help.

“Mr. Musk considers himself self-sufficient and does not need help with technology — if he does, he will ask.”

And then there's the relatable stuff, like his dislike of unexpected Wi-Fi outages and his penchant to take a nap, even on day trips. He also prefers to keep the cabin at 65 degrees, the lights dim, and the passenger vents off because he “does not like the noise.”

Ideally, a distro maintainer would come across a project packaged with nix and think:> Oh good, the app dev has taken extra steps to make life easy for me.As-is, I don't think that's the case.  You can add a flake output to your project which builds an .rpm or a .deb file, but it's not commonly done.I'm guessing that most of the time, distro maintainers would instead hook directly into a language specific build-tool like cmake or cargo and ignore the nix stuff.  They benefit from nix only indirectly in cases where it has prevented the app dev from doing crazy things in their build (or at least has made that crazyness explicit, versus some kind of works-on-my-machine accident or some kind of nothing-to-see here skulduggery).If we want to nixify the world I think we should focus less on talking people out of using package managers which they like and more on making the underlying packages more uniform.

The value in Nix comes from the package set, nixpkgs. What is revolutionary is how nixpgks builds a Linux distribution declaratively, and reproducibly, from source through purely functional expressions. However, nixpkgs is almost an entire universe unto itself, and it is generally incompatible with the way any other distribution would handle things, so it would be no use to Fedora, Debian, and others

The article you linked is very clear that both qualitatively and quantitatively, NixOS has made achieved high degrees of reproducibility, and even explicitly rejects the possibility of assessing absolute reproducibility.NixOS may not be the absolute leader here (that's probably stagex, or GuixSD if you limit yourself to more practical distros with large package collections), but it is indeed very good.Did you mean to link to a different article?

If they just started quarantining the long tail of obscure packages, then people would get upset. And failing to be 100% reproducible will make a subset of users upset. Lose-lose proposition there, given that intelligent users could just consciously avoid packages that aren't passing reproducibility tests.100% reproducibility is a good goal, but as long as the ubiquitous packages are reproducible then that is probably going to cover most. Would be interesting to provide an easy way to disallow non-reproducible packages.I'm sure one day they will be able to make it a requirement for inclusion into the official repos.

AI-native psychiatry, built for scale and covered by insurance

We're building the AI-native operations layer for psychiatric care. Not diagnostics, but what happens outside the visit—the real operational backend: scheduling, documentation, billing, intake, risk detection, and more.

If you want to build core infrastructure with real AI, own systems end-to-end, and work directly with a deeply technical founder still up to his neck in the code—read on.

Hey—I'm Daniel, co-founder and CTO of Legion Health (YC S21).

Mental health care is operationally broken—patients ghosted, clinicians buried in forms, payers chasing missing notes.

The industry is flooded with AI startups trying to automate away diagnosis—and even providers as a whole. But diagnostics aren't the bottleneck. Operations are.

So, we're solving the real problem:

""What if operations worked?”

We're building a real-time, AI-powered backend for mental health clinics—LLM agents + structured systems that coordinate human care like it's software. Think:

And we're already live. Our agent infrastructure supports over 2,000+ patients — with only one support human.

Unlike most AI startups, we are our own customer. We operate our own large psychiatric practice. The systems you build directly impact our clinicians and patients today. No theoretical B2B pitches, begging for pilots, and months of stakeholder alignment and bureaucracy—just real-world, high-stakes operational challenges.

⭐ If you've felt like AI is being wasted on toy tools or B2B busywork—come work on something real.

This is the moment where foundational hires make the company. You're not joining an idea-stage pipe dream or a late-stage dinosaur. You're helping us define the future.

This isn't a feature factory. We move fast, shipping multiple meaningful features straight to real patients and providers every single day.

You'll own entire domains end-to-end—architecture, implementation, iteration—not just JIRA tickets. This is the frontier of applied AI in healthcare.

You'll help answer questions at the frontier of AI, like:

What does reliable agent infrastructure look like in production?

What's the role of structured data in a world with LLMs?

How do we make agents auditable, evolvable, and fast?

We're not looking for warm bodies. We're looking for founding technologists who can think in systems and ship fast.

Backend:

Node.js, TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres), AWS (ECS, Lambda, S3)

Frontend:

Next.js 15, Tailwind, Vercel

AI Infra:

OpenAI, Anthropic, agentic loops and workflows, observability and eval (e.g. Langfuse), embeddings and vector DBs, tool-calling, model context protocol (MCPs), etc.

Other:

PHI security, audit pipelines, real-time schedulers, transcript parsing

This is the moment when the infrastructure is still malleable. When the next 20 years of mental health care can still be shaped by a few engineers with systems taste, speed, and conviction.

You won't be joining as employee #73. You'll be founding the engineering culture. You'll have a direct line to me. You'll shape core systems and help decide what we build next.

If you've ever said, “I wish I could've been there when [insert legendary product] was getting built,” this is that moment.

If this resonates, I want to work with you. Let's build the founding systems of AI-native mental healthcare—and make something people didn't think was possible.

We're rebuilding psychiatry from the ground up—AI-native, insurance-covered, and engineered to scale.

Legion Health is a high-quality psychiatry network where patients get care from licensed clinicians, fast and affordably. Under the hood, our LLM agents and orchestration layer automate operations, reduce admin, and enable truly great care.

Most startups bolt AI onto broken workflows. We're replacing the workflows—and the system underneath.

If you've ever wanted to use AI to actually fix something that matters, this is your shot.

In a test run, a unit of Marines in the Pacific used generative AI not just to collect intelligence but to interpret it. Routine intel work is only the start.

For much of last year, about 2,500 US service members from the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit sailed aboard three ships throughout the Pacific, conducting training exercises in the waters off South Korea, the Philippines, India, and Indonesia. At the same time, onboard the ships, an experiment was unfolding: The Marines in the unit responsible for sorting through foreign intelligence and making their superiors aware of possible local threats were for the first time using generative AI to do it, testing a leading AI tool the Pentagon has been funding.

Two officers tell us that they used the new system to help scour thousands of pieces of open-source intelligence—nonclassified articles, reports, images, videos—collected in the various countries where they operated, and that it did so far faster than was possible with the old method of analyzing them manually. Captain Kristin Enzenauer, for instance, says she used large language models to translate and summarize foreign news sources, while Captain Will Lowdon used AI to help write the daily and weekly intelligence reports he provided to his commanders. 

“We still need to validate the sources,” says Lowdon. But the unit's commanders encouraged the use of large language models, he says, “because they provide a lot more efficiency during a dynamic situation.”

The generative AI tools they used were built by the defense-tech company Vannevar Labs, which in November was granted a production contract worth up to $99 million by the Pentagon's startup-oriented Defense Innovation Unit with the goal of bringing its intelligence tech to more military units. The company, founded in 2019 by veterans of the CIA and US intelligence community, joins the likes of Palantir, Anduril, and Scale AI as a major beneficiary of the US military's embrace of artificial intelligence—not only for physical technologies like drones and autonomous vehicles but also for software that is revolutionizing how the Pentagon collects, manages, and interprets data for warfare and surveillance. 

Though the US military has been developing computer vision models and similar AI tools, like those used in Project Maven, since 2017, the use of generative AI—tools that can engage in human-like conversation like those built by Vannevar Labs—represent a newer frontier.

The company applies existing large language models, including some from OpenAI and Microsoft, and some bespoke ones of its own to troves of open-source intelligence the company has been collecting since 2021. The scale at which this data is collected is hard to comprehend (and a large part of what sets Vannevar's products apart): terabytes of data in 80 different languages are hoovered every day in 180 countries. The company says it is able to analyze social media profiles and breach firewalls in countries like China to get hard-to-access information; it also uses nonclassified data that is difficult to get online (gathered by human operatives on the ground), as well as reports from physical sensors that covertly monitor radio waves to detect illegal shipping activities. 

Vannevar then builds AI models to translate information, detect threats, and analyze political sentiment, with the results delivered through a chatbot interface that's not unlike ChatGPT. The aim is to provide customers with critical information on topics as varied as international fentanyl supply chains and China's efforts to secure rare earth minerals in the Philippines. 

“Our real focus as a company,” says Scott Philips, Vannevar Labs' chief technology officer, is to “collect data, make sense of that data, and help the US make good decisions.” 

That approach is particularly appealing to the US intelligence apparatus because for years the world has been awash in more data than human analysts can possibly interpret—a problem that contributed to the 2003 founding of Palantir, a company with a market value of over $200 billion and known for its powerful and controversial tools, including a database that helps Immigration and Customs Enforcement search for and track information on undocumented immigrants. 

In 2019, Vannevar saw an opportunity to use large language models, which were then new on the scene, as a novel solution to the data conundrum. The technology could enable AI not just to collect data but to actually talk through an analysis with someone interactively.

Vannevar's tools proved useful for the deployment in the Pacific, and Enzenauer and Lowdon say that while they were instructed to always double-check the AI's work, they didn't find inaccuracies to be a significant issue. Enzenauer regularly used the tool to track any foreign news reports in which the unit's exercises were mentioned and to perform sentiment analysis, detecting the emotions and opinions expressed in text. Judging whether a foreign news article reflects a threatening or friendly opinion toward the unit is a task that on previous deployments she had to do manually.

“It was mostly by hand—researching, translating, coding, and analyzing the data,” she says. “It was definitely way more time-consuming than it was when using the AI.” 

Still, Enzenauer and Lowdon say there were hiccups, some of which would affect most digital tools: The ships had spotty internet connections much of the time, limiting how quickly the AI model could synthesize foreign intelligence, especially if it involved photos or video. 

With this first test completed, the unit's commanding officer, Colonel Sean Dynan, said on a call with reporters in February that heavier use of generative AI was coming; this experiment was “the tip of the iceberg.” 

This is indeed the direction that the entire US military is barreling toward at full speed. In December, the Pentagon said it will spend $100 million in the next two years on pilots specifically for generative AI applications. In addition to Vannevar, it's also turning to Microsoft and Palantir, which are working together on AI models that would make use of classified data. (The US is of course not alone in this approach; notably, Israel has been using AI to sort through information and even generate lists of targets in its war in Gaza, a practice that has been widely criticized.)

The Oculus founder has pivoted from selling goggles to consumers, to selling them to the military

Perhaps unsurprisingly, plenty of people outside the Pentagon are warning about the potential risks of this plan, including Heidy Khlaaf, who is chief AI scientist at the AI Now Institute, a research organization, and has expertise in leading safety audits for AI-powered systems. She says this rush to incorporate generative AI into military decision-making ignores more foundational flaws of the technology: “We're already aware of how LLMs are highly inaccurate, especially in the context of safety-critical applications that require precision.” 

Khlaaf adds that even if humans are “double-checking” the work of AI, there's little reason to think they're capable of catching every mistake. “‘Human-in-the-loop' is not always a meaningful mitigation,” she says. When an AI model relies on thousands of data points to come to conclusions, “it wouldn't really be possible for a human to sift through that amount of information to determine if the AI output was erroneous.”

One particular use case that concerns her is sentiment analysis, which she argues is “a highly subjective metric that even humans would struggle to appropriately assess based on media alone.” 

If AI perceives hostility toward US forces where a human analyst would not—or if the system misses hostility that is really there—the military could make an misinformed decision or escalate a situation unnecessarily.

Sentiment analysis is indeed a task that AI has not perfected. Philips, the Vannevar CTO, says the company has built models specifically to judge whether an article is pro-US or not, but MIT Technology Review was not able to evaluate them. 

Chris Mouton, a senior engineer for RAND, recently tested how well-suited generative AI is for the task. He evaluated leading models, including OpenAI's GPT-4 and an older version of GPT fine-tuned to do such intelligence work, on how accurately they flagged foreign content as propaganda compared with human experts. “It's hard,” he says, noting that AI struggled to identify more subtle types of propaganda. But he adds that the models could still be useful in lots of other analysis tasks. 

Another limitation of Vannevar's approach, Khlaaf says, is that the usefulness of open-source intelligence is debatable. Mouton says that open-source data can be “pretty extraordinary,” but Khlaaf points out that unlike classified intel gathered through reconnaissance or wiretaps, it is exposed to the open internet—making it far more susceptible to misinformation campaigns, bot networks, and deliberate manipulation, as the US Army has warned.

For Mouton, the biggest open question now is whether these generative AI technologies will be simply one investigatory tool among many that analysts use—or whether they'll produce the subjective analysis that's relied upon and trusted in decision-making. “This is the central debate,” he says. 

What everyone agrees is that AI models are accessible—you can just ask them a question about complex pieces of intelligence, and they'll respond in plain language. But it's still in dispute what imperfections will be acceptable in the name of efficiency. 

Update: This story was updated to include additional context from Heidy Khlaaf. 

The new general AI agent from China had some system crashes and server overload—but it's highly intuitive and shows real promise for the future of AI helpers.

What the firm found challenges some basic assumptions about how this technology really works.

These newer models appear more likely to indulge in rule-bending behaviors than previous generations—and there's no way to stop them.

The country poured billions into AI infrastructure, but the data center gold rush is unraveling as speculative investments collide with weak demand and DeepSeek shifts AI trends.

Three books examine what we gain and lose when we let machines create.

In 2021, 20 years after the death of her older sister, Vauhini Vara was still unable to tell the story of her loss. “I wondered,” she writes in Searches, her new collection of essays on AI technology, “if Sam Altman's machine could do it for me.” So she tried ChatGPT. But as it expanded on Vara's prompts in sentences ranging from the stilted to the unsettling to the sublime, the thing she'd enlisted as a tool stopped seeming so mechanical. 

“Once upon a time, she taught me to exist,” the AI model wrote of the young woman Vara had idolized. Vara, a journalist and novelist, called the resulting essay “Ghosts,” and in her opinion, the best lines didn't come from her: “I found myself irresistibly attracted to GPT-3—to the way it offered, without judgment, to deliver words to a writer who has found herself at a loss for them … as I tried to write more honestly, the AI seemed to be doing the same.”

A string of startups are racing to build models that can produce better and better software. They claim it's the shortest path to AGI.

The rapid proliferation of AI in our lives introduces new challenges around authorship, authenticity, and ethics in work and art. But it also offers a particularly human problem in narrative: How can we make sense of these machines, not just use them? And how do the words we choose and stories we tell about technology affect the role we allow it to take on (or even take over) in our creative lives? Both Vara's book and The Uncanny Muse, a collection of essays on the history of art and automation by the music critic David Hajdu, explore how humans have historically and personally wrestled with the ways in which machines relate to our own bodies, brains, and creativity. At the same time, The Mind Electric, a new book by a neurologist, Pria Anand, reminds us that our own inner workings may not be so easy to replicate.

Searches is a strange artifact. Part memoir, part critical analysis, and part AI-assisted creative experimentation, Vara's essays trace her time as a tech reporter and then novelist in the San Francisco Bay Area alongside the history of the industry she watched grow up. Tech was always close enough to touch: One college friend was an early Google employee, and when Vara started reporting on Facebook (now Meta), she and Mark Zuckerberg became “friends” on his platform. In 2007, she published a scoop that the company was planning to introduce ad targeting based on users' personal information—the first shot fired in the long, gnarly data war to come. In her essay “Stealing Great Ideas,” she talks about turning down a job reporting on Apple to go to graduate school for fiction. There, she wrote a novel about a tech founder, which was later published as The Immortal King Rao. Vara points out that in some ways at the time, her art was “inextricable from the resources [she] used to create it”—products like Google Docs, a MacBook, an iPhone. But these pre-AI resources were tools, plain and simple. What came next was different.

Interspersed with Vara's essays are chapters of back-and-forths between the author and ChatGPT about the book itself, where the bot serves as editor at Vara's prompting. ChatGPT obligingly summarizes and critiques her writing in a corporate-­shaded tone that's now familiar to any knowledge worker. “If there's a place for disagreement,” it offers about the first few chapters on tech companies, “it might be in the balance of these narratives. Some might argue that the ­benefits—such as job creation, innovation in various sectors like AI and logistics, and contributions to the global economy—can outweigh the negatives.” 

Vara notices that ChatGPT writes “we” and “our” in these responses, pulling it into the human story, not the tech one: “Earlier you mentioned ‘our access to information' and ‘our collective experiences and understandings.'” When she asks what the rhetorical purpose of that choice is, ChatGPT responds with a numbered list of benefits including “inclusivity and solidarity” and “neutrality and objectivity.” It adds that “using the first-person plural helps to frame the discussion in terms of shared human experiences and collective challenges.” Does the bot believe it's human? Or at least, do the humans who made it want other humans to believe it does? “Can corporations use these [rhetorical] tools in their products too, to subtly make people identify with, and not in opposition to, them?” Vara asks. ChatGPT replies, “Absolutely.”

Vara has concerns about the words she's used as well. In “Thank You for Your Important Work,” she worries about the impact of “Ghosts,” which went viral after it was first published. Had her writing helped corporations hide the reality of AI behind a velvet curtain? She'd meant to offer a nuanced “provocation,” exploring how uncanny generative AI can be. But instead, she'd produced something beautiful enough to resonate as an ad for its creative potential. Even Vara herself felt fooled. She particularly loved one passage the bot wrote, about Vara and her sister as kids holding hands on a long drive. But she couldn't imagine either of them being so sentimental. What Vara had elicited from the machine, she realized, was “wish fulfillment,” not a haunting. 

The rapid proliferation of AI in our lives introduces new challenges around authorship, authenticity, and ethics in work and art. How can we make sense of these machines, not just use them? 

The machine wasn't the only thing crouching behind that too-good-to-be-true curtain. The GPT models and others are trained through human labor, in sometimes exploitative conditions. And much of the training data was the creative work of human writers before her. “I'd conjured artificial language about grief through the extraction of real human beings' language about grief,” she writes. The creative ghosts in the model were made of code, yes, but also, ultimately, made of people. Maybe Vara's essay helped cover up that truth too.

In the book's final essay, Vara offers a mirror image of those AI call-and-­response exchanges as an antidote. After sending out an anonymous survey to women of various ages, she presents the replies to each question, one after the other. “Describe something that doesn't exist,” she prompts, and the women respond: “God.” “God.” “God.” “Perfection.” “My job. (Lost it.)” Real people contradict each other, joke, yell, mourn, and reminisce. Instead of a single authoritative voice—an editor, or a company's limited style guide—Vara gives us the full gasping crowd of human creativity. “What's it like to be alive?” Vara asks the group. “It depends,” one woman answers.    

For artist Sougwen Chung, AI is an opportunity to embrace uncertainty.

David Hajdu, now music editor at The Nation and previously a music critic for The New Republic, goes back much further than the early years of Facebook to tell the history of how humans have made and used machines to express ourselves. Player pianos, microphones, synthesizers, and electrical instruments were all assistive technologies that faced skepticism before acceptance and, sometimes, elevation in music and popular culture. They even influenced the kind of art people were able to and wanted to make. Electrical amplification, for instance, allowed singers to use a wider vocal range and still reach an audience. The synthesizer introduced a new lexicon of sound to rock music. “What's so bad about being mechanical, anyway?” Hajdu asks in The Uncanny Muse. And “what's so great about being human?” 

But Hajdu is also interested in how intertwined the history of man and machine can be, and how often we've used one as a metaphor for the other. Descartes saw the body as empty machinery for consciousness, he reminds us. Hobbes wrote that “life is but a motion of limbs.” Freud described the mind as a steam engine. Andy Warhol told an interviewer that “everybody should be a machine.” And when computers entered the scene, humans used them as metaphors for themselves too. “Where the machine model had once helped us understand the human body … a new category of machines led us to imagine the brain (how we think, what we know, even how we feel or how we think about what we feel) in terms of the computer,” Hajdu writes. 

But what is lost with these one-to-one mappings? What happens when we imagine that the complexity of the brain—an organ we do not even come close to fully understanding—can be replicated in 1s and 0s? Maybe what happens is we get a world full of chatbots and agents, computer-­generated artworks and AI DJs, that companies claim are singular creative voices rather than remixes of a million human inputs. And perhaps we also get projects like the painfully named Painting Fool—an AI that paints, developed by Simon Colton, a scholar at Queen Mary University of London. He told Hajdu that he wanted to “demonstrate the potential of a computer program to be taken seriously as a creative artist in its own right.” What Colton means is not just a machine that makes art but one that expresses its own worldview: “Art that communicates what it's like to be a machine.”  

What happens when we imagine that the complexity of the brain—an organ we do not even come close to fully understanding—can be replicated in 1s and 0s?

Hajdu seems to be curious and optimistic about this line of inquiry. “Machines of many kinds have been communicating things for ages, playing invaluable roles in our communication through art,” he says. “Growing in intelligence, machines may still have more to communicate, if we let them.” But the question that The Uncanny Muse raises at the end is: Why should we art-­making humans be so quick to hand over the paint to the paintbrush? Why do we care how the paintbrush sees the world? Are we truly finished telling our own stories ourselves?

Pria Anand might say no. In The Mind Electric, she writes: “Narrative is universally, spectacularly human; it is as unconscious as breathing, as essential as sleep, as comforting as familiarity. It has the capacity to bind us, but also to other, to lay bare, but also obscure.” The electricity in The Mind Electric belongs entirely to the human brain—no metaphor necessary. Instead, the book explores a number of neurological afflictions and the stories patients and doctors tell to better understand them. “The truth of our bodies and minds is as strange as fiction,” Anand writes—and the language she uses throughout the book is as evocative as that in any novel. 

In personal and deeply researched vignettes in the tradition of Oliver Sacks, Anand shows that any comparison between brains and machines will inevitably fall flat. She tells of patients who see clear images when they're functionally blind, invent entire backstories when they've lost a memory, break along seams that few can find, and—yes—see and hear ghosts. In fact, Anand cites one study of 375 college students in which researchers found that nearly three-quarters “had heard a voice that no one else could hear.” These were not diagnosed schizophrenics or sufferers of brain tumors—just people listening to their own uncanny muses. Many heard their name, others heard God, and some could make out the voice of a loved one who'd passed on. Anand suggests that writers throughout history have harnessed organic exchanges with these internal apparitions to make art. “I see myself taking the breath of these voices in my sails,” Virginia Woolf wrote of her own experiences with ghostly sounds. “I am a porous vessel afloat on sensation.” The mind in The Mind Electric is vast, mysterious, and populated. The narratives people construct to traverse it are just as full of wonder. 

Humans are not going to stop using technology to help us create anytime soon—and there's no reason we should. Machines make for wonderful tools, as they always have. But when we turn the tools themselves into artists and storytellers, brains and bodies, magicians and ghosts, we bypass truth for wish fulfillment. Maybe what's worse, we rob ourselves of the opportunity to contribute our own voices to the lively and loud chorus of human experience. And we keep others from the human pleasure of hearing them too.

Bringing an audio speaker into the bathtub with you used to be, well, inadvisable. At best. And many of those portable Bluetooth speakers that boast of being waterproof are only seaworthy to a point. Then there is Anker's Soundcore Select 4 Go Bluetooth Shower Speaker, which rocks a degree of waterproofing so great that it floats. Skeptical? It's worth a $20 bet to find out, which is what the Soundcore Select 4 Go is selling for right now at Amazon during a 39% off sale.

We're not advocating that you make using the Soundcore Select 4 Go in your bath or pool as a regular habit, but should an accidental dunking occur, the Soundcore Select 4 Go can be immersed in up to 3.3 feet of water for up to 30 minutes without damage. It's barely half a pound in weight and has a built-in loop for your showerhead, handlebars, carabiner, or anything else you want to attach it to for great sound on the go without fear of the elements.

See at Amazon

The hand-sized Soundcore Select 4 Go cranks out 5 watts worth of clear, beautiful sound from any Bluetooth device you choose to pair it with. It's USB-rechargeable with the included cable, and a full charge gets you 20 hours of listening time. Even after 300 charging cycles at max current, the Soundcore Select 4 Go's battery retains 95% of its performance. Between that and its amazingly durable construction, this should provide years of portable listening.

You can also double your pleasure by pairing two Soundcore Select 4 Go speakers to your Bluetooth device — they'll assume stereo separation with one taking on the left channel and the other one the right channel. This 39% off Amazon deal is the perfect time to grab two Soundcore Select 4 Go speakers and set them up for clear, long-lasting, budget-friendly stereo sound.

The Soundcore Select 4 Go has “shower” in its name, and it is indeed a perfect shower speaker thanks to its long battery life and IP67 waterproofing. But it's also ideal for the beach or a day out on a boat — remember, in case it goes overboard, it floats — or clipped to handlebars or a backpack for a day of outdoor adventuring, because it's also rated IP67 for dustproofing. It work equally well indoors in a dry room, but when you have this kind of insurance against the elements, that almost seems like a wasted opportunity.

The Soundcore Select 4 Go comes in six colors, but only the black model is part of this 39% off Amazon deal. When you can save $13 and the performance is identical, why be picky about the color? Head to Amazon now and lock in a summer of outdoor tunes free that will last regardless of the elements.

Meet the cleaning companion that makes your current robot vacuum look like a dust-pushing toy. The Dreame L10 Ultra isn't just another autonomous vacuum – it's a complete floor-care system that vacuums, mops, and most importantly, takes care of itself. With the ability to automatically empty its dust bin, clean its own mops, and refill its water tank, this is as close as you can get to never thinking about floor cleaning again.

See at Amazon

In a jaw-dropping deal, Amazon has slashed the price of the Dreame L10 Ultra from $790 to just $300. This massive 62% discount saves you $490 on one of the most advanced robot vacuum and mop combos available.

The self-maintenance features set this robot apart from budget models. After each cleaning session, it returns to its base station to empty collected debris, wash its mopping pads, and refill its water tank. This means you can go weeks without having to touch the robot or its base station.

Cleaning performance impresses with 5,300Pa of suction power – strong enough to pull embedded dirt from deep within carpet fibers. The dual rotating mop pads apply consistent pressure to tackle dried-on spills and stubborn stains, while intelligent sensors prevent your carpets from getting wet.

Navigation is where the L10 Ultra truly shines. Using LiDAR technology and advanced mapping algorithms, it creates detailed floor plans of your home and plots the most efficient cleaning routes. It can recognize and avoid obstacles like shoes, cords, and pet bowls, minimizing the need to “prep” your home before cleaning.

The smartphone app provides comprehensive control over every aspect of cleaning. Set schedules, customize cleaning intensity for different rooms, create no-go zones, and monitor the robot's progress in real-time. Voice control through Alexa or Google Assistant adds hands-free convenience.

Battery life is impressive at up to 210 minutes, enough to clean up to 2,600 square feet on a single charge. If the battery runs low during a large job, the robot automatically returns to charge and resumes where it left off. That's great for if you just sat down and really don't feel like getting up to put the robot away.

At $300 (-62%), this represents exceptional value for a self-maintaining robot vacuum and mop combo. While there are cheaper robots available, none offer this level of autonomy and cleaning performance. This deal brings premium features into the mid-range price category, making it an excellent opportunity to upgrade your home cleaning game without breaking the bank.

In 1901, sponge divers discovered an ancient shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera. Among the recovered materials, a corroded lump of metal caught the eye of archaeologist Valerios Stais. The artifact turned out to be a surprisingly complex—though fragmented—mechanical device dated between the late second and early first centuries BCE. Now called the Antikythera Mechanism, it is widely considered to be the world's first analog computer, tracking time and astronomical events through gearwork and pointers.

New research adds a twist to the story of this famous device, suggesting the Antikythera Mechanism may never have worked as intended, that it was just a fancy knickknack. The triangular shape of the gear teeth wasn't the issue, according to new simulations—the real problem was likely flaws in the gear construction. The new work shows that even the tiniest manufacturing mistake could've caused the mechanism to jam or slip, raising the possibility that the Antikythera Mechanism was either nonfunctional or originally built with far greater precision than scientists can now discern.

Since its discovery, many scholars have questioned whether the Antikythera Mechanism actually functioned or if it was merely a glorified bauble. In this spirit, two engineers, Esteban Guillermo Szigety and Gustavo Francisco Arenas from Argentina's National University of Mar del Plata, combined previous approaches to analyze how the gearwork's triangular teeth and manufacturing errors may have impacted its functionality. Their work is detailed in a paper, posted April 1 on the preprint server arXiv, that has not yet been peer reviewed.

The Antikythera Mechanism had interconnected indicators (like the hands of a clock) that pointed to the positions of the Sun and Moon in the zodiac, future eclipses, the Egyptian calendar date, and a Greek lunisolar calendar. “The indicators are driven by a gear train, which introduces two main sources of error that affect their accuracy,” the researchers explained in the study. “First, the triangular shape of the teeth results in non-uniform motion, causing acceleration and deceleration as each tooth engages.” Today, modern gears use an involute tooth profile. “Second, the inevitable inaccuracies in gear manufacturing can also generate errors.”

To investigate how these two features may have affected the device's function, they simulated the system using a computer model that incorporated earlier measurements from two researchers—Alan Thorndike and Mike Edmunds—who had analyzed the “triangle tooth” and “manufacturing” problems, respectively.

Ultimately, “our findings indicate that while the triangular shape of the teeth alone produces negligible errors, manufacturing inaccuracies significantly increase the likelihood of gear jamming or disengagement,” the researchers wrote. In other words, the “manufacturing” problem, as measured by Edmunds, would have made the Antikythera Mechanism practically unusable. “As a result, two possibilities arise: either the mechanism never functioned, or its errors were smaller than those found by Edmunds.”

The researchers add that, though possible, it is unlikely that someone would intentionally build such an unusable device. As such, they suggest that Edmunds' analyses might have been skewed by the highly corroded nature of the artifact, while emphasizing that their own results should be interpreted with caution, given the speculative nature of the study.

This study doesn't settle the debate over whether the Antikythera Mechanism actually worked, but it is pushing the conversation forward. As scientists continue to analyze the device from its badly degraded remains, each analysis uncovers something new, while also reminding us how incredibly precise its makers needed to be.

The semiconductor industry is among the worst offenders in PFAS use and pollution.

A team at Australia's Monash University has published its work on a new water filtration membrane that can successfully remove small PFAS molecules from water flow. PFAS, or polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a key piece in multiple facets of semiconductor manufacturing that have earned the name ""forever chemicals"" for their difficulty to clean up.

Monash's research team is ready to utilize some key partnerships to bring the filters to market at a high scale, keeping PFAS out of the groundwater at plants in all of the various industries that work with forever chemicals. The semiconductor industry, however, has long been opposed to legislation or other initiatives to restrict its use of PFAS in fabrication, forming lobbying groups and other coalitions to conserve the use of forever chemicals in chipmaking.

Monash University's team, led by Ph.D. candidate Eubert Mahofa, has designed a modified graphene membrane that selectively stops PFAS chains while allowing water to pass through freely. The membrane stops over 90% of PFAS that pass into it, a major improvement over traditional polyamide membranes, which can only remove around 35% of PFAS.

""PFAS are difficult to manage because they dissolve easily in water and can spread far from their original source, making contamination challenging to contain and remediate,"" shared Mahofa. ""Our approach solves this by filtering out and concentrating these harmful chemicals while still allowing water to flow through efficiently, making it a strong candidate to supplement the technologies for PFAS destruction.""

PFAS have been known as forever chemicals since their societal reckoning in the 1990's. Defined by carbon-fluorine bonds, which can have half-lives over eight years long, PFAS chains consistently leech into groundwater supplies, remaining there indefinitely. Certain PFAS are highly dangerous to humans if inhaled or ingested, and others will end up ""stuck"" in humans or animals after death.

The new filtration method utilizes specific chemical relationships to catch even the smallest PFAS bonds, which typically slip past traditional polyamide methods. The new barrier stops these bonds at varying temperatures while still maintaining efficient water flow, making the new tech nothing short of a breakthrough development.

""This breakthrough in PFAS filtration has the potential to revolutionize how PFAS contamination is managed globally, with applications ranging from landfill leachate treatment to industrial wastewater purification,"" says Professor Mainak Majumder of the Australian Research Council, which contributed to the research, in the press release.

Monash University and the Australian Research Council have close connections with NematiQ, a graphene-focused manufacturer that has pledged to help bring the new filter to market. Commercialization seems like a likely next step for the new technology, made easier by the study's focus on using highly scalable shear alignment printing to produce its filters.

PFAS have been used in industrial manufacturing since Teflon's invention in the 1930s. Today, countless industries, including semiconductors, use the chemicals in various facets of manufacturing. PFAS were originally thought to be chemically inert and harmless to humans, an assumption that held for decades. However, once PFAS was found swimming in the bloodstream and organs of longtime industrial workers, more research was done, and more risks were found.

PFAS chemicals are now linked to a variety of toxic effects by governments and health organizations, including developmental issues, infertility, and cancer. PFAS exposure comes from industrial chemicals that soil water tables and rainwater but also from clothes, cosmetic items, and consumption of animals with PFAS exposure. It is estimated that the majority of humans living today have some amount of PFAS already permanently in their bodies.

Certain PFAS, including PFOS and PFOA, have already been banned by the European Union and eventually worldwide as of 2009 for their egregious health risks. The EU is beginning to pursue legislation that would ban the entire PFAS group, but this legislation has been challenged by myriad lobbyist efforts, including serious resistance from the semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry uses PFAS up and down the microchip supply chain, and as such has launched multiple efforts to slow progress on PFAS restrictions. Semi, an industry association representing companies across the electronics supply chain, publishes an explainer guide on the semiconductor industry's use of PFAS in chip fabs. The guide includes all of the following uses for PFAS in chip fabs.

PFAS are present in chemicals necessarily used during chip fabrication, including photoresist liquids used during lithography and etch chamber gases used in wafer production. Chemical purifiers that produce hydrogen for use in EUV lithography also may contain PFAS, along with more tertiary parts of development like lithium batteries or plastic chip packaging. Semi's public page presents an overwhelming amount of possible places where PFAS may be used, tacitly stating that PFAS use is so widespread that to remove it entirely from chipmaking is too uphill a fight.

A collection of industry members also recently established the Semiconductor PFAS Consortium, a group more obviously dedicated to combating efforts to stop PFAS use in chipmaking. While the Consortium claims on its homepage that it is not focused on advocacy, this is not the case. The group's efforts in American politics were widely reported in August, when the Consortium spread its whitepapers against PFAS restrictions across Capitol Hill.

The PFAS Consortium's parent company successfully lobbied lawmakers for a bill removing chip fabrication plants from inclusion in certain environmental restrictions on manufacturing byproducts. The Consortium promised lawmakers that it would voluntarily self-regulate and eventually decrease its use of pollutants if legislation was not enacted forcing them to do so.

The semiconductor industry stands staunchly opposed to any further restrictions on PFAS use, with the PFAS Consortium's 2023 paper containing the quote, ""it is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible in some instances, to find viable alternatives [to PFASs] without stepping back decades in technological advancement.""

This stance has been defended even in the face of breakthrough findings that disprove it. The Consortium recently argued against a widespread study proposing safer and effective alternatives to PFAS use in chipmaking. While the study identifies multiple surfactants that are both superior in quality and lower in toxicity than PFASs in etching wafers, surfactants which are now used instead of PFAS by some smaller fabs, the Consortium quickly published its own negative response to the study, only accessible by approved members of certain companies.

How the semiconductor industry responds to the recent breakthrough study on PFAS filtration remains to be seen. Data taken in 2022 from an unnamed chip fab found 78,000 parts per trillion of PFAS in the fab's wastewater, worlds higher than the EPA limit of 4 ppt, proving that Monash University's new water filtration would directly positively impact the local ecosystems around high-PFAS-use chip fabs. It is nice to hope that fabs across the industry will voluntarily use the new filters for the well-being of their communities, but the semiconductor industry's track record shows this will likely not be the case.

Killing two birds with one stone.

Amid a fierce trade war with the US, China's General Administration of Customs has changed its rules of how the origin of imported chips must be classified, now deeming that the wafer fabrication location should be counted as the origin of chips shipped to the country. This rule exempts products from AMD, Nvidia, Qualcomm, Intel, and other chipmakers who outsource wafer fabrication to Taiwanese companies from the punitive 125% tariff China now imposes on products from the U.S. However, this badly hurts Intel, Global Foundries, Texas Instruments, and chip designers who produce chips in America. 

Today, the China Semiconductor Industry Association published an urgent notice regarding the rules for determining the 'country of origin' of semiconductor products shipped to China. As it turns out, the location where the wafer was processed is deemed the 'country of origin,' no matter where the chip was developed or packaged, according to a CSIA document published in WeChat and republished by various analysts. The rule applies to both packaged and unpackaged semiconductors. 

Because China deems Taiwan its own territory, chips fabricated by TSMC, Micron, UMC, Vanguard, and other chipmakers in Taiwan will be exempt from punitive 125% import duties imposed on products from then U.S. even though virtually all contemporary chips from companies like AMD, Broadcom, Intel, Nvidia, Micron, and Qualcomm are developed in America and are sold by U.S.-based company. 

By applying this rule, the Chinese government kills two birds with one stone. 

On the one hand, it allows chipmakers to ship their products to China without any restrictions or punitive tariffs, which enables China-based fabs to continue making actual products based on those chips, thus keeping Chinese facilities busy. As an added bonus, China shows American companies that it considers Taiwan its own territory and actually means it by not imposing any punitive import duties. 

On the other hand, it punishes American chipmakers and chip designers that produce their ICs in the U.S., which includes companies that outsource to GlobalFoundries' Fab 8 in New York as well as Texas Instruments, which builds its chips in Texas. 

As an added bonus, the Chinese government helps TSMC, UMC, Vanguard, and China-based foundries to potentially land new customers. This has implications, too. Many products made in China use chips from American companies produced in America by companies like Analog Devices, GlobalFoundries, NXP, or ON Semiconductor, or fabbed by contract chipmakers in the U.S., such as Intel or GlobalFoundries. Consequently, companies that use chips from the U.S. will now have to find alternatives, which takes time and costs money. For some, this may be the end of the line.

One thing to note is the stark contrast between how Chinese customs treat semiconductor products and how American customs treat chips in terms of 'country of origin.' The U.S. determines the 'country of origin' by the location of the last substantial transformation, where the product undergoes a major change. For example, a memory IC developed in the U.S., fabbed in Japan, but packaged in China is considered a Chinese product subject to punitive tariffs, according to the current laws. The same applies to logic chips designed in the USA but fabbed in Taiwan and packaged in China by subsidiaries of Taiwanese OSAT giants. By contrast, China's customs determine the 'country of origin' by the location of the actual wafer fabrication facility.

A bit overkill for a rumored 180W graphics card


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Nvidia is preparing to launch the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti to compete with AMD and the best graphics cards on the market. Meanwhile, VideoCardz has leaked various custom models from MSI, displaying the use of a 16-pin (12VHPWR) power connector.

The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti is a forthcoming midrange gaming GPU from Nvidia, expected to have a 180W TDP. A single 8-pin PCIe power connector, capable of providing up to 150W, is more than adequate for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti since it can draw an additional 75W from the PCIe slot, resulting in a combined total of 225W. It's impossible to tell from the leaked renders if MSI utilizes the original 12VHPWR or the revised 12V-2x6 connector, but it should be the latter.

Utilizing a 16-pin power connector on a GeForce RTX 5060 Ti seems unnecessary, as the Blackwell-powered graphics card doesn't even use a third of the power connector's capacity. While some might suggest that MSI opted for the 16-pin connector for better cable organization, the visual distinction between a standard 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 16-pin one is minimal since both configurations ultimately require a single power cable.

At any rate, consumers shouldn't have to worry about the probability of the 16-pin power connector melting since a GeForce RTX 5060 Ti pulls nowhere near the same amount of power as a GeForce RTX 5090 or GeForce RTX 4090.

We can only speculate why MSI used a 16-pin power connector on a 180W graphics card. It's plausible that the company is recycling a previous PCB design for the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, which would explain the presence of a 16-pin power connector. Alternatively, the custom model from MSI may feature an exceptionally high factory overclock that justifies the 16-pin power connector.

MSI seem to have four custom GeForce RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards ready for the market. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming Trio, available in black or white, is the flagship model with a triple-fan cooling system, while the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Gaming leverages a dual-fan cooler. The trio of SKUs employs the 16-pin power connector. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Inspire 2X appears to be the only SKU with the 8-pin PCIe power connector.

Nvidia's mainstream Blackwell graphics cards offer PCIe 5.0 support, though this interface is overkill for gaming purposes. The GeForce RTX 5060 Ti will also support PCIe 5.0, but with a twist. The MSI renders indicate that the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti, which reportedly utilizes the GB206 silicon, features a PCIe 5.0 x8 connection to communicate with the motherboard.

It doesn't come as a shock that Nvidia's x060-class graphics cards, such as the GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti, along with AMD's Radeon RX x600 models like the Radeon RX 6600 or Radeon RX 7600, came with an x8 electrical PCIe interface. Graphics cards in this tier are typically not fast enough to merit an x16 connection, and an x8 connection somewhat helps reduce manufacturing cost.

While the 16-pin power connector has proven problematic, it's here to stay. Currently AMD continues to cling to the 8-pin PCIe power connectors for its current RDNA 4 graphics cards, at least one manufacturer, Sapphire, has put a 16-pin power connector on a Radeon RX 9070 XT. Some high-end power supplies have already started to decrease the number of 8-pin PCIe power cables in favor of the 16-pin.

A loophole enables the generators to be used for 364 days without a permit


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Last year it turned out that Elon Musk's xAI had to install additional ‘portable' generators near its facility adjacent to Memphis, Tennessee, to power the Colossus supercomputer with over 100,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs as local power grid could not support the load. The Southern Environmental Law Center contends the generators are ""illegal,"" yet they can keep running, reports The Guardian.

xAI's Colossus supercomputer consumes about 150 MW of power when equipped with 100,000 H100 GPUs. More when it is upgraded to 200,000 processors. However, last July the site near Memphis, Tennessee, could only provide 8 MW of power to the facility, so Musk's company had to install gas fueled turbines to power the colossal supercomputer.

However, the company had only sought permits for 15 units, but aerial images now show double that number in operation. Apparently, 20 gas generators are now running without the required approvals, raising alarm from environmental groups and nearby residents, according to The Guardian who refer to KeShaun Pearson, director of the advocacy group Memphis Community Against Pollution. Pearson stated to the Shelby count board of commissioners (Memphis, Tennessee) that xAI is using 35 methane gas burning turbines while only having a permit for 15.

The company seems to be using a legal loophole that allows turbines to run without permits if they are not fixed in one location for more than 364 days. In January, xAI filed for approval of 15 turbines, but the other 20 were not included and still have no legal clearance. However, they can keep running for months before xAI gets formal approval, if local authorities actually approve them.

The Southern Environmental Law Center revealed images and calculations showing that the turbines can produce 420 MW, an amount sufficient to power a city. According to senior attorney Amanda Garcia, xAI has essentially created an unregulated power facility in a residential area, posing significant health and environmental risks.

The law center stated in a letter that these generators are a major pollution source and breach federal air quality rules, including emissions of hazardous and cancer-causing substances. They demanded that the local health agency issue an emergency halt to the operations and fine the company $25,000 for every day it continues to run them without proper authorization.

A company representative scheduled to address the county board did not attend the meeting, according to The Guardian.

IPO is Intel's way of balancing manual overclocking and reference settings with warranty protection.

Arrow Lake might have some fuel left in the tank, as Intel's latest IPO (Intel Performance Optimizations) tech is reportedly hitting pre-builts in China, per UNIKO's Hardware at X.

Intel recently unveiled the IPO program in China. It is supposedly a suite of tuned settings or profiles that balance overclocking and stock settings. It is important to note that Intel has not detailed or announced an IPO for the global market. In addition, for the time being, it appears these profiles are aimed at system integrators and OEMs, not individual customers.

Enthusiast and gamers can use many techniques to get the most out of their CPU. This includes manual CPU overclocking when you exceed your CPU's rated specifications, followed by XMP/EXPO for RAM. AMD offers a PBO that auto-tunes your CPU to extract maximum performance with minimal manual intervention. The catch is that all these utilities can technically void your warranty if things go south.

IPO is designed to serve as a middle ground between stock profiles and overclocking, with proper warranty coverage. These profiles promise a stable experience, eliminating the need for constant adjustments and the fear of crashing as seen with manual overclocking. IPO targets the CPU (P-cores, E-cores, Ring-bus, NGU, D2D interconnects, PL1 and PL2) and the RAM (Transfer speeds and timings).

intel ipo (intel performance optimization) pc is now available on the china market with specific sellers like 攀升.ipo means overclocking cpu+dram, from frequencies and timings to power limits.ipo warranty is said to be provided by the seller, stability is covered.btw, even… pic.twitter.com/DXSXlFPszQApril 10, 2025

In an example profile shared by UNIKO's Hardware, a pre-built from Maxsun with IPO lands a sweet 200 MHz uplift in core clock speeds while pushing RAM speeds to DDR5-8400 from DDR5-8000, resulting in a purported 10% FPS increase (on the pre-built's marketing material).

That's not all. Another leaker claims that Intel will offer ""opt-in"" BIOS presets to its Arrow Lake chips in the future, a premise similar to IPO. Maybe IPO serves as a pilot program for this feature. The exact specifics have not been detailed. This might make Arrow Lake a compelling choice against Ryzen offerings, particularly for system integrators.

Despite the substantial buildup to Arrow Lake, performance on launch day was subpar, with these chips failing to beat even their last-generation counterparts in some scenarios. Arrow Lake's MCM (Multi Chip Module) design eats away a chunk of the performance, with the memory controller designated to a separate tile, incurring unwanted latency penalties. Another aspect was the slower ring-bus clock speeds, almost 20% slower than Raptor Lake.

Additional firmware/software-related issues pushed Intel to release several fixes by December. The final update, microcode version 0x114 and CSME firmware kit 19.0.0.1854v2.2, launched in January, but our testing proved contrary to Intel's claimed performance improvements. IPO is Intel's latest attempt to wring every last bit of performance from Arrow Lake, but we are still light on details regarding availability.

Well, if it ever reaches commercial phase.

A startup called Maxwell Labs, with support from Sandia National Laboratories, is working on a new technology that will cool high-performance computing hardware with lasers, reports The Register.

As heat dissipation has become a major challenge for modern data centers, various cooling methods have been tried and deployed in recent years. For years, the industry has relied on air cooling; then, big companies began to experiment with liquid cooling, tried both warm water cooling and chilled water cooling, tested immersion cooling, and even planned to deploy it in the coming years. There is one thing that has not been used for cooling yet: lasers. Yet, lasers can be used to take away heat from processors. But there is a catch.

A startup called Maxwell Labs, with support from Sandia National Laboratories, is working on a new way to cool high-performance computing hardware, reports The Register. The technique uses special cold plates made of ultrapure gallium arsenide (GaAs) that cool down when they receive focused beams of coherent laser light of a certain wavelength. Rather than heating, which is common in most interactions involving intense light beams, this carefully engineered setup allows the semiconductor to shed heat at precise locations thanks to the high electron mobility of GaAs. The method promises to assist traditional cooling systems rather than replace them.

To implement this in practical applications, the GaAs semiconductors are structured into thin components placed directly on high-heat regions of processors. Microscopic patterns within the semiconductor guide the coherent beams precisely to these hot spots, resulting in highly localized cooling, which ensures efficiency by directly managing heat exactly where it becomes problematic instead of attempting to use GaAs and lasers to cool down an entire system. This technique has roots in earlier studies: back in 2012, at the University of Copenhagen, they cooled a tiny membrane to -269°C using a similar method, according to the report.

Additionally, this technique offers a unique capability: it can recapture the energy removed as heat, according to Maxwell. Rather than dissipating into the environment, the thermal energy extracted from chips can be emitted as usable photons, which are convertible back into electrical power. While this certainly increases the overall energy efficiency of computing systems, the efficiency of the process remains to be seen.

While the approach to use GaAs semiconductors for cooling is certainly an innovation, it is associated with extreme challenges both from the cost and manufacturability points of view.

First up, producing ultrapure GaAs wafers requires complex, energy-intensive techniques like molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) or metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). As we are dealing with ultrapure crystalline layers, defect rates can be high, which affects costs. At the moment, a 200-mm wafer made from GaAs can cost around $5,000, while a silicon wafer of the same size might be priced as low as $5, according to WaferWorld.

GaAs transistors cannot be seamlessly integrated into traditional silicon-based chips on a single wafer. However, if someone wants to use GaAs transistors for cooling traditional chips (or rather chiplets), they can use heterogeneous 3D integration or wafer bonding, which are well-known techniques for systems that use silicon photonics. While these techniques are quite expensive, they are not as costly as GaAs wafers per se.

Currently, the concept remains in the experimental and modeling stage. According to Maxwell Labs chief executive Jacob Balma, simulations suggest the method is promising, but it has never been confirmed in physical trials as testing so far has been limited to separate components rather than a full setup.

Speaking of a full setup, Maxwell Labs expects to complete a functioning prototype by the fall of 2025. Interestingly, Maxwell has already found early adopters for its first version, named MXL-Gen1, and plans to deliver initial systems over the next two years. Broader access is projected for the end of 2027, assuming development stays on track.

 April 11, 2025  

Malnutrition-related diabetes, distinct from both type 1 and type 2, has now been officially recognized and named “type 5 diabetes.”

The vote to endorse the category took place on April 8, during the International Diabetes Federation's (IDF's) World Diabetes Congress, held in Bangkok, Thailand. In January 2025, a panel met in India to draft a consensus statement about the condition, due to be published soon, Meredith Hawkins, MD, professor of medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, told Medscape Medical News.

“Malnutrition-related diabetes has historically been vastly underdiagnosed and poorly understood…The IDF's recognition of it as ‘type 5 diabetes' is an important step toward raising awareness of a health problem that is so devastating to so many people,” Hawkins said.

(According to the American Diabetes Association, “type 3” diabetes indicates specific types due to other causes such as single genes, exocrine pancreatic diseases such as cystic fibrosis, or drug/chemical-induced diabetes. “Type 4” is gestational diabetes.)

Malnutrition-related diabetes was first described in Jamaica in 1955. It is seen most commonly in young men in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) who have a body mass index < 19. They are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabetes, but they don't develop ketonuria or ketosis despite high blood glucose levels and high insulin requirements.

In 1985, the World Health Organization officially classified “malnutrition-related diabetes mellitus” as a distinct diabetes type, but then in 1999 dropped the category, citing a lack of evidence that malnutrition or protein deficiency causes diabetes.

Hawkins became aware of malnutrition-related diabetes in 2005 while teaching at global health meetings. In 2010, she founded Einstein's Global Diabetes Institute to study it. In 2022, she and her colleagues published findings from state-of-the-art metabolic testing in 73 Asian Indian men, including 20 with what is now called “type 5 diabetes” following exclusion of all other known forms of diabetes by immunogenetic analysis. Another 15 had type 1 diabetes, 13 had type 2 diabetes, 16 were lean without diabetes, and 9 were overweight without diabetes.

Among the findings were lower total insulin secretion in the “type 5” group than in both the lean group without diabetes and the T2D group, significantly lower endogenous glucose production and significantly higher glucose uptake in the type 5 group than in the T2D group, and significantly lower visceral adipose tissue and hepatocellular lipids in the type 5 group than in the T2D group.

These findings contradict the previous belief that malnutrition-associated diabetes was associated primarily with insulin resistance. “It turns out people with this form of diabetes have a profound defect in the capacity to secrete insulin, which wasn't recognized before. This finding has revolutionized how we think about this condition and how we should treat it,” Hawkins said.

She told Medscape Medical News it's important to differentiate type 5 from type 1 diabetes because giving too much insulin can rapidly prove fatal. While there aren't clear guidelines yet for treating type 5, some data suggest that very small amounts of insulin combined with oral agents may be the most effective.

And, she added, “I suspect that their nutrition should include much higher amounts of protein and lower amounts of carbohydrates, plus attention to deficient micronutrients…but this needs to be carefully studied now that there is global will and an official mandate from [the International Diabetes Federation] to do so.”

Hawkins lectures on this topic often at universities in LMICs. “They frequently ask, ‘Why is it we see so much of it and yet never read about it in textbooks?' Turns out those textbooks are written in the West, where it is not encountered. This will change soon…I'm excited that the tide is turning on a condition that is so prevalent among the world's poor yet so neglected in Western literature.”

A working group has been tasked with developing formal diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for type 5 over the next 2 years.

Hawkins had no disclosures.

Regular use of glucosamine, a widely used supplement to manage osteoarthritis and joint pain, was linked to reduced risks for both composite microvascular complications and diabetic nephropathy among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

“Integrating glucosamine into patient care may help reduce the risk of microvascular complications, thereby improving overall health outcomes,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Zi-Jian Cheng, Center for Genetic Epidemiology and Genomics, School of Public Health, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Preventive and Translational Medicine for Major Chronic Non-communicable Diseases, MOE Key Laboratory of Geriatric Diseases and Immunology, Suzhou Medical College of Soochow University, Suzhou, China. It was published online on April 01, 2025, in Nutrition & Diabetes.

The UK Biobank did not collect detailed information on glucosamine use, such as the dose and duration of use or data on the side effects of glucosamine consumption. Cases of diabetic nephropathy, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy were identified from hospital records and national death registries, which may have missed some patients with microvascular complications. Furthermore, distinguishing the effects of a healthy lifestyle from those of regular supplement use was difficult due to the observational nature of this study.

This study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China, Science and Technology Project of Suzhou, and Interdisciplinary Basic Frontier Innovation Program of Suzhou Medical College of Soochow University. The authors reported having no relevant conflicts of interest.

 April 11, 2025  

Newly released regulations governing Medicare Advantage (MA) and Part D next year are a mixed bag for physicians.

The rules for 2026 will provide some relief on the prior authorization (PA) front, but they'll also aggravate clinicians champing for reimbursement relief as insurers get a huge financial boost.

In addition, the Trump administration decided to punt — for now — instead of address the hot topics of coverage for glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist weight-loss drugs and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in PA decision-making.

Earlier this month, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) issued the final 2026 rule regarding the MA health plan, which serves more than half the Medicare population, or about 33 million people, and the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program, known as Part D.

The CMS also updated reimbursement rates for health plans.

Here are four things physicians should know about the new regulations.

Christine M. Clements, JD, a partner and managed care law specialist with the Sheppard Mullin firm in Washington, DC, told Medscape Medical News that “there's nothing drastic or surprising in this rule.”

In fact, she said, “the Trump administration is a fan of Medicare Advantage.”

Both Robert F. Kennedy, Jr, secretary of Health & Human Services, and Mehmet Oz, MD, MBA, administrator of the CMS, have supported the program, she noted. “To some extent, I think the final rule reflects that.”

Health plans won't be able to withdraw PA for inpatient care except in cases of “obvious error or fraud.” According to the CMS, “the goal of this provision is to ensure that if a plan approves an inpatient admission, it will have to honor the prior authorization.”

Clements said this means “plans cannot use additional clinical information that might be available after they make their decision to reopen a coverage decision” unless there's fraud or an error such as a provider mistakenly saying that a patient had pain in their chest when it was actually their leg.

“That should be welcome news for providers who have expressed concern about the potential for coverage decisions to be reversed after the fact,” Clements said. Her firm represents both payers and providers.

The American Medical Association (AMA) has alleged that insurers “decide to back out of paying or try to recoup payment already made” after care has been provided. “Insurers will frequently cite vague reasons such as overpayment on their part, a redetermination that approved care was not medically necessary, or incomplete paperwork,” the AMA said in a 2024 post on its website.

Jeffrey Davis, MS, health policy director with McDermott+, a health policy organization in Washington, DC, told Medscape Medical News that the Trump administration is likely to address PA again, especially in light of comments by from Oz about limiting its use, he said.

“This isn't the only bite at the apple. They're going to have other opportunities to go forward,” Davis said, although there's little time left to make major changes for 2026.

McDermott+ represents a variety of health-related clients, including medical associations and hospital systems.

The CMS announced that MA plans will get more reimbursement in 2026. KFF, a nonprofit health policy organization, estimates that plans will get 7.2% more in payments than this year's — about $35 billion in total.

KFF noted that the boost “comes at a time of increasing scrutiny over Medicare Advantage payments, and government spending generally. In particular, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission estimates that the federal government pays Medicare Advantage plans 20% more per person than it spends on similar people in traditional Medicare, at a cost of $84 billion in 2025.”

Clements agreed that physicians are frustrated by the increase in payments to insurers in light of their long struggle to increase their own Medicare reimbursements. “They're not happy that the plans got it, but they didn't.”

However, Clements noted some physicians get reimbursed with a percentage of the MA premiums that patients pay. “This would be very beneficial to them.”

The CMS delayed decisions on whether MA should cover GLP-1 agonist weight-loss drugs and whether there should be rules regarding the use of AI in PA decisions.

Kennedy did tell CBS News that “he's considering a proposal for Medicaid and Medicare to cover the drug once patients have established they've exhausted other options.”

As for the use of AI in PA, Lynn Nonnemaker, PhD, a senior director with McDermott+, said the CMS didn't give any hints about the direction they may go. “They seem to be saying that while they are not doing rulemaking on AI now, they are actively thinking about it for the future.”

Artificial intelligence (AI) accurately detected paediatric fractures and modestly improved the diagnostic accuracy of inexperienced physicians in the emergency department (ED), a study found; however, cost-benefit considerations were recommended.

""The AI software showed good stand-alone performance in a paediatric real-life cohort. In our university hospital setting of a tertiary centre, inexperienced residents benefit in a limited proportion of cases. This benefit must be weighed against the economic cost,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Maria Ziegner, University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany, and Johanna Pape, Institute for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology, Leipzig University, Leipzig, Germany. It was published online on April 07, 2025, in European Radiology.

This study was limited by its retrospective and single-centre design. Software updates between study initiation and publication may have affected the results. The real-life design, in which the diagnosis was established first without AI and immediately followed by AI assistance, may have made readers being less willing to change their initial diagnosis. Additionally, the expert consensus used as ground truth may not have been perfect, despite being standard practice.

This study received open access funding that was enabled and organised by Projekt DEAL. The AI tool described in this study was provided free of charge to the authors by ImageBiopsy Lab. The authors declared having no relationships with any sources.

 April 11, 2025  

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has recommended a new twice-daily tablet for some patients in England with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer. 

Capivasertib (Truqap, AstraZeneca), taken with fulvestrant, is a first-in-class kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking the action of specific biomarkers in patients with oestrogen receptor–positive breast cancer.

In its final draft guidance, NICE cited results from the phase 3 CAPItello-291 trial. The study showed that capivasertib plus fulvestrant extended progression-free survival to 7.3 months, compared with 3.1 months for patients on placebo plus fulvestrant.

The drug was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in July 2024. 

The drug received European approval in summer 2024.

According to 2020 figures from NICE, 14.8% of the 40,192 people diagnosed with breast cancer in England had advanced-stage disease.

Hormone receptor (HR)–positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative advanced breast cancer is incurable. Treatment aims to delay disease progression and extend survival. 

Outcomes are poorer in the 40%-50% of people with gene alterations such as PIK3CA, AKT1, or PTEN. These patients often experience recurrence despite endocrine therapy.

Currently, NICE recommends alpelisib plus fulvestrant for PIK3CA-altered disease, or exemestane plus everolimus for others. 

Although capivasertib plus fulvestrant has not been directly compared with these options, NICE said that indirect comparisons suggest it performs similarly. 

NICE applied a severity modifier, which allows a higher cost-effectiveness threshold for conditions with significant impact on quality and length of life. With a severity modifier of 1.2 applied, the combination therapy was found to be an acceptable use of NHS resources. Around 1100 patients in England are expected to benefit from the decision.

Capivasertib is priced at £5850 per 64-pack of 200 mg tablets. Fulvestrant costs £55.32 for two 250-mg prefilled syringes. The list price for 12 months of combination treatment is £77,088. 

However, NICE's approval is conditional on a confidential discount from AstraZeneca. The treatment will be funded immediately through the Cancer Drugs Fund.

Helen Knight, director of medicines evaluation at NICE, said the committee had heard from patients who described the devastating impact of advanced breast cancer. She noted the value of a well-tolerated treatment that targets AKT1 or PTEN gene alterations for which no therapies have been available.

“People with advanced breast cancer would value treatments like capivasertib that can be given when limited options exist, and because it may delay the need for chemotherapy and its associated side-effects,” Knight said in a press release.

Nicholas Turner, professor of molecular oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and consultant oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London, led the CAPItello-291 trial

Commenting in a press release, the ICR, which was involved in the drug development research for capivasertib, said it “strongly welcomed” the decision.

Nicholas Turner, professor of molecular oncology at the ICR and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, led the phase 3 CAPItello-291 trial. He said NICE's approval was “immensely rewarding” and urged clinicians to test for the relevant biomarkers.

“It is now crucial that advanced breast cancer patients have their cancer tested to identify those who could benefit from this capivasertib combination,” he said in a press release.

Claire Rowney, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, welcomed the decision but said, “We shouldn't overlook the fact that its initial provisional rejection meant patients have faced unnecessary delays in accessing it.”

Rowney also urged the Scottish Medicines Consortium to consider the treatment “at pace.”

NICE's final guidance is expected to be published on 15 May 2025.

The CAPItello-291 trial was sponsored and funded by AstraZeneca.

In a 52-week trial among adults with treatment-resistant depression, quetiapine augmentation was more effective than lithium augmentation in reducing symptoms, offered greater cost-effectiveness, and showed comparable safety.

""Compared with lithium, quetiapine might be a more appropriate first-line augmentation for many people with treatment-resistant depression. Future research should investigate predictors of treatment response and discontinuation,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Anthony J. Cleare, PhD, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, London, England. It was published online in the April 2025 issue of The Lancet Psychiatry.

Substantial missing data for some secondary outcome measures and slightly more missing data in the lithium group at weeks 26 and 52 may have introduced a detection bias. The reduced representation of non-White ethnic groups in the study sample and a chance imbalance in sex and employment between the two groups may have affected the outcomes.

This trial was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Health Technology Assessment programme. Several authors reported having various ties with pharmaceutical companies and research organisations. Details are provided in the original article.

An autonomous total body photographic (TBP) and dermoscopic imaging device achieved comparable image quality and faster acquisition times than manual dermoscopy, in a prospective cohort study.

“These findings suggest that this autonomous device may have potential value in improving workflow efficiency, especially in high-volume settings,” the authors wrote, adding that the device's ability “to deliver high-quality images swiftly could enhance the diagnostic process, making it a valuable tool for dermatologists in both routine and complex cases.”

The study was led by Pau Rosés Gibert, MD, Dermatology Department, Hospital Clínic Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, and was published online on April 9 in JAMA Dermatology.

The study had a limited sample size and did not include patients with certain skin types or conditions, which could affect the generalizability of the findings.

A multicenter prospective study validated that an electronic nose (eNose) can accurately detect lung cancer in individuals with suspected disease. In the validation cohort, a new eNose model achieved a sensitivity of 94% (true positives) and specificity of 63% (true negatives) for detecting lung cancer.

This “multicenter prospective external validation study confirms that eNose analysis of exhaled breath enables reliable, noninvasive, point-of-care detection of lung cancer in individuals suspected of having lung cancer,” the authors wrote. “Results suggest that implementation of eNose analysis could avoid performing unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures in approximately 75% of individuals with a benign diagnosis, at a 5%-6% risk of withholding a lung cancer diagnosis at thoracic oncology outpatient clinics.”

This study, led by Alessandra I.G. Buma, MD, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands, was published online in the Annals of Oncology.

Diagnostic subgroup classification relied partly on radiologic and expert judgment, which could have led to misclassification. In addition, the new eNose model was only internally validated.

 April 11, 2025  

Chronic lower respiratory diseases, namely, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States. A contributing factor is diagnostic errors, which can lead to delayed or ineffective treatments and mismanagement.

Telling the difference between these two conditions can be difficult. Not only do they affect broad, diverse populations but also overlapping symptoms and clinical features coupled with a lack of validated screening tools can make diagnosis difficult.

How then, are primary care doctors able to effectively distinguish asthma and COPD, especially given their complexity? 

“Asthma and COPD are conditions that present often with very similar symptoms and patients can have them together; they're both diseases that affect the airways and cause similar patterns on pulmonary function testing,” said Joseph Skalski, MD, head of the asthma section and an assistant professor of medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “It often comes down to a patient's clinical history to distinguish the two. But to know what to look at, you need to understand these diseases.” 

Many pulmonologists acknowledge the “messiness” of these conditions. Not only can they occur together in the same patient but also “there are many different subtypes in which they show up for patients,” said David Beuther, MD, PhD, professor of medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine at National Jewish Health in Denver.

“There's never going to be a ‘one size fits all,” said Panagis Galiatsatos, MD, associate professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore.

There are, however, certain distinguishing features that can help clinicians develop a more refined idea, said Beuther. For example, asthma is typically best characterized by its variability and COPD by fixed symptoms.

Where to start? A comprehensive medical history is essential.

Galiatsatos recommended that primary care physicians take a “time travel” with patients to gain important diagnostic clues.

“Were they premature? Did they have any childhood infections that sent them to the hospital? Were they able to keep up with their peers in sports or during recess?” he said. With female patients, he would try to learn if, during pregnancy, they had experienced any breathing issues, which might point to asthma.

“Then we get into adulthood. I ask patients to tell me when they're breathless, ie, if it's when they are on flat surfaces (more indicative of conditioning) or when they are climbing stairs (which might indicate that they're being robbed of blood flow, and more likely have COPD),he said. Family history is also important.” 

One of the most helpful differences is if the patient has good and bad days (asthma), or constantly live with bad and worse days (COPD), said Galiatsatos, also noting the benefit of the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale, which can help classify dyspnea severity in respiratory diseases, especially COPD. Roughly 75% of patients with COPD have also been shown to experience moderate to high chronic cough and/or sputum production.

“The big thing with COPD is the exposure to something that can injure the lungs,” said Mark Yoder, MD, associate professor of medicine, Department of Internal Medicine at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. “In the United States, that is largely going to be tobacco smoke and certainly, other exposures — mostly occupational — for example, in Chicago where there are large hangers of buses that are warmed up indoors, a bus driver is going to be exposed to high concentrations of diesel fumes.”

Additional occupationally-related exposures include chemicals and fumes that could affect house cleaners, military veterans, firefighters, and others.

Another important consideration is age.

“Almost uniformly, COPD is going to be a disease of patients who are 40 years or older, with the exception of some genetic conditions or maybe some very severe exposures,” said Skalski. “A younger patient with obstruction is likely to have asthma and an older patient with obstruction, COPD. But you can't distinguish based on age alone,” he emphasized, which is where spirometry can help.

On the other hand, for asthma, “you want to look for clues that support the diagnosis, for example, dermatitis, allergic nose and sinus disease, childhood history, etc.,” said Skalski. “About 60% of cases are going to be eosinophilic asthma, which can be confirmed by laboratory testing for elevated peripheral eosinophil count.”

Data suggest that a medical history that focuses on specific factors such as smoking history, certain respiratory symptoms, and the presence/absence of allergies is a reliable strategy for differentiating asthma and COPD. However, for accuracy, a post bronchodilator spirometry should be conducted.

American Thoracic Guidelines define suspected asthma as a post bronchodilator increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) > 12% and 200 mL volume, which is consistent with airflow limitation. In COPD, the fixed FEV1/forced vital capacity ratio is low (< 70%) and remains persistently so.

“Spirometry can be done by anybody trained to do it,” said Yoder, “but there are rules that need to be followed to ensure that it's high quality. And there are definitions of what obstruction is (as well as ways to interpret results) depending on the disease process that you're talking about.”

“If you have the capability to conduct high quality spirometry where patients perform with maximal effort then go for it,” advised Skalski. Without those criteria, the test is more likely to underestimate a patient's lung function and sometimes, falsely diagnose COPD or asthma where there is none, he said.

“Several times a week, I will see a patient who had spirometry done locally that showed falsely low values because the test wasn't performed at maximal effort.”

Instead, it might be easier to send staff to training courses or refer patients to local pulmonary function labs for testing, although, depending on where you are, facilities might be limited in number.

“If there is one point to get out to a primary care audience, it's that you should never diagnose a patient with COPD (or asthma) without spirometry,” said Skalski. “Other tests, including a chest x-ray, labs, and local eosinophilia can be helpful adjuncts. Just be careful to have a clear diagnosis before starting treatment; inhalers are not benign.”

Skalski, Beuther, Galiatsatos, and Yoder reported no relevant financial relationships.

 April 11, 2025  

At least two recent studies have found bariatric surgery more cost-effective, long term, than the pricey glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist obesity medications. Another recent study concluded that two leading GLP-1s are not cost-effective at current prices.

It begs the question: Should physicians suggest bariatric surgery for more of their patients with obesity?

Yes, obesity medicine experts told Medscape Medical News.

“I do think bariatric surgery is definitely underutilized, and primary care and other physicians should be thinking more often about referring their patients,” said Ryan Macht, MD, MS, an obesity medicine physician and bariatric surgeon in Belmont, California. Macht, who is also a member of the Bariatric Medical-Surgical Committee, Obesity Medicine Association, Centennial, Colorado, treats patients with both bariatric surgery and anti-obesity medications.

Despite bariatric surgery's long track record, and the variety of surgical options, only about 1% of patients eligible for bariatric surgery actually get it, according to estimates by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS). The organization said there is an overall risk for major complications of about 4% and the risk for death at about 0.1%.

Physicians should be suggesting more patients consider bariatric surgery, but not to the exclusion of medication, Macht and others said. For some, combining medication and surgery may produce the best results. For instance, one study found that preoperative use of GLP-1s may reduce complications after bariatric surgery in those with extreme obesity.

In the analysis presented at the American College of Surgeons meeting in October, researchers compared the cost-effectiveness of GLP-1 medications with that of bariatric surgery. They took into account costs of the medications and the surgery and evaluated how many healthy years of life a patient could gain from the treatments, using modeling.

“Bariatric surgery and most important bariatric surgery with these medications is much more cost-effective than just taking these medications alone,” said Anne Stey, MD, assistant professor of surgery at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago and the senior author on the study.

“Bariatric surgery alone had a cost of $21,539 [on average], and 1 year of GLP-1 use was $11,935,” she said.

The medication costs would have to decline by 70% or 75%, Stey's team found, for the cost-effectiveness to even out with surgery.

In another study, Florida researchers compared the costs between GLP-1 medications and bariatric surgery to find a break-even point. They looked at average 2023 national retail prices for GLP-1s and surgical cost estimates from 2015 adjusted for inflation.

Conclusions: “…for some GLP-1s like Saxenda and Wegovy, the high cost of ongoing use surpasses the cost of RYGB [Roux-en-Y or gastric bypass] in less than a year and sleeve gastrectomy within 9 months.”

The most affordable option studied, Byetta, becomes more costly than surgery after about 1.5 years.

University of Chicago researchers conducted a lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis using the validated Diabetes, Obesity, Cardiovascular Disease Microsimulation model for US adults. The model projected long-term cardiometabolic outcome, the amount of additional healthy years, and healthcare expenditures with the use of four anti-obesity medications, including two of the new GLP-1s, semaglutide and tirzepatide. They compared the use of the GLP-1s and lifestyle modification with that of lifestyle modification alone.

The newer GLP-1s offered long-term health benefits but weren't cost-effective at current prices, the researchers said.

In 2022, 279,967 bariatric surgeries were performed in the United States, up from 262,893 in 2021, according to the ASMBS, with sleeve gastrectomy and RYGB being the most popular ones.

Estimates of weight loss with surgery vary. Patients may lose as much as 60% of excess weight after 6 months, according to ASMBS, and 77% in as early as 12 months.

Others cite different estimates. Surgery patients can expect to lose 20%-50% of their excess weight, according to Catherine (Cate) Varney, DO, obesity medicine director for University of Virginia Health, Charlottesville, Virginia, and a primary care and obesity medicine doctor at its comprehensive bariatric surgery center.

In comparison, she tells patients, weight loss using diet and lifestyle averages 5%-10%, and up to 20% for obesity medicines.

Tracking bariatric surgery patients long term to assess success is difficult for researchers, said Ann M. Rogers, MD, director of the Surgical Weight Loss Program, Penn State Health, and president of the ASMBS, because so many patients are lost to follow-up. She contends that's because many who do well don't keep in contact with their doctors.

She cited a study done in 2016, when researchers compared the outcomes of 151 patients with consistent 10-year follow-up with those of 500 patients who submitted data for the study. Researchers found no difference in weight-loss outcomes between the groups, with the research refuting claims that those lost to follow-up gain back the weight.

“A lot of commercial insurance companies do cover bariatric surgery,” Rogers said, but often requires patients first to spend 6-12 months in a lifestyle weight-loss program. She sees a trend to major insurers becoming more stringent with this requirement.

While weight loss with the GLP-1s varies person to person and with different medications, the SURMOUNT-5 phase 3b, open-label, randomized clinical trial found tirzepatide (Zepbound) produces a loss of 20.25% vs 13.7% with semaglutide (Wegovy).

Yet discontinuation rates are high, with users citing costs and side effects. In a retrospective cohort study of 125,474 adults with overweight or obesity who started a GLP-1 (liraglutide, semaglutide, or tirzepatide) between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2023, most discontinued the medication within a year. Those without type 2 diabetes, taking the medication for overweight or obesity, were more likely to stop the medication and less likely to restart it.

In 2024, just 18% of large firms offering health benefits covered GLP-1s for obesity, which can cost $1000 per month out of pocket without coverage. And on April 7, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services announced it would not be moving forward with a proposal suggested under the Biden administration to cover the medications under its Part D drug program.

The topic of bariatric surgery does come up in visits, primary care and obesity medicine physicians said. “Most of the patients who seek my care have considered bariatric surgery but want to see if medical weight loss in an option first,” said Sarah Stombaugh, MD, a family medicine and obesity medicine physician in Charlottesville, Virginia.

“As we've seen the effectiveness of weight-loss medications improve, there are many patients who may think ‘Let me try medications first, and if that doesn't work, then I'll consider surgery.'”

“While the complication rates from bariatric surgery have improved significantly over the past few decades, it is still a major surgery,” Stombaugh said.

Varney recalled a patient considering surgery who was nervous about the risks. When the patient mentioned a previous surgery (not related to obesity) that had gone well, Varney told her the bariatric surgery risks were the same or less than those of her prior surgery. “She had the surgery and did great,” she said, achieving a body mass index of 24.

Rogers describes GLP-1s as a “gateway drug,” explaining that people who would not have considered obesity treatment might now consider medications, with the arrival of the GLP-1s. Then, if the medications stop working, “they might consider surgery,” which they would not have considered otherwise.

Macht and Stey had no disclosures. Rogers is a proctor and/or speaker for Intuitive Surgical, Medtronic, and W.L. Gore. Stombaugh is on the Lilly faculty for Zepbound. Varney was on a primary care advisory board for Eli Lilly in 2024.

 April 11, 2025  

As Match Day ended in March, 554 medical students celebrated their selection — out of some 1200 applicants — to a highly coveted dermatology residency slot. Many will eventually pursue advanced training — perhaps in dermatopathology or Mohs surgery — but as few as a dozen will move on to subspecialize in pediatric dermatology.

The number of clinicians in training who choose pediatric dermatology has been low for decades and continues to flatline, even as need skyrockets and older clinicians are retiring. Meanwhile, up to a third of visits to a pediatrician involve a skin issue, often one that needs the specific skillset of a pediatric dermatologist. They are few and far between, which creates major access bottlenecks.

“It is the smallest, smallest specialty,” said Thy N. Huynh, MD, assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Mississippi School of Medicine, Jackson, Mississippi, speaking at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2025 Annual Meeting in March. Huynh feels those small numbers acutely. She is the only board-certified pediatric dermatologist in Mississippi.

Lengthy training, a potentially high debt load — followed by lower compensation — demanding work hours, and a lack of awareness about the subspecialty all contribute to an abiding lack of interest, said clinicians and pediatric dermatology leaders.

“Some doctors, let alone parents and caregivers, still don't even know that we exist as a subspecialty,” said Sheilagh Maguiness, MD, associate professor of dermatology at the University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis and immediate past president of the Society for Pediatric Dermatology (SPD).

The 4-5 years of subspecialty training that pediatric dermatologists undergo “is very meaningful,” Maguiness told Medscape Medical News. But, she added, “It takes a special kind of person to want to do extra training and make less money.”

Maguiness and colleagues have struggled to figure out how to attract more medical students and residents to their field. She and others have gone to fellowship and residency meetings to hand out SPD brochures that give details on what's involved in the subspecialty and salary information. “Building up career awareness is really important so that people know that we're here,” said Maguiness.

Some academic medical center dermatology programs don't have a pediatric dermatologist, which means students and residents may never be exposed to the subspecialty. SPD has helped move along an effort where some residency programs — such as at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia — “earmark” a residency spot for someone who's interested in pediatric dermatology. They then can be channeled into the fellowship they'll need to get certified.

The number of pediatric dermatologists has grown, but not exponentially. In 2010, there were 196 board-certified pediatric dermatologists, according to a review published in 2014. A 2021 survey indicated that there were 336 board-certified pediatric dermatologists practicing in the United States and that, on average, six pediatric dermatologists practice in each state, but seven states did not have one.

There are about 4.3 pediatric dermatologists per million children, according to a 2021 study in Cutis. The vast majority practice in urban areas and on the coasts.

“There is a huge access problem,” Huynh said at the AAD meeting. Huynh, originally from Montgomery, Alabama, completed pediatric training in Los Angeles and a pediatric dermatology fellowship in Boston. However, she did her dermatology residency at the University of Mississippi and said that she “came back to Mississippi to build” better access to pediatric dermatology in the state.

Her wait time is 4-6 months, but she is still seeing new patients, unlike some pediatric dermatologists who hit the pause button on new consults. Some colleagues in other locations have a wait time of up to a year, said Huynh.

“Delayed care is a problem,” said Maguiness, adding that it can be costly for some patients. For instance, untreated infantile hemangiomas can ulcerate and become cosmetically disfiguring. She's seen children who have struggled for years with atopic dermatitis despite the availability of new and effective therapies.

Pediatric dermatologists' value may be under-recognized. Pediatricians are great at addressing common skin conditions like viral rashes and diaper rashes or mild eczema, said Maguiness. But they aren't as well versed in the thousands of general skin diseases and are less attuned to genetic or autoimmune conditions or complicated vascular anomalies that pediatric dermatologists see regularly, she noted.

“I see more zebras,” said Huynh, adding that being exposed to those rarities — and knowing what they are — is part of the job when she is the only specialist for some 700,000 children in Mississippi.

As for many subspecialties, the road to that expertise is a long one.

After a 3-year dermatology residency and passing the general dermatology board exam, a 1-year fellowship at an Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)–accredited pediatric dermatology fellowship program is required. There are 34 accredited pediatric dermatology fellowship programs in the United States, according to the ACGME.

Fellowship slots often go unfilled. At the University of Minnesota, there has been only one pediatric dermatology fellow in the past 6 years, said Maguiness.

Those who complete a fellowship must then obtain board certification in pediatric dermatology. The American Board of Dermatology certified 23 pediatric dermatologists in 2024 — a relatively high number.

A 2014 overview of the field by Brea Prindaville, MD, and colleagues published in Pediatric Dermatology reported that a previous survey found that the majority of pediatric dermatologists had made the decision to pursue the field in medical school or in pediatric — not dermatology — residency.

That was true for Stephen Humphrey, MD, a dermatologist at Children's Wisconsin and associate professor of dermatology at the Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. He knew in medical school that he wanted to go into a pediatrics-related field.

“I was really interested in taking care of kids,” he told Medscape Medical News. Once he became aware of pediatric dermatology, he shifted his focus because he really enjoyed his dermatology rotations.

Humphrey said the 5 years of training that he had did not deter him, “especially when compared to some of our surgical colleagues, who I feel like are still in training, and I've been out in practice 9 years.”

Maguiness agreed. “I don't think the training is the impediment,” she said, adding that medical students recognize that extra training is needed for any subspecialty.

Pediatric dermatologists point to reimbursement as an issue that might discourage some from diverting from the more lucrative general dermatology path.

“Pediatric dermatology is far more cognitive than procedural and focused on preventative and maintenance care,” wrote Prindaville and co-authors.

“The time spent educating and counseling and doing preventative care, and all of the things that go into the pediatric subspecialty, don't get paid or reimbursed at the same level,” said Maguiness.

But, she added, “If you're comparing us to a general pediatrician, I think the salary would look quite attractive.”

Humphrey agreed that reimbursement might discourage some from joining him in his field. “At the end of the day, there is a financial thing that people think about,” he said, noting that someone might accumulate $500,000 in debt from college and medical school. An extra year of training for pediatric dermatology means another year without income, he said.

Pediatric dermatologists must get used to being in high demand. Humphrey, who is based in Milwaukee, gets referrals from all over Wisconsin and Northern Illinois.

“I work in a city that actually has a lot of pediatric dermatologists, comparatively speaking,” he said. But his next available new patient appointment is in 4-5 months. He still makes room for emergencies.

A survey of 118 pediatric dermatologists published in Pediatric Dermatology in 2024 found that 89% of respondents said they see one to 10 new consults each week and 71% said they don't have protected time during the week to provide inpatient consults. More than a third said they perform all inpatient consults without assistance from other clinicians, including on evenings and weekends.

Maguiness said she takes calls for everyone in Minnesota and does telephone consults for patients in North Dakota, South Dakota, and part of Iowa, where there are no pediatric dermatologists. Even so, she said, “I would actually make the claim that it's a pretty good lifestyle.”

She said she can “strike a balance” between work and home life, even though it's busy. 

Humphrey agreed. He said he's been able to find a good work-life balance, which he said is crucial to being human. Humphrey chose the subspecialty in part because he wanted to practice in an academic environment and in a hospital system. Being a pediatric dermatologist “exposes you to challenging or more rare cases,” he said.

“It comes down to — do you love what you do? Do you love who you're seeing? And if you do, the hours don't matter so much,” he said.

“At the end of the day, you'll find that pediatric dermatologists are extremely happy with their career,” said Maguiness.

“What makes a great career? Lifelong learning and having a purpose and helping others — those are the three things that really lead to personal fulfillment and satisfaction,” Maguiness said.

Huynh, Maguiness, and Humphrey reported no relevant disclosures.

 April 11, 2025  

Americans eat too much salt, but the influence of dietary sodium is especially noticeable in women, whose blood pressure may become more salt sensitive in their 40s or 50s. Primary care providers should take note and not underestimate salt's ability to affect blood pressure later in life, warn women's health experts.

Most adults have a strong response to dietary sodium. Blood pressure rises significantly when individuals switch from a low-salt to a high-salt diet. Interestingly, some data suggest women get more sensitive to salt in their late 40s, around the menopausal transition. “Women tend to be more sensitive to salt and its effects on blood pressure, especially during perimenopause and postmenopause,” according to Ashley L. Mutchler, PhD, assistant professor at Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee.

“Increased salt sensitivity also contributes to a higher risk of heart disease in this population,” said Mutchler in an interview.

While all the mechanisms related to blood pressure changes around menopause are not understood, research is focusing on the role of estrogen, which helps regulate blood pressure by influencing how the kidneys process sodium, Mutchler said.

It is likely that estrogen helps regulate the blood pressure of younger women in multiple ways: By acting as a vasodilator, by increasing nitric oxide, and by acting on the kidneys, which are estrogen-receptive organs.

In menopause, without estrogen, the body has a harder time dealing with salt, which contributes to the slow increase in blood pressure, said cardiologist Kayle Shapero, MD, PhD, assistant professor of medicine at The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.

This connection between hormones, salt sensitivity, and heart health highlights why monitoring blood pressure as well as sodium intake is especially important for women as they age.

Primary care doctors should be aware that some women will start to experience a rise in blood pressure during the menopause transition or during perimenopause, said Chrisandra Shufelt, MD, professor and chair of the Division of General Internal Medicine, associate director of the Women's Health Research Center, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida, and former president of the Menopause Society.

Increased blood pressure doesn't cause obvious symptoms, and accurate blood pressure readings can be elusive. White coat hypertension is real, which is why so many groups encourage educating patients about self-measured blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring to confirm a diagnosis of elevated or high blood pressure outside of a doctor's office.

According to Umesh A. Patel, MD, a cardiologist at the Louisiana Heart Center, Covington, Louisiana, at-home devices are especially helpful for patients who:

Patients can keep a journal of readings to show their doctor or buy a monitor that connects to a smartphone and averages measurements, Patel said. Look for an automatic monitor that uses a bicep cuff and meets the American Medical Association criteria. (Wrist and finger monitors give less reliable readings and are not recommended.) The American Heart Association's website can give patients tips to avoid common pitfalls.

Testing frequency depends on a patient's age, heart disease risk factors, and other variables. Risk factors such as a history of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia warrant more frequent monitoring, as often as once a month, according to Patel.

In an article published in Clinical Hypertension in 2024, the author calls out-of-office blood pressure measurement essential to prevent high blood pressure misdiagnosis before explaining the advantages and limitations of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring compared with home blood pressure monitoring for managing hypertension.

While many midlife health changes are related to hormonal changes in women, it is important to recognize that elevated blood pressure might indicate sleep apnea, stressed Shapero.

Shufelt concurs — obstructive sleep apnea is another common cause of elevated blood pressure in midlife women. “Before menopause, 3% of women have sleep apnea. After menopause, 11% of women have it,” she said.

Sometimes women attribute sleep apnea symptoms such as morning headaches to perimenopausal symptoms such as insomnia or hot flashes. Another common issue, midlife weight gain, may contribute to sleep apnea and increased blood pressure.

There are so many different reasons for increases in a midlife woman's blood pressure; it is important that primary care physicians ask about them, said Shufelt.

Counseling patients on how to cut back on salt may take more time and effort than a typical primary care physician can provide, but don't discount the impact of simple cheerleading. And focus on the basics: Advise choosing fresh meat, fruits, and vegetables, and reading labels. Refer them to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet — a free, effective resource. Tell patients that their salt preference can fade in as quickly as a couple of weeks.

Encouragement from a health professional has been shown to help individuals monitor their salt intake and read nutrition labels, according to data published in Patient Education and Counseling in 2023. However, behavioral interventions alone may not be sufficient to prevent hypertension and may need to be combined with other salt reduction or blood pressure–lowering measures.

Patients who are interested and need the help can be referred to a registered dietitian. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, patients have had easier access to consultations with registered dietitians for preventative care.

Working with a dietitian is a good way to help people cut back on salt, said Theresa Gentile, MS, RD, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “It can be easier to approach changes step by step with the help of a dietitian,” she said.

Gentile likes to advise people trying to reduce salt intake to eat one additional serving of fruit or vegetable a day. This adds potassium to the diet, which can help counteract sodium.

At the same time, they share low-sodium lifestyle tips, and dietitians can help with other midlife health challenges, such as increases in cholesterol levels and weight gain. Patients can find a local registered dietitian using the database on the Academy's website, eatright.org.

Mutchler, Shapero, and Gentile disclosed no relevant financial conflicts of interest. Shufelt is the principal investigator of a National Institutes of Health–funded study on young women with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea.

 April 11, 2025  

By the late 1990s, annual cases of measles in the United States dwindled to a few dozen, down from more than 27,000 in 1990. However, the disease remained a mainstay of medical education for dermatologists. While few trainees might see measles in practice, the thinking went, the lesions were still a useful benchmark for diagnosing viral skin diseases.

“We naturally compare things to measles,” said Esther Freeman, MD, PhD, director of Global Health Dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, and chair of the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD)'s Emerging Diseases Task Force, in an interview. “We're taught that the morbilliform rash — morbilliform literally means measles-like — is a particular characteristic viral rash.”

Now, as a measles outbreak spreads in the American Southwest and elsewhere, it's becoming more and more likely that measles-like lesions are actually signs of measles. 

As of April 4, 2025, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 607 measles cases in six outbreaks, up from 285 cases in 2024 and 59 in 2023. As of April 8, Texas, where an outbreak has struck the South Plains and Panhandle regions, reports 505 cases since early January, and New Mexico reports 56, almost all in Lea County near the Texas Panhandle. The other affected states are Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington. On April 8, a case was reported in Hawaii in an unvaccinated child younger than 5 years.

“We are absolutely expecting the number of cases and states to rise,” said Freeman, whose AAD task force has posted a new Measles Resource Center for dermatologists. “As dermatologists, it's really important to have this on our radar, although many of us have not seen measles cases,” she said.

The following are six recommendations for dermatologists regarding measles and the current outbreak:

“Measles is one of the most infectious viruses that we have,” Freeman said. “It can stay in the air after an individual has left a room for 2 hours and affect someone at a distance of 100 feet away.” In dermatology, “we're not used to a virus this infectious,” she added, so special precautions are needed.

The AAD Measles Resource Center suggests that dermatology clinics in measles-affected areas institute a previsit telephone triage system to screen patients for symptoms of measles within the last week — high fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, and maculopapular rash. When possible, patients with a possible case of measles should be seen in a facility with an airborne infection isolation room, Freeman said.

If a patient with suspected measles does turn up in a dermatology clinic, the patient should be masked immediately and not left in the waiting room, she said. “Only healthcare personnel with known immunity to measles should be taking care of that individual, and they should be wearing an N95 mask or other appropriate PPE [personal protective equipment].”

When a case of measles is suspected, don't wait for the case to be confirmed before contacting your local and state health departments, Freeman said. Reach out to them immediately, and “they will take you through the process from there.”

The AAD Measles Resource Center includes contact information for state/territory, city/county, and tribal health departments. It also lists emergency “Epi-on-Call” phone numbers for state/territory health departments along with some local health departments.

Measles-like rashes alone aren't definitive signs of measles since they can be caused by other viruses, Freeman said. Other symptoms, along with their timing, can assist in making the diagnosis.

“Before you come down with measles, you have a prodrome. You don't just wake up one day with a rash,” said Sharon Nachman, MD, professor of pediatrics at SUNY Stony Brook and chief of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Division at Stony Brook Children's Hospital, Stony Brook, New York, in an interview.

A useful mnemonic refers to the “three Cs” of measles: Cough, conjunctivitis, and coryza. “We're not talking about a little runny nose. They have a horrible, yucky, nasty glop coming down the nose,” Nachman said.

These symptoms, along with small white spots inside the mouth (Koplik spots), appear first, Freeman said. Then comes a maculopapular rash.

“Generally, the rash begins about 7-18 days after exposure, starts on the face and the upper neck, and then spreads across the trunk, arms, and legs over the course of about 3 days,” Freeman said. “The rash usually lasts around 5-6 days.”

In addition, the rash never begins on the lower body and goes upward Nachman said. “It always starts on your head and goes downwards.”

Serology testing and real-time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction tests are available to confirm measles, and the tests are sometimes conducted outdoors. “This is not something that we suddenly expect a lot of dermatologists to be doing because the goal really is to potentially screen people out and not have them show up in your office,” Freeman said. “But at times they will.”

The AAD Measles Resource Center notes that serology tests that look for immunoglobulin M antibodies may be in short supply, so “clinicians should be vigilant in contacting their state or local health department for guidance on testing.”

If a case of measles is suspected, one of the first steps is to vaccinate the rest of the family if needed, Nachman said. As the AAD's Measles Resource Center notes, postexposure prophylaxis is available for vulnerable people via the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine (within 72 hours of exposure) or immunoglobulin (within 6 days of exposure), and “public health officials can help identify eligible people, assess contraindications, and weigh the benefits.”

It's also crucial to determine how sick the patient is. Nachman said she may send a child with a fever home if they're feeling all right. “But I would give the family a lot of cautious advice. If they're working hard to breathe, breathing fast, and can't catch their breath, they go to the hospital. If they're not eating or drinking, they go to the hospital. I tell families of little kids that if they're not playing, they're not walking up and down the stairs, go to the hospital.”

According to Freeman, dermatologists should follow the usual drill when a patient appears to have a case of measles that requires extra management. “It's not the dermatologist's role to manage measles complications, such as severe pneumonia,” she said. “We're going to use our usual protocol: When patients are very sick, we end up calling the ER [emergency room] or transfer our patient to an inpatient facility. Those rules are not going to change here.”

In milder cases, the recommendation is to “keep the kids comfortable,” Nachman said. “Every child that I've seen who has the measles is whining, crying, and miserable. Their whole body hurts.” Hydration is important, but don't worry about lotions or special baths for the lesions, she said.

“We tell families to expect [their kids] to be sick for about 3 weeks,” she said.“It takes the kids a long time to get better and back to their usual selves.” Serious complications can include measles pneumonia, and several years after infection, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which causes brain swelling, affects an estimated 4-11 per 100,000 patients with measles and is nearly always fatal. “We're not able to predict which kid it is going to happen to except to say it happens 10 years later,” Nachman said.

Prior to this year, the most recent pediatric death in the United States from measles was in 2003, and the most recent adult death was in 2015. As of April 7, there have been two reported deaths from measles in school-aged children, both in West Texas. One child died in February and another in April. In a suspected case, a person in eastern New Mexico died and was found to be positive for measles, but other details haven't been released. According to health officials, none of the three victims was vaccinated against measles.

According to the CDC's April 4 data, the current measles outbreak is affecting people of all ages (26% of cases are ≥ 20 years), but children make up a large number (32% of cases are younger than 5 years; 40% are between 5 and 19 years), with age unknown in 2% of cases.

Of the 607 confirmed cases, 12% have been hospitalized, including 21% of those younger than 5 years and 8% of those of other ages; in 8% of the cases, the ages are unknown. It's not clear why the patients were hospitalized. In 2024, the CDC reported that 40% of 285 patients were hospitalized “for isolation or for management of measles complications,” but none died. Vaccination status in most of the 607 cases (97%) is listed as unvaccinated or “unknown.”

“Vaccination is incredibly important,” Freeman said, especially in light of the high contagiousness of measles. “Herd immunity for measles is about 95%, meaning that 95% of us have to be vaccinated in order to not have it and in order to protect those around us who are unable to get vaccinated for a variety of reasons,” she said. “Unfortunately, vaccination rates have been falling over the last 5 or so years, and a number of states are below this threshold.”

A 2024 report found that 93% of kindergartners nationwide had received two doses of the MMR vaccine, ranging from a high of 98.3% in West Virginia to a low of 79.6% in Idaho. States with percentages below 95% are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.

The District of Columbia and Puerto Rico also have rates below 95%, and Montana did not provide data.

“From the 2019-20 to the 2022-23 school year,” the report said, “national kindergarten coverage with state-required vaccinations declined from 95% to approximately 93%.” The AAD Measles Resource Center offers information about measles vaccines, including details regarding pregnant and immunosuppressed people and those taking certain medications.

Clinical photos of measles are available on the AAD's resource center.

Freeman consults for philanthropic global health projects for CeraVe and L'Oreal and co-authored a report on COVID-19 for UpToDate. Nachman disclosed funding via the National Institutes of Health.

Discontinuing concomitant methotrexate (MTX) was noninferior to continuing it for maintenance of low disease activity (LDA) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had already achieved the state with a combination therapy of MTX plus certolizumab pegol (CZP).

“The results of the present study demonstrate that discontinuing MTX is noninferior to continuing MTX in terms of subsequent maintenance of LDA sustained with CZP + MTX therapy, and discontinuing concomitant MTX is clinically feasible for RA patients treated with CZP,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Shuji Asai, MD, PhD, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Rheumatology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine in Nagoya, Japan. It was published online on April 5, 2025, in Arthritis Research & Therapy.

According to the authors, the open-label design where both patients and evaluators were aware of MTX reduction and discontinuation could potentially influence assessments. This study may have selection bias as it included patients who maintained LDA in clinical practice, possibly resulting in favorable outcomes. Additionally, the observation period was restricted despite the chronic nature of patient conditions requiring long-term treatment.

The clinical trial received funding from Astellas Pharma, with a portion of expenses covered by UCB through Astellas. The funders had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis and interpretation, or preparation of the study manuscript. Some authors disclosed receiving grant/research support, consulting fees, and/or speakers' fees from several pharmaceutical companies.

Consumption of holy water from Ethiopia has recently led to several cases of cholera in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) with a multidrug-resistant Vibrio cholerae strain, according to a study published in Eurosurveillance. Four patients were infected through imported water, while three patients had travelled in Ethiopia. Researchers detected multidrug-resistant Vibrio cholerae O1 linked to recent outbreaks in Eastern and Middle Africa in clinical specimens and the holy water.

The ongoing cholera outbreak in Ethiopia began in 2022, and by 9 February 2025 a total of 58,381 cases and 726 deaths had been reported. There was a resurgence of the outbreak on 6 February 2025 reported in the Amhara region leading to 163 cases and 3 deaths, with more recent numbers being unavailable. One identified contamination source is the Bermel Giorgis holy well, which is located in the Quara district and is a site of pilgrimage attracting visitors worldwide. Pilgrims consume or bathe in the water for physical or spiritual healing, and often take it home.

In Germany, three people were initially reported via the European surveillance portal for infectious diseases (EpiPulse) as suspected of having cholera on 25 February 2025. All patients were identified as being of Ethiopian ethnicity. Two had travelled to Ethiopia in January, and acquired a small plastic bottle of water with water from the holy well in Bermel Giorgis. Upon their return to Germany, both people consumed the water. A third person received splashes of water to the face, including the lips, and possibly ingested some of it. In early February, all three individuals developed diarrhoea and vomiting, and were hospitalised. One patient required intensive care, but all recovered.

In the UK, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency (UKHSA) identified four patients, among which two reported recent travel to Ethiopia to the Amhara region, and one specifically mentioning a 9-day trip to Bermel Georgis. A third patient had not travelled to Ethiopia, but reported that they had drank holy water from the well that had been brought back by the fourth patient, who had also become ill after consuming the water in the UK. Three were admitted to hospital, with one requiring intensive care. One person who had also travelled to Ethiopia also had symptoms of cholera, but was not tested and recovered without medical treatment.

Genetic analysis of the bacteria in stool samples from the UK cases showed that they belonged to a multidrug-resistant clade of Vibrio cholerae O1 previously linked to outbreaks of cholera in Kenya and Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in Eastern and Middle Africa. Ethiopian V. cholerae isolates sequenced in Germany and the UK had the same antimicrobial resistance profile as the bacteria samples obtained recently from UK residents. The similarities in these isolates, as well as among the Kenyan and sub-Saharan African strains in England, indicated that multidrug-resistant V. cholerae O1 circulating in Africa were transmitted into Europe.

Consumption of holy water has been previously identified as a risk factor for cholera in Ethiopia. Public authorities have taken preventive measures during religious holidays, and the Ethiopian National Guideline for Cholera Surveillance and Outbreak response has also addressed the associated risks. However, the spread of cases into Europe related to a cholera outbreak in Africa is unusual.

While genetic data have improved surveillance and identification of cases, prevention requires investment in water, sanitation and hygiene. According to Frank et al.: ""Low-income countries will continue to need overseas development aid support to control outbreaks and epidemics using effective WASH, surveillance, communications, diagnostics and countermeasure programmatic delivery.""

A new research perspective was published in Oncotarget, Volume 16, on April 4, 2025, titled ""GSK3β activation is a key driver of resistance to Raf inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma cells.""

In this work, first author Diana Crisan and corresponding author Abhijit Basu from the University Hospital Ulm led a team that presents experimental evidence pointing to the protein GSK3β as a key contributor to drug resistance in melanoma. Their findings suggest that GSK3β becomes increasingly active in cancer cells during treatment, helping them survive and adapt despite ongoing therapy with BRAF inhibitors.

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer in which nearly half of patients have mutations in the BRAF gene that accelerate tumor growth. While treatments targeting BRAF, known as BRAF inhibitors, initially work well, tumors often find ways to fight back. This research perspective explores how GSK3β, a protein involved in metabolism and cell survival, becomes more active in melanoma cells that develop resistance to BRAF inhibitors.

Researchers treated melanoma cells with a common BRAF mutation using Dabrafenib, a widely used BRAF inhibitor. Over time, the cancer cells developed resistance and showed a marked increase in GSK3β levels. This pattern was confirmed across multiple melanoma cell models, suggesting that the finding is consistent and reliable.

Importantly, the researchers observed that treating resistant cancer cells with a GSK3β inhibitor significantly reduced their growth. This result suggests that blocking this protein could restore sensitivity to treatment, highlighting GSK3β as a promising therapeutic target and supporting the idea of combining GSK3β inhibitors with existing melanoma therapies.

""Remarkably, treatment of BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells with the GSK3 inhibitor LY2090314 for three weeks could overcome resistance and significantly decreased melanoma cell growth, confirming the causal role of GSK3 activation for BRAFi resistance development.""

The research perspective adds to ongoing efforts to understand and overcome melanoma drug resistance. It shows that resistance is not driven only by genetic mutations but may also involve adaptive changes in the cell's internal signaling and survival mechanisms. By identifying GSK3β as a potential contributor, the authors offer a new direction for improving the durability of targeted treatments in melanoma.

As research continues, GSK3β may be a critical factor in the long-term success of melanoma therapy, particularly for patients who have stopped responding to standard BRAF-targeted drugs.

Julie Rovner KFF Health News  @jrovner

Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent and host of KFF Health News' weekly health policy news podcast, ""What the Health?"" A noted expert on health policy issues, Julie is the author of the critically praised reference book ""Health Care Politics and Policy A to Z,"" now in its third edition.

A week into the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services announced by Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the scope of the staff cuts and program cutbacks is starting to become clear. Among the biggest targets for reductions were the nation's premier public health agencies: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the FDA.

Meanwhile, Kennedy did not show up as invited to testify before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, known as HELP, but he did visit families in Texas whose unvaccinated children died of measles in the current outbreak and called for an end to water fluoridation during a stop in Utah.

This week's panelists are Julie Rovner of KFF Health News, Victoria Knight of Axios, Alice Miranda Ollstein of Politico, and Sandhya Raman of CQ Roll Call.

Among the takeaways from this week's episode:

Also this week, Rovner interviews Georgetown Law School professor Stephen Vladeck about the limits of presidential power.

Plus, for ""extra credit"" the panelists suggest health policy stories they read (or wrote) this week that they think you should read, too: 

Julie Rovner: The New York Times' ""Why the Right Still Embraces Ivermectin,"" by Richard Fausset. 

Victoria Knight: Wired's ""Dr. Oz Pushed for AI Health Care in First Medicare Agency Town Hall,"" by Leah Feiger and Steven Levy. 

Alice Miranda Ollstein: The Guardian's ""'We Are Failing': Doctors and Students in the US Look to Mexico for Basic Abortion Training,"" by Carter Sherman. 

Sandhya Raman: CQ Roll Call's ""In Sweden, a Focus on Smokeless Tobacco,"" by Sandhya Raman. 

Also mentioned in this week's podcast:

This article was reprinted from khn.org, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF - the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.

One of the world's foremost pain experts has highlighted the risks of bypassing established processes for assessing the safety and effectiveness of medicines at the launch of a research center at the University of Queensland.

In a public lecture, President of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Professor Andrew Rice used an analysis of the use of cannabinoids for pain relief to illustrate concerns.

The collective body of work from our taskforce on cannabis and cannabinoid analgesia represents the most rigorous and unbiased appraisal of both preclinical and clinical evidence published to date.

We analyzed 36 randomized controlled trials and overwhelmingly concluded that cannabinoids are no more effective at treating pain than placebos. 

At the same time, there are continuing concerns about adverse effects, including the risk of psychosis and dependence syndrome.""

Professor Andrew Rice, President of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)

Director of The Centre for Innovation in Pain and Health Research Professor Paul Hodges said one of their aims was to conduct high-priority clinical trials to evaluate pain treatments, care models, and preventive strategies.

""We are striving to accelerate the development of effective interventions so that we can enhance the lives of people impacted by pain,"" Professor Hodges said.

""A current focus of our work aims improve matching the right patient with the right treatment at the right time. 

""We are doing this through developing new tools to characterise people's pain, accelerating the translation of treatments from fundamental research to the clinic, and implementing new ways to test treatments using clever new types of clinical trials.""

The Centre has been officially launched by Queensland Health Minister Tim Nicholls and brings together about 200 researchers in the largest and most diverse centre for pain research in Australia.

Despite significant advances in Parkinson's disease (PD) treatment, it remains incurable, with limited therapeutic options. Currently, repurposing already tested, safe drugs has emerged as an effective therapeutic strategy against various neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. Using a drug-repurposing approach, the current study investigated the neuroregenerative potential of polysialic acid mimicking compounds, 5-nonyloxytryptamine oxalate (5-NOT) and Epirubicin (Epi), an anti-cancer drug, in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-treated human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells as a PD model.

The excitotoxic model was established by exposing SH-SY5Y cells to 500 µM of MPP+ and subsequently treating them with the test compounds. The effect of MPP+-induced toxicity on cellular and nuclear morphology, as well as on the expression of neuroplasticity and cell survival proteins, were studied by immunostaining, gelatin zymogram, and Western blot assays.

Treatment with 5-NOT and Epi significantly promoted the survival of MPP+-challenged SH-SY5Y cells and prevented changes in their cellular and nuclear morphology by regulating the expression of microtubule-associated protein (MAP-2) and polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) and NCAM synaptic plasticity proteins. Further, 5-NOT and Epi treatment also protected SH-SY5Y cells by restoring levels of nitric oxide, matrix metalloproteinase, and stress response proteins. Interstingly, 5-NOT attenuated MPP+-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by regulating the intrinsic protein kinase AKT/BAD apoptotic pathway and the P-38 MAP kinase synaptic plasticity pathway.

The present data provides compelling evidence for the potential beneficial role of 5-NOT as a glycomimetic drug candidate targeting the neurodegeneration of dopamine neurons, a hallmark feature of patients suffering from PD. The study's outcome is also supported by our previous findings in spinal cord injury (in vivo study) and neurodegenerative disease in vitro models of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Identification of novel compounds from small molecule libraries mimicking the functions of PSA may offer new therapeutic avenues for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.

The National Lipid Association (NLA) and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) have released a Joint Scientific Statement focused on the management of hypercholesterolemia in adults older than 75 years who do not have a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).  Published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society and the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, this collaborative effort, developed by a diverse team of clinical lipidologists, cardiologists, geriatricians, and pharmacists, offers evidence-based guidance to help clinicians navigate the complexities of cholesterol management in a growing population of older adults.

Older persons have many competing medical and social needs, so treating high cholesterol in those without cardiovascular disease may not always be straightforward for clinicians and patients. We hope to help provide as much clarity as possible.""

Vera Bittner, MD, MSPH, MNLA, co-chair of the scientific statement

The statement reviews the current evidence surrounding lipid-lowering therapies in older individuals without established ASCVD and offers pragmatic recommendations to support clinical decision-making in this unique population.

""The AGS is excited to have aligned our efforts with NLA to ensure that lipid management for adults over 75 years of age is personalized, evidence-based, and mindful of the diverse needs of our aging population,"" added Sunny Linnebur, PharmD, co-chair of the statement.

As the U.S. population continues to age, the number of individuals over 75 years old living without diagnosed cardiovascular disease is growing. However, the decision to initiate or continue cholesterol-lowering therapy in these patients can be challenging due to limited clinical trial data, the presence of comorbidities, polypharmacy, and differing goals of care.

This statement serves as a critical resource to guide personalized treatment decisions-balancing potential benefits in ASCVD prevention with the realities of aging and the end-of-life, frailty, medication burden, and patient preferences.

A multi-institutional study led by Moffitt Cancer Center found that percutaneous hepatic perfusion using a melphalan hepatic delivery system may help patients with a rare eye cancer that has spread to their liver. This disease, known as metastatic uveal melanoma, is traditionally very hard to treat and usually has poor outcomes.

The phase 3 FOCUS trial, published in the Annals of Surgical Oncology, compared two treatments for metastatic uveal melanoma. One group of patients received the melphalan hepatic delivery system treatment, while the other group received standard of care treatment. Patients treated with the melphalan hepatic delivery system experienced significantly improved outcomes than those receiving alternative care. The median progression-free survival for these patients was 9.1 months, compared with 3.3 months for those on standard treatments.

The objective response rate was 27.5%, nearly three times the 9.4% observed in the comparison group. The disease control rate also substantially increased from 46.9% to 80.0%. Patients treated with the melphalan hepatic delivery system lived a median of 18.5 months, compared with 14.5 months for those receiving other forms of care. Although there were some side effects, mostly related to blood cell counts, these were treated with standard care as an outpatient and mostly resolved with observation alone.

This new treatment gives hope to patients with this historically tough-to-treat cancer. This is the second publication in Annals of Surgical Oncology on the results of the FOCUS trial and definitely shows that treatment with the melphalan hepatic delivery system can help control the cancer in the liver. The treatment provides an option that does not interfere with their quality of life and gives patients a chance at longer survival.""

Jonathan Zager, M.D., surgical oncologist in the Cutaneous Oncology Department at Moffitt and lead author of the study

The melphalan hepatic delivery system treatment was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in August 2023 based on the phase 3 trial results. Unlike regular chemotherapy, this treatment delivers a high dose of the drug directly into the liver, which is isolated with a series of catheters and balloons via percutaneous insertions. The chemotherapy is filtered out before it gets introduced to the rest of the body. This targeted approach helps reduce harmful side effects in the rest of the body. More research is planned to test the benefits of the melphalan hepatic delivery system. Studies will also look at combining this treatment with other new therapies.

The FOCUS trial is sponsored by Delcath Systems, Inc.

Therapy-related B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) following treatment for multiple myeloma is a rare occurrence. Despite its rarity and the lack of recognition by the World Health Organization as a distinct disease entity, previous publications indicate its possible emergence following myeloma treatment.

The patient is a 65-year-old gentleman with a history of IgG kappa multiple myeloma, status post multiple lines of therapy. The patient presented with a fever, and a complete blood count showed cytopenia. Bone marrow morphologic evaluation revealed numerous blasts. Immunophenotypic analysis demonstrated that these blasts were B lymphoblasts, despite MYC and unusual surface kappa light chain expression. A diagnosis of B-ALL with surface kappa light chain expression post-myeloma treatment was made. Ancillary studies indicated that the B-ALL and the previous myeloma were clonally unrelated. Next-generation gene sequencing revealed pathogenic mutations in KDM6A and KRAS.

In summary, we present an interesting case of B-lymphoblastic leukemia with unusual surface light chain expression in a patient who has previously undergone myeloma treatment. This case represents therapy-related B-ALL. Although it has not been categorized as a WHO-recognized disease entity, our case provides additional evidence supporting that myeloma treatment, particularly lenalidomide therapy, is associated with secondary B-ALL. Furthermore, the ClonoSEQ test result in the current case indicates that therapy-related B-ALL is clonally unrelated to the preceding MM. The identification of new predominant clones in follow-up bone marrow samples of myeloma patients should alert clinicians to the possible emergence of a secondary B-cell neoplasm.

The use of virtual reality haptic simulators can enhance skill acquisition and reduce stress among dental students during preclinical endodontic training, according to a new study published in the International Endodontic Journal. The study was based on collaboration between the University of Eastern Finland, the University of Health Sciences and the University of Ondokuz Mayıs in Turkey as well as Grande Rio University in Brazil.

The study aimed to evaluate the influence of virtual reality (VR) haptic simulators on skill acquisition and stress reduction in endodontic preclinical education of dental students.

During preclinical training, dental students develop manual dexterity, psychomotor skills and confidence essential in clinical practice. VR and haptic technology are increasingly used alongside conventional methods, enabling more repetition and standardised feedback, among other things.

In the present study, 40 volunteered dental students enrolled in preclinical endodontic training were randomly divided into two groups. One group trained with VR haptic simulators before practicing on artificial teeth, while the other practiced on artificial teeth first, followed by VR simulator. All received standardised lectures and demonstrations on access cavity preparation. Pre- and post-training evaluations included stress level measurements, manual dexterity assessments and self-confidence surveys.

Students who started their training with VR haptic simulators demonstrated significantly higher manual dexterity scores and self-assessed proficiency, as well as lower anxiety levels during preclinical training sessions, compared to the other group. In addition, they felt better prepared and more confident in performing access cavity preparations and managing procedural challenges.

Stress levels were notably reduced following simulator practice in both groups. Simulator-based performance metrics were similar between the groups.

The researchers point out that further research is needed to explore long-term effects and optimal integration strategies for VR simulators in dental curricula.

New research highlights how GLP-1 receptor agonists influence gut bacteria, offering insights into their broader metabolic and anti-inflammatory benefits.

Study: Effects of GLP-1 Analogues and Agonists on the Gut Microbiota: A Systematic Review. Image Credit: Corona Borealis Studio/Shutterstock.com

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogs and receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are relatively new players in the medical landscape, but they've quickly gained attention for their effects on blood glucose, metabolism, weight loss, and even neurodegenerative diseases.

Now, researchers are turning their attention to another promising area: the gut microbiome. A recent review in Nutrients explores what we currently know about how GLP-1 RAs interact with gut microbes—and the broader implications for human health.

GLP-1 is an incretin hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels after meals, acting in a glucose-dependent manner. This means it lowers blood sugar without causing hypoglycemia—a key advantage in diabetes management.

Since its discovery in 1984 by Svetlana Mosjov, GLP-1 and its analogs (such as semaglutide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide) have rapidly become cornerstone treatments for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. These drugs are effective in reducing blood sugar and promoting weight loss—two major risk factors for cardiometabolic disease—making them important tools for both prevention and treatment.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) now recommends GLP-1 agonists for overweight individuals with diabetes, particularly those who experience frequent hypoglycemia with insulin or sulfonylureas.

Mechanistically, GLP-1 agonists enhance insulin secretion after meals, slow gastric emptying, and suppress glucagon release—all of which contribute to better glycemic control and weight management. These effects also appear to have a broader influence on metabolic health, potentially mediated through the gut microbiome.

Emerging evidence suggests that GLP-1 agonists support beneficial microbial growth, reduce inflammation in the gut, and may even help restore microbial balance disrupted by obesity and insulin resistance.

GLP-1 RAs appear to shift the gut microbial ecosystem in favorable ways. For example, they reduce populations of Bacillota, a group of bacteria linked to obesity and insulin resistance, while also decreasing levels of Gram-negative bacteria that produce inflammatory compounds like lipopolysaccharides (LPS).

These changes could have systemic anti-inflammatory effects—benefitting not just metabolic health but possibly alleviating conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

T2DM itself is known to disrupt the gut microbiome, often leading to reduced diversity and a decline in beneficial genera like Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, and Faecalibacterium, with increases in potentially harmful genera such as Ruminococcus, Fusobacterium, and Blautia.

The current review focused on how GLP-1 RAs—through their microbial effects—might influence the development and progression of T2DM.

The review analyzed 38 studies, most of which examined changes in the gut microbiome using fecal samples. Notably, 27 studies focused on liraglutide, while only 8 included human participants; the rest were conducted in animal models.

Liraglutide consistently promoted the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila, a microbe known to support gut barrier integrity and metabolic health. It also increased levels of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a key butyrate-producing bacterium with anti-inflammatory properties. At the same time, it reduced the prevalence of inflammation-associated microbes.

Exenatide and exendin-4 showed similar benefits in animal studies, enhancing populations of Akkermansia and Barnesiella, while suppressing bacteria linked to dysbiosis. In human studies, these agents increased levels of Coprococcus and Bifidobacterium, which are associated with improved metabolic outcomes and reduced inflammation.

Both liraglutide and exenatide also increased Lactobacillus reuteri, a beneficial microbe that enhances intestinal barrier function and promotes GLP-1 secretion.

Dulaglutide was less studied but showed promising signs in animals, increasing beneficial bacteria like Bacteroides, Akkermansia, and Ruminococcus. Human studies reported only minor shifts, with Lactobacillus being one notable increase.

Semaglutide produced mixed results in animal models. While it boosted A. muciniphila, it also appeared to reduce overall microbial diversity. These effects may depend on factors such as baseline metabolic status, dietary habits, and comorbid conditions.

This growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 analogs could influence the gut microbiome in ways that support long-term metabolic and intestinal health. As the review concludes, “The effect of GLP-1 analogues on the gut microbiota may have a positive impact on the long-term treatment of diabetes.”

However, further work is needed. Standardized study designs, consistent reporting methods, and better control of lifestyle and dietary variables are crucial to deepen our understanding of these interactions.

More robust human studies will be especially important to validate these findings and explore how microbial changes might affect patient outcomes over time.

Cancer ravages both body and mind. If you've ever lost loved ones to the disease, you might recognize the physical and emotional changes cancer patients often endure during their final months. They seem drained of strength and spirit. Even people who've maintained a positive outlook throughout their lives can enter a state of despair. New research published in Science suggests apathy and lack of motivation are symptoms of a condition called cancer cachexia. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) Associate Professor Tobias Janowitz explains:

""Many patients complain of symptoms in that category. They say, 'I don't know what's going on with me. My relatives cooked my favorite meal. I don't feel like eating it.' Their grandchildren come for a playdate. Usually, they'd be excited and enjoy it. They just don't seem to engage so much.""

Also frustrating, cachexia severely limits patients' ability to tolerate common cancer treatments. CSHL scientists have been studying the condition for years. Now, in a major development, Janowitz and colleague Adam Kepecs at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis (WashU Medicine) have identified a connection between the brain and the immune system that is responsible for cachexia-related apathy.

They found that as cachexia progresses, certain neurons release less and less dopamine. That's the brain's ""feel-good"" chemical. Screening for elevated immune system proteins in the brains and bodies of mice with cachexia led the team to IL-6, which gets released during inflammation and has long been associated with cachexia. Decreasing IL-6 signals in connected brain areas made the mice more motivated. Notably, the mice became less sensitive to the amount of effort required to find food. The scientists saw the same result when elevating dopamine levels in the right brain areas.

We discovered a full brain circuit that senses inflammation in the bloodstream and sends signals that reduce motivation. This reveals that apathy isn't just an emotional or psychological reaction to cachexia-it's built into the biology of the disease.""

Adam Kepecs, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis

The discovery further suggests that existing antibody treatments could be repurposed to improve cancer patients' quality of life. ""Our goals are to make patients feel better and to treat the cancer better,"" Janowitz explains.

""A better patient will be able to better tolerate and benefit from anti-cancer treatments.""

Working across cancer and neuroscience has brought the researchers this far. Their ultimate hope is that one day, through continued interdisciplinary collaboration, they will help turn cachexia into a condition patients can overcome. That would be a welcome development not only for people battling cancer but also for their loved ones who suffer alongside them.

Patients with acute liver failure (ALF) or acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are at high risk of bleeding with traditional artificial liver support systems. To address the bleeding risk in liver failure patients, the safety of regional mesylate anticoagulation (RMA) in centrifugation artificial liver support systems (cALSS) is proposed for study.

In this prospective single-arm study, ALF and ACLF patients were treated with cALSS using RMA. Coagulation function was monitored, and the predictors of mesylate dose were analyzed using the area under the curve (AUC). Blood ammonia, model for end-stage liver disease scores, and survival rates at 28 and 90 days were assessed.

All 57 patients showed no new bleeding within 24 h post-cALSS. Most disseminated intravascular coagulation indicators improved at 0.5 h and 24 h post-cALSS. Thromboelastography showed hypocoagulability at 0.5 h post-cALSS. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified pre-R and pre-MA as key factors for R exceeding 10 m at 0.5 h post-cALSS, with odds ratios of 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84–0.98) and 2.03 (95% CI: 1.05–3.90), respectively, P < 0.05. The predictive values were pre-MA ≤ 38 mm (AUC = 0.817, 95% CI [0.690–0.907], P < 0.001) and pre-R > 6.3 m (AUC = 0.790, 95% CI [0.661–0.888], P < 0.001). Patients showed improvements in blood ammonia and model for end-stage liver disease scores after the last session, especially those with high initial levels (>80 µmol/L and >30). The 28-day and 90-day survival rates of ALF patients were similar to those of ACLF patients.

cALSS with RMA is safe for liver failure patients with a high risk of bleeding. Adjusting the mesylate dose based on pre-R and pre-MA enhances safety.

The fatigue and lack of motivation that many cancer patients experience near the end of life have been seen as the unavoidable consequences of their declining physical health and extreme weight loss. But new research from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis challenges that long-held assumption, showing instead that these behavioral changes stem from specific inflammation-sensing neurons in the brain.

In a study published April 11 in Science, the researchers report that they identified a direct connection between cancer-related inflammation and the loss of motivation characteristic of advanced cancer. Studying mice with cancer-linked cachexia, a condition typical of the disease that leads to muscle wasting and weight loss, they discovered a previously unrecognized pathway in the brain. This pathway senses inflammation and actively suppresses dopamine - a key driver of motivation - resulting in apathy and loss of drive.

Blocking the pathway restored motivation, even though the cancer and weight loss continued. This indicates that apathy can be treated separately from the disease itself.

The implications of the research are profound. We've uncovered a direct brain mechanism through which inflammation drives apathy in cancer, and we were able to restore normal motivation in mice with cachexia, despite ongoing inflammation as cancer progressed.""

Adam Kepecs, PhD,  study's lead author, professor of neuroscience and of psychiatry at WashU Medicine

About 70% of patients with advanced cancer experience cachexia. In addition to physical decline, patients often suffer from severe fatigue, apathy and a lack of motivation that affect their overall quality of life.

To understand whether these psychological symptoms are side effects that emerge from physical deterioration or whether they arise from distinct biological mechanisms, the research team, including Marco Pignatelli, MD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at WashU Medicine, and Tobias Janowitz, MD, PhD, an associate professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, turned to a well-validated mouse model of cancer cachexia. They focused specifically on behavioral symptoms, which had not previously been investigated, and mapped the brain regions involved.

They discovered that a structure in the brainstem, a part of the brain that controls vital functions such as breathing and heart rate, acts as a sensor for inflammatory signals in the bloodstream, particularly a molecule called interleukin-6 (IL-6), which is elevated in cancer cachexia. When IL-6 levels rise, neurons in this region of the brainstem transmit a signal through a defined pathway that suppresses dopamine release in a part of the brain called the nucleus accumbens, which is key for motivation and reward. The resulting drop in dopamine had the effect of making the mice less motivated to exert themselves to complete activities.

To see if interfering with this response could treat the lack of motivation and apathy, Kepecs and his colleagues tried two different approaches: they boosted dopamine levels and blocked inflammation-sensing neurons in the brainstem. Both approaches eliminated or reduced apathy in the mice. Treating the mice with an IL-6 antibody similar to an existing FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis, an inflammatory condition, also restored the animal's motivation, a finding that points to a potential treatment for the psychological symptoms associated with advanced cancer.

""What's remarkable is that motivation was restored even in late-stage disease,"" said Pignatelli. ""It suggests we may be able to improve quality of life by targeting the brain circuit.""

For acute illnesses such as infections, this inflammation-driven reduction in motivation may be adaptive, helping the body conserve energy to fight off disease, Kepecs explained. But in chronic conditions such as cachexia, prolonged apathy - including a reduced drive to eat, move or engage socially – can become harmful, worsening health and quality of life. Because IL-6 - the inflammatory molecule driving this effect - is elevated in many other conditions, and the brain regions involved are central to motivation, this same circuit likely contributes to apathy across a range of chronic illnesses.

""This gives us a new way to understand apathy in advanced cancer,"" said Kepecs. ""It's not just a byproduct of physical decline, but a direct response to inflammation in the brain. That means we can potentially target the underlying biology to improve motivation and quality of life - even when the cancer itself is no longer treatable.""

NWSL

LOS ANGELES — Billie Jean King can work a room like few others in women's sports.

It is no different at the SheBelieves Summit in Los Angeles, as she headlines the U.S. Soccer event intended to empower women across sports and business. There's an immediate standing ovation from the crowd when she takes the stage, sporting a blue Adidas tracksuit with matching shoes, a string of pearls and the contrasting pop of red from her glasses and lipstick.

Advertisement

Only the 81-year-old, who won 12 Grand Slam singles, helped found the WTA Tour and spearheaded equal prize money in tennis, could get away with an all-Adidas look at a Nike-sponsored event.

“The more you know about history, the more you know about yourself,” she tells the sea of mostly young women staring in rapt attention, many taking notes in their brand new co-branded notebooks handed out in the day's swag bag. “Most importantly, it helps you shape the future. That's the reason I want you to know about history.”

There are few better ambassadors for the history of women's sports and the future than King, as she continues to build alongside her wife Ilana Kloss. And King is not slowing down. In addition to her eponymous foundation and the Women's Sports Foundation, and her investment portfolio across various sports including the Los Angeles Sparks, Angel City FC and the entirety of the Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL), King is also trying to finish a college degree that she never actually completed at California State University.

In the cavernous room at an event space in downtown Los Angeles, branded heavily by U.S. Soccer but still resembling its true roots as a half-rustic half-industrial wedding venue, King hits the big stories she wants, maybe needs, to hit. She quizzes the crowd on the language of Title IX and its impact.

Former U.S. women's national team champion Julie Foudy sits alongside King on stage for the headlining panel and points to her own history with King. The stories are centered around conflict with the U.S. Soccer Federation over contracts and pay. Even a few years ago, to talk openly about this sort of conflict with the federation at their own, very expensive event, would have felt unimaginable.

“She is literally the thread that runs through women's sports history,” Foudy says.

“Learn the business you're in,” King says to the crowd. She feels passionate about that, and it's clear she doesn't think enough current athletes are digging into that work.

Backstage, a gravitational pull surrounds King after she steps behind the curtains. The aura is real. The walk between the backstage and the green room is maybe 50 steps; King is stopped multiple times. There are many photographs. She is handed things, she takes them.

Finally, in the relative quiet of the green room, King lists all the things she could have talked about — the things she should have talked about. There could have been more about Angel City, about Michele Kang and how her buying the Washington Spirit increased the value of every other NWSL team. She's seen that impact firsthand, as her and Kloss's investment grew with Angel City's recent sale for $250 million.

King has been thinking about the relationship between money and women's sports for decades, even if her approach isn't always the most popular one. Her mood on stage had been upbeat. Here, even pausing 20 minutes for an interview, she has a sense of urgency, still prodding to find every single seam she can to break through. Maybe that's why she admires Kang so much — how one transaction had jolted an entire league forward.

“Everybody understands money,” King says. That's never changed. Money is why she wanted to pull in a $100,000 paycheck because people would understand that nice big number.

“They'll start watching the tour, and I can talk about the other players,” King recalled. “I can talk about our dreams, I can talk about the future generations and all that.”

Money has changed the world of women's sports in a lot of ways, but the rapid influx of investment and viewers over the past few years means the feel of a decade ago is fading, maybe gone already — players staying after games until every fan gets an autograph or a selfie, for instance. The accessibility of players isn't what it used to be, for anyone. It can't be.

This strikes a nerve with King. It bothers her, she says. She tells players they have to be available for the media, for reporters to tell their story. The players will say they have social media now.

“I don't care,” she says, throwing her hand in the air. “You need everything.”

Her argument could come off as a lecture, but it goes back to what King said in her panel. Athletes must understand every part of the business — how they work together and how the money flows through the sport and into their pockets.

“These (reporters) are trying to make a living, and they're covering our lives, our sport,” she says. “I'm so thankful to the media because we didn't have anything then, except them, and they told our story. But we killed ourselves to be available. We didn't leave the arena until we signed every autograph. I was doing interviews at two o'clock in the morning for magazines. I'm big on that; this is part of our job, to give people time and effort.”

There is a dark side to women's sports and accessibility, though. Tennis player Emma Raducanu's life changed after an experience with a spectator with “fixated behavior” in Dubai. Raducanu opened up about how vulnerable she felt and how she's rarely alone to provide some additional safety and support. It's not just a tennis problem. Last year, a 40-year-old man pled guilty to stalking UConn's Paige Bueckers after he was arrested walking on a Connecticut highway from the airport to the university. Caitlin Clark has been a target as well.

“Security is another aspect,” King says. “There's another job, or two jobs, or four or six.”

She has her own story on this front about Monica Seles, working directly with her to make her feel safe at a Fed Cup (now the Billie Jean King Cup) following her return from a stabbing attack in 1993. That's still the specter that lingers in everyone's mind on this issue.

“If we have the money, we have to pay for security. We have to take care of that, and that's part of the deal,” King says. There are risks everywhere; this is not one that King wants to allow to shape women's sports. This cannot stop the larger project.

“We're so in our infancy, but we have to just keep busting our backsides to get it out there, to get the women's names out there and to talk about them,” King says. “We just have to keep doing what we're doing because we need media. Once we get media, we get attention. Once we get attention, people know who we are.”

This is where it's fair to expect some sort of victory. Instead, King says, “Well. It's difficult.”

This is why she wants everyone to know the history. She's been first in a lot of things, like being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. But where she asks, are the same honors for those that came before her, that were her heroes, like Althea Gibson? The national tennis center and grounds of the U.S. Open in Queens were named after King; Arthur Ashe had a stadium named after him, and a statue installed on the grounds.

“Took 30 years,” King says, “we finally got (Gibson) something at the Open.” A granite statue honoring Gibson was installed in 2019.

“These are the challenges, the 24/7 things, that go in my head all the time. And I just would like to have it change somehow.”

King's car is waiting to take her to the next stop on her day. Just like the long walk from backstage to the green room, it takes a while for her to make it to the door. Even here, people are waiting for her, for a word, a hug, a check-in of what's next. There's always something up next, after all.

SoccerToday features original articles with exclusive interviews plus influential columnists covering youth and professional soccer, coaching, nutrition, and the wonderful soccer life.

Macario Scores Early, But Brazil Answers Late in Second Match of Doubleheader as Emma Hayes Continues to Prioritize Youth Development

In a match that showcased the evolving identity of the U.S. Women's National Team under head coach Emma Hayes, Brazil emerged with a 2-1 victory on April 9, scoring a dramatic stoppage-time winner in the second of two high-profile friendlies between two global powerhouses.

While the USWNT won the first match 2-0 in Inglewood on April 5, the second leg—played just days later—provided valuable minutes for rising stars and served as another step in what Hayes has described as a critical phase of building the next generation of champions. As SoccerToday has covered in recent weeks, Hayes has emphasized giving young players real experience on the international stage—a commitment clearly reflected in this latest roster.

The Americans struck first—and fast. Just 34 seconds after kickoff, forward Catarina Macario capitalized on a loose ball following a creative give-and-go with Alyssa Thompson, scoring her 10th career international goal and her first against the country of her birth, Brazil. It was the seventh-fastest goal in USWNT history and a reminder of the dynamic threat Macario brings, especially when fully fit.

Michelob Ultra Woman of the Match: Cat Macario

Macario's goal held added significance. The Stanford alumna found the net at Levi's Stadium—just 20 miles from where she helped lead her college team to a national title in 2019.

Brazil equalized in the 24th minute as Kerolin, the former NWSL MVP, found space in the box and launched a shot past U.S. goalkeeper Mandy McGlynn. The game remained deadlocked until the dying moments, when a U.S. free kick turned into a counterattack that saw Luany fly down the flank and assist Amanda Gutierres for a tap-in game-winner in the 95th minute.

It marked Brazil's first win over the USA since 2014, and only their fourth all-time.

Despite the loss, the performance reflected Hayes' strategic vision. With a starting lineup averaging just 17.9 caps, it was the least-experienced USWNT XI in over two decades. At 26, Macario was the second-oldest starter. Veteran Emily Sonnett, with 107 caps, had more international experience than the rest of the starters combined.

Editorial Note: Will American soccer fans question Emma Hayes' prioritizing youth in USWNT's 2-1 Loss to Brazil because she chose to plan for the future and player pathway taking center stage? Leadership is never easy, and we are relying on our choice of head coach to make the tough decisions to pave the way to a strong, dynamic, and bright future, so we should support her choices.

This match also marked a milestone for several future stars:

These aren't just debuts—they're building blocks. Hayes is leaning into youth not just for depth, but to identify the players who can grow into leaders by 2027 and beyond.

While the late-game breakdown stung, the takeaway is clear: under Hayes, the U.S. is committed to redefining its player pathway and trusting the process. It's a long-term play rooted in development, resilience, and tactical growth.

Veterans like Crystal Dunn, Sam Coffey, and Lindsey Horan were introduced in the second half to stabilize the squad, and Hayes' use of seven substitutions (including a concussion sub) demonstrated her willingness to test combinations under pressure.

As SoccerToday continues to cover, this transitional phase isn't just about building a competitive roster—it's about setting the tone for the future of American women's soccer, from the grassroots to the global stage.

The U.S. will return to action with a two-match series against China PR on May 31 in St. Paul, Minnesota, and June 3 in St. Louis, Missouri. Expect continued experimentation—and more young players seizing their moment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Is it time to give up on Gio Reyna becoming the USMNT's next star?","https://www.espn.com/soccer/insider/story/_/id/44603290/is-usmnt-fans-give-gio-reyna","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 12:11:00 GMT","

If you're trying to do any kind of statistical analysis of Gio Reyna's career, there's only really one dataset that has a big enough sample size.

Since what seemed like a breakout season at age 17 in 2020-21 -- four goals, five assists across 23 Bundesliga starts for Borussia Dortmund -- he has barely played. In the four seasons since, he has made just 14 starts, scored 11 goals and assisted four more. He's played just over 4,000 league minutes for Dortmund, attempted 88 shots, created 77 chances, and tried to beat a player off the dribble 81 times.

In this season alone, 12 players have attempted more shots, one has created more chances, and 87 have taken on more defenders across Europe's Big Five top leagues. We basically have one-plus full seasons of professional soccer for Reyna, played across six calendar years.

And so, all we really know about Gio Reyna is that his parents needed to read ""How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kids for Success"" and that he's always injured.

-Live on ESPN+ Watch Dortmund in Der Klassiker vs. Bayern Munich (Saturday, 12:25 p.m. ET)

For the lack of game-play data, we do have a ton of injury data. Per the site Transfermarkt, Reyna has missed 498 days due to injury since his career began, for 17 different reasons: colds, illnesses, infections, strains and fissures of the fibula. There's a fantastic book coming out soon from former ESPN editor Henry Abbott, ""Ballistic,"" about the new science of injury prevention. If anyone from Reyna's team is reading this, I would highly recommend reading that book, too.

But beyond that, I can provide no insight on how to fix Gio Reyna's body because I am not a doctor. However, some newly available data can shine a light on how all the injuries may have affected the way Reyna plays for his club and the U.S. men's national team. He's not only missing lots of games, but he's moving very differently on the field.

International Football

When Gregg Berhalter took a largely MLS-based squad to the 2021 Gold Cup, the decision was part of Berhalter's grand plan to expand the U.S. player pool ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Momentum was on his side. Berhalter had celebrated a Concacaf Nations League title over Mexico (a 3-2 extra-time win in Denver) with his full senior roster, and the young Americans were viewed as a promising generation of European-based players ahead of the World Cup in Qatar.

Advertisement

The nominal U.S. B-team reached that Gold Cup final and handed a veteran Mexico side a second consecutive final defeat to lift the continental trophy. It was arguably the highest point of Berhalter's tenure. The squad's depth was celebrated, and the U.S. was hands down the strongest team in the region.

Four years later, the tides have turned against the Americans. The U.S. is drowning in a sea of heightened expectations ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which it will co-host with Mexico and Canada. Manager Mauricio Pochettino, after just eight games in charge, is in need of a signature win after the U.S. finished fourth in the Nations League finals.

The Europe-based players, led by Christian Pulisic, Tyler Adams, Tim Weah and Weston McKennie, are under increased pressure after their poor performances in Los Angeles in March. The unheralded U.S. team at the 2021 Gold Cup showed fight and grit in their defeat of Mexico, something that has been lacking ever since Pochettino replaced Berhalter last fall.

It will all come to a head in June when the U.S. faces Trinidad & Tobago, Haiti and guest nation Saudi Arabia in Concacaf's premier tournament, with the groups confirmed in Thursday night's draw.

Make no mistake: the U.S. has to win this Gold Cup. And Pochettino has to take his strongest-possible squad, not an experimental one. He is in dire need of positive energy and will have no excuses as the U.S. will once again play a tournament comfortably held on U.S. soil. The Americans won't face hostile crowds unless a matchup against Mexico materializes in the knockout rounds. But they wouldn't face Mexico in Guadalajara or in Mexico City. The U.S. will still be at home – not that it was much of a help in last summer's pre-Pochettino Copa América or last month's Nations League finals.

Advertisement

Nevertheless, the group is beyond manageable. If an overconfident or uninterested U.S. team flops this summer, the pitchforks won't necessarily be out for Pochettino, but his reputation, and that of the players, will take another hit. No matter how secure his job is, or how large his contract buyout may be, Pochettino must lead the U.S. to a trophy. Not to save his job, but, rather, to fend off the growing sense of negativity around the senior national team – at a time when galvanizing the country around this team is paramount.

His previous record as a manager who punched above his weight in Europe made for a nice story when he was hired by U.S. Soccer. Right now, however, his inexperience at the international level, and his lack of knowledge of American soccer and the types of players the country produces, is shining far brighter than his résumé.

Pochettino looked befuddled at his players' casual approach in losses to Panama and Canada last month. He was at a loss of words and asked the American soccer public to have patience just 426 days before the 2026 World Cup.

“I don't want the people to feel pessimistic,” Pochettino said after the 2-1 loss to Canada in the Nations League third-place game at SoFi Stadium. “Disappointed? Disappointed, we are all. And the fans need to feel the disappointment that we didn't win. But I don't want to allow (them) to feel pessimistic, because I think we have good players. We are going to find a way to perform. And for sure we are going to compete in a different way. And (at) the end, we are going to get different results than Thursday and today.”

Because Borussia Dortmund and Juventus will participate in the Club World Cup this summer, Pochettino will be without playmaker Gio Reyna, who plays sparingly for the German club, and McKennie and Weah, who are key players for the Serie A giant. FIFA has given participating clubs player priority over national teams, so barring any transfers, they won't be available. Pulisic, however, will be, as AC Milan is not in the Club World Cup. If Pochettino is thinking about giving Pulisic the summer off, he should reconsider.

Pulisic didn't end the Nations League unscathed. His performances were muted as team captain. His messaging, though, was on point, albeit it painfully obvious after a tremendously disappointing tournament. Pulisic should not be given a pass this summer.

“Obviously, the feeling is not good right now,” he said after last month's loss to Canada. “We need to turn it around and we can hopefully build some momentum this summer, because we really do need it and with big, big tournaments ahead.”

For whatever reason, the Gold Cup has gradually lost its prestige. Nations League has soaked up the narratives and is growing in popularity, despite its young history as an official competition. That should not matter. The Gold Cup will be the last opportunity for Pochettino to test his players in a tournament environment before their opening match at the World Cup. Certain places on the squad, namely in midfield, at center forward, at center back and at goalkeeper, should be up for grabs.

That puts Pochettino in a complex position. If he's going to experiment, he better get it right. If he's going to demote a player, say like starting goalkeeper Matt Turner, the replacement has to elevate the team. If Real Salt Lake No. 10 Diego Luna is viewed as a viable alternative for a World Cup-bound team, then the 21-year-old must take a major stride as a creative player this summer. In Los Angeles last month, the U.S. side was void of leadership on the pitch.

“The mentality has to change,” Adams said before the Canada game. “We've had good talks about where we are and where we need to go, just an honest evaluation and then there needs to be a response.”

There wasn't a response against Jesse Marsch's Canadian side. Adams talked like a team leader, but he was among the squad's most subpar performers. The Gold Cup will be a referendum for the Bournemouth midfielder, as well. The expectation is that he will be joined by fellow Premier League standout Antonee Robinson.

The 27-year-old missed Nations League through injury, but he has since reclaimed his starting position with Fulham, and is widely considered as one of the best left backs in England. Robinson's direct play, speed and service were missed last month, and Pochettino will be relieved if Robinson is fit for competition this summer. He has no like-for-like replacement on the U.S., and, along with Pulisic, Robinson will be counted on at the Gold Cup to provide a higher level of play in a key position.

When Pochettino was hired, the Gold Cup was viewed as an important dress rehearsal before the 2026 World Cup. After underperforming at the Nations League, this is no time to experiment with the player pool. The U.S. and Pochettino must now approach the Gold Cup as a test of their dwindling fortitude. Regional foes like Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama and Canada are eagerly waiting for an opportunity to bury the Americans in their own mediocrity.

If Pochettino and his players don't punch back this summer, the pessimism that the former Tottenham manager wants to stamp out will further engulf a program that's swinging and missing more often than expected.

We analyze the teams that the USMNT will see in the group stage

The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup Draw occurred last night, and the United States Men's National Team saw themselves drawn into Group D with Haiti, Trinidad & Tobago, and Saudi Arabia. The USMNT enters the tournament seeking its eighth Gold Cup title in what will be the final competition the team plays before it steps onto the field next June as co-hosts to begin the 2026 World Cup.

Group D for the @GoldCup is set! pic.twitter.com/LJkQiytEso

Ranked 16th in the world, the USMNT needs to regroup after a disastrous Concacaf Nations League Finals, where they finished 4th among the 4 teams that competed. Their road back to showing that they can contend for a World Cup title as hosts must include getting back to the top of Concacaf, and the Gold Cup is the last chance they have to show that.

Group D will present some tests for the USMNT, as Haiti has given them fits over the years, Trinidad & Tobago has beaten them in a couple infamous matches, and Saudi Arabia can play anyone tough. While the schedule is expected to be released on Friday, the USMNT will need to mentally prepare for the group stage grind no matter what order they face their opponents.

Haiti, the 83rd ranked team in the world, last faced the USMNT in the opening match of the 2021 Gold Cup group stage. The USMNT won 1-0 behind Sam Vines' first international goal. The USMNT is 7-6-5 (W-L-D) all-time against Les Grenadiers.

Trinidad & Tobago, ranked 100th in the world, has been a thorn in the USMNT's side for years, and it feels like they have drawn them in several recent competitions. The last time the two teams met was in the 2023 Concacaf Nations League Quarterfinals. In the 2-legged series, the USMNT 3-0 won in Austin in November 2023, with goals from Ricardo Pepi, Antonee Robinson, and Gio Reyna coming in the final 10 minutes of the match. They followed that up with a 2-1 loss in Port of Spain that included a wild Sergiño Dest outburst that got him sent off in the first half. Still, the USMNT advanced to the Nations League Finals, where they claimed their third straight title. The USMNT is 22-4-4 all-time against the Soca Warriors

Saudi Arabia is currently 58th in the world, and the USMNT is 3-2-2 against them all-time. They last faced in a friendly in Murcia, Spain back in September 2022, which was a scoreless draw. It was the last match for both teams before the 2022 World Cup.

The group is a manageable one for the United States, even with a roster that may be missing some players due to injury or FIFA Club World Cup duty. While the three teams in Group D with them will fight them tough, the USMNT on paper should be the team that easily advances out of the group. The winner of Group D would move on to face the runner-up in Group A, which could be Costa Rica or even a surprise from Suriname. However, finishing second in Group D would likely mean a quarterfinal date with Mexico. That makes getting through the group unscathed even more important for the United States to try and make their path to the Gold Cup final be without the emotions of one of the biggest rivalries in the world.

The USMNT's Gold Cup path is now laid out in front of them. They now have two months to prepare to fight for the title and get back to the top of Concacaf and show the progress necessary to lift hopes for next summer.

The U.S. men's national team has learned its opponents for this summer's CONCACAF Gold Cup. 

Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia have been paired with Mauricio Pochettino's squad for the upcoming tournament. The USMNT last won the Gold Cup in 2021 and overall have won the competition seven times. 

The Americans are unbeaten in their last nine head-to-head matches with Haiti despite losing the previous seven encounters prior. The USMNT holds a 22-4-5 record against Trinidad & Tobago and a 3-2-2 record against Saudi Arabia, who are a guest team in the tournament. 

A total of 16 teams will take part in the competition, with the four group winners and four winners-up advancing to the knockout stage. 

The knockout stage will feature the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds before the final takes place at Houston's NRG Stadium on July 6. 

Mexico are the reigning champions of the competition. 

Here is a closer look at the remaining three groups for the Gold Cup:

Group A: Mexico, Costa Rica, Suriname, Dominican Republic Group B: Canada, Honduras, El Salvador, Curacao Group C: Panama, Jamaica, Guatemala, Guadeloupe 

are we sending the A team to the gold cup?

If the US gets grouped in this tournament Poch should be fired, no excuses, get a result.

Thank goodness Panama was a seeded team!

Looking forward to it. Hope to see Luna in the starting 11. He is the new Dempsey.

“He is the new Dempsey.”

Maybe some day but right now that's very, very premature. 

Clint was much more of a scorer while Luna is more of a playmaker.

I don't know much about Luna who seems like a great guy but Clint was one of the two toughest, most hard core, driven individuals who ever played for the USMNT that I knew of ( the other one being Jermaine Jones). 

When Clint first came up for the USMNT fans blasted him for being too selfish and caring only about money and not caring enough about the USMNT.

Since you mentioned him here are some quotes from Clint in an article in ESPN the magazine just before the 2010 World Cup:”

– “I don't want to get into how I'm perceived there versus here in the U.S. But I'm respected in Europe for what I do week in and week out on the highest level.”

– “In big games, I always come through.”

– “It was good for my first goal to mean so much,” says Dempsey [who went to Fulham from the New England Revolution of the MLS on a $5 million transfer and scored a goal that saved Fulham from relegation] “I paid back the club for my transfer fee. I wasn't in debt to them.”

– “I pride myself on stepping up on big occasions.”

– “People who aren't educated about the game are going to take whatever a commentator has to say as the complete truth. And that's not always the case. That's just their opinion.”

– “I was top three in the whole tournament in distance covered,” he says. “You can question my effectiveness, but you can't question my heart and my effort.”

– “I'm respected by my teammates. And I'm respected by my coaches. That's why they keep me on the field. The criticism comes with the money we get paid.”

– “Off the pitch, the best thing about [playing in the Premier League] is more money in your account. You go to Europe for the competition, for the soccer and for more financial stability for your family.”

– “I'm from nowhere, man.” [Regarding growing up in Nacogdoches, TX]

– “I feel like I'm effective no matter where I am on the field.”

– “I enjoy playing up top, because the closer you are to goal, the more chances you're going to get, and one of my favorite parts of the game is scoring goals.”

– “You start to think that fate's on your side. There's a chance to do something unbelievable.”

– “You can be the face [of US soccer] or not be the face. You get only so many opportunities in major competitions, and you've got to take advantage of them. I gotta stand up and be counted in this World Cup.”

Is it bad that even with a group this weak I still wonder if we're even going to get out of it? I mean…I hope not, but….

That's bad because that would be a level of futility that is orders of magnitude worse than our worst performances in the past year or so. It just means you are far more pessimistic than is warranted. It's about you more than the team.

The first-ever FIFA Club World Cup takes place this summer, with the tournament played in the United States between June and July.

The competition will follow the same setup as the traditional World Cup involving 32 nations every four years, this time with 32 domestic clubs competing for the prize, one of which is Real Madrid.

Marca have reported that Real Madrid and Boca Juniors are the two teams that have sold all their allocations for their three group-stage games.

Los Blancos are well-known across the globe, especially in North America. Argentina side Boca Juniors are also a huge club with a massive fan base alongside fellow domestic rivals River Plate, who is also in the tournament.

🚨 Real Madrid will get €145m from FIFA if they win the Club World Cup in July. How the money will be distributed:• Real Madrid's participation: €35m• 3 wins in the group stage: €6m• Ro16: €7m• Quarter-final: €12m• Semi-final: €20m• Final: €28m• Winner:… pic.twitter.com/PApEaryyse

Carlo Ancelotti's side play their three group games in Miami, Charlotte, and Philadelphia, with the former a hot spot for Rea Madrid fan bases.

The Spanish champions have seen their grip slip on their La Liga and Champions League crowns in the last week. Despite being in the Copa del Rey final, the Club World Cup could be the last chance for a major trophy this season if things don't turn around.

Chelsea are currently navigating a crucial final couple of months of their season, but in the back of their minds they'll know the Club World Cup tournament is just around the corner.

The Blues are looking to finish strongly in their final seven Premier League games. As it stands, they sit fourth in the division table, and the top five qualify for the Champions League. On top of that, Enzo Maresca's side are competing in the quarter-finals of this season's Conference League.

In mid-June, the Club World Cup kicks off, which is a 32-team tournament that includes both Chelsea and Manchester City.

Chelsea will take the Club World Cup seriously because of the financial rewards, so it could be an interesting watch for supporters over the summer.

Chelsea have a number of talented players current thriving out on loan, including Andrey Santos.

Apparently, the on-loan Strasbourg midfielder is going to be drafted straight into the Blues group to feature at the upcoming summer tournament.

According to AS, Chelsea's plan is to use 20-year-old star Santos at the Club World Cup.

The report suggests the Brazilian talent could be used in a new role to partner Moises Caicedo and Enzo Fernandez in midfield.

Apparently, Chelsea's hierarchy are counting on Santos to be with them next season and resisted recalling him from his loan in January to allow him to develop further.

Speaking in a recent interview, Santos claimed he's ready to play for Chelsea when asked about his future. His potential participation in the Club World Cup will give him a head start before next season. 

For now, the box-to-box central midfielder will be looking to get Strasbourg over the line for Champions League qualification. Without a doubt, he's been one of the outstanding performers in the French top flight this season.

While it's been suggested that Santos could form a midfield three at Chelsea in the Club World Cup, we see him as a direct competitor for Fernandez in the starting XI next season.

In recent months, Fernandez is thriving in a No 8 position covering every blade of grass. He's accompanied by Caicedo as the defensive midfield destroyer, while Cole Palmer produces his magic in the No 10 spot.

It's interesting to compare the respective league form of Santos and Fernandez this season:

Chelsea's midfield depth next season will definitely become a lot stronger with the introduction of Santos. Fans should definitely be excited about getting a first glimpse of him in the summer.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

...

Real Madrid defender Eder Militao will not be fit to participate in the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup, according to journalist Marco Ruiz's update in AS.

This comes as a blow to the Spanish giants, who have been dealing with defensive issues this season.

With La Liga already slipping out of reach and a heavy 0-3 defeat to Arsenal in the UEFA Champions League quarter-final first leg, Militao's absence from the Club World Cup becomes a crucial miss for the club.

Real Madrid's defence has been under scrutiny throughout the season, and with Militao now confirmed to miss the Club World Cup, the team's depth will be further tested.

Despite their struggles, the focus remains on finishing the current season on a strong note.

Although La Liga is becoming increasingly difficult to win and the Champions League seems out of reach, the FIFA Club World Cup remains a key objective for the team.

However, Militao's absence from this tournament means that Real Madrid must adapt without one of their top defensive players.

The good news for Real Madrid is that Militao has been spotted working on the pitch with the ball in recent weeks, signalling positive progress in his recovery.

While he will not be available for the FIFA Club World Cup, the fact that he is actively training with the ball suggests that his return is not far off.

His focus is now on being in peak condition for Real Madrid's pre-season campaign, which is where he hopes to regain full fitness and fight for a starting spot.

Now, Militao's long-term goals include being fully fit for the new season, and although his immediate return to action won't be possible, the defender's determination to recover and be at his best is evident.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Tuttosport newspaper reports that Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund is open to joining Juventus with the Bianconeri looking for an attacking reinforcement for the Club World Cup.

Manchester United forward Hojlund is open to discussing a summer transfer to Juventus after the Bianconeri established contact with his entourage.

The latest Tuttosport report claims that the ex-Atalanta star is willing to negotiate with the Serie A giants who are looking for an attacking reinforcement for the imminent Club World Cup.

Transfer expert Matteo Moretto already reported that Juventus had made preliminary contact for the Manchester United striker, who has also attracted interest from Napoli.

Juventus are expected to part ways with Arek Milik as the Poland international has been struggling with injuries this season and hasn't yet made a single appearance in 2024-25.

Furthermore, Randal Kolo Muani is on loan from PSG until the end of June, while Dusan Vlahovic has a contract expiring in 2026 and is expected to go on the market as he's unwilling to extend.

Hojlund is among the Bianconeri transfer targets in attack for 2025-26 alongside Atalanta's Ademola Lookman and Napoli-owned Victor Osimhen.

FIFA announced yesterday that the $1M from the soccer governing body that Club World Cup host cities will receive will go “to support community soccer projects in the future,” according to Safid Deen of USA TODAY. Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, L.A., Miami, Nashville, N.Y./N.J., Orlando, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington D.C. will host Club World Cup games, and “benefit from FIFA's ‘legacy contributions' intended to help build small community-focused pitches and leave an impact following this summer's tournament” (USA TODAY, 4/10). In Philadelphia, Kerith Gabriel noted FIFA President Gianni Infantino spoke at an event at Lincoln Financial Field in which officials from FIFA, the Eagles, and the city, including Mayor Cherelle L. Parker, were on hand. Afterward, “fans took photos with the FIFA Club World Cup trophy and the Eagles' two Lombardi trophies in the stadium's Red Zone suites.” Additionally, Infantino and FIFA “disclosed plans to create FIFA Foundation USA to oversee the distribution of its contributions to the 11 U.S. cities hosting the Club World Cup.” A FIFA source noted that the money “most likely would be presented after the Club World Cup” (PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 4/10). 

POLITICS AT PLAY: The AP's Dan Gelston wrote that this week on Ticketmaster or “most secondary market websites,” there are “plenty of seats still available at various stadiums” for this year's Club World Cup in the U.S. The current U.S. political climate “could be enough to scare off fans” from traveling overseas for the games. Infantino met with U.S. President Donald Trump last month in the Oval Office to hype this event and next year's World Cup. Infantino said that he “received assurances” from the White House that “any foreign fans would be in good hands during their time in the United States” (AP, 4/10).

HYPE TOUR: In Philadelphia, Jonathan Tannenwald said that the Club World Cup “hasn't yet been seen as a big deal,” which FIFA has “implicitly acknowledged” by taking Infantino on a publicity tour of the tournament's host cities. He said it out loud as he spoke in front of the trophy. Infantino: “It will be a celebration of soccer, and the stadiums will be full, and fans will be coming from all over the world. Buy tickets. There are still a few available” (PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 4/10).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

Wednesday morning was an exciting one for the City Beautiful, specifically at Inter&Co Stadium.

Just as the sun was rising, the FIFA Club World Cup trophy made its debut at the home of Orlando City SC and Orlando Pride, which will be one of two venues in Orlando to host matches in the upcoming tournament this June.

The soccer-specific stadium will host four teams across two matches: South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. vs. South Korea's Ulsan HD FC and Portugal's SL Benfica vs. Australia's Auckland City FC. The neighbors to the south, Camping World Stadium, will host three matches, including a Round of 16 match later in the month. It's worth noting that the City of Orlando will be the only host city with two separate venues for the upcoming tournament.

From the perspective of Inter&Co Stadium, bringing in a top-tier tournament like the Club World Cup to help showcase the stadium on the world's stage is an opportunity of a lifetime. Orlando City's Chief Operating Officer and General Council, Cesar Lopez, said on Wednesday, ""We have a soccer-specific stadium downtown, wonderful environment, unbelievable passion from our fans, and we're giving them good soccer product. We really want to make sure that ours is a venue that is exposed to the world stage. The excitement that we have with this entire group, and the community is coming together, it's an unbelievable opportunity to show why we're still the number one city in America for sports.""

The biggest part of the undertaking for both venues is involving nearly every sports and tourism entity in Orlando to work hand in hand to help this massive project come to fruition.

Leadership from all surrounding counties, Orlando City and Pride, Florida Citrus Sports, Visit Orlando, Central Florida Hotel and Lodging and so many other individuals helped collaborate on this project. Something that President & CEO of the Greater Orlando Sports Commission Jason Segal made sure to mention on Wednesday.

""None of this happens if we don't have a collaborative community,"" he said, ""It doesn't happen if we don't have great venue partners, and of course, it goes without saying, all of this is on the shoulders Orlando City, Orlando Pride, the Wilf family, their investment into Inter&Co Stadium. So, we're really proud of everything that's transpired over these, you know, past 30, 40 years, which have prepared us for moments like these.""

While the fanfare on Wednesday surrounded the tournament itself, it also brought the President of FIFA, Gianni Infantino, into town to enhance the scale of the day. He spent his morning touring both Inter&Co Stadium and Camping World Stadium, getting a scope of what the City Beautiful would be offering, not just for this summer but potentially further down the line.

The morning culminated in a press conference with Infantino, Segal, and Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer, who all spoke about the upcoming tournament to local dignitaries and partners. The FIFA President talked about the importance of the tournament and the history of soccer in Orlando and finished up by announcing that FIFA would be contributing $1 million to the City to help invest in soccer activities in and around town.

""Orlando has become really a soccer city in the last few years, both on the men's side as well as on the women's side,"" Infantino said. ""A lot of progress has been made with a soccer-specific stadium being built for the soccer teams. A community has been built. Orlando is a big international, multicultural community. So, for us, it was important. [Orlando is] a city that welcomes the world, anyway, [throughout] the whole year, with over 75 million tourists. And now, we bring the world here with the FIFA Club World Cup.""","{'href': 'https://www.orlandocitysc.com', 'title': 'Orlando City'}","soccer"

The 2030 World Cup will be held in six nations across three continents 

An official proposal to expand the men's 2030 World Cup to 64 teams has been put forward by South American governing body Conmebol.

The tournament will be hosted by Spain, Morocco and Portugal, after the opening matches are held in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.

The 2026 World Cup will be the first with 48 teams but Conmebol wants to expand further for 2030 to mark the competition's 100-year anniversary.

""This will allow all countries to have the opportunity to live the world experience and so nobody on the planet is left out of the party,"" said Conmebol president Alejandro Dominguez at the body's congress on Thursday.

""We are convinced that the centennial celebration will be unique because 100 years are celebrated only once.""

The idea was first ""spontaneously raised"" at a Fifa Council meeting in March by Uruguayan Football Federation president Ignacio Alonso.

In a statement on Friday, Fifa said it had a ""duty to analyse any proposal from one of its Council members"".

Gianni Infantino, the president of Fifa, participated in Thursday's Conmebol Congress and highlighted the ""exceptional milestone"" the 2030 tournament would represent.

The decision to expand the 2026 World Cup to 48 teams was taken in 2017 following a unanimous vote at a Fifa congress. 

Fifa's 75th congress will be held in Paraguay on 15 May, when Conmebol's proposal could be discussed. 

Should the proposal eventually be accepted, the 2030 edition would include 128 matches - up from the 64-game format played between 1998 and 2022.

Critics of the expansion say it devalues the qualification process, while Environmental group Fossil Free Football said the decision to host the tournament across three continents was a ""climate nightmare"". 

Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin described the proposal as a ""bad idea"" earlier this month. 

""This proposal was maybe even more surprising for me than you. I think it is a bad idea,"" Ceferin said at a news conference. 

The 2030 World Cup is being held across three continents for the first time.

Spain, Portugal and Morocco were named tournament hosts in 2024, with matches to be held in Argentina and Paraguay to mark the 100-year anniversary of the first World Cup tournament.

Uruguay - the inaugural winners of the competition in 1930 - have since been announced as co-hosts, with the country to host one game.

Would 48-team Women's World Cup be good for the game?

World Cup

New Jersey congressman Josh Gottheimer has written to the new heads of the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security to request that all eight matches at MetLife Stadium during the 2026 World Cup are designated at the highest security ranking to avoid risks to “thousands of fans, players, and law enforcement officials.”

The 82,500-capacity stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., has been awarded five matches during the group phase, as well as a round-of-32 game, a last-16 game and the final at the tournament, which the U.S. will co-host with Canada and Mexico.

Gottheimer's letter said that only the World Cup final at MetLife is currently designated for the highest level of security support (Level 1), with other games at the stadium during the tournament receiving Level 2 status, which has more limited federal support.

Major sports events in the U.S. are given a security risk level, the highest being the Level 1 Special Event Assessment Ranking (SEAR), which are reserved for events of national and international significance. A Level 1 SEAR involves extensive federal interagency support and in the case of MetLife, Rep. Gottheimer says it would ensure that New Jersey State Police and local law enforcement receive maximum support from federal agencies, including equipment, infrastructure, personnel and funding.

Democrat representative Gottheimer first sent a letter in November, which has been seen by The Athletic, requesting the highest-possible security for the MetLife games. This was under the previous U.S. administration headed by President Joe Biden, but Rep. Gottheimer did not receive a reply.

His office has now confirmed to The Athletic that the letter was re-sent in late March to both the FBI and DHS. The new appointees of President Donald Trump's administration — Kash Patel (director of the FBI) and Kristi Noem (Secretary of DHS) — were the recipients.

In the November letter, he wrote: “I am concerned that these ‘Level 2' designations will not provide New Jersey law enforcement officers with the tools and resources they need to keep attendees and the surrounding communities safe. A failure to properly designate all matches being played at MetLife Stadium as “Level 1” risks the security of the thousands of fans, players, and law enforcement officials.”

Gottheimer referenced the difficulties the authorities faced when hosting the Copa América final in Miami last summer. “With large crowds, larger than those at COPA in Miami, high-profile attendees, and global media attention increasing visibility, this can also increase vulnerability. And, since every single World Cup game played here at MetLife will be a national event, every single one of them needs the SEAR 1 designation.

“This will be critical to securing not only this stadium, including the area we are currently standing in, but also to protecting the tens of thousands of people who live here in the greater East Rutherford area. They will be impacted by traffic, public transportation changes, and the massive amount of visitors coming here. Keep in mind, you will have a million fans coming and going, either to the stadium itself, or watching and staying nearby.”

He added: “As a Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, I'm keenly focused on the threats facing our nation, whether that's terrorists from abroad, local cells, or lone wolf extremists at home. Between 1970 and 2019, there were seventy-four terrorist attacks on sports venues around the world.”

The FBI and DHS did not respond on Thursday when asked by The Athletic if all games at MetLife Stadium will be designated Level 1 status.

Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, met with FIFA president Gianni Infantino this week in Miami. He wrote on X: “The FBI is proud to work with FIFA to ensure global security for the upcoming 2026 World Cup in the U.S. Thank you President Gianni Infantino for your collaboration and partnership.”

 Member of Parliament for Ashaiman, Ernest Norgbey

Member of Parliament for Ashaiman, Ernest Norgbey, has refused to credit Black Stars head coach Otto Addo for Ghana's victories over Chad and Madagascar in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers held in March 2025.

According to him, the team won both matches due to the players' determination and hunger, not because of the coach's tactical input.The lawmaker emphasised that he is not a fan of the German-trained coach and believes Otto Addo is not the right person for the Black Stars job.“I may not be a big fan of Otto Addo, not because he's not a good coach, but because he's not the right coach for the Black Stars of Ghana,” he told CitiSports.“The wins against Chad and Madagascar were not due to any tactical discipline but rather the motivation and hunger of the players. It wasn't because we have a tactically gifted coach,” he added.Many Ghanaians had called for Otto Addo's dismissal after he failed to lead the Black Stars to qualify for the 2025 AFCON, failing to win a single game in the qualifiers.However, the manager appears to have turned things around with impressive results in the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in March 2025.

He guided the team to two wins, defeating Chad and Madagascar, scoring a total of eight goals and keeping clean sheets in both matches.Ghana now tops its World Cup qualifying group with 15 points, with four games remaining in the campaign.EE/MAMeanwhile, watch the latest edition of Sports Check with veteran coach JE Sarpong

As FIFA President Gianni Infantino visits the United States to promote the Club World Cup, Al Jazeera takes a closer look.

Take a look at Ticketmaster or most secondary market websites this week and there are plenty of seats still available at various stadiums for this year's Club World Cup in the United States.

No, not the World Cup. The “FIFA Club World Cup 2025.”

Al Jazeera Sport takes a closer look at FIFA's rebranded club showpiece, which has many question marks surrounding its staging – including about the host nation, who themselves are warming up to hold the 2026 World Cup.

It's an international soccer tournament designed to bring together 32 professional teams from around the world with matches in 11 American cities, including Philadelphia.

Lincoln Financial Field will host six group stage matches, a round-of-16 match, and, per FIFA, “a highly anticipated quarterfinals match” on July 4.

In fact, while FIFA President Gianni Infantino promoted the tournament – a pair of Lombardi Trophies for the Philadelphia Eagles behind him – he alternated between Spanish and English and at one point turned to American reporters to say, “Buy tickets. There are still a few available.”

Whether you call it soccer or call it football, the sport is coming to the United States this year, in part to promote next year's real deal World Cup.

Next year's tournament, with 48 national teams for the first time, also will be played at various NFL stadiums, as well as in Canada and Mexico.

The current US political climate could be enough to scare off fans from travelling overseas for the games. Infantino met with President Donald Trump last month in the Oval Office to hype this event — and next year's true main event.

“The world loves America, whatever some might say,” Infantino said.

Infantino said he received assurances from the White House that any foreign fans would be in good hands during their time in the United States. The FIFA president met this week with US Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel at the FIFA office in Miami to map out a security plan and any potential issues with international fans travelling to the US on visas.

“It's absolutely crucial that we have this collaboration,” Infantino said. “This never would have been possible some years ago with the image that FIFA had. We came back a long way. Today, we work in a clear way, in a transparent way, in an ethical way. We'll bring the world to the United States of America. These are the guarantees the United States government signed at the time of the bidding, and reconfirmed of course. The world will be welcomed.”

Eagles wide receiver and Super Bowl champion AJ Brown hit the Linc to promote the event but noted he never played much soccer beyond the FIFA videogame.

He said he planned to attend his first soccer matches this summer – a first-time fan, just like FIFA hoped would attend the summer extravaganza.

“I always heard great things,” Brown said.

This year's revamped and expanded tournament is set to start on June 15 and run through July 13, with the final set for New Jersey's MetLife Stadium – also the site of the 2026 World Cup final.

FIFA announced earlier this year a $1bn broadcast deal with DAZN for broadcast rights to this summer's Club World Cup.

The winners could earn a football record $125m as part of the $1bn prize money fund – which matches the broadcast deal.

FIFA said it allocated $525m in guaranteed fees for teams taking part, ranging from $38.19m to the top-ranked European team – likely Real Madrid – to $3.58m for the Oceania representative Auckland City.

— FIFA Club World Cup (@FIFACWC) April 10, 2025



Two American teams are confirmed for this year's tournament: Inter Miami, who will include Lionel Messi in their ranks, and the Seattle Sounders.

Twelve teams from Europe will be included in the Club World Cup: Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Benfica, Borussia Dortmund, Chelsea, Inter Milan, Juventus, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, Porto, Real Madrid and Salzburg.

Other teams that have qualified are Boca Juniors, Botafogo, Flamengo, Fluminense, Palmeiras and River Plate from South America; Leon, Monterrey and Pachuca from North America; Al Ahly, Esperance, Mamelodi Sundowns and Wydad from Africa; Al-Hilal, Al Ain, Ulsan and Urawa from Asia; and Auckland City from Oceania.

“I don't have any concerns about ticket sales,” Infantino said. “We'll have full stadiums in America. If in America you fill soccer stadiums for friendly games, then when you come with a World Cup and the best players to win a competition … we'll have to promote it, we'll have to present it, we'll have to explain it to the people. That's what we are doing. But it's a celebration of soccer and the stadiums will be full and fans will be coming from all over the world.”

FIFA plans to spread the wealth of staging the warm-up event, pledging on Thursday $1 million to each of the 11 cities that will host Club World Cup matches this summer.

“Everyone thinks that the country winning their own national or continental competition is the best in the world,” Infantino said, referring to tournaments like the Champions League and Copa Libertadores. “But that's actually not the case. So we decided to create a real World Cup for teams.”

					Philadelphia local news: Neighborhoods, politics, food, and fun				

Gianni Infantino may be the president of soccer's global governing body, FIFA, but he knew enough in his first-ever visit to Philadelphia Thursday to drop multiple “Go Birds” into his remarks. (He did not drop in an “E-A-G-L-E-S …”)

Infantino was here to promote this summer's Club World Cup and see how preparations were going for next year's men's World Cup, with stops at Lincoln Financial Field, City Hall and Lemon Hill.

He also brought a surprising, and significant, donation for the city's soccer development.

“At FIFA, we are also aware of our social role and our social responsibility,” Infantino said at City Hall. “And as such, we want to donate to the whole city of Philadelphia … one million U.S. dollars, to be used as a legacy for being a host city of the FIFA Club World Cup.”

Infantino's visit to Philadelphia was part of a tour of U.S. cities that will showcase soccer over the next year-plus. At the Linc, he posed with the tournament's new trophy, as well as the Eagles' two Lombardi trophies, Birds wide receiver A.J. Brown, Mayor Cherelle Parker and other city dignitaries.

He said that Philly's history and sports culture were major reasons why it was chosen as a host city for both tournaments.

“Because everything started in Philadelphia, right? Almost 250 years ago, everything started here,” he said. “It's a great city. It's a great sports city.”

The Linc will be Philly's venue for eight games in this summer's Club World Cup and six games of 2026's World Cup. This year's tournament will feature the best club teams in the world and unveils a new format, switching the event from annual to every four years and greatly expanding the number of teams to 32 from the previous seven. It replaces the Confederations Cup as the tune-up competition for the World Cup.

Frank Gumienny, chief operating officer of the Eagles, said that the organization is ready for the new cadence of hosting several games over a couple weeks.

“We are getting to put our home — the home of the Eagles — on the grandest stage potentially in the world,” Gumienny said. “I mean, it's a proud papa moment, right? To be able to take what we've done and what we've learned and what we've built and highlight the biggest names in the sports world this summer.”

Infantino's U.S. visit included a meeting with U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel at FIFA's headquarters in Miami, as concerns rise that soccer fans might not be able to travel into and out of the United States, particularly with next year's tournament being co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.

Infantino said that FIFA has excellent relations with the Trump administration and seemed confident the U.S. would abide by the guarantees that were made when the country bid to serve as a tournament host.

“There are discussions ongoing of course when you have 10 million tickets for sale between this year and next year, and millions more of fans coming even without tickets wanting to be here to feel the vibe of the World Cup,” he said. “This creates, of course, a certain number of challenges that need to be addressed and we are working very, very hard. I would like to thank the Attorney General, the Director of the FBI, the government, President Trump, everyone for their engagement.”

Infantino also received a tour of East Fairmount Park's Lemon Hill, which will be the site for the World Cup's official fan festival next year. 

“We are going all in when we think about how we activate this great park and how we make it ready to welcome the world,” said Michael DelBene, the executive producer of the fan festival who gave Infantino the tour. “The tagline that we often use is ‘welcoming the world with a Philly flavor,' so this is going to be an authentic expression of the city of Philadelphia. Everyone who comes here will walk away, feeling like they have visited a lot of the city and gotten a lot of those great experiences.”

Meg Kane, Philadelphia Soccer 2026's host city executive, said that the first phase of parks development, focused on the infrastructure work, will begin late this summer or early in the fall. The festival grounds will start being built in April 2026, then taken down in August of that year. Phase two will involve legacy upgrades to the park based on community feedback.

“Our conversations with President Infantino have really focused around our two-phase approach and the fact that, for us, having Lemon Hill be a legacy of Philadelphia's hosting of the World Cup felt really important to us,” Kane said. “It combines a lot of our goals for the tournament of having that impact where residents for the several years after the tournament can look at Lemon Hill and say, ‘This place was improved because Philadelphia was selected to host the FIFA World Cup in 2026.' ”

FIFA is also contributing to that legacy with that $1 million donation, which is being given to all 11 host cities for the club tournament. Infantino said the money should go to soccer facilities in areas of need and activities with local associations. A FIFA Foundation USA will be formed to distribute the funds, which will likely be presented after the tournament, the Inquirer reported.

Tickets are still available for this summer's games, which is part of the reason for Infantino's visit. Concerns about overcrowded schedules, player burnout and a potential strike action have shrouded the tournament.

Infantino said he was unconcerned about ticket sales.

“If in America you fill soccer stadiums for friendly games, then you know when you come with a World Cup where the best players who play really [want] to win a competition. For sure, it will be full,” he said.

FIFA is offering a total tournament prize pool of $1 billion, with the winners earning up to $125 million.

Tickets for the Linc's games for the Club World Cup are available on FIFA's website.

FIFA announced yesterday that the $1M from the soccer governing body that Club World Cup host cities will receive will go “to support community soccer projects in the future,” according to Safid Deen of USA TODAY. Atlanta, Charlotte, Cincinnati, L.A., Miami, Nashville, N.Y./N.J., Orlando, Philadelphia, Seattle and Washington D.C. will host Club World Cup games, and “benefit from FIFA's ‘legacy contributions' intended to help build small community-focused pitches and leave an impact following this summer's tournament” (USA TODAY, 4/10). In Philadelphia, Kerith Gabriel noted FIFA President Gianni Infantino spoke at an event at Lincoln Financial Field in which officials from FIFA, the Eagles, and the city, including Mayor Cherelle L. Parker, were on hand. Afterward, “fans took photos with the FIFA Club World Cup trophy and the Eagles' two Lombardi trophies in the stadium's Red Zone suites.” Additionally, Infantino and FIFA “disclosed plans to create FIFA Foundation USA to oversee the distribution of its contributions to the 11 U.S. cities hosting the Club World Cup.” A FIFA source noted that the money “most likely would be presented after the Club World Cup” (PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 4/10). 

POLITICS AT PLAY: The AP's Dan Gelston wrote that this week on Ticketmaster or “most secondary market websites,” there are “plenty of seats still available at various stadiums” for this year's Club World Cup in the U.S. The current U.S. political climate “could be enough to scare off fans” from traveling overseas for the games. Infantino met with U.S. President Donald Trump last month in the Oval Office to hype this event and next year's World Cup. Infantino said that he “received assurances” from the White House that “any foreign fans would be in good hands during their time in the United States” (AP, 4/10).

HYPE TOUR: In Philadelphia, Jonathan Tannenwald said that the Club World Cup “hasn't yet been seen as a big deal,” which FIFA has “implicitly acknowledged” by taking Infantino on a publicity tour of the tournament's host cities. He said it out loud as he spoke in front of the trophy. Infantino: “It will be a celebration of soccer, and the stadiums will be full, and fans will be coming from all over the world. Buy tickets. There are still a few available” (PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER, 4/10).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

Los Blancos' treble hopes are dwindling after a disastrous week, but their beleaguered manager is not solely to blame

Real Madrid's 2024-25 campaign is in real danger of unravelling. They fell four points behind arch-rivals Barcelona in the La Liga title race after a 2-1 defeat at home to Valencia last weekend, before being decimated 3-0 by Arsenal at the Emirates in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie, and Carlo Ancelotti is, understandably, growing more and more frustrated.

“Why am I finding it difficult to instil ambition in these players?” Ancelotti said after Tuesday's loss to Arsenal. “This is a little bit the problem we've been having throughout the season: the difficulty of being a compact unit in good moments, but also in bad moments.” Indeed, the Gunners were able to carve Real open far too easily, which continued a worrying trend in the most important matches.

As is always the case at Real, though, the buck stops with the manager. According to Relevo, if Ancelotti is unable to deliver more major trophies come May, with a Copa del Rey final date against Barca also on the cards, he will pay the ultimate price. 

Los Blancos are said to have already lined up Bayer Leverkusen's Xabi Alonso to replace Ancelotti, who no longer has any margin for error. But sacking the legendary Italian coach won't fix Madrid's biggest issue. 

Ancelotti has been hamstrung this term by the club's baffling lack of transfer activity, and the deficiencies in key areas of the squad are now impossible to ignore. It doesn't matter who is sitting in the dugout; until a semblance of balance is restored Madrid will remain a team that is far too reliant on individual brilliance and doesn't have any plan B.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ramsay has convinced his players to follow a strict directive, a ""collective"" resulting in an unprecedented start to 2025

Minnesota United are off to the best start in franchise history through seven matches. They sit third in the Western Conference, level on points with San Diego FC, and are also level with the expansion side and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami in the race for the MLS Supporters' Shield.

They are averaging the least amount of possession per-game across all 30 MLS teams to begin 2025 - and by a considerable margin. They're excelling without the ball, playing a game that is focused on moments, timing and what MNUFC manager Eric Ramsay calls ""the collective.""

""Our job as a group of coaches, my job as a head coach is to squeeze every drop of quality that we can from this group and push the buttons that need to be pushed in order to be competitive,"" Ramsay told GOAL in an exclusive interview. ""I think if you look at what we do as a group, you can guarantee every week there's a level of organization, a level of discipline, a level of pragmatism, and we can cause the opposition a threat in multiple ways.""

With a 4-1-2 (WLD) record, the Loons are flying higher than they ever have to start a campaign.  Yet they've done so in an unorthodox manner. MNUFC are, as Ramsay describes, ""pragmatic."" And through a sense of ""desperation"" they've found identity in 2025.

The Loons sport a 3-5-2 formation, excel in transition and are the most cohesive team in all of MLS in terms of keeping, managing and maintaining their shape. Within seconds, they can threaten - even after going minutes without the ball at their feet. Ramsay has instilled a level of discipline within the team that has them aligned in every area of the pitch, a squad that understands the focus is on all 11 in a core collective.

""We've got a very level-headed group,"" Ramsay said. ""No one's getting ahead of ourselves here. We know what buttons we need to push to continue to be competitive. But I would say in each of the seven games so far we have been really competitive, and we're here in this position on merit, and certainly by the degree of deservedness. And there's no signs of us letting up in that sense.""

Led by a striker pairing of Canada international and former MLS SuperDraft pick Tani Oluwaseyi, and Designated Player and former Serie A forward Kelvin Yeboah, Minnesota have become one of the league's most difficult teams to play against in 2025.

And much of it is due to the unorthodox methods of Ramsay, who previously worked as an assistant coach at Manchester United under the likes of  of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Ralf Rangnick and Erik Ten Hag. The UK native signed on as Minnesota coach in the early stages of the 2024 season as the youngest manager in league history at 32, and now, is making an impression in the early stages of 2025.

Though he has experience on the touchline, alongside some of the biggest names in world soccer, Ramsay is adamant that he's his own coach; the imprint he's made on Minnesota is who he is as a manager, and who he strives to be as he leads the Western Conference side into the 2025 campaign.

""I wanted to be my own man so that I could solve problems and adapt from within,"" Ramsay said. ""I think that this period of a year or so, now with this group, is a really good example of that. I feel like I've really grown as a coach as a consequence of taking that mentality by which I really only look within, and I look at the strengths of the players. I look at what every individual is capable of doing at their very best. And I try and work out a way that suits those players.""

The tactical identity of the Loons is a fascinating combination of total football, playing without possession, capitalizing on set-piece opportunities and ensuring that - despite limited opportunity on the ball - each chance in the final-third is meant to be maximized.

Whether or not it remains to be a sustainable option throughout the season is still to be determined -  Ramsay acknowledges that - but right now, the Loons are doing exactly what is being asked of them by their head coach. And they're flourishing.

GOAL sat down with Ramsay to get an inside look into how the Loons are finding success and how his unconventional tactical methods have led the team to the best start in franchise history.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The clay season is now well underway, with top players on the ATP Tour looking to book their places in Saturday's semi-finals at the Monte-Carlo Masters. And there has been one significant change on the dirt this year, with automatic line calling now in use.

Hawkeye technology had previously been seen as too unreliable to be adopted on the clay. Instead, umpires would manually go down to the court and look at the ball marks left on the surface. But the system has been entirely automated, with an electric line calling system running the show, and one player isn't happy.

Gone are the days of drama on the clay, when players would point out a mark and argue with officials if they disagreed with a call. It's been smooth sailing in Monaco this week with an automated voice calling the lines.

Two years ago, the ATP Tour announced that live electronic line calling would be introduced across all matches on the circuit from 2025.

ELC live has been in place at some tournaments over the last few years, but this is the first time it is being utilised throughout the clay swing.

Most players already seem to be used to it. There have been no disputes at the Monte-Carlo Masters so far, and any close calls are shown on the big screen so players and fans can get a better view of the mark.

However, Arthur Fils believes the new rule is coming at a cost. While the Frenchman is happy to use automation on the hard courts, he says the dirt is a step too far.

“Well, I think we're losing the charm of tennis. When I was young I remember the linesmen. There was more life going on on the court,” the world No. 15 said.

“On hard courts, it's not as bad, but on clay court, really, I miss them. It's nice to have the umpire's opinion and watching, you know, the mark.

“Sometimes machines can make mistakes too. So it's different for clay. I don't really like it like this. I prefer to have linesmen, but I don't think I have a choice.”

The French star's Monte-Carlo run came to an end on Friday as he lost a tight three-setter to Carlos Alcaraz. Fils was seeking his first semi-final appearance at Masters 1000 level after reaching three consecutive quarter-finals.

But it wasn't to be for the 20-year-old sensation. Fils blew his break lead in the decider, losing the last five games in a row as Alcaraz advanced 4-6 7-5 6-3.

The world No. 15 will now return to action at next week's ATP 500 in Barcelona, where he will need to get used to the automated line calls on the dirt.

Carlos Alcaraz produced a gutsy display on Friday, when he overcame a resilient, heavy-hitting performance from Arthur Fils to keep alive his title hopes at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters.

In a dramatic clash on Court Rainier III, Alcaraz was on the verge of defeat on several occasions but refused to surrender in a match of high-quality shot-making. The World No. 3 crucially saved three break points at 5-5, 0/40 in the second set and rallied from 1-3 in the third set to earn a dramatic 4-6, 7-5, 6-3 quarter-final win.

""I just wanted to stay strong and wait for my chances,"" Alcaraz said. ""I think his level is high right now and he puts a lot of pressure on his opponents. Today I could feel it but in some moments he just made a few mistakes and I tried to make the most of those points and wait for my chances. The second set I saved those break points and then made the only break point I had that set.

""In the third set I was just trying to play good tennis. When I was a break down I just tried to keep going and play aggressively and be strong mentally and physically.""

RESPECT. @carlosalcaraz 🧡 @ArthurFils1 @ROLEXMCMASTERS | #RolexMonteCarloMasters pic.twitter.com/PeaXHFbjWx

Fils came out firing, demonstrating great footwork to dictate on his destructive forehand and force the Spaniard off balance. However, Alcaraz hit with greater depth throughout the match to pin Fils deep. He found the Frenchman's backhand with more regularity in the second and third sets, reeling off five straight games from 1-3 in the decider to seal victory after two hours and 23 minutes.

Alcaraz is making just his second appearance in Monte-Carlo, having lost in his only previous match in 2022 to Sebastian Korda. The 21-year-old suffered a shock opening-round exit to David Goffin in Miami and has been slowly rediscovering his best level in The Principality.

After defeating Francisco Cerundolo and Daniel Altmaier in his first two matches, the World No. 3 survived his greatest test yet against Fils in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting to set a semi-final clash with Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.



The Spaniard is into his 10th ATP Masters 1000 semi-final and is chasing his sixth title at this level across four different events (Madrid 2022, 23'), (Indian Wells (23', 24'), (Miami 22'). If the Spaniard claims his first crown in The Principality, he will pass Alexander Zverev for World No. 2 next Monday. If Alcaraz does not triumph in Monte-Carlo, he will remain World No. 3.

In a dramatic clash against Fils, Alcaraz fought hard to save three break points at 5-5 in the second set before he produced a stunning lob in the following game on set point to level the match. After pushing a return in, the 21-year-old scrambled to the backhand corner to flick a perfect lob over Fils' head. He then marched to his chair with his arm in the air. Both hit a number of stunning winners in the third set but it was Alcaraz who found greater consistency to break Fils' spirit and advance.

""I have missed clay,"" Alcaraz added. ""It is good to play the drop shot and it is a shot I use a lot and feel comfortable using. In matches like this I won almost every drop shot I hit and it gives me more confidence.""







Fils was aiming to reach his first Masters 1000 semi-final having also reached the quarter-finals in Indian Wells and Miami last month. The 20-year-old Frenchman threw everything he had at Alcaraz in a proactive display but costly unforced errors on serve ultimately stalled momentum and allowed the Spaniard to turn the tables in the deciding set.
Fils leaves The Principality up two spots to No. 13 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

Alcaraz is 15-1 on clay since last May. He won Roland Garros last year and lost in the gold medal match to Novak Djokovic in the Paris Olympics.

Lorenzo Musetti earned a milestone victory Friday at the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. The Italian scored his first win against Stefanos Tsitsipas in his sixth Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting against the Greek and advanced to his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final.


Musetti fought off the three-time champion 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, backed by a brave serving performance, saving 14 of the 17 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. In the final set, the 13th seed erased four break points at 1-2. Moments later, Tsitsipas double faulted down break point at 3-3 as Musetti stormed towards a two-hour, 21-minute victory. 

“Today was a really tough match. I knew that before today I never beat him and we played five times. Especially on clay, I knew against a three-time champion, definitely not an easy job today,"" said the Paris Olympics bronze medalist, who captured his ninth Top-10 win. ""I found a way and I was increasing during the whole match. Really, really happy and proud of this win.”






While Tsitsipas looked to run around his backhand and crush his forehand, that wing also created 23 of his 45 unforced errors. Musetti adopted a deep return position and played with great variety, hitting his one-hander down the line precisely and creating delicate drop shots that bit sharply on the sun-baked court.Relieved and on the verge of tears, Musetti hugged his team courtside following the hard-fought victory.""It's really beautiful to cry together and win together. It's really nice,"" Musetti said.The release. The euphoria. The moment.

Carlos Alcaraz did not have things all his own way on Friday against Arthur Fils, but found a way to reach the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters semi-final for the first time.

Following his hard-fought three-set win, the Spaniard reflected on his champion mindset.

“I think that real champions find the right level when it's needed,” Alcaraz said in his post-match press conference. “Obviously I would love to play a high level and my best tennis from the beginning until the last ball, but I think in tennis we play for two hours and a half, so it is the most difficult thing to do, to maintain your best tennis.

“When it's needed, it's great to find the good tennis. But sometimes I'm playing against an opponent who is playing better and you have to accept it and run and fight.”

Alcaraz has become a seasoned champion in the early stages of his historic career. A four-time major titlist, the 21-year-old Spaniard is chasing his sixth ATP Masters 1000 trophy this week.
However, for all his success at the top of the game, this week's run in Monte-Carlo is unknown territory for Alcaraz. The Spaniard is making just his second appearance in The Principality, having lost in the opening round to Sebastian Korda in 2022.
“I am still super young and I am going to live new experiences and learn about [them], but I feel like I know how to deal with situations that probably other players don't. It is my second time [playing] here and to be able to play a semi-final for the first time makes me grow up as a player, as a person,” Alcaraz said. “Every match is new, it is different and [I] have to learn from the matches that I'm playing here.”

The Spaniard will face countryman and former finalist Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the semi-finals on Saturday. Alcaraz revealed that he is close friends with the 25-year-old but will put their relationship to the side when they meet for the second time in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.
“He invited me to his wedding. He's a friend,” Alcaraz said on Davidovich Fokina. “We have seen each other for a long time already. He used to play with my old brother when they were younger.
""I know him pretty well. I've played against him a few times. Hit with him a lot. So it's going to be interesting. It's not going to be easy, never easy playing against a friend, but this is tennis. Once you step on the court, there are no friends.”
Alcaraz is 18-4 on the season, highlighted by his title run in Rotterdam. If he wins the trophy in Monte-Carlo, he will pass Alexander Zverev for No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday.

However, for all his success at the top of the game, this week's run in Monte-Carlo is unknown territory for Alcaraz. The Spaniard is making just his second appearance in The Principality, having lost in the opening round to Sebastian Korda in 2022.

“I am still super young and I am going to live new experiences and learn about [them], but I feel like I know how to deal with situations that probably other players don't. It is my second time [playing] here and to be able to play a semi-final for the first time makes me grow up as a player, as a person,” Alcaraz said. “Every match is new, it is different and [I] have to learn from the matches that I'm playing here.”



The Spaniard will face countryman and former finalist Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the semi-finals on Saturday. Alcaraz revealed that he is close friends with the 25-year-old but will put their relationship to the side when they meet for the second time in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.

“He invited me to his wedding. He's a friend,” Alcaraz said on Davidovich Fokina. “We have seen each other for a long time already. He used to play with my old brother when they were younger.

""I know him pretty well. I've played against him a few times. Hit with him a lot. So it's going to be interesting. It's not going to be easy, never easy playing against a friend, but this is tennis. Once you step on the court, there are no friends.”

Alcaraz is 18-4 on the season, highlighted by his title run in Rotterdam. If he wins the trophy in Monte-Carlo, he will pass Alexander Zverev for No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday.

Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas seeks fresh direction with former Djokovic coach Goran Ivanisevic after turbulent season so far. 

Stefanos Tsitsipas is set to begin a new chapter in his career by bringing on Goran Ivanisevic as his coach after the 2025 Roland Garros tournament. This development marks a significant shift for the Greek player, who has navigated a tumultuous season marked by early exits and a high-profile coaching change. 

Goran Ivanisevic is best known for winning Wimbledon in 2001 as a wildcard ranked No. 125, as he is the only man in history to do so, after finishing runner-up at the tournament three times in the 1990s. He reached a career-high ATP singles ranking of No. 2 in 1994 and captured 22 singles titles. Since retiring, he's become a respected coach, most notably guiding Novak Djokovic to multiple Grand Slam titles.

Earlier this year, Tsitsipas parted ways with his long-time coach and father, Apostolos Tsitsipas, seeking to redefine their relationship and professional boundaries. In the interim, he appointed Dimitris Chatzinikolaou, the Greek Davis Cup captain, as his coach, aiming to bring stability and continuous progress to his game.​

The 2025 season has been a rollercoaster for Tsitsipas. After a first-round exit at the Australian Open, he rebounded by winning his first ATP 500 title at the Dubai Tennis Championships, defeating Félix Auger-Aliassime in the final. This victory marked his 12th ATP Tour title and his 350th career win.

He becomes yet another ATP player to bring on a previous legend to his team. Andrey Rublev is working with Marat Safin, as of a few weeks ago.

Inside the Baseline…​

The impending partnership between Tsitsipas and Ivanisevic could be the catalyst he needs to regain his footing in the competitive tennis landscape. Ivanisevic's experience and strategic knowledge, honed through coaching roles with top players, may provide Tsitsipas with the guidance necessary to navigate the challenges of the tour and achieve consistent success, which has been a struggle for Stefanos in the past.

Filipino tennis ace Alex Eala is all pumped up to compete in the main draw of the French Open from 25 May to 8 July, thanks to her new Women's Tennis Association (WTA) ranking of No. 73.

The 19-year-old prodigy said she couldn't wait to make it as she will be able to face the best tennis players in the world without going through the qualifying rounds. 

Eala is currently at the Rafael Nadal Academy in Mallorca, Spain preparing for the Oeiras Ladies Open in Portugal from 14 to 20 April.

“I'm excited for the Grand Slams ahead, Roland Garros. I know that I will be in the main draw. So I'm very excited about that,” Eala said. 

“This is my first time to be in the main draw. So it's a new experience and everything to gain.”

Making it to the main draw of the French Open, the second Grand Slam of the year, will be a full circle moment for Eala.

In 2021, Eala joined forces with Oksana Selekhmeteva of Russia as they won the French Open girls doubles crown as they pulled off a 6–0, 7–5 victory over Russian netter Maria Bondarenko and Amarissa Kiara Tóth of Hungary.

Back in 2024, the three-time Junior Grand Slam champion almost made it to the main draw of the French Open but lost to Julia Riera of Argentina, 6-4, 6-7, 4-6, in the third qualifying round. 

Eala said repeating her magical run in the Miami Open will be easier said than done but playing in various WTA tournaments will help her get comfortable in facing the top players frequently.

Before going to the Miami Open, Eala will compete in the Mutua Madrid Open in Spain from 22 April to 4 May, the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome from 5 to 11 May, and the Parma Ladies Open in Italy from 12 to 17 May.

“For me, the biggest learning is that even the top players have weaknesses and they're not perfect. Of course, when you see that they've won so many things, and of course, it can depend on what kind of moment they're in in their career,” Eala said.

“But there's always a way. There's always a point to push and if I believe in myself, then I know that I'm able to push those points.”

Dan Bloxham on centre court in Mallorca. | Mallorca Country Club

One of Wimbledon's “unsung heroes”, the Wimbledon Master of Ceremonies, Dan Bloxham, has just spent the past few days inspecting, visiting and playing at the prestigious Mallorca Country Club in Santa Ponsa, for Spobis Match Point Mallorca, sponsored by AETIB, which again this year will be hosting the ATP 250 tournament. This will take place from June 21 to June 28, with top players coming to the island as part of the final preparations for Wimbledon.



Dan, told the Bulletin this week that he has been extremely impressed with the club and what the island has to offer the players in general. He is one of the most important figures at the All England Club. He is a Level 5 tennis coach who holds a dual role at Wimbledon. He is current head coach and has helped the likes of Andy Murray and Johanna Konta on the road to success.



He is also the Wimbledon Master of Ceremonies, whose role is technically to invite players to play on Centre Court. He escorts the two players to court before each game and is watched by around 150 million people on the walk before the final. In short, he is the last person the players see before they take to the courts during the tournament. Furthermore, as head coach he is captain of the Members' Team, which every year enjoy a tennis holiday, mainly on grass courts; Mallorca has been chosen for next year.

It's amazing“It's amazing where we've found great grass courts over the years, from Japan to China, India and Hong Kong. And working with Tim Henman we've obviously played the great clubs in Europe like Stuttgart. But having seen the Mallorca Country Club, I'm extremely impressed and see a great flourishing future for the club. We'll be planning our tennis holiday in Mallorca for next year.

“It's been great. I've been down with Mark Ferguson, grass specialist from Wimbledon, and it's been very interesting and encouraging. I've been playing a couple of hours on clay and the hard courts in the morning and then grass in the afternoons and the courts are first class.



“I have to stress that the grass groundsman is part of the Wimbledon team, so the relationship between the two clubs is very close. We support the tournament ever more each year. It's an ATP event and we're nearing the 150th anniversary of the The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, of which Santa Ponsa is a member, so we have a very special year ahead and we want to further develop our relationship with Mallorca. One of the main aims is to bring that connection between Mallorca and Wimbledon to the forefront.

British heritage“So moving forwards it's not only going to be about tennis, we're also going to help host two croquet events and tournaments at the country club every month. These will be quality sponsored events to increase the club's exposure to the community on the island and attract more people of all nationalities to enjoy the experience, plus the Pimm's and the champagne ..,” he said. “It's all part of the British heritage.

""I can certainly say that my experience has been first class. The secret to a good tennis club is energy, enthusiasm and positivity, and the club in Santa Ponsa is brimming with it all. The coaching staff are excellent and it's crucial that when members, or even guests, enter the club, they feel at home; that's how I was made to feel in Mallorca. All that's very important. So, combine that with the facilities and the country club has all the makings of competing with the best tennis/padel clubs in Europe. No doubt about it.

“It's got perfect courts, a wonderful hotel across the road, it's 15/20 minutes from the airport, it has a top golf club next door, while there are all the others around the island along with the first class hotels. Most tennis players love a round a golf in their downtime and obviously want to stay in comfort but like to have things relatively close together.

Mediterranean vibe“So the club's location, surrounded by the mountains and just a few minutes from the sea, is a winner. In addition, the club has that Mediterranean vibe, which is another benefit. It's not a massive tennis resort stuck in the middle of nowhere, it's just comfortable, and all these reasons are why, since the tournament began, some of the best tennis players in the world have decided to play Mallorca ahead of Wimbledon. I can't see any reason for that to change, In fact I can only see the club's cachet growing and I certainly hope so,” Dan enthused.

“Coming out of Covid, tennis clubs, all sports clubs, are flourishing. For many active people who were locked away, unable to exercise and socialise, it's been a breath of fresh air to get to back into their normal rhythms. More people have decided it's time to get fit and healthy and enjoy the fun of being a club member and that's helped us all in the sector as a whole,” he added.

Roger, Rafa, Andy and NovakWith Wimbledon just a few months away, Dan has always got his mind set on his vitally important role at the most famous tennis club in the world. “I've got a great team and obviously as I or we walk the greats to the courts, there's always the odd member who tries to get in the way for a chat or whatever, so diplomacy is the key, I've become a great diplomat over the years. But when it comes to the players they love and deeply respect Wimbledon. Behind the scenes, for example, timing is very important. Depending on the nationalities, some are more punctual that others.

“But what does shine out and is something I always take with me when I give talks to juniors or in schools is the high level of respect the players have for each other, the club and its rules. They love the clothing regulations, for example, it all adds to the prestige and importance of the event. I have to admit I have a unique position, but the players, and I've seen some the biggest rivals of the history of the game, especially with the recent big four of Rafa, Roger, Andy and Novak. Their behaviour has been impeccable and they show each other the utmost respect. They all hold great values and that applies to all of the top tennis players, male and female.

“They bring that to their game. On court, for example, the players, especially the top seeds, are more concerned about themselves and their game than the other players. In most cases they have a pretty good idea how the opponent players, the fitness levels, best shots, etc., so the players focus more on themselves. Their job is to get the very best out of themselves to beat the person on the other side of the court. When they do get angry or frustrated it's with themselves, not their opponent and that is something I always share and try to explain to youngsters when I give open days or talks, as does the rest of the team.



“Yes, each player has his or her own little final warm-up move or attempt to psych the other player out and put him off guard slightly. Rafa (Nadal) was a prime example with his final jumping up and down moves as we waited to finally go on court. On one occasion, while playing on one of the outer courts, the height of the entrance to the court slipped my mind. Rafa started bouncing up and down and hit his head on the door frame, but it was no big deal and things do happen,” he sniggered.

“It will be interesting this year because we're moving to electronic line judges. This will make line calls more efficient but we will still have a team of judges because anything can happen. Say the power goes down like at Heathrow, we can't call it all off until the matter is repaired, so the traditional line judges will step in. Yes, there's the argument of whether the electronic system is 100% correct, but if it's slightly off, then it will affect both players, so really no one will be playing at a disadvantage. It's the future I guess and one we have to embrace,” Dan said.

“There's been a change of the guard at the top of men's tennis, if you like, so it's going to be a very interesting and exciting Wimbledon this year. The British men and women are on form, especially Jack. Novak is obviously still there and he wants one more slam. I think he's got his sights set on the French but he'd clearly take Wimbledon - who wouldn't - plus there's Carlos Alcaraz, who is playing some great grass tennis. It's very difficult to say about the women. There are some great players who have come through and it's going to be very open on both sides of the draw,” he said.

Win or lose“But win or lose, that's when the respect I've talked about really comes to the forefront. Obviously the winners don't need consoling, it's the loser. But as we see time and time again, the players remain on court after the match and the losers are always very courteous. They pay their respects to the winner, thank the organisers and the crowds and that is not always easy when you've lost an important match; that shows courage as well. It reminds me of rugby. In fact I think tennis and rugby are the only two sports which show so much respect for the losers. In rugby, the winning team always gives the losers a tunnel or applause of the pitch and I think those traits and traditions in these sports are very important and must be cherished. But yes, sometimes walking a loser back to their locker room can be a slow and testing walk. That said, once it's all over, the focus switches to the next tournament and making sure the same mistakes are not made again,” Dan explained.

“This is where some of the top players will be hoping to fine tune their game on the eve of Wimbledon this year. Edwin Weindorfer, CEO of the organising e|motion group, has created a winning tournament and my trip down here, which will be the first of many I am sure, has been to bolster relations between the two clubs. Wimbledon is a first-class spectacle and there is no reason whey the Mallorca Championships can't hit those heights,” Dan said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Goran Ivanisevic reveals what the hardest thing was about coaching Novak Djokovic, 'I have never seen anything like it in my life'","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/goran-ivanisevic-reveals-what-the-hardest-thing-was-about-coaching-novak-djokovic-i-have-never-seen-anything-like-it-in-my-life/","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Novak Djokovic enjoyed a long-standing relationship with Goran Ivanisevic before parting ways with him in 2024. 

Together, Ivanisevic's meticulous approach to preparation led Djokovic to a wealth of titles during a period where he was the dominant figure in the sport of tennis. 

Since the 2001 Wimbledon winner pursued other avenues, Djokovic hasn't won a Grand Slam title and perhaps that speaks volumes. 

Andy Murray is now in the corner of the 24-time Grand Slam champion and the weight rests on his shoulders when it comes to coaching Djokovic over the line in one of the big events. 

Ivanisevic is going to be working with Stefanos Tsitsipas after the French Open and he's been reminiscing about working with Djokovic during a recent interview. 

It's hard to imagine there being too many issues when it comes to coaching a player like Djokovic, given all he's achieved in the game of tennis. 

However, there was one thing that Ivanisevic did find a little bit tricky when it came to being in the Serbian player's corner. 

He said on a Croatian TV channel: “I don't know what could be the hardest. He's quite serious. He likes biomechanics and many similar things. It's not that I don't believe in that but some things have nothing to do with biomechanics. You can't think about the biomechanics of your hips, your knees, when you throw the ball for your serve and the sun hits your eyes and you can't see anything. You can't see the ball. For one second, you can't see the ball and you hit it blindly. You can't think about your hip while serving while you're blind as a bat. There's also the wind.

“He wants to be perfect at it. He's a perfectionist. I am too, but you have to find some balance.

“And the easiest thing for me is that I have never seen a tennis player who can not play tennis for two months and then play as if he never even stopped. 

“He plays like he had been training for five hours a day for the past two months. Such timing, such a feel for the court, for the ball, for the space. I have never seen anything like it in my life. Nadal is not like that. He has to train every day.”

Although the parting of the ways was amicable, there is perhaps a case to suggest that Djokovic should have tried harder to keep the Croatian in his corner. 

Since parting, Djokovic has reached a Wimbledon final but ultimately, he does seem to have lost that aura of invincibility about him. 

There are other things to factor in, of course. Djokovic isn't getting any younger and as a result, injuries have started to have a bigger impact on his body. 

There is no doubting Ivanisevic's quality as a coach, however, and perhaps there's an argument to suggest that Djokovic shouldn't have let him go as quickly as he did. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Former World No. 1, winner of 12 Grand Slam singles titles and founder of the WTA, Billie Jean King knows about greatness. As one of the legends of the sport, she has not only played against some of the biggest stars, but has also witnessed the talent of recent generations. So, when it comes to claiming a GOAT, King gave a clear answer and it isn't Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal.

King, who has always defended equality, went with Serena Williams as her choice for the greatest player of all time. “I think that we have been very blessed to have Serena Williams in our sport. Great athlete, I think a lot of people think she is the GOAT, I think every generation gets better. So right now she's the GOAT,” she told the National Bank Open's social media team.

“I love reading about her and listening to her about how she's evolving. She has transcended the sport way beyond the boundaries of just being an athlete,” King added. “Because of her stature, using tennis is a platform way beyond just the sport and giving back, and also making it better for women particularly women of color, it's just the beginning for Serena,” she said.

Williams secured 23 Grand Slam singles titles, the most by any female player in the Open Era, with only Djokovic surpassing her at 24. Her dominance wasn't confined to the majors; she held the world No. 1 ranking for 319 weeks, including an impressive 186-week streak that tied Steffi Graf's record.

Partnering with her sister Venus, she captured 14 Grand Slam doubles titles and earned three Olympic gold medals in the event. Additionally, she secured a gold in singles, making her the only player in tennis history to achieve a career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. Overall, Williams won 73 WTA singles titles, including five WTA Finals championships.

Billie Jean King, a former world No. 1 tennis player from the United States, is widely regarded as one of the sport's greatest. Throughout her career, she amassed 39 Grand Slam titles: 12 in singles, 16 in women's doubles, and 11 in mixed doubles.

Beyond her on-court achievements, King was a pioneering force off the court. She founded the Women's Tennis Association and the Women's Sports Foundation, advocating for gender equality in sports.

Novak Djokovic had a disastrous start to the clay season as he lost to world no. 32 Alejandro Tabilo in straight sets in the Monte Carlo opener on Wednesday. The defeat came as a big setback for the Serbian as it deflated all the momentum, he gained during the Miami Open. Djokovic reached the final of the ATP tournament but suffered a woeful loss in the tournament's concluder to Jakub Mensik. Barring the final, it was a much-improved Djokovic on display in Miami, and based on the performance, he looked set to ride on the confidence but got inflicted by yet another devastating early elimination.

Former US Open winner Andy Roddick has yet again paid heed to the situation of Novak Djokovic and gave an interesting opinion. According to Roddick, Djokovic must not be looking at the bigger picture, which would be winning two majors, rather he would be more focused on attaining the peak form for the said tournaments.



“It should be viewed as normal. I don't think that the base level for Novak for a successful year is two majors anymore. I think the question is, ‘can I build up my season? Can I peak for the majors, right? Can I be as good once as I ever was?' Right? I think that matters a little bit more,"" the 2003 US Open champion said on Tennis Channel. 

The former player weighed in on Serb's Monte Carlo loss and stated that it shouldn't be concerning as featuring in the tournament might not have been in his initial plans but eventually decided to take part in it because he lives across the street and would be a ""paid practice."" 



""He's going to reset. Next Monday, he's still going to be in Monte Carlo training, to get ready for the clay-court season, so I don't put a ton of stock in this,"" the American tennis legend added.

Djokovic, 37, is searching for the elusive 25th Grand Slam glory and his 100th title overall. He has been denied the milestone quite a few times and the pressure is building up. It will be intriguing to note how the perceived GOAT of the game will deal with this tough phase and grab the glory which is just a step away. Djokovic will feature in the Madrid Open next, which is scheduled to start on April 23.

As the BMW Open in Munich ascends to ATP 500 status in 2025, many oeyes will be on Germany's own Alexander Zverev.

The two-time former champion has a rich history at the event, one that helped shape the early stages of his career. Having won back-to-back titles in 2017-18, Zverev returns to Munich in 2025 at a career-high No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, but can he complete the hat-trick?

Ahead of the newly upgraded 2025 edition of the BMW Open, ATPTour.com looks back on Zverev's relationship with the clay-court event.



2017: Zverev's Maiden Munich Triumph 
After an impressive run to the semi-finals in 2016, Zverev arrived in Munich the following year eager to leave his mark on home soil. Competing as the third seed, Zverev saved his most dominant performance of the week for the championship match, where he defeated qualifier Guido Pella 6-4, 6-3 to triumph on German soil for the first time in his fledgling career. A first title in Munich — and first on clay — alerted fans to the then-20-year-old's versatility and potential on the surface.

Two weeks after sealing his third career trophy in Munich, Zverev went on to claim his maiden ATP Masters 1000 title in Rome, where he battled past World No. 2 Novak Djokovic in the final. His run in the Italian capital further cemented his clay-court prowess during the early years of his pro career.

2018: A Dazzling Double
By 2018, Zverev had established himself inside the Top 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Already a six-time tour-level champion, who debuted at the Nitto ATP Finals at the back end of a standout 2017 season, Zverev was riding high among the sport's elite. Could the German produce a successful title defence upon return to Munich?

Entering the clay-court ATP 250 on the back of four three-set clashes en route to the Monte-Carlo semi-finals, Zverev then ended up on the losing side of a 26-point first-set tie-break in his Munich opener with Yannick Hanfmann. It proved nothing more than an extended warm-up for the defending champion, however, who responded emphatically by not dropping a set from that point on to retain the title.

In an all-German final, Zverev sunk three-time champion Philipp Kohlschreiber to successfully defend a tour-level title for the first time. Zverev built on his Munich momentum by extending his winning streak to 13 matches on the European clay, including a title at the Masters 1000 in Madrid and a run to the final in Rome, where he was defeated by Rafael Nadal.

2025: Hat-Trick On The Cards?
Having fallen at the quarter-final stage or earlier in each of his previous five appearances in Munich, Zverev will aim to turn his fortunes around when he arrives as the top seed in 2025. As a newly upgraded ATP 500, the World No. 2 will have to fend off the star power of his fiercest rivals in the field.

American No. 3 Ben Shelton will land on the other side of the draw in Munich, where he will enter as the second seed. Another player to watch is Argentine Francisco Cerundolo, who boasts a 2-0 lead in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Zverev, having won their recent quarter-final clash in Buenos Aires this year.

Regardless of his opponents, Zverev will be able to draw on the fond memories he holds from his past title runs in Munich.

McLaren driver Oscar Piastri topped the timesheets during Friday evening's second practice session for the Bahrain Grand Prix, leading the way from team mate Lando Norris and Mercedes racer George Russell.

After a baking hot first hour of practice, FP2 served up more representative twilight conditions for teams and drivers – the sun setting and the floodlights switching on around the Sakhir venue, as they will ahead of Qualifying and the Grand Prix.

It also involved all 20 full-time drivers, following a handful of ‘rookie' appearances in FP1, with Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Russell, Fernando Alonso, Ollie Bearman and Carlos Sainz returning to their respective cockpits.

Drivers were quick to head out on track and get a feel for grip levels when the green light switched on at the end of the pit lane, bringing a mixture of run plans with Pirelli's soft, medium and hard compound tyres through the early stages.

Practice 2 results

It was a tricky start for reigning four-time World Champion Verstappen, who reported over the radio that his car was “jumping a lot” with a “very bad ride” – highlighted by a lock-up and trip to the run-off area at the tight Turn 10 left-hander.

Matters were worse for Alonso, who encountered a steering wheel problem only a couple of laps into his programme and crawled back to the pits, where Aston Martin mechanics surrounded the AMR25 and changed parts of its steering system.

HIGHLIGHTS: Watch the action from Bahrain as Norris tops FP1 from Gasly

Some 15 minutes into the session, Russell provisionally led the way with a time of 1m 31.945s on soft tyres, just ahead of former team mate Lewis Hamilton, new team mate Kimi Antonelli and the aforementioned Verstappen.

However, as the minutes ticked by and every driver completed a lap with the red-marked rubber, the McLarens impressively moved to the fore – Piastri pumping in a 1m 30.505s and Norris a 1m 30.659s to put the papaya cars around half a second clear of the field.

Russell grabbed the ‘best of the rest' slot with his own improvement, 0.527s back, with Ferrari's Leclerc taking fourth over Antonelli, high-flying Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar and Verstappen, who reported further issues relating to his brakes late on.

Second practice in Bahrain saw the sun set and the floodlights switch on

Hamilton wound up eighth in the sister Ferrari, as the team completed back-to-backs with their new floor design, followed by Haas youngster Bearman, the two Williams machines of Sainz and Alex Albon, and Liam Lawson's Racing Bulls car.

Gabriel Bortoleto found plenty of time on his soft-shod run to place 13th, from Alpine's Jack Doohan, the compromised Alonso – who made it back out but finished with fewer than 20 laps – and the Haas of Esteban Ocon.

AS IT HAPPENED: Follow all the action from second practice for the Bahrain Grand Prix

Pierre Gasly put his Alpine 17th, in front of Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda, who continues to get to grips with the “science room” that is the RB21, while Aston Martin driver Lance Stroll and the Kick Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg completed the order.

Drivers and teams will now regroup in the paddock at the Bahrain International Circuit before returning to the track for Saturday's final practice session, which is scheduled to get under way at 1530 local time.

FP2: Piastri leads Norris as McLaren dominate second practice in Bahrain

TRIDENT's Rafael Camara was in supreme form once again, as he secured his second consecutive pole position to start the season, beating Rodin Motorsport's Callum Voisin at an action-packed Qualifying in Bahrain.

The Scuderia Ferrari Driver Academy member led the way in Free Practice early in the day, but it was not until his third and final lap that he took to the top of the leaderboard in Qualifying.

F2: Fornaroli secures maiden pole ahead of Martins

Camara's 1:49.214 late in the session was good enough for P1, and Voisin, who had been on provisional pole, was forced to settle for second, 0.156s behind.

TRIDENT made it two cars in the top three, as Charlie Wurz went up to third on his final attempt, ahead of DAMS Lucas Oil driver Christian Ho.

MP Motorsport rookie Bruno del Pino also had a stellar day in Bahrain, qualifying fifth ahead of another FDA member in Tuukka Taponen, who was sixth for ART Grand Prix.

Noah Stromsted was seventh for TRIDENT, ahead of Nikola Tsolov, in his Red Bull-liveried Campos Racing car.

Williams Driver Academy member Alessandro Giusti was ninth for MP, while AIX Racing's Freddie Slater rounded out the top 10 on debut.

Hitech TGR drivers Martinius Stenshorne and Joshua Dufek ended up in P11 and P12. This means they will line up on the front row when we reverse the grid for Saturday's Sprint Race, which is set to start at 13:15 local time.

F3: Camara beats Voisin to take pole position in Sakhir

Lando Norris topped the timesheets during the opening practice session of the Bahrain Grand Prix weekend, the McLaren driver going fastest from Pierre Gasly and Lewis Hamilton in an hour that featured appearances from six rookies.

Just days after racing in cool conditions at Japan's Suzuka Circuit, the teams and drivers returned to action amid hot and sunny weather at Sakhir for Friday's Free Practice 1. Several of the current grid, however, would not be getting behind the wheel, having instead handed their cars over to a young driver as part of the rule stipulating that teams must run rookies in four FP1 sessions during the season.

READ MORE: The six rookie drivers set to take part in FP1 at the Bahrain Grand Prix

Ayumu Iwasa, Dino Beganovic, Fred Vesti, Felipe Drugovich, Ryo Hirakawa and Luke Browning were set to turn out for Red Bull, Ferrari, Mercedes, Aston Martin, Haas and Williams respectively, taking the place of Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, George Russell, Fernando Alonso, Ollie Bearman and Carlos Sainz.

The new faces seemed keen to get going, with Iwasa leading the pack out from Browning and Hirakawa when the green light appeared at 1430 local time. There was early trouble, meanwhile, for the more familiar name of Kimi Antonelli, the Mercedes driver reporting “no power” before slowly returning to the pits less than 10 minutes into the session.

Practice 1 results

While Antonelli's car was worked on in the Silver Arrows' garage – the issue seemingly being due to a loss of water pressure – other drivers appeared to be struggling to find grip out on track, with Liam Lawson stating that the balance on his Racing Bulls machine was ”shocking”.

By the halfway point of the session – after most of the pack had put a time on the board with the medium or hard tyres – Alex Albon led the way for Williams on a lap of 1m 35.180s, putting him six-hundredths clear of Norris in the McLaren, with Gasly slotting into third for Alpine.

Attentions then started to shift to the soft tyre runs and Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto quickly went fastest by half a second after being one of the first to bolt on the compound, before promptly being displaced by team mate Nico Hulkenberg.

As Antonelli's problems persisted in the Mercedes garage – with the mechanics seen pulling on the rear wing in their efforts to sort the issue – Albon was released into the path of Red Bull's Yuki Tsunoda in the pit lane, prompting the Thai driver to apologise over the radio. The incident will be investigated after the session.

The stewards will also look at a possible impeding incident that occurred between the two Williams drivers, with Browning having to take avoiding action after encountering a slow-moving Albon on track.

Ayumu Iwasa was one of six rookie drivers in action during FP1 ahead of the Bahrain Grand Prix

As more soft-shod laps came in and the times continued to tumble, it was Norris who had gone fastest with his effort of 1m 33.204s, two-tenths faster than Gasly in second, while Hamilton slotted into third for Ferrari after completing his soft run later in the session.

Albon – who reported a loss of power in the closing stages – held onto fourth, ahead of Haas' Esteban Ocon in fifth and Hulkenberg in sixth. Jack Doohan was seventh for Alpine, with Lawson, Tsunoda and McLaren's Oscar Piastri completing the top 10.

Bortoleto ended the hour in 11th, followed by Racing Bulls' Isack Hadjar, Browning and Beganovic. The Aston Martins of Lance Stroll and Drugovich took 15th and 16th respectively, with Hirakawa, Vesti, Iwasa and Antonelli – who missed most of the session due to those aforementioned car issues – rounding out the order.

The drivers and teams will now have an opportunity to examine their data before returning to action for Free Practice 2, which is set to get underway at 1800 local time.

The actor played the Tenth Doctor from 2005 to 2010 before reprising his role as the Fourteenth Doctor in 2023.

David Tennant almost didn't portray one of his most iconic roles to date.


	The actor shared on a recent episode of David Tennant Does a Podcast With… that his former agent actually told him, “Don't touch” the role of the Doctor in the BBC hit show Doctor Who.




	His wife, Georgia Tennant, who took over hosting duties on the latest podcast episode, recalled how David initially got asked to star as the titular character, saying he met Doctor Who executive producers Russell T. Davies and Julie Gardner while working on the 2005 miniseries Casanova, which Davies and Gardner also exec produced.

	Georgia said they were looking for someone to take over the role of the Doctor from Christopher Eccleston in their 2005 Doctor Who revival, and decided to “lure” the Broadchurch actor to their house to watch some of the first season.


	“And then they go, ‘Guess what? Do you want to play [the Doctor]?'” she recounted. “And you pretend to think about it for, like, a day or something?”


	“It was longer than that,” David responded, before his wife added that he was “clearly” going to take the part.


	“Well, maybe I was clearly going to do it,” the Jessica Jones actor admitted, “but there was definitely a moment where I wasn't.”


	David continued, “About 40 hours after they asked me, and I sort of had to process everything that it meant. And I had an agent at the time who was like, ‘Don't touch it. It's not going to work.' Not my current agent. A previous brilliant agent who's since retired, but she didn't call that correctly, as it turns out. She said, ‘It's not been on yet, it's not going to work. You don't want that hung around your neck.'”


	And his former agent was definitely wrong, as his Doctor Who character has become one of his notable roles. David ultimately played the Tenth Doctor for three seasons from 2005 to 2010 before reprising his role as the Fourteenth Doctor in 2023 for the 60th anniversary Doctor Who specials.

The venerable actress played Broadway producer Eileen Rand during the show's two seasons.


							By 

	Lexy Perez


Associate Editor


Anjelica Huston may have starred on the NBC musical series Smash, but she admits she didn't feel happy on the show.


	In an interview with People magazine, the actress reflected on starring alongside Katherine McPhee, Megan Hilty, Debra Messing and Jack Davenport on the TV show.




	Huston played Broadway producer Eileen Rand during Smash‘s two seasons. The series was cancelled in 2013.


	“I wasn't very happy when I was on that show,” Huston told the publication. “I was living in New York and I wasn't very happy living in New York for the obvious reasons. It was a cold winter, and I didn't feel very prized in that role. I was a bit depressed by it. It was hard really; I didn't really have a good time making it.”

	While on the show Huston was also still mourning the loss of her husband of 16 years, Robert Graham, who died in 2008.


	“Bob was very special and very irreplaceable,” she said. “A lot's gone on since Bob died.”


	Huston's comments come amid a Broadway adaptation of the show that opened Thursday night. Robert Greenblatt, Neil Meron and Steven Spielberg are lead producing, with Susan Stroman, a five-time Tony Award winner for The Producers, directing.


	The Broadway show stars Robyn Hurder, Brooks Ashmanskas, Krysta Rodriguez, John Behlmann, Kristine Nielsen, Caroline Bowman, Jacqueline B. Arnold, Bella Coppola and Casey Garvin. Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman wrote the score, which includes many of the songs the two wrote for the television show including “Let Me Be Your Star” and “Don't Forget Me” as well as new material. Joshua Bergasse who choreographed the television series, returns as choreographer of the stage show. 


	The Broadway show has long been in the works, with Greenblatt and other team members first discussing bringing the show to a bigger stage after a 2015 one-night charity benefit concert version of Bombshell. It was originally announced for Broadway in 2020 but delayed, and the team held a developmental workshop of the show last summer. 


	The series centers on the approaching opening night for Bombshell, a new show about Marilyn Monroe. The synopsis of the Broadway show reads: “Nearly breaking under the pressure, legendary Broadway star Ivy Lynn causes a series of hilarious set-backs and surprises that brings a diva director, a bewildered producer, two exasperated authors, one eager understudy and an entire company to its knees. But the curtain's going up, no matter what.”

The star also dropped a Kaytranada remix of ""Don't Forget About Us"" ahead of the expanded album.

	Hannah Dailey



Mariah Carey has officially been free for two decades — and to celebrate, she's dropping an expansive collection of music packaged in a five-disc The Emancipation of Mimi (20th Anniversary Edition).


	As announced on Instagram Friday (April 11) — one day shy of the exact 20-year anniversary of the vocalist's enduring 2005 record — Carey has personally compiled a suite of songs from the Emancipation era into one sleek five-LP vinyl box set arriving May 30 via Def Jam Records/UMe. Featuring the original tracklist of hits including “It's Like That,” “We Belong Together,” “Shake It Off,” “Say Somethin,'” “Fly Like a Bird” and “Get Your Number,” the special edition will also house dozens of bonus tracks, past remixes and collaborations with other artists, instrumentals, a capella takes, live recordings and more.

	











The Emancipation of Mimi (20th Anniversary Edition) will also include tracks from the previously released Ultra Platinum Edition — including “Don't Forget About Us,” “Makin' It Last All Night (What It Do),” “Secret Love” and “Sprung” — as well as brand new remixes and collaborations. One of those remixes, Kaytranada's version of “Don't Forget About Us,” dropped Friday as part of the anniversary project's announcement.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“I'm really happy to celebrate ‘Mimi's Emancipation' with this special anniversary re-release,” Carey said in a statement. “While working on this edition, I got to relive all the memories from this pivotal moment in my personal and professional life.” 


	Released April 12, 2005, The Emancipation of Mimi marked Carey's 10th studio album, and a pivotal comeback moment in her career. Spending two weeks atop the Billboard 200, the project won three Grammys and spawned one of the longest-running Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits of all time, the 14-week leader “We Belong Together.”


	The new anniversary edition will further celebrate that era of the vocalist's career with a 28-page booklet of photos of Mimi, along with a personal letter she penned to her Lambs. A deluxe 2-LP vinyl set will also be available. An extended digital deluxe version of the suite will also be available on May 30 featuring additional tracks exclusive to streaming services.


	“This album has some of my biggest hits to date, as well as some personal favorites that are very special to me,” Carey added. “Forgotten gems, unreleased bonus tracks and different remixes with incredible collaborators — all of these and more are now available in one place for the first time ever!”

Maroon 5 were one of many artists enlisted to cover The Beatles for a 2014 CBS special.

	Tyler Jenke



Maroon 5 vocalist Adam Levine has reflected on Paul McCartney's reaction to his band covering The Beatles on television more than a decade ago.


	Levine's comments were made during his recent appearance on The Howard Stern Show, where he and guitarist James Valentine were discussing a special televised event from February 2014. Broadcast by CBS, The Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles was a star-studded performance held to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Fab Four's debut on The Ed Sullivan Show.


	Alongside performances from McCartney and Ringo Starr, the event featured the likes of Ed Sheeran, Katy Perry, Stevie Wonder, and John Legend and Alicia Keys all covering original Beatles songs. The night opened with Maroon 5, who shared their own renditions of “All My Loving” and “Ticket to Ride.”

	“ I was scared s–tless,” Valentine told Stern of the performance, with Levine adding, “I told you I've been scared a handful of f–king times in my life, that was definitely one of them. “I was like, ‘Holy s–t.' I'm sorry man, but it's just like, you can be too cool, but not always. It's Ringo Star and Paul McCartney. F–k off if you're gonna try and be cool about that.

	“Afterwards, I see Paul and Paul kind of took me in close and he goes, ‘You know, we did it better,'” Levine remembered while laughing. “I thought it was so funny. And I cracked up and I'm like, ‘Yeah, no s–t, you're Paul McCartney, you're The Beatles.'”


	Levine then added how the interaction took an even stranger turn when McCartney tried to get his attention at a party some months later, using the opportunity to apologize for any bad blood his initial comments may have caused.


	“He's like, ‘Hey man, I just wanted to let you know, if that bothered you, I've been thinking about this, I didn't want to insult you or anything,'” Levine recalled. “It was something like that. Like, ‘If I insulted you, I apologize.' And I'm like, ‘Oh my God. Like, you're good. Dude, you're Paul F–king McCartney.


	“But it kind of shattered in a great way this whole thing about your heroes being who they are,” Levine concluded. “It's like, he's a human being with a beating heart and a really beautiful soul who actually was thoughtful enough to even take into account that maybe for some reason my feelings might have been hurt, but of course they were not.”


	Levine's appearance on The Howard Stern Show wasn't his only big media appearance this week, with Monday night's (April 7) episode of The Tonight Show seeing him confirm that Maroon 5 will be making a musical comeback in 2025

	











	“The rumors are correct. There are details. I cannot divulge all the details,” Levine explained. “But the details are basically, roughly, there's a single coming at the end of the month-ish. I'm really excited about it. An album is coming over the summer. Non-specifically around the summertime. And then, even more non-specifically, there is a tour coming in the fall-ish.”

The country hitmaker and British crooner join forces for a folksy new track.


													By
												

	Kyle Denis



	Two of the 2024's biggest breakout stars have lent each other a hand for a new springtime single.


	Five-time Grammy nominee Shaboozey and Brit Award-winning Myles Smith have joined forces for “Blink Twice,” an infectious, folk-inflected track built on twangy finger-picked guitars, pounding drums and raucous stomps and claps. “Oh me, oh my, would you look in my eyes/ We'll laugh or cry just to feel alive/ Oh-woah-woah, no time for living a lie/ Oh-woah-woah, time flies, so don't blink twice,” they sing together in the chorus. The track also arrives alongside a pensive, tear-jerking music video.


	“Blink Twice” marks Shaboozey's first musical release after his blockbuster past year. In addition to his dual appearances on Beyoncé‘s three-time Grammy-winning Cowboy Carter LP, the Billboard cover star scored the longest-running solo Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 single of all time with “A Bar Song (Tipsy),” which spent a whopping 17 weeks atop the ranking. While “A Bar Song” continues to hang around the Hot 100's top five — it sits at No. 4 on the chart dated April 12 — “Good News,” which he released last fall, ranks at No. 51, having previously peaked at No. 47.

	Smith, who won the Brit Rising Star Award last month (March 1), also appears on the Hot 100 with his own “Stargazing,” which peaked at No. 19 and spent one week atop Pop Airplay. Earlier this year (Feb. 14), he teamed up with Grammy-winning country star Lainey Wilson for a new version of “Nice to Meet You,” which reached No. 13 on Hot Rock & Alternative Songs.

	This month, Shaboozey will perform at both Coachella (April 11-13, 18-20) and Stagecoach (April 25-27), cementing his status as one of music's biggest crossover acts.

HYBE promises to ""continue to monitor and take legal action to eradicate such serious crimes.""

	HYBE is continuing to work to protect its artists.


Korea's Northern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency (NGPPA) worked with the global entertainment company to arrest eight individuals who are suspected of creating and distributing deepfake videos of HYBE Music Group artists, Billboard can confirm. Deepfakes are false images, videos or audio that have been edited or generated using artificial intelligence.


	The investigation was launched as a result of a Memorandums of Understanding between HYBE and NGPPA, signed in February 2024, as a means to combat cybercrimes for their artists and maintain their safety. HYBE provided information to NGPPA, who were able to track down and identify the suspects. Additionally, fans helped the investigation by sending reports via the HYBE Artist Rights Violation Report Center tip line.


	“HYBE will respond firmly to crimes that infringe on our artists' portrait rights and reputations, based on a zero-tolerance and no-settlement policy,” Jason Jaesang Lee, CEO of HYBE, said in a press statement, adding, “We will continue to monitor and take legal action to eradicate such serious crimes.”

	











	Ho-seung Kim, district chief of NGPPA, also assured that deepfake suspects will continue to be tracked down. “Deepfake crimes that exploit the vulnerabilities of celebrities—who often find it difficult to report such offenses themselves — are on the rise,” he said in his statement. “Deepfake is a serious type of crime that can destroy the daily lives of victims, and crimes targeting public figures are no exception.”

	At press time, HYBE has not released names of suspects or which of its artists were affected.

Lizzo is going on the show to promote her upcoming album Love in Real Life.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	In new promos for this weekend's Saturday Night Live, Lizzo pays homage to another pop star with a rich history on the SNL stage: Britney Spears.


	Saturday's musical guest Lizzo wears a Britney T-shirt in the promos, throwing back to the pop princess' teen-idol days. This weekend will mark Lizzo's fourth time performing on SNL (she also hosted the show once in 2022), while Spears did double-duty as host and musical guest twice (in 2000 and 2002) and performed on the show in 2003. (Spears has also been impersonated on the show more than a dozen times, most recently by current cast member Chloe Fineman.)


	Lizzo stars in the new promos with host Jon Hamm (hosting for a fourth time this weekend) as well as cast members Bowen Yang and Marcello Hernandez. The quartet finds out just how much they have in common when they decide to say their favorite food in unison (“mozzarella sticks”) but things get really “weird-mazing” when they recite their shared favorite movie. “Angels in the Outfield, the heartwarming 1994 sports comedy starring Donald Glover and a young Joseph Gorden-Levitt!” they all say enthusiastically at once.

	











	We also learn Hamm's surprising real name and find out that this isn't the first time this four-pack has spent time together. Watch the promos here:




			Trending on Billboard		







	Lizzo is going on the show to promote her upcoming fifth studio album Love in Real Life, which doesn't yet have a release date and has been preceded by the title track and “Still Bad.” Last month, she announced on Instagram that the album is officially complete.


	“ALBUM IS DONE YALL!” she wrote, alongside a photo of herself in the studio, struggling to smile, which she explained in the second half of the caption: “ASTROLOGY EXPERTS Do my mercury got micro braids? Cus I got an emergency root canal, announced SNL & finished my album all in one day today.”


SNL airs Saturday night at 11:30 p.m. ET/8:30 p.m. PT on NBC and then streams on Peacock.

	A lot going on in Thursday previews, many of them boosted by early screenings. 


	As we told you last night, Warner Bros/Legendary's A Minecraft Movie crossed $200M after a $7.1M Thursday. It took Minecraft one week to hit that mark versus Illumination/Nintendo/Universal's The Super Mario Bros Movie, which did that figure in five days in 2023, again because it was a Wednesday release leading into Easter weekend. The anticipation is that Minecraft eases by 60% this weekend to about $65M and another No. 1 showing.


	Angel Studios' is calling $2M for its animated biblical movie The King of Kings. That's pure preview money from showtimes starting at 11 a.m. Thursday. There's some high excitement that the movie could have the edge over 20th Century Studios' $60M Rami Malek PG-13 spy movie, The Amateur, after $14.6M presales. We'll see soon if all that cash is for this weekend.

The Amateur did $2M in previews, but that includes early screenings as well as 2 p.m. showtimes yesterday.

The pic is launching today in 3,400 theatres, including 400 Imax auditoriums, 300 Premium Large Format screens and 100 D-Box/Motion screens. The 3-day is expected to be north of $12M.

Its 3-day is around $6M-$7M. The PG-13 feature is after women 17-34. Drop was made for $11M net before P&A after a robust tax credit from Ireland.

Documentary Editor, Awards


EXCLUSIVE: The impact of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey will be explored in an upcoming documentary that's being made in partnership with the legendary filmmaker's estate and the Stanley Kubrick Film Archive.


	Producing the film titled Monolith are Mike Medavoy and Michael Lee Peterson of Phoenix Pictures, Jason Clark of Catchlight Studios, Sean Richard, and Oscar winner Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Davisson of Appian Way. Partners in Kind and TIME Studios are co-financing the film.


	The documentary, expected to be released in 2026, begins production this month. Helming the film is Stevan Riley, director of the acclaimed 2015 Brando-themed documentary Listen to be Marlon.

	“2001 is the ultimate Zeitgeist movie,” Riley said in a statement. “It was recently voted the #1 movie of all time by film directors, and for good reason. It predicts and speaks to the dramatic technological and societal changes that we are facing today.”




			Watch on Deadline		







2001: A Space Odyssey, written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke (based on Clarke's short story The Sentinel) was released in 1968, and starred Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, with Douglas Rain as the eerie voice of the supercomputer HAL.


	“Monolith offers an in-depth exploration of the groundbreaking ideas that emerged from the partnership between Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and their collaborators, many of which have shaped the modern era,” notes a release. “The documentary will showcase never-before-seen personal letters and narratives between Kubrick and Clarke, and feature insightful interviews from contemporary visionaries and changemakers across diverse disciplines who themselves took inspiration from the film to create the world we live in today.”


	Gillian Hormel and Shelly Tygielski will serve as executive producers for Partners in Kind, with Dave O'Connor and Loren Hammonds as EPs for TIME Studios. Also executive producing will be Phillip Watson from Appian Way, and Fares I. Fares.


	Partners in Kind executive Claudia Cahill, founder of Omnicom Media Group's Entertainment and Content Marketing division, will lead brand partnership negotiations and program development.


	“The Partners in Kind Foundation, in collaboration with Propper Daley BPI, will spearhead philanthropic social good campaigns and activations inspired by the film's key themes,” the release says, “including artificial intelligence and ethics, human evolution, and the pursuit of knowledge.”

	











	In the decades since its release, 2001: A Space Odyssey has only grown in reputation (in 1969, critic Pauline Kael famously panned it, but she was an outlier). In 2013, Killian Fox wrote in the Guardian, “Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey is, for me, primarily about the experience of total awe. Yes, you can spend an entire evolutionary stage debating the meaning of the interstellar monolith, or whether or not the film is really an elaborate triple allegory involving Nietzsche and Homer.”

					By Baz Bamigboye 

Columnist/International Editor At Large


EXCLUSIVE: Doctor Who and Barbie's Ncuti Gatwa and A Discovery of Witches and Killing Eve's Edward Bluemel are headed straight into London's West End for the European premiere of Liz Duffy Adams' “cheeky, witty and flirty” play Born With Teeth, about an imagined meeting between bad-boy playwright Christopher Marlowe and a then-up-and-coming William Shakespeare.


	The two hotshot Elizabethans were like the rock ‘n' roll stars of their day. The jewel box Wyndham's Theatre, the much sought after prestigious playhouse smack in the middle of the W.End, may never recover from the combined firepower of Gatwa and Bluemel, who both graduated with honors from Netflix's Sex Education, which has of late become something of a finishing school for future stars.

	











	Adams' play is being directed, fittingly, by Royal Shakespeare Company co-artistic director Daniel Evans, who, as it happens, just completed a run playing Marlowe's Edward II for the RSC at Stratford-upon-Avon. “So I've been saying his words for the last eight weeks,” Evans tells me in an exclusive interview.




			Watch on Deadline		







Born With Teeth is set in 1591, a time when England, under the reign of Elizabeth I, was more like an oppressive police surveillance state with spies and lapsed Catholics and Protestants at every turn. Fear and paranoia abound. There's a theory that Marlowe himself was a spy working for the crown: He'd already lured and betrayed dramatist Thomas Kyd. Now he wants the upstart Shakespeare under his ink-stained thumb. 


Born With Teeth has yet to play New York but has enjoyed much success since it originated at Houston's Alley Theatre three years ago. The powerful show — which I've read but haven't seen — played across the U.S. from the Guthrie in Minneapolis to the Asolo Repertory Theatre in Florida to the Oregon Shakespeare Festival and then on to Berkeley, CA, where it was staged by the Aurora Theater Company in 2023.


	Evans tells me that he and Adams have held line-by-line readings of the play and the dramatist has made amendments to her text. “And I dare say we're treating it as a new play, Liz will keep working on it until opening night,” he says.

	











	It will run at Wyndham's for a limited 11-week season from August 13-November 1. The production is being produced by Matthew Byam Shaw and partners Nia Janus and Nick Salmon for Playful Productions, the RSC and Broadway's Elizabeth Williams. 


	If all goes well in London's theatre-land, it's likely to rock New York in 2026 or 2027, although Byam Shaw stresses that “there's always a hope” of New York “but, first of all, let's have a successful season at Wyndham's and not get too big for our boots.”


	However, he's a canny dude and knows the lay of the land in NYC. After all, Playful, which he founded 15 years ago with Janis and Salmon, has a history of taking productions such as The Audience (which led to Netflix hit The Crown) and Frost/Nixon — both by penned by Peter Morgan — to Broadway.


	For NYC, says Byam Shaw, “it needs razor-sharp actors and a razor-sharp production and then I think the play will fly there.” And it has all those qualities in Gatwa, Bluemel and Evans. 


	Byam Shaw and his colleagues at Playful are also working with producer and theatre owner Nica Burns on The Fifth Step, starring Martin Freeman (Black Panther) and Jack Lowden (Slow Horses) at @sohoplace theatre in the W.End, and on many other shows which they either produce or general manage.


	Without wishing to sound “twee,” Byam Shaw is of the view that Marlowe and Shakespeare “were the rock stars of their day.”


	“Not only that,” he continues, “Marlowe died at 27 like Jimi Hendrix and all the rest of them, and therefore, there's a really interesting story there.”


	(To clarify: Marlowe was 29, but the point's well made.)


	Evans and Byam Shaw have collaborated on many shows before, plus Byam Shaw was on the panel that interviewed the actor-turned-director for his current post at the RSC, a job he shares with Tamara Harvey.


	In the play, Marlowe and Shakespeare, the two preeminent writers of their generation, are thrown together in a secluded tavern to work on what would become Shakespeare's history cycle trilogy Henry VI. “It's cheeky, witty and flirty,” says Evans because “you get both of their personalities. Marlowe, the kind of star of the age, wildly flamboyant, and very naughty.


	“And you get Shakespeare who's at the start of his career, sort of quite shy, sometimes a bit diffident, but every now and then there's a real glint of ambition,” Evans observes. 


	“When you think of who Marlowe is, the danger of him, the wit of him, the energy of him. There is no better person than Ncuti. His charisma as an actor, his humor as an actor, his power as an actor. It's everything that this script demands,” Evans states.


	“It's a kind of great sensuality that he has, and that's Marlowe,” he beams. “And so I'm really overjoyed to be working with him,” he says as he cites how he was “blown away” when he saw him early on in Sex Education but also recently at the National Theatre in a pantomime-inspired production of The Importance of Being Earnest.


	Gatwa returns for the new season of Doctor Who on Saturday, April 12, on BBC One, BBC iPlayer and Disney+.


	Evans enthuses equally over Bluemel's “brilliant TV work” which also incudes We Might Regret This, My Lady Jane and Belgravia: The Next Chapter. The actor's now starring with Mia McKenna-Bruce, Freeman and Helena Bonham-Carter in Netflix's lavish country house series The Seven Dials Mystery. It's written by Broadchurch's Chris Chibnall and directed by Chris Sweeney (The Tourist) and executive produced by The Crown's Suzanne Mackie and Chris Sussman (Good Omens).

	











	“Edward has amazing sensitivity for this part,” Evans relays.


	“He has a kind of incredible charm, likeability, and also very intelligent. So again, for our play, he really suits Shakespeare at the beginning of his career. Clearly being able to admire Marlowe and see what Marlowe's doing. And thinking all the time, ‘Oh, I might be able to out-Marlowe Marlowe.' So the two of them together, honestly, it's a really thrilling combination.”


	Full rehearsals start in July. The production's designed by Olivier Award-winning Joanna Scotcher, lighting design by Olivier- and Tony-winning Neil Austin. Casting director is by Charlotte Sutton. Negotiations for other members of the creative team are ongoing.


	The RSC's currently enjoying a hit at the Gillian Lynne Theatre with a transfer of the utterly charming My Neighbour Totoro, based on Studio Ghibli's animated classic.


	There are also efforts to bring Edward II — with Evans starring — into London.


	But right now, he's pretty busy.

EXCLUSIVE: Angel Studios‘ family pic The King of Kings has already clocked $14.6M in pre-sales and could wound up outstripping DreamWorks Animation's The Prince of Egypt ($14.5M) as the best opening ever for an animated Biblical movie. One million tickets have been presold further boosted by Angel's “Kids go Free” campaign which allows one free kid's ticket with each adult ticket purchase.


King of Kings opens in more than 3,200 locations nationwide this weekend. We already told you that King of Kings presales from earlier this week stood at $7.8M surpassing that of Angel Studio's biggest hit, Sound of Freedom.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


	The Tony Awards Administration Committee met yesterday in the third of their four Tony eligibility meetings, and while most of the decisions where the usual determinations about what category to place video designs and projections. 


	But one ruling stood out: The fine revival of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross will not compete in the important Lead Actor In A Play slot – Kieran Culkin, Bob Odenkirk and Bill Burr will each be considered eligible in the Best Performance by an Actor in a Featured Role, the Tony equivalent of a Supporting Actor Oscar.


	The ruling is a bit surprising given that all three names are listed above the show title in the Playbill program's Glengarry Glen Ross credits page, an indication of leading actor status. But the Administration Committee is empowered to deviate from that standard, often at the request of the production

	The Committee does not discuss or explain its decisions. Deadline has reached out to a rep for the play.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Culkin, Odenkirk and Burr play the three main characters in the play: Richard Roma, Shelley Levine and Dave Moss, respectively. A fourth bold-name star of the show is Michael McKean, whose performance of sadsack George Aaronow is a below-the-title role so would would likely automatically go in the featured actor slot, with no input from the committee needed.


	It's certainly not without possibility that all four actors could be competing in the same featured actor category this year. Nominations for the 2025 Tony Awards will be announced on Thursday, May 1. 


	Among the other slightly curious rulings were for Operation Mincemeat, in which a five-person ensemble cast – all listed below the title in Playbill – play numerous characters. The committee decided that David Cumming and Natasha Hodgson will be considered in the leading performer/musical categories. 


	And one more thing: Oscar Wilde could win a Tony Award this year. His 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray will be considered eligible in the Best Play category, and Wilde and the play's adaptor Kip Williams will be considered jointly eligible as co-authors of the dazzling production starring Sarah Snookl.


	The 78th Annual Tony Awards will take place Sunday, June 8 in New York's Radio City Music Hall, airing live on CBS at 8 p.m./ET and 5 p.m.PT. The awards show will also stream on Paramount+ (live and on-demand for Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers, or on-demand for Paramount+ Essential subscribers the day after the special airs)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Unstoppable Morgan Wallen Smashes Taylor Swift's Record","https://entertainmentnow.com/country-music/morgan-wallen-smashes-swift-record/","Fri, 11 Apr 2025 01:43:00 GMT","

Morgan Wallen has smashed yet another record, and this time its superstar Taylor Swift he's stealing a title from.

While Wallen's fourth studio album doesn't drop until May 16, it's already setting records that are writing the singer's name in the history books. 

The 31-year-old's latest track release “Just in Case,” from the upcoming album “I'm the Problem,” debuted at No. 4 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. That makes Wallen the first artist to have five songs from an unreleased album reach the Top 10.

Taylor Swift had held onto that record since 2012, when four of her songs from her “Red” album charted in the top ten before the album's release. Post Malone tied that achievement with four tracks from his 2019 album “Hollywood's Bleeding” hitting the top ten before that album dropped.

Now Wallen's fifth single “Just In Case,” joins “Lies Lies Lies,” plus title track “I'm the Problem, “Smile” and “Love Somebody” in knocking both Swift and Malone off that particular throne.

It's not the first record the so-called bad boy of country music has taken from the Eras star. Last year, Morgan Wallen broke a different Billboard record held by Swift when three of his singles reached No. 1 on the Hot 100 and Hot Country Songs charts at the same time. 

Only a handful of other artists including Swift have achieved that twice, including Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers, John Denver and Glen Campbell.

Wallen also dethroned country legend Garth Brooks from a long-held record.  

And he did it in record time.

Wallen bested Brooks record for weeks at number one on Billboard's Top Country Album Chart.

Brooks, 63, spent 35-years racking up number ones, with 173 weeks collectively at the top spot on Billboard's prestigious Top Country Album Chart.. Those hits spanned 17 albums.

Wallen topped that number in less than five years, with just three albums. And he continues to add to it.

According to Billboard, only 21 artists have spent 50 or more weeks at the top of the Top Country Album Chart in its 61-year history. Of those, only three female solo artists are on that list. They are Lee Ann Rimes with 50 weeks, Shania Twain with 97 weeks and Taylor Swift, with 101 weeks at number one.

Morgan Wallen will launch a tour to support his “I'm the Problem” album about a month after it drops May 16.

Tour dates are as follows:

A portion of every ticket will go to the Morgan Wallen Foundation (MWF), which supports youth programs that focus on sports and music.

After three years together, Ally Lewber ended her relationship with “Vanderpump Rules” star James Kennedy after he was arrested for domestic violence. A month after the arrest, Kennedy revealed that he was sober and had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.

With the changes he is making, Nick Viall asked Lewber on “The Vial Files” if she would ever consider getting back together with Kennedy. Lewber expressed that while she will always love and support him, it's time for her to move on. 

“I honestly do have so much love for James that I want him to genuinely heal and get better and I want him to find love. I really do,” Lewber said. “And I don't think that will be with me. I feel like there's just been too much that's gone down. I think I would always be on edge or wondering what if.” 

“And it's hard because I'd love to support him and do that, but I just can't,” she added. “I haven't really thought about this to be honest.”

A post shared by Ally Lewber (@allylewber)

In December 2024, Burbank police took Kennedy into custody on suspicion of misdemeanor domestic violence, per TMZ. However, in January, his lawyer announced that “no charges will be filed against James Kennedy,” in a statement to CNN.  

Following the news, Lewber posted on her Instagram story, expressing that she was “happy” Kennedy would not face criminal charges. 

“I am happy that prosecutors decided not to file James, as I never desired criminal charges,” Lewber wrote. “We had an argument outside of his home related to him drinking again, however, I was not physically hurt. I was shocked by the headlines and disheartened by how the event was portrayed.”

“We are no longer together, but I will always support James and wish him the best with his sobriety and healing,” Lewber added.

During her time on the “Viall Files” podcast that aired on April 9, Lewber also revealed that Lisa Vanderpump reached out to her following Kennedy's arrest. While she did check in to see how Lewber was doing, Vanderpump also tried to convince her to stay with him.

“She called me, and she did make sure, like, ‘Are you OK?' I mean, this was, like, two months later, but she called and made sure… maybe a month? I don't know. Certainly not the next day,” Lewber said on the podcast. “But she called and checked in on me.”

“She's very protective over James,” she added. “And I get it because I was too for a long time.”

Lewber detailed exactly what Vanderpump said to try and get her to stay with Kennedy.  

“She was basically like, ‘Ally, he needs you. You're really good together,” Lewber recalled. “She was like, ‘You should go travel with him to his [DJ] shows this weekend.' I'm like, ‘First of all, what shows? He's canceled right now. And also, no? I just moved into an apartment. We're not together.'”

“It was really weird because, on the call, I was weak in the moment,” she continued. However, after asking herself if she “made the wrong decision” by breaking up with him, she spoke to her friends who confirmed that she did the right thing.

If someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, please call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233 for confidential support.

“Summer House” star Lindsay Hubbard is denying rumors that she and her boyfriend, Dr. Turner Kufe, have broken up. 

During an April 2025 interview with It Girl, Hubbard said she and Kufe, the father of her daughter, Gemma, are still dating. 

“We are very much together. All the time, day in, day out, being parents to our baby. We just went to Florida. We have a couple of trips coming up. And yeah, just, like, normal life with a newborn,” said Hubbard during the interview. 

In the It Girl interview, Hubbard also noted that she and Kufe met during the fall of 2020. According to Hubbard, they “went on a few dates.” Kufe, however, let Hubbard know that he was not interested in having a serious relationship after their fourth date. Hubbard said Kufe reached out again in December 2023, four months after her engagement to Carl Radke was called off. The couple, who welcomed their daughter in October 2024, began dating again in January 2024. 

A post shared by Lindsay Hubbard (@lindshubbs)

Hubbard suggested she was not sure how her relationship with Kufe will end up faring during a February 2025 interview on “Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen.”

“I think we're trying to figure that out. We got pregnant very quickly upon dating. And it's very challenging even on the strongest relationships. But, you know, we're doing it,” said Hubbard during the interview. 

She also said she does not believe Kufe will ever appear on “Summer House.” 

In addition, Hubbard gave an update about how she was feeling after welcoming Gemma. 

“I feel identity issues. And I don't know what my future holds. And I'm just getting used to being a mom,” said Hubbard while filming the “Watch What Happens Live” episode. 

A post shared by Lindsay Hubbard (@lindshubbs)

While speaking to It Girl, Hubbard discussed her dynamic with Radke. She said she does not believe she will “ever forgive” Radke for ending their relationship while “Summer House” cameras were rolling. 

“We were supposed to get married two months later. And next thing you know, there was cameras in my living room. And he's breaking up with me on television,” said Hubbard during the interview. 

In an April 2025 “Watch What Happens Live” interview, Radke said he did not intend to break up with Hubbard in front of cameras.

“I wanted to get on the same page. But as we were talking — which we talked in circles, it was very obvious that it wasn't right. And when I said, ‘I don't think I can do this.' Her response was, ‘Okay, it's over,'” said Radke during the April 2025 interview.

HGTV star Tarek El Moussa is sharing how is dynamic with his ex-wife Christina Haack has improved. 

While speaking to Us Weekly in April 2025, Tarek El Moussa, who shares his older children Brayden, 9,  and Taylor, 14, with Haack, said filming the series, “The Flip Off,” alongside his ex-wife bettered their relationship. The HGTV series, which premiered in January 2025, featured Tarek El Moussa and his wife, Heather Rae El Moussa, competing against Haack to see who could make a better profit when flipping a house. Haack's estranged husband, Josh Hall, was originally her partner until he left the series following their July 2024 split. 

Tarek El Moussa said filming the series “was more fun than [he] thought it was going to be.” 

“It was better for our family. It was better for our relationship. It brought everybody closer and, in the end, it did such amazing things for our family. I wouldn't change a thing,” said Tarek El Moussa to the publication. 

He also said that he and Haack were able to positively communicate with each other during the production of the show. 

“The show gave me and Christina an opportunity to apologize for things we did to each other. It gave Christina and Heather an opportunity to bond even closer. I mean, we're going to dinners now. So, honestly, it's just about working together, spending time together and creating some really fun TV together,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview. 

A post shared by Tarek El Moussa (@therealtarekelmoussa)

Tarek El Moussa spoke about filming with Haack for “The Flip Off” during a January 2025 Us Weekly interview, alongside his wife. He said he was not worried about working with his ex-wife again because they have “been in a really good place” for “the last couple of years.” 

“It took us almost 10 years to get there, so going back into shooting together, it's a lot more of an intimate relationship. There were some reservations. But as the show has gone on, we've realized it's just business,” said Tarek El Moussa during the interview. 

He also said that he and Haack did argue while filming the HGTV series. According to Tarek El Moussa, he took issue with Haack “because she always wants to get her way.” 

“She doesn't want to have rules,” said Tarek El Moussa to Us Weekly.

Heather Rae El Moussa also shared that he and Haack's dynamic is similar to how siblings fight.

A post shared by Heather Rae El Moussa (@theheatherraeelmoussa)

During a November 2024 interview with Entertainment Tonight, Haack said Hall took issue with her dynamic with Tarek El Moussa while filming “The Flip Off.” 

According to Haack, Hall viewed her relationship with her ex-husband as flirty. She said, however, that she views Tarek El Moussa like a sibling.

When actress Lyndie Greenwood was diagnosed with breast cancer in September 2024, she was on a roll making Hallmark movies, having just co-starred in Hallmark Mystery's “Crimetime: Freefall” with Luke Macfarlane. It was her fifth movie role at the network since 2021, but her work as an actress came to an abrupt halt as she began an intense cancer treatment plan in the fall, including a double mastectomy and chemotherapy. 

“I haven't been able to work during this time,” Greenwood, 42, wrote in a blog update on April 8, 2025. “In most ways – because I have enough savings and a comfortable home with a supportive partner – this has been an unbelievable blessing. I imagine sometimes how difficult this would be if those things weren't true, and it shatters my heart.” 

But Greenwood, married to producer Ben Jamieson for six years, admitted it's also been hard to step back from acting and adjusting to her new normal, writing, “No one is ever prepared for cancer. It's not something we're taught how to deal with in advance. Coping with everything that a cancer diagnosis ignites in your life is not something that comes naturally, whether it's your diagnosis or that of someone you love.”

A post shared by Lyndie Greenwood (@lyndiegreenwood)

In her latest blog post, Greenwood expressed gratitude for having the ability to focus on treatment and healing, “but in some ways,” she wrote, “it has been emotionally taxing to not have work – and my savings won't last forever. I would have loved the distraction on the days that it was physically possible, but acting doesn't really work that way. You're all in, or you're out. And the logistics of cancer come first when trying to organize one's life-schedule.”

Noting that it's been the longest stretch of time she's ever stayed at home, not traveling for a project, the “Girlfriendship” star wrote, “I've had nothing but time to stew and to worry and to pull my hair out (literally), and to also find ways to learn and to ground and to hope and to laugh.”

Greenwood shared that, to feel productive each day, she made two goals for herself in 2025. First, she wrote, “to write something everyday (even just a sentence)” and, second, “to meditate everyday (even for just a minute).” 

“Being able to check these tiny, achievable things off my to-do list gives me a sense of accomplishment each day, but it also helps me to fully relax,” Greenwood shared. “Like if I do just those little things I said I would do, then I can justify doing ‘nothing' else. As if one needs to justify simply existing. But I am not immune to our cultural standard of worth = productivity, even as I am trying to be more conscious of it.”

A post shared by Lyndie Greenwood (@lyndiegreenwood)

In 2021, before Greenwood landed a supporting role in her first Hallmark movie, “Every Time a Bell Rings” starring her longtime friend Erin Cahill, the actress had decided to give up on acting. 

Writing on her blog that she was “miserable” and not booking any new acting jobs, Greenwood quit — and the freedom it provided seemed to usher in a new era of opportunity for her. 

“I quit, and the simple act of doing so immediately brightened my mood,” she wrote. “It felt like I gained control of my life again. I had been spinning out, desperately waiting for someone to tell me I was good enough for their stupid (expletive) show (they weren't all stupid), and now I could drop all the weight of that self-judgement and shame.” 

“I started teaching yoga and guiding plant walks, and I was peaceful and content for the first time maybe ever in my life,” Greenwood continued. “And just when I thought to myself that maybe I could go back to acting in a way that was healthier for me, I started getting offers. It sounds made up, I know, but it's true. Since then I have been living this way, accepting offers and doing specific audition requests, and it has lead to the most rewarding work of my career.”

In addition to “Girlfriendship” in 2022, she also co-starred with Holly Robinson Peete in “Holiday Heritage” that year. In 2023, she starred in one season of a Canadian TV show called “Shelved,” now available to stream on Tubi, and Hallmark's “Magic in Mistletoe.” In 2024, she appeared in “Crimetime: Freefall” and worked with fellow Hallmark actor Brooks Darnell on the sci-fi short “Embryo,” per IMDb. 

Before Greenwood went public with her cancer journey in March 2025, there was hope from fans and online reviewers for “Crimetime: Freefall” to become a franchise. Macfarlane even told TVGoodness that director Stacey N. Harding always planned on it becoming a franchise — which is still possible once Greenwood feels well enough to act again. 

“Stacey said to me right at the beginning, ‘I'm shooting this with all the preparation one would do as if they were making a pilot,'” Macfarlane told TVGoodness. “She did a wonderful job and I want it to come back. I really do. We wait and see how it does. I am certainly moving forward with the hope that we get to do it again.”

In a rare move, the Hallmark movie “Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: A Lesson in Murder” will premiere simultaneously on Hallmark Mystery and Hallmark Channel on April 10, 2025. The whodunit starring Skyler Samuels has been exclusively available to stream on Hallmark+ since October, but the joint airing marks the movie's cable TV premiere. 

Candace Cameron Bure starred in the original “Aurora Teagarden” franchise until she left Hallmark for Great American Family in 2022. “A Lesson in Murder” is Samuels' second prequel in the franchise, in which she stars as a younger version of the main character. Doing so, she exclusively told EntertainmentNOW, was a major juggling act. 

The cast and crew of “A Lesson in Murder” primarily filmed the movie in Victoria, British Columbia, per IMDb. But the shoot was a long one — lasting most of March and April 2024 — because they filmed two movies back-to-back. The third prequel, “Death at the Diner,” is currently available to stream via Hallmark+ and will likely make its cable premiere at a later date. 

Complicating matters was the fact that Samuels was a new, first-time mom when she arrived to the set. Before the movies debuted on Hallmark+, she told EntertainmentNOW that she felt like she “stumbled all the way through” filming, juggling her scenes while taking breaks to feed and bond with her little one, whose name and gender she's chosen not to reveal.

Samuels laughed that she was “just a working mom who's, you know, putting the ‘Aurora' wig on and running around solving crimes. But also, like, having to take breaks to go pump and then feed the baby, and then come back to set, and just juggle all these all-day jobs. Mom job, actor job — they're both full-time.” 

A post shared by Jessica Harmon (@jessicanoelleharmon)

Viewers will recognize many familiar faces in “A Lesson in Murder.” The cast includes Marilu Henner, who appeared as Aurora's mom in the original movies with Bure. She returned in 2023 for Samuels' first movie as Aurora Teagarden, “Something New,” and appears in her second and third prequels, too. 

Henner, who's now appeared in more than 20 Hallmark projects, told KTLA in October why she loves working with the network so much. 

“They're the best,” she said. “They're the best people to work for, it's a great set … I was flattered enough that they thought I could play myself in the (“Aurora Teagarden”) prequels, so that's what I'm doing.”

Evan Roderick also returns as a young Arthur after appearing in “Something New” the year before. In the prequels, his character is working as a beat cop, years before he becomes a detective. In the original “Aurora Teagarden” movies, that role was played by Hallmark actor and director Peter Benson. 

Thankfully for Samuels, she felt surrounded by support on the Hallmark shoot by crew members who understood her need for flexibility with a new baby. Director Jessica Harmon was expecting her first child during the shoot, Samuels told EntertainmentNOW, and cinematographer Will McKnight's wife gave birth four days before filming started.

“It was just like babies everywhere,” Samuels recalled, laughing. “But I think this year's experience will always be pretty special because it was this, like, unique moment where everyone was coming into parenthood at the same time and it was very exciting.”

“Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: A Lesson in Murder” premieres on Hallmark Mystery and Hallmark Channel on April 10 at 8 p.m. Eastern time. It is also scheduled to air at additional times on Hallmark Mystery and is still available to stream on Hallmark+.

It's been obvious for a while now that Hollywood is hoping to position video game adaptations as its next big meal ticket, but — in an industry that's always braced for failure and blindsided by success — the blockbuster opening weekend of “A Minecraft Movie” still managed to take everyone by surprise. Even Warner Bros. seemed to be caught flat-footed by its own sudden windfall, as if the studio's recent failure to make any money off a mega-budget space fascism satire from Bong Joon Ho and/or the imminent dread it feels about selling the masses on an $115 million action film inspired by a Thomas Pynchon novel somehow meant that a manic kids movie based on the best-selling video game of all time might result in another round of embarrassing headlines.

Still, I can understand why there might have been a little trepidation around a project that, in hindsight, was always going to be a major event. Sure, “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” and the “Sonic the Hedgehog” franchise had already combined to gross more than two billion dollars, but the last time someone plugged Jack Black into one of these things we got “Borderlands,” which didn't even make one billion dollars, and was almost as bad at resembling its video game as Elon Musk probably is at playing it. Further muddying the waters was the fact that “Minecraft” is a plotless sandbox that hinges on the joys of unfettered creativity, while “A Minecraft Movie” is a hyper-linear hero's journey that doesn't have a single fresh idea of its own. 

Experiencing the final product at a pre-release press screening with my five-year-old son (who spent most of the movie beating me to death with the blocky foam swords they gave him on the way in), I wasn't entirely convinced that projecting “Minecraft” graphics onto a generic adventure story would be enough to satisfy the game's fanbase, or to sell its concept on a wider audience. And judging by the tepid response to that screening (which, unlike the average showing of “A Minecraft Movie,” did not descend into “mother!”-like pandemonium at the sight of a square-headed zombie child riding a big chicken), I certainly wouldn't have suspected that “A Minecraft Movie” was about to signal a major paradigm shift in the film industry's priorities. 

 










On the contrary, as I watched Jason Momoa and co. speed through a paint-by-numbers plot so unashamedly mashed together from “The Lord of the Rings” and “The LEGO Movie” that WB might have to sue itself, all I could think about was that Hollywood still has no idea how to make a video game movie. It wasn't until I watched the box office numbers roll in that I started to think about how exciting that could be now that Hollywood is about to be making a lot more of them. 

It might be premature to declare that video game adaptations have become the new superhero movies, but something will have to be in order for Hollywood to move on, as the film business would be lost without a well it can't wait to tap dry (as box office quote machine Paul Dergarabedian confirmed to IndieWire earlier this week). Studio execs may never be able to find another licensing machine as elastic, reliable, and self-perpetuating as the MCU, but the success of recent video game movies at least seems more replicable than that of other sensations like “Oppenheimer” (there's a reason why Paramount barely waited until the weekend was over to announce “The Angry Birds 3,” but Universal still hasn't cleared its summer schedule for a star-studded biopic about Niels Bohr). 

 










It doesn't hurt that video game adaptations also come pre-installed with a more enthusiastic fanbase than movies based on board games and other toys, nor that most of them are reverse-engineered from recognizable fantasy worlds rather than from specific plots, which allows the genre to avoid the tedious fidelity of live-action remakes. Theater etiquette notwithstanding, I'll take a fan servicey moment of recognition like the chicken jockey scene over an entire film that feels like enshittified déjà vu.

All of which is to say that if I were Donna Langley right now, I'd be racing to build out the Super Mario Bros. Cinematic Universe (and using the billions I'd make at the box office to support a full slate of auteur-driven original films because I am a good Warrior of Cinema who would like to see heaven someday). I'd be standing in front of a Powerpoint presentation that maps out our release plans for a “Super Smash Bros.” epic modeled after Jean-Claude Van Damme tournament fighter classics like “Bloodsport,” a “Donkey Kong” comedy about class warfare, and an 150cc “Mario Kart” bonanza that promises to blue shell the “Fast & Furious” franchise into a pit so deep not even Lakitu could ever hope to fish it out. 

Of course, there are only so many beloved video game franchises that lend themselves to that kind of Marvelous thinking — not enough to let Hollywood run these properties into the ground on auto-pilot. With superhero movies slowing down and studios desperate for product, the film industry will likely feel pressured to create video game adaptations faster than they can figure out the safest and least interesting way of doing so. Best case scenario: The creative uncertainty that made video game movies a liability for so long will be complemented — but not replaced — by the urgency with which Hollywood is going to to start making them. 

 










In a lot of cases, that's not going to go well. Despite the fact that Hollywood is throwing a lot more talent and money at these movies than they have in the past, it's possible — probable, even — that many of them will continue to suck as bad as “Hitman” or “Uncharted.” What excites me, after a decade and change of writing virtually the same review for every superhero film that was shoved down our gullets, is my suspicion that these movies will at least have the potential to suck in different and sometimes wildly unexpected ways. 

Of course, if the unique creative freedom that video game movies are still afforded gives me reason to hope that some of them might be worth seeing, it also helps to explain why so many of them have been so bad for so long. As “The Last of Us” showrunner Craig Mazin told me a few years ago: “Movies are not a particularly good medium for video game stories, and it would be folly to try and reproduce the enjoyment of playing them as a passive experience.” (His solution: TV). It's a conundrum that Hollywood has been wrestling with for decades, and — with a few very qualified exceptions — has only been able to solve in the context of high-energy kids fare. 

If the success of “A Minecraft Movie” has broader implications than that of the “Super Mario Bros.” cartoon, however, that's because it was able to create something out of nothing; or, overcoming a challenge similar to the one faced by Amazon's upcoming “The Sims” adaptation, perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it was able to create something out of everything. By sledge-hammering a broad comedy from the bones of its source material's singular brand aesthetic, “Minecraft” proved that a high-concept “Barbie” approach can still pay off in the absence of precious resources like wit and vision. To the same end, it also proved that the weakness or non-existence of video game stories, which has vexed screenwriters from “Double Dragon” to “Need for Speed,”  has the potential to be more of a feature than a bug.

 










But the real opportunity for creativity might stem from the adaptations that are rooted in a more specific narrative of atmospheric experience. I'd be lying if I said I've ever felt the need for a “Death Stranding” movie, especially as Hideo Kojima's schlepping simulator was such a cinematic feat to begin with, but my abject inability to picture what A24 and “Pig” director Michael Sarnoski might do with the idea only makes me more excited to see them try. By the same token, I struggle to imagine how Wes Ball's live-action “The Legend of Zelda” movie will be able to capture the transcendent magic of its source material, but that's all the more reason to let him experiment with it. Ditto the “Split Fiction” and “Vampire Survivor” adaptations that Story Kitchen just scooped up the rights to make, or the “Clair Obscur: Expedition 33” adaptation they've already put into motion even though the game itself has still yet to be released. 

None of these films will resemble one another, and — in stark contrast to the various installments of an interconnected superhero franchise — the success of each one won't have a direct impact on the fortunes of the next, even if all of them are bound together by their perceived viability. Mathieu Turi's imminent “Watch Dogs” might have been greenlit because video games have become widely accepted as valid source material, but it will have to stand on its own two feet in a way that “Ant-Man” never did. 

 










Where “Captain America: Winter Soldier” became a punchline for claiming to be a conspiracy thriller, and where “Logan” was mocked for fronting as a Western even though it was very much a superhero saga at heart, the “Portal” movie that J.J. Abrams is flirting with really would have to be a brain-bending piece of hard sci-fi, while any hypothetical “Red Dead Redemption” adaptation could only hope to succeed by actually embodying the cowboy ethos that “Logan” could only glance at in between other obligations. 

As much as video games have struggled to circumvent the reality that most of them boil down to shooting things, video game movies are tethered to so many different genres that it would be impossible to pump them out on the same kind of assembly line that has been clogging theaters with capeshit since 2008. Video game movies aren't held in place by spandex — there's a different kind of flexibility to them, and more room to stretch the movies towards new places. I'm not holding my breath for that to happen, but the remote possibility that it might is enough to make me happy that superheroes aren't going to be seen as multiplex cinema's only saviors anymore, or even as its most powerful allies. After all, a chicken jockey only has a 0.25 percent chance of appearing in “Minecraft” if no chickens are nearby (a fact I definitely knew offhand and didn't have to google “what is the chicken jockey?” in order to find out), but I suppose that's all the more reason for people to buy a ticket and see something the movies have never shown them before.

IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast had a very special guest this week, live in New York City, with Christine Vachon. The producer at Killer Films, which she runs with Pamela Koffler, has Celine Song's “Materialists” (A24, June 13) coming up after the success of Song's “Past Lives,” which also earned Vachon her first Oscar nomination, for Best Picture. Vachon has helped steer the careers of Todd Haynes, Todd Solondz, and more filmmakers we love throughout a career dating back to Todd Haynes' Sundance-bracing queer triptych “Poison” in 1991.

 










Joining IndieWire “Screen Talk” co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio in-person at Film at Lincoln Center and MoMA's New Directors/New Films, Vachon previewed Song's new film (which co-stars Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal) and mused about the state of moviegoing: “It's not so much people aren't going; there's nothing for people to see,” Vachon said.

“One of the things I love about ‘Past Lives,' and one of the reasons I think it was successful, is everybody thinks it's about them,” Vachon said. “I introduced Celine to Steven Spielberg at that Academy lunch, and Steven said, ‘”Past Lives!” That's about me and my wife,' and then proceeded to tell me a story, which a lot of people tell me, which is ‘I almost did this, and then I did that. This is the person I ended up with.' Almost everyone has a tale that is the road that they could've taken, and they didn't, which is part of the many things that make it appealing.”

Another film Killer has coming up is “Late Fame,” directed by Kent Jones with Willem Dafoe and Greta Lee, another “Past Lives” alum. 

Vachon also talked about Sean Baker and Brady Corbet's recent frankness about how indie filmmakers struggle to make a living. “It's directors, and it's producers,” Vachon said, “and I would say at least directors are protected, to a certain degree, by their union, by the DGA. I'm not disparaging at all what Brady's saying because I know that directors give up an enormous amount to get movies like ‘The Brutalist' done.” (Killer also executive-produced Corbet's Oscar winner.) 

She added, “If a director is putting what they have on the table or on the line, it is typical for us to do the same thing… we're at a moment in independent film which feels extremely disruptive. Character-driven dramas are essentially not being made by the studios at all… It would never occur to me to see a ‘Minecraft' movie. And I assume that's what it's going to be: ‘Minecraft' movies.”

 










Earlier in this week's episode, we also break down the 2025 Cannes Film Festival lineup, which includes new films from Spike Lee, Ari Aster, Kelly Reichardt, and more.

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Pitt” finale — Season 1, Episode 15, “9:00 p.m.”]

At the end of a backbreaking, soul-shaking hospital shift, it's only fitting for Dr. Robby (Noah Wyle) to rally the troops. “Today should never have happened,” he says, as the weary doctors, nurses, and medical staffers gather around. “Such a horrific act is the worst of humanity. But it brought out the best in the rest of us.”

During his two-minute tribute, Dr. Robby — who's suffering from acute existential exhaustion on top of the day's extra-fine grind — falls back on a handful of cliches. He peppers his pick-me-up with terms like “better angels” and shares his pride in each of them for “rising to the occasion.” Near the end, he can't hold back his tears and encourages the rest of them to do the same. “It's just grief,” he says, “leaving the body.”

Dr. Robby's words mean a lot. Seeing a leader actually step up and lead is a rarity these days, and Wyle's blend of inspiration and vulnerability prove potent. They may even end up bringing Dana (Katherine LaNasa) back to Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center, as the charge nurse considers if this should be her last tour of duty.

But they're not the defining words of “The Pitt” finale. 

Those belong to Robby's friend and colleague, Dr. Jack Abbott (Shawn Hatosy). While he isn't around for the bulk of his buddy's 15-hour day, Jack shows up when it counts, in more ways than one. The night attending clocks in during the mass casualty situation (set off by a shooter at Pitt Fest), and then steps up on the roof, next to Dr. Robby, when the bedraggled doc can't stop blaming himself for falling short of his own impossible expectations.

“I broke,” Robby says.  “I shut down. The moment everybody needed me the most, I wasn't there. I couldn't do it. I choked.” 

The grace he gives to his coworkers is notably absent from Robby's brutal self-assessment. He doesn't believe he rose to the occasion. He doesn't feel proud of all the lives he saved. He only remembers the ones he didn't. The same drive and vision that allowed him to successfully lead the treatment of 106 out of 112 patients won't allow for a few minutes of personal human frailty.

But that's all they were — a few minutes, in a shift that stretched on for more than 15 hours. With a little distance, Robby might be able to see the utility he offered during 95 percent of his shift vastly outweighs the 5 percent when he felt useless. It's just hard to step back when you've been in the middle of it for so long, a perspective “The Pitt” excels at crafting throughout its unrelenting, real-time first season.

 










But that's not really what's bugging him. What's bugging him is that it happened before, during COVID, it happened today, in the aftermath of a mass shooting, and that means it will likely happen again. How long will it last then? Who will he lose next time? What's he supposed to do, living with the belief that he's destined to disappoint himself?

Well, he's supposed to recognize his own limitations, as one man in a world of billions, and when he can't do that — for all the reasons outlined above — Jack does it for him. When Robby says he broke, he choked, he failed, Jack is there to tell him, in no uncertain terms, “So fucking what?”

“That is what happens when you're in a war and nothing makes sense,” Jack says. “We survived as a species because we learned how to cooperate and communicate. So when we're in the middle of killing each other, it defies the very logic of our existence. Your brain starts to short-circuit. All you can do is focus on the medicine. The medicine is the only thing that saves the patient — and your sanity.”

The medicine is the only thing that saves the patient, and the medicine is the only thing that saves the doctor. It sounds so simple, and for as blunt as Dr. Abbott is in that moment, he still knows it's not an easy idea to accept. He knows from experience. 

 










At the start of Robby's shift, Jack talks about spending two hours trying to resuscitate a dying veteran. When he couldn't do it, he wrote a note to his family. Clearly, veterans are a personal priority for him. Later, in the park, Jack removes his prosthetic leg, and the implication is that he's been to war — actual war — and it's given him the perspective needed to know what Robby is going through. 

Despite Robby's ball-busting complaints about his speechifying, Jack doesn't just bullshit his way through his friend's crisis. Always the doctor, he speaks directly to what's ailing him. 

In doing so, he also speaks directly to what's made “The Pitt” a minor streaming sensation. Beyond playing spot the nepo baby and guessing “How'd they do that?” during graphic operations, beyond the nostalgia for well-mounted broadcast-style medical dramas and the nostalgia for “E.R.” specifically (which Wyle wearing scrubs can't help but evoke), what the first season of R. Scott Gemmill and John Wells' Max drama offers is medicine — medicine for the broken, burned-out mind. 

What Jack describes to Robby is a situation they both lived through. It's what happened to them, that day, at the hospital. But it's also what's happening all around us, every day, especially in 2025. We are surrounded by war and genocide, environmental catastrophes and unlawful deportations, economic collapse and more mass shootings. Most of us aren't witnessing these events first-hand, in the way these doctors did with the Pitt Fest victims, but we are still witnesses to unfathomable attacks on humanity. If you try to take it all in, all at once or one tragedy after the next, your brain will short-circuit, too. The only way to survive is focus on one single thing that makes sense.

 










“The Pitt” offers its viewers that one single thing. After a long day of work, school, childcare, volunteering, organizing, protesting, and everything else you do to engage with the world you want to make better, “The Pitt” is an utterly absorbing experience that commands your full attention. It's the break your brain needs from the things that are breaking your brain. It's the medicine, and you're the patient. 

Other TV shows, movies, and various forms of entertainment can offer the same physic remedy, and there's also the risk that distracting yourself from reality becomes so addictive that you get permanently lost. But that's part of makes “The Pitt” such a smart choice. It's a show that appreciates a strong work ethic. It respects the commitment its characters are making, as well as the actual dedication of the doctors they represent. It makes it hard to detach completely — what with all the talk about real-world issues like health insurance, vaccines, and, oh yeah, mass shootings — but it beckons you so smoothly into its world that your time there still feels like time off. 

That's not a feeling you can get from second-screen TV. You're not going to feel like you've escaped our current hellscape after spending two hours doom-scrolling with one eye and tracking plot-points with the other. “The Pitt,” despite persistent flaws (that could mostly be fixed before Season 2), knows how to earn your attention. It knows it needs to earn your attention, and it knows you need it to earn your attention. 

 










Maybe that's a little convoluted. Maybe it's lending a TV show a little too much control over my mental health. Maybe I should take Dr. Robby's advice and stop talking.

…you get what I'm saying, though, right?

“The Pitt” Season 1 is available on Max. The series has already been renewed for Season 2.

Doctors are often medical shows' harshest critics, but “The Pitt” seems to be the one they actually like. Doctors credit Max's scripted medical drama, which spends a season exploring 15 hours in a Pittsburgh ER, with capturing the experience of working in a 2025 emergency room.

“The other thing that's really great is the emergency workers who say, ‘For years, I've tried to explain to my family what I do in the emergency department, and I can never put it into words,'” said co-executive producer Dr. Joe Sachs. “ They could never explain, ‘What I go through,' and when they watch an episode of the show, they get it and they understand.”

For decades, real-life cops, lawyers, and doctors have helped TV procedurals with their stories. So what does “The Pitt” do that's different? That's the question IndieWire posed to Sachs as well as medical consultants Dr. Jacob Lentz (eps 103, 106, 109, 112), Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira (eps 104, 107, 110, 113), and writer's intern Dr. Ariel Wu. Short answer: Doctors shaped every aspect of “The Pitt.”

For Season 1, “The Pitt” employed seven residency-trained, board-certified emergency physicians: four for the writing process, and three on-set medical advisors. Six nurses and physician assistants also served as specialty background players throughout production.

Overseeing it all was Sachs, who received his master in film studies while going to medical school — a combination motivated by his interest in public health education. While working for 30 years as a TV writer, Sachs continued to work part-time as an attending emergency physician at a teaching hospital and trauma center.

“I worked all during COVID, all during the peak of the pandemic, intubating the sickest patients in full protection gear, so I know what it's like,” said Sachs.

“The Pitt” creator R. Scott Gemmill, executive producers John Wells and Noah Wyle (who plays Dr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch) shared the goal of realistically capturing an ER in 2025. In their first conversations with Sachs they asked, “What's new? What's going on today?” Sachs' immediate answer was the Boarding Crisis, which took off during COVID and never went away.

“In a 40-bed ER, there may be 30 patients taking up beds in rooms, on gurneys on every available wall spot waiting for admission, so your ability to see new patients suffers,” said Sachs. “The waiting time is terrible. And the horrible solution is that you have to practice waiting-room medicine. From the waiting room, as we portrayed, you get your labs drawn, you come back, you go to x-ray, you come back, and sometimes you never make it back to a bed.”

 










The opening sequence of episode 1 of “The Pitt” grounds the audience in that new normal.  Dr. Robby walks through a hundred patients in the waiting room and briefs the new medical students and residents on the reality of boarding and waiting-room medicine. Said Sachs, “I think in the first few minutes of episode 1, healthcare workers knew this was a show that's real and different from your typical medical show.”

Another reason “The Pitt” is instantly recognizable to doctors, and it could shoot in a realistic way, stemmed from early planning and collaboration between Sachs and production designer Nina Ruscio. She created a set that was not only grounded in modern medicine, but was also built for unique production needs.

“I gave Nina a book of the 20 newest, greatest emergency departments,” said Sachs. “It's curvilinear, there's open doors, there's depth — our set has a ceiling that allows for a documentary-style walk for a half a mile where you see everything. Most sets don't have ceilings and our lighting is built right into that.”

“We never start with a medical case,” said Sachs. “It stems from the dramatic needs of the characters, and when we have the dramatic needs, then my job is to go to the well.”

 










In the search for the specific medical condition that will serve the dramatic needs, that well of story options is deep. Beyond his own three decades in the ER, Sachs brought aboard Dr. Mel Herbert, CEO/Founder of continuing medical education organization EM:RAP; it comes with its own network of medical professionals. Joining Sachs and Herbert in the story development was Dr. Greg Moran, the retired chair of emergency medicine at Olive View Medical Center, and Dr. Ariel Wu, the chief resident in emergency medicine at UCLA who brought the perspective of what the ensemble of medical students and resident characters experience.

“The Pitt” also benefits from an army of more informal consultants. One example of this was hosting “nurse's nights,” where the show feeds working nurses dinner and lets them tell their stories. Sachs offered an example of how this deep well can lead to finding just the right medical case to fit dramatic and character needs.

“A writer wanted to do a scene that showcased Mel King's (Taylor Dearden) special abilities to relate to patients, especially patients with special needs,” said Sachs. The team settled on a patient with SD Autism Spectrum disorder who had an ankle sprain but frustrated Dr. Langdon (Patrick Ball) with his endless questions. Said Sachs, “And Mel comes into the room, sits down quietly, turns off the lights, closes the door, and gets everything she needs out of him.”

 










The case allowed character to be expressed in action and conflict. Without a need for backstory or medical exposition, the viewer knows a great deal about Dearden's character and the medical drama is de-escalated, while Mel's relationship with Langdon takes a new turn.

Sachs, Wu, Moran, and Herbert also gave script notes at every step of the writing process, including a list of vocabulary and medical terminology. 

“We don't shy away from complex technical dialogue,” said Sachs. “If it's crazy technical and the audience doesn't understand it at all, it's fine because the emotion, the conflict, the humor comes through performance.”

Trusting the audience will follow the drama, and won't stumble on jargon and procedures they don't fully understand, is a driving ethos of the writers room. Doctors who watch “The Pitt” love characters who talk like professionals, especially when featuring a particularly cutting-edge scenario. Sachs' favorite example came during episode 14, the mass casualty episode.

“Dr. Langdon places a supraclavicular, subclavian line and calls out all the appropriate landmarks and pointing to the ipsilateral nipple. The cast reading it were going, ‘Are you kidding me? What is this?'” said Sachs. “It's a procedure that isn't taught, that frequently was featured on EM:RAP as a way to do a central line when you don't have ultrasound. Anyway, that show just aired and when that scene came on, Mel Herbert, who's the CEO of EM:RAP, his phone blew up with about 300 texts and emails saying, ‘Oh my God, did you see what they're doing?'”

 










The 15 episodes of Season 1 were divided among the three on-set medical consultants, Drs. Jacob Lentz, Elizabeth Ferreira, and Fred Einesman. Each medical consultant begins prepping their episode as soon as the scripts are ready, sitting in all production meetings and working with directors and department heads. They follow their episodes through production and are on-set for every shot.

“You're responsible for every medical part of everything for the entire episode,” Lentz told IndieWire. “There's a huge amount of prep time and then a huge amount of legwork mapping these things out. And you have to answer every single medical question for the entire episode.”

Medical consultants break down the script to outline what each department will need ahead of time. This is especially key for the art department and props, which must return the medical tool or equipment “back one” as if it hadn't just been used every time.

The doctors learned how, with proper prep and information, filmmakers can produce incredibly lifelike and detailed results. Sachs was particularly impressed how makeup department head Myriam Arougheti created open fractures, the dislocation of a lower extremity, a fasciotomy with tissue bulging out, open chest surgery with a beating heart, third-degree burns, and a vaginal delivery.

 










“The biggest compliment her work has ever had was someone [who worked on ‘The Pitt'] was at a cocktail party and a real-world surgeon said, ‘Don't you know it's a HIPAA violation to use real footage of real patients? Who gives you that footage? Because it's against the law,'” said Sachs. “So to fool a surgeon with our makeup and our procedures is pretty great.”

Each of the principal cast went through a medical boot camp to learn the basics of suturing, intubation, and how to hold an ultrasound. “[For each shooting] day, we write extensive sides, [outlining the] choreography, to make sure these trauma scenes look as legitimate as possible,” said Ferreira of her role as on-set medical consultant. 

During down moments, Ferreira, Einesman, and Lentz would pull an actor aside to review the mechanics of aprocedure to create the right physicality. Said Lentz, “All three of us [the on-set medical consultants] have the muscle memory of how things feel when you pop into a lung. There's a distinct feel to a lumbar puncture, and so you're trying to like explain that and show them how they can best physically mime it  — your shoulder jerks a little bit as you pop through the chest wall into the lung when you're putting in a chest tube.”

 










Ferreira was impressed by how dedicated the cast was to getting it right and how quickly they learned how to mirror each act. According to Ferreira, the actors' muscle memory improved as the season progressed and they slipped more quickly into the physicality of playing ER doctors. The medical consultants learned  thatphysicality was only half of the equation.

“One thing that Lizzie [Dr. Ferreira] is really good about is thinking about where their head is at when you're about to do something,” said Lentz. “If you're doing a crazy procedure, the actor doesn't know if this is routine or a very rare thing. We have to tell them, ‘You rarely do this and it's super high stakes, so this is a hair on fire situation, you're secretly panicked, you're trying to seem calm.'”

Actors getting their actions down is only part of accurately portraying medical procedures. Who stands where, who is responsible for what, who hands what to whom — there's a coordination and choreography in doctors and nurses trying to save lives. Medical consultants shared videos of real-life medical procedures with their episode's director to provide a sense of the action involved, but ultimately it has to be staged and rehearsed to get it right.

 










“I think the directors are very kind because sometimes we do things that I feel typically the director is in charge of,” said Ferreira. “But because of the nature of the situation where it requires a lot of technical knowledge, they give us a lot more freedom into creating the scene and then they [see] what we've done to create their shot.”

Lentz said the series allowed consultants to first stage and rehearse medical procedures. “I would always say, ‘Here's what I came up with. It's your show. It's your episode. Tell me what you think. If you're okay with it, great. If you wanna change anything, let me know,'” said Lentz. “It was a symbiotic, cooperative thing.” 

Professional background extras know how to portray everyday things like busy New Yorkers walking down the street, posh guests at a cocktail party, or workers to board a bus. “It turns out that it's very difficult to teach background actors how to be nurses,” said Lentz. 

In the busy ER, the realism of nurses how move and do their job is vital. Each episode had six nurses as background performers: Melette LeBlanc, Ambar Kaiser Martinez, Jordan Farrand, Tim van Pelt, and Jamie Watkins.

“It's interesting,” Lentz said. “Someone says, ‘Oh, I'd like to be a background on the show,' we'd have to say, ‘Oh, can you work Monday through Friday for seven months? Because it all happens in one day.”

 










Van Pelt was also in charge of background choreography. At any point, there are up to 21 boarded patients on the walls in “The Pitt.” Van Pelt mapped out each patient's symptoms and care minute to minute.

“Tim worked out a spreadsheet for every hour and every episode,” said Sachs. “Each boarding patient has a different appropriate activity, whether it be a breathing treatment, IV antibiotics, meals, physical therapy unique to their condition, And this is the part that I love: Tim looked after the fluid in their IV bag, making sure it went down an appropriate amount every. The attention to detail was phenomenal.”

A shooting at a U.S. presidential rally. A looming recession. And now, the return of one of our great artists after a year out of the public eye. Isn't real life beginning to feel more and more like Nashville, Robert Altman's 1975 portrait of America on the brink? The film boasts a whopping 24 principal characters, shuffling them around in a shell game around the unstable center of Ronee Blakley's Barbara Jean, whose songs of lost love and lost innocence come to stand in for a national reckoning. Altman later told the critic David Thompson: “I just wanted to take the literature of country music… and put it into a panorama which reflected America and its politics.”

Lana Del Rey and Altman have a lot in common: former purveyors of pastiche (Born to Die, M*A*S*H*) who became cultural barometers, avatars for our fears, fetishes, and fascinations. So do she and Barbara Jean, each a feat of self-mythmaking who is at once more and less fragile than she first appears. With “Henry, come on,” the ostensible lead single from a forthcoming album called The Right Person Will Stay, Del Rey delivers what Pauline Kael, reviewing Nashville for The New Yorker, called “a twang with longing in it.” It's not the singer's first foray into country music—“Let Me Love You Like a Woman,” from 2021's Chemtrails Over the Country Club, was practically her “Angel from Montgomery”—but here she fully embraces its iconography. The titular “Henry” is a lonesome cowboy who hangs his hat up on the wall, wears “soft leather, blue jeans,” and whose time has finally come to “go on and giddy up.”

The most country thing about “Henry, come on,” though, is Del Rey's delicate interweaving of the divine and the mundane. “Yesterday, I heard God say, ‘You were born to be the one/To hold thе hand of the man/Who flies too close to thе sun,'” she sings, only to immediately deadpan, “I'll still be nice to your mom.” When her voice breaks on the last syllable of “fly away,” I'm reminded of Barbara Jean, clad in frilly white lace, nearly sobbing as she performs “Dues,” a song Blakley herself wrote. The pageantry of country music is a costume that reveals. And somewhere between its exquisite, prairie-wide string arrangements, iPhone screenshot cover art, and Del Rey's cowgirl persona, “Henry, come on” moseys its way into the sublime.

The title of Macie Stewart's second solo album, When the Distance Is Blue, is borrowed from Rebecca Solnit's essay “The Blue of Distance,” a meditation on longing. The Chicago composer and multi-instrumentalist's album, an eight-part suite of improvisational chamber ambient, is tinted by the limpid colors of an in-between space, peering across absence without attempting to resolve or subdue it. Her pieces for prepared piano, string quartet, voice, and field recordings drift weightlessly; with minimal tools, Stewart crafts multitudes.

The album began with Stewart's improvisations on piano, her first instrument, which she prepared in the studio with contact mics and small objects. It took further shape as she started incorporating recordings from an archive of audio documents gathered during a year on the road, channeling the perpetual ungroundedness of touring into aqueous shapes, and hoping to “evoke a nostalgia for something I wasn't able to name,” she has said. “No matter where I am, there's always something that's far away from me,” she told an interviewer. But her collaborators here—friends and fellow members of the Chicago experimental scene—keep her rooted. Extemporaneous cello from longtime collaborator Lia Kohl enlivens album opener “I Forget How to Remember My Dreams”; on “Murmuration/Memorization,” Kohl's cello and Whitney Johnson's viola blend with wordless vocals, Stewart conducting the air like a choir. Swelling drones saturate the atmosphere, broken only by pointillist plucks near the track's end.

The central presence of piano and a lack of lyrics set When the Distance Is Blue apart from nearly everything else in Stewart's varied catalog, save for her 2020 record with Kohl. There are only minimal traces of her art-rock duo Finom or the cross-pollinated folk of her solo debut, Mouth Full of Glass. Instead, stripping away the complexity of her previous work, she sounds inspired by the nuanced focus her collaborators have shown on albums like Kohl's The Ceiling Reposes and Johnson's Sonescent.

Lead single and album centerpiece “Spring Becomes You, Spring Becomes New” is both lush and exploratory, built around repeating piano figures and bell-like chimes. Stewart's collagist approach succeeds whether she is improvising with a trio of other players (Kohl, Johnson, and double bassist Zach Moore) or overlaying vocal improvisations recorded in a Parisian apartment building (“Stairwell (Before and After)”). She is magnetized to the uncertain, unknown, and uncomfortable, observing textured, complex terrain and rendering it in sound.

A pair of field recordings were born from Stewart's desire to draw the world around her into the music. She recorded “Tsukiji,” flooded with voices and shuffling footsteps, at the Tokyo fish market of the same name; when a car engine emerges, it sounds almost musical, buzzing high above the din. Recorded at the Osaka airport, “In Between” is a microcosm of transience, droning strings swimming through a sea of conversation. Though fleeting, these interstitial tracks help to sustain the album's spiritual core, informing the slow presence of the longer pieces.

“The blue at the horizon, the blue of land that seems to be dissolving into the sky, is a deeper, dreamier, melancholy blue, the blue at the farthest reaches of the places where you see for miles,” writes Solnit; “the blue of distance.” That is precisely the hue Stewart achieves here, blurring wordless humming with lyrical strings, laughter, drones, airport PA announcements, eerily detuned keys, and an undercurrent of nameless yearning.

Not so long ago, it would have been a bizarre novelty if Stephen Malkmus had tried his hand at a sonata, or if Interpol had staged an evening-length multimedia work at Lincoln Center. But concert music needed to loosen up once the old divisions became almost absurd to maintain, and indie bands—well, as their industry collapsed, they needed money, and some had reached a level of professionalism that easily upscaled. Now we don't think twice about Bryce Dessner, Annie Clark, Julia Holter, or Hamilton Leithauser splitting time between hang-out and sit-down shows. Why shouldn't David Longstreth?

Dirty Projectors seem ideally suited to this kind of thing. They distinguished themselves with complex time signatures, mosaic vocal techniques, nonlinear structures, and ambiguous tonality—sweetly coated, sour-centered. Their magpie psych-pop has often snagged bits of classical in its darting path. Yet Song of the Earth, Longstreth's first major piece for a large ensemble, shows how different writing an hour of concert music is from writing an hour of songs. It's a challenging, arduous, fitfully rewarding work that favors density and creativity at the expense of clarity and continuity—long music for short attention spans.

Song of the Earth was commissioned by the Berlin-based chamber orchestra s t a r g a z e, conducted by André de Ridder. Though named after Mahler's song cycle Das Lied Von Der Erde, the album evokes late-'60s auteurs like Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks, and Scott Walker, their juiced-up harmonies and huge, shivery arrangements swirled into the nervy minimalist brew of contemporary chamber music. Longstreth has said he wrote the first draft in six “manic” weeks, disoriented by the new pandemic and new fatherhood, and that really is the best word. With 24 tracks, often subdivided into little cubicles, it's a long hour that keeps starting over. Dirty Projectors' Felicia Douglass, Maia Friedman, and Olga Bell contribute a lot, and guests like Phil Elverum and Steve Lacy are in there somewhere. It's probably best in concert, for which it was designed. But at home, it's nearly monotonous in its restless variety.

Though the overall picture is blurry, the individual parts can sound good, with a few exceptions: “Gimme Bread” is an early primer on the album's unique mess and excess. As Longstreth croons under his range, there's a Pet Sounds-y part, then a harp freakout with people chanting, then a riffy part, all before the menacing Pharoahe Monch-style horns burst in, taking the climactic insight about bread a little too seriously. In “Uninhabitable Earth, Paragraph One,” Longstreth sings an extract from a climate journalist's book verbatim, which seems like a cool thing to try before instantly seeing why it doesn't work well at all, let alone with a little gospel-rap prelude.

On the other hand, the album starts well with “Summer Light,” where the female singers set the template for the natural, flattering sections of imitative counterpoint that are consistent high points across the album. The ensemble is robust and game as it attacks the demands for churning basses, scampering trebles, and blustery horns. “At Home” in particular comes together as an enchantingly sung, confidently developed, piercingly simple song, the lyrics modest but functional. It's a tantalizing glimpse of one dimension Longstreth could have explored within this splintering psych-orchestral universe. Borrowing Mahler's vivid contrasts while jettisoning the soothing unity, Song of the Earth feels more like something coming apart than coming together, which may relate to Longstreth's ideas about the earth and how we live now. But if you can't get on its chaotic wavelength, it can wear you out.

Mariah Carey‘s Emancipation of Mimi will celebrate a milestone anniversary this weekend, marking 20 years since its April 12, 2005, release. The musician kicked off the party early last year with an expansive Las Vegas residency in celebration of the album. But now she's keeping it going with The Emancipation of Mimi (20th Anniversary Edition) and an additional digital deluxe edition, both set for release on May 30


	“I'm really happy to celebrate ‘Mimi's Emancipation' with this special anniversary re-release,” Carey shared in a statement. “While working on this edition, I got to relive all the memories from this pivotal moment in my personal and professional life. This album has some of my biggest hits to date, as well as some personal favorites that are very special to me. Forgotten gems, unreleased bonus tracks and different remixes with incredible collaborators – all of these and more are now available in one place for the first time ever!”


The physical version of the anniversary edition will include a 45-track 5LP box set including recent live performances of Emancipation of Mimi tracks, a cappella renditions, instrumentals, and unreleased cuts, including “When I Feel It,” which was leaked online in 2005 but never released due to sample clearance hiccups. It will appear on Side J along with the Esentrik remix of “It's Like That,” the Kaytranada remix of “Don't Forget About Us,”— which is out now — and the medley of “Don't Forget About Us” and “We Belong Together” that Carey performed at the American Music Awards in 2024.

	











	“When you sit down and go through the whole Emancipation of Mimi as an album, and go, ‘Some of these songs were a little bit more that way or a little bit more this way,' it's just really interesting,” Carey told Rolling Stone last year as she prepared to kick off her Las Vegas residency. “I love the album so much that it's hard to pick it apart and go, ‘Oh, I like this part less than I like that part.' It really is one unit.”

	The more time she spends with the album over the years, Carey said, the more she loves it. “Certain songs that I really didn't get a chance to perform very much — like ‘I Wish You Knew,' ‘Your Girl,' and ‘Circles' — we kind of made medleys out of a lot of these songs,” she said. “That album just ended up being my favorite body of work that I've done.”

	











	An a capella version of “Circles” will be featured on the anniversary release, as well as an a capella version of “Shake It Off” and an instrumental for “We Belong Together.” Carey launched an official website for the release that pays homage to her early 2000s fan site, a nod to the fans who have been with her for decades. “There's just something about that time period and about everything that went into my work, my music, and my life at that time that really is the essence of who I am,” she said.

	Charlie Heller, the bereaved rookie vigilante Rami Malek plays in The Amateur, is all brains and no brawn. That sets him apart from his colleagues at the CIA, where he works as a cryptographer, running numbers while they run down suspects. It also distinguishes him, of course, from the Jason Bournes and James Bonds of the world — the perfect physical specimens that usually headline globe-hopping espionage claptrap of this sort. The Amateur takes off from a hooky hypothetical: What if the most intelligent man in central intelligence had to leave his desk and enter the field? For a sense of how that plays, imagine watching Q assume the mantle of 007.


	It's grief that pulls the lion out of this lamb. Charlie, you see, is after the terrorists who murdered his wife, Sarah (Rachel Brosnahan), an investigative reporter in the wrong place at the wrong time. We know she's doomed from the very first scene, a morning of coffee and canoodling so idyllic it can only portend tragedy. When the taxi peels out from their cozy farmhouse, Sarah smiling within, it's like that carriage to eternity Emily Dickinson waxed poetic about. No domestic bliss this pure could possibly last. If it did, the hero would just stay home and cuddle instead of killing anyone.Instead, Charlie blackmails two superiors into some combat training and takes the matter of avenging his beloved into his own shaky hands, chasing leads from London to Paris to Istanbul. A thousand Death Wish clones have treated revenge like a self-help seminar, transforming a meek beta into a macho alpha. But the fun of The Amateur lies in how un-stereotypically Charlie mans up: Rather than going full action hero, he remains his squirrelly, vaguely neurodivergent self — an IT guy turned vengeful wife guy, cutting an improvised warpath across Europe. Occasionally, this results in some mordant humor, as when Charlie cues up a YouTube explainer on lock-picking right at the door he means to enter. Other times, he's less clueless than downright diabolical, rigging a skyscraper swimming pool into a cracking, collapsing death trap worthy of Jigsaw.

	











	Back in his Mr. Robot comfort zone, Malek leans on all his old affectations of antisocial oddity: the bug eyes perennially averting, the face puckering so much you'd swear he was chomping on a lemon during every encounter. Is this our weirdest working movie star? There's not an A-lister with a clammier brand. Less convincing are the scenes where this vaguely humanoid star-man has to express emotional anguish. No wonder the movie keeps cutting to nearly subliminal flashbacks of Brosnahan — an overcompensating attempt to fill the void where its heart should be. So relentlessly does The Amateur work the dead wife angle that you'd swear Christopher Nolan was responsible. (The script was, in fact, penned by Ken Nolan, no relation, and of relevantly military-minded Black Hawk Down fame.)

	What uniformly overqualified performers British TV director James Hawes has assembled around his fidgety lead. Laurence Fishburne puts a harsher, realpolitik spin on his Morpheus mentor routine to play the retired colonel who shows Charlie the ropes, then threatens to snuff him out at the command of the green agent's peeved boss (Mindhunter's exquisitely salty Holt McCallany, who makes his bastard bigwig hard to hate). Jon Bernthal, doing double duty this month in action flicks about possibly autistic ass-kickers, also swaggers in for a cameo as irresistible as it is totally expendable, even pointless. (You could cleanly excise his swinging-dick secret agent from the movie, but why would you want to?) And The Amateur is smart to conceal the identity of the big bad Charlie is tracking — all the better to delight us when the actor finally shows up to deliver a surprisingly sympathetic monologue, like the most understated Bond villain ever.

	











	Only a hair overlong at two hours, this is the kind of disposable airport spy thriller that Hollywood rarely makes anymore, and which generally plays fine, maybe best, on cable over a lazy Saturday afternoon. The source material, a novel by Robert Littell, dates back to the Cold War, and only the technology meaningfully situates us in a more modern world. In fact, there's even something rather retro about that element, too. The slow crawl of progress bars, the insect skitter of lines of codes, the jittery surveillance footage begging to be enhanced: If you've seen a Bourne movie or a Tony Scott techno-thriller, you know the paranoid drill.Just don't mistake the film's vision of cloak and dagger for any kind of contemporary reality. The Amateur is a Cold War throwback in more ways than one: It reflects the spy movies, and the spycraft, of a very different era. Today, you wouldn't need the mad hacking skills of Charlie Heller to declassify America's shadiest operations. You'd just need a Signal account and a dream.

Cross Canadian Ragweed sized up the expectations — months of comeback hype, a stadium filled with fans doing the wave, a five-band lineup of Red Dirt icons, and an introduction by Oklahoma State University football coach Mike Gundy — and then made a collective decision to blow right past them.


	The Oklahoma four-piece credited with laying the groundwork for today's soaring popularity of Red Dirt music capped a layoff of nearly 15 years on Thursday night with a blistering two-and-a-half-hour comeback concert at Boone Pickens Stadium in Stillwater — the town where they got their start and paid their dues 30 years ago.


	“It seems like it was a really long time ago, and not six or seven months ago, that we were talking about how we were gonna do this,” frontman Cody Canada told the sold-out crowd of more than 45,000. “Now we're here. We fucking did it.”


	Ragweed followed a scorching set from their co-headliners, Turnpike Troubadours, who announced a surprise new album onstage, plus shows from the Great Divide, Jason Boland and the Stragglers, and Stoney LaRue, at the first of a four-night concert event dubbed “The Boys From Oklahoma.”

	











	Canada, along with rhythm guitarist Grady Cross, bassist Jeremy Plato, and drummer Randy Ragsdale, spent the weeks ahead of the concert raking in accolades like an induction into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame and the Icon Award from Texas Music & Radio Awards. On Thursday night, they turned the fervor on its head with what might well go down as the most memorable concert in the state's history.


	In early October, Ragweed confirmed this reunion in an interview with Rolling Stone. In the eight months since, the four members have spoken to me in more than a dozen interviews — for this story and for a book chronicling their return, Never Say Never, which will recap all four concerts and is set for release on April 21.


	From the start, the scale of the shows never actually set in with Canada. For all the credit Ragweed get for exposing the world to Red Dirt, the group spent the arc of its career as a bar band. Canada's current band, the Departed — featuring Canada, Plato, and drummer Eric Hansen — is still a bar band. Coming back, suddenly, as a stadium act is hard to comprehend for the Ragweed frontman.

	“We got into Stillwater on Monday night, and kind of had the keys to the kingdom,” Canada tells Rolling Stone ahead of the show. “We walked around everywhere, and man, you can look at it all you want to on a piece of paper, but good Lord, it's big. I've been to so many shows like this, but I've never done it.”


	A year ago, such conversations would have been unfathomable, and the idea of a reunion residency at such a scale would have been laughable. Ragweed's final show, in October 2010 at Joe's Sports Bar in Chicago, capped a year of internal turmoil that left hard feelings and bitterness in the band. In February 2024, Canada — again speaking to RS — emphatically ruled out a comeback.


	In truth, however, the notion had been on Canada's mind for nearly two years. He saw the reaction to Turnpike's 2022 reunion after a three-year break, and social media comments suggesting that Ragweed should be next. Jon Folk — agent for both Ragweed and the Departed, as well as Turnpike — had steadily fielded offers since Ragweed broke up, but he began receiving ones that crept into life-altering territory. Canada started running the idea of a comeback past his peers: Robert Earl Keen told him to take a victory lap; Great Divide frontman Mike McClure, whose own band once broke up for nearly a decade, told Canada he'd feel like a weight had been lifted.

	“To be able to reconcile that, and to think about how happy this is going to make their fans,” McClure says, “I really can't believe it.”


	Felker echoes McClure's sentiment but is quick to point out that Ragweed were gone a lot longer than Turnpike. That time away, he says, created an aura around the band which contributed to the frenzy surrounding their return.


	“Theirs is very different than ours,” Felker says. “They're almost mythical to us, to people who are my age and a little older who were there. They sort of sum up a generation. To see them get to come back like this, at some of the biggest shows in Oklahoma that have ever happened, it's fucking insane.”


	The path to the stage on Thursday night, in hindsight, was less of a road and more of a tightrope. With the exception of Plato, who says of a comeback, “I always thought it was bound to happen,” the tightrope began at OSU. Right about when Canada was swearing off a comeback, Darren Shrum was dreaming big. At the time, the university president was Kayse Shrum; Darren is her husband. In early 2024, he thought bringing concerts to OSU's athletic facilities would help fill a need for name, image, and likeness money for the program. He tells Rolling Stone now that he ran the idea past Kayse. “She said, ‘Go for it,'” Darren recalls.

	











	But Darren Shrum was focusing on Gallagher-Iba, Oklahoma State's 13,000-seat basketball arena, not the massive Boone Pickens stadium. However, when he took the idea to Kyle Waters, the university's athletic director for facilities, Waters, who once worked for Coachella, responded by sharing a years-old proposal he had made for a concert at Boone Pickens.


	With permission to move forward, Darren — along with Waters and director of football business Kenyatta Wright, a former Oklahoma State and NFL player who is close with Turnpike — started brainstorming. They wanted a country show to be first and contacted Russell Doussan, whose company, Doussan Music Group, is currently producing and promoting Alan Jackson's Last Call Tour. With Doussan's help, OSU put out an offer for a concert featuring Jason Aldean and Miranda Lambert, but more than a month passed without an answer.


	That's when Waters suggested Ragweed. “I said, ‘Can they fill the stadium?' And Kyle said, ‘I don't know, but I think so,'” Darren tells Rolling Stone. “So I said, ‘We're gonna push forward.'”


	They contacted Folk, who contacted Canada. This time, the idea of a comeback stopped Canada cold.


	“I think there were some unresolved feelings around when and how the band split up,” Folk says. “All the guys in the band had regrets over how that chapter ended. I've always found that in life that time heals all wounds. If you were around back in the Ragweed era, you know how much fun their show was and how much happiness it brought to everyone in the room. 


	“Ultimately,” Folk continues, “I think after years of arguing with himself, Cody woke up one day and said, ‘I'm tired of being upset about this, and I'm going to do something about it.' He told me, ‘If the guys are up for it, I'd love to add some more chapters to our story.'”


	Folk reached out to Cross and Ragsdale separately. But Cross's mind didn't go to Ragweed; rather, he thought of his kids. His daughter, Charlie, and son, Slaid, were young when the band broke up. Slaid is 19 now and plays guitar in a hard-driving country band called the Smokin Oaks. Canada has two sons, Dierks and Willy, in their late teens. They play in Waves in April, a metalcore band based in New Braunfels, Texas.


	Cross saw a chance for the band to show their children what their old men were capable of together.


	“We were gone a lot, and when we broke up, we went home and raised our kids,” Cross says. “Instagram wasn't around when we played. They never got to see what we were like. This really is everything.”

	











	Cross and Ragsdale said yes, and a deal was made. Immediately, the ticket presale window revealed a massive demand for a Ragweed concert. One night became four nights, without a general public on sale ever happening.


	“I am still in the ‘is this real' mode,” Doussan says. “Being in the business for almost 31 years, and having worked with many ‘level A' artists and massive events, I have never been a part of something so explosive.”


	In early November, Kayse Shrum invited Ragweed to Oklahoma State's homecoming football game as the guests of honor. The Departed always play a concert the night before OSU's homecoming in the parking lot of Eskimo Joe's — Stillwater's longtime bellwether bar. At that concert, the four members spoke as a group for the first time in more than a decade. Canada and Cross hugged, and Cross joined the Departed onstage at Eskimo Joe's to play guitar. The next day, the band and their families took in the football game from Shrum's suite.


	One of the family members in the suite was JC Ragsdale — Randy's son, who was born in 1999 with a form of epilepsy called Lennox Gastaut Syndrome. He used a wheelchair and was limited in his speech, and Canada delighted in embracing him, crying to himself when he saw JC taking in the scene.


	“When Cody said yes, I could see a weight had been lifted in his eyes,” says Shannon Canada, Cody's wife and Ragweed's manager. “At homecoming, when I saw him with Grady and Randy, it didn't feel like 15 years had passed. That's when Ragweed really was back.”


	Less than a month later, JC Ragsdale died. The band was devastated, but it put the members in a position of comforting Ragsdale and one another. After the funeral, Ragweed resolved: This comeback is for JC.


	“You cherish a lot of the simple things that a lot of people take for granted,” Ragsdale says of JC. “You pay attention to what matters, and you just fucking learn how to soften up and have a heart, because some people have a hard fight just to get through the day. One little thing that you might think is small might mean the whole world to someone else. I didn't realize what an impact Ragweed had on my own son until I came home. For the last 15 years, he was just watching videos of us over and over again.”


	With a renewed friendship and a clear-cut motivation to set the bar for the Red Dirt concerts, Ragweed spent the end of 2024 and early 2025 rehearsing relentlessly — usually in Fort Worth at the studio belonging to Vaden Todd Lewis of the Toadies. They let Folk, Doussan, and Shannon Canada work out the details of the concert.

	











	As city, Stillwater found itself in an unprecedented position. The town's population is just over 49,000 — roughly the same number of tickets sold for each night of the Boys From Oklahoma concerts. Stan Clark founded Eskimo Joe's 50 years ago and still oversees the company that runs it. His establishment is the most-recognizable bar and restaurant in Oklahoma. Still, he says this week is a new experience for everybody with an interest in Stillwater or OSU.


	“Over 180,000 tickets sold,” Clark says. “I can't even get my arms around what that's going to look like or feel like. We've never had it. We've had game days, but that's one-and-done. We've never had four in a row.”


	By the time Ragweed stepped off the tightrope and into the spotlight Thursday night, the concert had already cemented its place in Red Dirt lore. LaRue kicked the night off and chose “Oklahoma Breakdown” — the Mike Hosty-penned river tune that was the top-selling single in Texas music in 2007 — to set the tone. Boland followed with a set heavy on the songs he wrote when he lived in this town such as “Pearl Snaps” and “Proud Souls.” The Great Divide led off the third set with “College Days,” which McClure wrote about Stillwater.


	When the Turnpike Troubadours are in their element, they are one of the hardest bands in country music to follow. On Thursday night, they were in their element. The co-headliners played a stomping, high-energy show for 70 minutes with a set list filled with enough Turnpike standards that effectively dared Ragweed to try to top it.


	“How does it feel to be a part of the biggest night in Oklahoma music ever?” Felker asked the crowd. “All of the bands on this stage are the reason we get to do this. I've had a lot of great nights in my life, but this is the best one ever.”


	Ultimately, though, the night belonged to the garage band from Stillwater, and Ragweed played an hour longer than their planned set time. At one point, Canada pleaded with event organizers from the mic, “Y'all, don't shut us off! We haven't played a show in 16 fucking years.”


	Ragweed didn't just burn through their catalog, though. They laid bare for all in attendance the driving forces behind their comeback. The children whose own musical pursuits spurred the reunion all made it onstage, highlighted by Charlie Cross, who stepped to center stage with a harmonica to kick off the event's title song, “Boys From Oklahoma,” that brought the loudest roar of the night.

	











	There was also a steady stream of special guests. Dierks Bentley joined to sing his favorite Ragweed song, “42 Miles.” Felker sat in for a verse of “Brooklyn Kid,” Boland did the same on “17,” and Wade Bowen sang “Constantly.” Before kicking off “Carney Man” — the kitschy circus tune Canada and McClure wrote that put Ragweed on the map in the late 1990s — Canada smirked to the crowd, “This is what you wanted!”


	The night ended with a cover of Reckless Kelly's “Crazy Eddie's Last Hurrah,” with Willy and Cody Braun from Reckless contributing on vocals and mandolin, respectively. The song itself is a fictional tale about a murder of passion, but fans sang the final chorus loudly and clearly, as though the lyrics were plausible to at least a few.


	Then, Ragweed walked off the stage. Spouses, children, and fellow artists met all four men at the end of the stage with a mix of laughter and tears, along with an endless line of hugs. Canada cut through the euphoria just long enough to put the evening into words.

	President Donald Trump seems perfectly willing to plunge the United States into a full-blown trade war with China, and China is not backing down.


	Trump on Wednesday paused many of the most extreme tariffs he announced last week, but jacked up the tax on Chinese goods. The White House said on Thursday that the effective tariff rate against China is now 145 percent. In response, China has bumped up their own retaliatory tariffs against U.S. imports to 125 percent — and any gains made by financial markets since Trump announced his 90-day pause are being wiped out as the long-brewing tensions between the two economic powers look ready to explode.


	Retaliatory tariffs are not the only economic lever China is pulling. Earlier this week, China slapped restrictions on exporting rare earth minerals to the United States, a supply chain it controls almost entirely. On Thursday, the Chinese commerce ministry slapped economic restrictions on 18 major manufacturers and defense companies in the U.S. 

	











	According to a Friday report from CNN, White House officials in communication with China had warned them against attempting to retaliate against the president's punitive tariffs — and should sit down to negotiate. Instead of asking China to talk, White House officials reportedly instructed their Chinese counterparts to have Chinese President Xi Jinping request a phone call with Trump. No request, or call, ever came. 


	Major American companies are scrambling to react to massive tax increases on their day-to-day sales and operations. On Friday Tesla — the flagship company of Elon Musk — removed the “order” button on its China website for the Model S and Model X. Both cars are manufactured in the United States and exported to China. 


	One of the companies most at risk in the intensifying trade war is another emblem of American technology and innovation: Apple. Around 90 percent of iPhones are assembled by Foxconn in China, which also manufactures products for Amazon, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony. According to an estimate from Evercore ISI, over half of Apple's Mac computer products and 80 percent of iPads are also assembled in China.

	Markets once again balked on Friday, continuing the roller coaster of a week for investors. Despite Trump's decision to pull the plug on most reciprocal tariffs while he “negotiates” deals with interested nations, the effective tariff rate for imports is even higher than it was before the pause on Wednesday, mostly due to the jacked up tax on imports from China, America's third-largest trading partner.

	











	Even more worrisome is the volatility in the typically stable U.S. bond market. On Friday morning, the 10-year yield surpassed 4.5 percent, a concerning sign that the Trump administration's move to pump the breaks on their tariff regime has not reassured major holders of the U.S. debt. 


	According to a study from Yale's Budget Lab, Trump's tariffs — as they stood on Thursday — would cost the average household about $4,700 a year. Clothing and textile prices would be significantly affected, spiking up to 67 percent in the short run. Unemployment would rise, GDP would drop, and businesses both large and small would take massive hits.

	With every percentage point that Trump hikes up the tariffs, things would get worse. Nevertheless, the president insisted on Friday that he and his administration is “doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY.  Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly.” 


	Things are moving quickly, in a downward line.

Donald Trump has taken extreme measures in his second term to deport foreign nationals legally residing in the U.S., such as revoking the visas of students involved in pro-Palestine protests on campuses around the country. Now, as The New York Times reports, the administration will look to widen the scope of its attacks on immigrants by canceling their Social Security numbers.


	The idea is to make it impossible for immigrants to work or access banking services — even though they came here legally — in hopes that they will be forced to self-deport. The Social Security Administration (SSA) plans to accomplish this by adding names to its “death master file,” marking living individuals as dead and removing them from the system. The agency's acting commissioner, Leland Dudek, explained in an email to staff that their “financial lives” would thus be “terminated.” Approximately 6,000 mostly Latino immigrants have already been pronounced dead by the SSA at the request of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, according to The Washington Post.

	











	And, according to Times, the “death master file” scheme isn't the only way the SSA has cooperated with Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. It also reached an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to hand over the last-known addresses of 98,000 people to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).


	Supposedly, the targets of these moves include “suspected terrorists” and convicted criminals — though as Trump's mass deportation of migrants to a mega-prison in El Salvador has demonstrated, the administration hardly bothers to justify these categorizations. About 90 percent of those prisoners have no criminal record, and ICE and DHS appear to have based their spurious claims about alleged gang affiliations on unrelated tattoos and clothing. Authorities have also admitted to sending one person to the prison in El Salvador due to an “administrative error.” The conservative-dominated Supreme Court today ordered the Trump administration to “facilitate” that man's release, in a unanimous decision.

	Similar errors are likely to arise as the Social Security Administration starts to rescind credentials from thousands of people. But it's just part of a sweeping and unprecedented effort to weaponize data from agencies formerly considered apolitical. Several top Internal Revenue Service officials resigned this week after the agency signaled that it would use tax documents to help the Trump administration identify immigrants to be deported.

	











	Tech oligarch Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency are heavily involved in this allegedly illegal ransacking of sensitive information from the administrative state, accessing this material through federal IT systems and feeding it into AI models for analysis. Needless to say, that software isn't infallible — and Musk himself seems committed to misreading and distorting whatever his team finds. The world's richest man has trashed Social Security as “the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time,” baselessly claimed that undocumented migrants are receiving benefits, and, at a rally in Wisconsin last month, argued that President Joe Biden had allowed an increasing number of noncitizens to receive Social Security numbers.


	But the program of automatically assigning Social Security numbers to immigrants authorized to work in the U.S., Enumeration Beyond Entry (EBE), began in 2017 under Trump. The program doesn't entitle noncitizens to receive Social Security benefits — it was designed to let noncitizens with legal status start paying into the program without visiting a SSA field office to obtain a number. The current Trump administration has partially frozen the EBE deal, meaning many work-authorized immigrants (and newly naturalized U.S. citizens) will need to visit one of those offices, which have been ravaged by DOGE-imposed staff cuts and closures, in order to get a Social Security card.

	More broadly, DOGE appears to be gathering personal data on hundreds of millions of Americans, not just immigrants, presumably in violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, enacted after Watergate to prevent the abuse of private personal information by government officials. For Trump, who promised “retribution” in the closing days of the 2024 election, access to these records could enable all manner of revenge against perceived enemies. Already, federal workers have come to believe that DOGE is spying on their internal communications, perhaps with the aim of purging anyone disloyal to Trump.


	The machinations afoot at the Social Security Administration alone reveal how easy it is for the White House to inflict harm on swaths of people with little regard for who is actually lumped into those groups or why. They also raise the question of what other phony pretexts the administration might invent to declare a person — citizen or not — effectively nonexistent. For an institution established to keep older and disabled Americans out of poverty, it's about as far from the original mission as you can get.

	A presidential candidate who plays to white grievance is almost assassinated. A Black woman runs for president. A major deportation threat hangs in the air. People take to the streets to protest bombings and genocide. Sounds very much like modern times. Instead, it's the post-Woodstock world of the early Seventies seen in Kevin Macdonald's One to One: John & Yoko, a documentary that dares to take you into one of the most polarizing periods of one of pop culture's most controversial couples. It's the movie you didn't think you'd want that turns out to be one of the few recent Beatles products you'll need.


	In the last few years, we've been awash in such Beatles content, some of it momentous, some marginal. One to One isn't as revelatory as Get Back, Peter Jackson's opus about the making of the Let It Be album, but it serves as something of a sequel. Taking in the years 1971 to 1973, it's a whooshing subway ride of a movie about the period when Lennon and Ono left England for downtown New York, leaving behind a lush estate for an apartment in the West Village. The legal dissolution of the Beatles had just begun, and Lennon is heard saying in one of many phone recordings in the film, “I want to be me now.” And the New York of the dawn of the Seventies was where he wanted to blossom.

	











	Starting with a recreation of Lennon and Ono's cozy, somewhat messy apartment, which feels more like a home to sloppy college roommates than one of the most famous musicians in the world, One to One is a window into the chaotic intersection of rock stardom, radical-chic politics, and counterculture art. The couple had dabbled in that confluence while they were still in England, shaving off their hair in 1970 and donating the locks to an auction to benefit a house for disabled kids. But they plunged headfirst into it during their time in Greenwich Village. The artistic fruits of that period — the spotty and proudly abrasive Sometime in New York City album — were not very tasty, to extend the metaphor. But the circus that unfolded around them is more entertaining than some of the music they made during that era.

	By way of interview recordings and taped phone calls (made by Lennon out of concern that he was being hassled by FBI, the immigration department, or both), One to One gives us a unique look into Lennon and Ono's post-Beatles world. They may now be living in a workaday apartment with a TV set placed just beyond the foot of their bed so they don't have to get up to watch it, but they're still celebrity rock stars with whims and grievances all their own and more than a sense of entitlement. In one call, Ono complains to a friend that Paul, George, and Ringo continue to avoid giving her any props whatsoever (“That's male chauvinism!”). Other calls are hilarious, like when pugnacious manager Allen Klein tries to talk Lennon out of singing a new song, “Attica” (about the famous prison riot) at a benefit for activist John Sinclair, instead of one of his hits. 












	In what amounts to a recurring gag, Ono is heard calling associates and demanding they round up thousands of live flies for a gallery exhibit. Those workers, including Lennon's future girlfriend May Pang, are heard scrambling to find the insects in time for the opening. (Spoiler alert: They do, and we see the results.) An entire film of those taped conversations would be an amazing performance art exhibit on its own.


	Yes, there's also music. One to One gets its title from a rare concert that Lennon, Ono, and their backup band Elephant's Memory played in New York in 1972. The show was a benefit for Willowbrook, a home for disabled children and adults that allowed its patients to wallow in filth and degradation. (That disgrace was exposed by a young Geraldo Rivera, then a swaggering TV news crusader before he went all Fox News on us; the transformation is still startling to absorb.) Most of the live footage has appeared before, on the posthumous Live in New York City album and home video in the Eighties. But rewatching Lennon's last full concert, and on a big screen, is another experience altogether. Backing Lennon, Elephant's Memory sound tougher and more cohesive than their legend has it. In close-ups of Lennon at the piano, singing “Mother,” each line of the song about his deceased parent seems to hit him harder than the last. That song, and a snarling version of “Come Together,” make you realize what a tragedy it was that Lennon, unlike his fellow Fabs, never did a full-on solo tour in his lifetime.

	But One to One is as much about its moment in history as it is about John and Yoko. Imitating the barrage of TV news that Lennon and Ono would watch incessantly, Macdonald alternates the timeline of the couple's life with news footage (the shooting of Alabama governor and segregationist George Wallace during a presidential campaign stop, Democratic congresswoman Shirley Chisholm making history as the first Black woman to seek her party's presidential nomination) and frothy, often sexist commercials for cleaning products and cars. The dream of Sixties idealism is over: As Ono tells a friend in a call, “Flower power didn't work, but so what — we're starting again.”


	But it's a flawed reboot, for sure. We listen as Lennon is asked to participate in all manner of benefit concerts, and he and Ono start cavorting with a rebel-yell crowd that includes coarse troubadour David Peel and Yippie co-founder Jerry Rubin, whose love of the spotlight rivals that of any arena rocker. In 1972, Lennon and Rubin hatch an idea for a tour in which ticket sales would go toward bail for wrongly imprisoned political prisoners in this country. The idea is both charitable and a little harebrained, and we listen as they almost get Bob Dylan on board (by way of intermediaries, not Dylan himself). Ono calls notorious Dylanologist A.J. Weberman — seen digging through garbage cans in front of Dylan's Village apartment and finding a very uncool empty container of Clorox — to tell him to back off and stop freaking Dylan out. He agrees, but ultimately Dylan bails and the whole tour falls apart.

	Not too long after that fiasco, Lennon and Ono head uptown to the Dakota building on Manhattan's Upper West Side. The move from sooty downtown to more stylishly sooty uptown now feels doubly symbolic. Even they, it seems, had had enough of playing revolutionary with diminishing returns. And given Richard Nixon's 1972 landslide, who can blame them?


	The movie has a happy ending of sorts: Lennon overcomes an attempt by the Nixon team to deport him, and baby Sean soon comes into the couple's life. But a chilling hint of the future arrives when Lennon is talking with drummer Jim Keltner about safety concerns connected to that aborted bail-money tour: “You mean people trying to kill us or something like that?” Lennon says. “I'm not about to get myself shot.” We all know what came not long after, first for Lennon and now the country. But even in his wildest or most paranoid moments, Lennon probably never fully imagined that the America of 1972 would foreshadow the country more than 50 years later.

The company is quenching a supercharger desert near Roswell, NM, with a special Cyber-UFO-themed station.

A recent X post by MarcoRP leaked Tesla's plans to build a special Cyber-UFO-themed charging station in Roswell, New Mexico, playing into the area's extraterrestrial folklore. Looking at the rendering, the station could potentially feature a canopy that mimics the Cybertruck's aesthetics whilst adding a dash of alien spaceship flair. Once motorists arrive, they'll have access to eight charging stalls, likely aided by the 20.88 kW solar array mounted on top of the “CyberCanopy.”

If you hadn't noticed already, we should clarify that these are just renderings, which were later commented on by Tesla's Head of Charging for North America, Max de Zegher. This means that the final product could look a whole lot different. Regardless, it shows Tesla's initiative to try and combine EV charging with potential points of interest—something we've seen already with its Drive-In-Diner Supercharger in Santa Monica, California. 

If we look at the design, the canopy appears to lean into the Cybertruck's angular aesthetics, with a massive RGB lightbar that appears to wrap around it. We noticed the mock-up showed off different colors being displayed on the lightbar, which could be a potentially interesting feature. If it were up to us, we would use it as a status indicator—showing red if all the stalls are occupied, yellow if some are occupied, and green if every stall is open. This wouldn't be difficult to achieve, as the location would only provide eight charging stalls.

For context, the current largest supercharging facility—with 98 charging stalls—is located at the Harris Ranch complex in Coalinga, California. Pretty impressive.

Teslarati reports Tesla's Head of North American Charging, Max de Zegher, mentioned that the site will be inspired by the events of 1947 that made Roswell what it is today. This inspiration is readily apparent with the CyberCanopy combining the aesthetics of the Cybertruck with a UFO. A later X post by de Zegher revealed pixelated constellations on the underside of the canopy with different patterns, including a hedgehog. All of these design elements are intriguing, but makes us question if they'll be quite as dazzling during the day as they are at night. 

While we're all for making EV charging more of an event, we should note that the proposed location is not only in a literal desert, but also what we'd call a “charging desert.” Assuming the information in the post is correct, the proposed charger will be located next to the Whataburger restaurant on Main Street in Roswell, New Mexico. If we look at Tesla's Supercharger map, there are only 10 Superchargers in the state of New Mexico. 

That's not to mention that the proposed site for the Supercharger is less than what we'd call picturesque. We don't discount that Roswell is an area of outstanding natural beauty, but the proposed location for Tesla's Superchargers just... ain't it. A quick look on Google Maps shows its proximity to fast food restaurants and motels well outside the city center.

As Tesla gradually opens up its Supercharging network to other automakers, it's looking more like the automaker wants to change the philosophy of charging altogether. Instead of directly competing with gas stations, where a fill-up is nothing more than a chore, Tesla wants motorists to visit Superchargers by choice, not only out of necessity. I liken it to my road trip experience as a kid where we'd not only make pit stops for fuel, but also to stop and look at points of interest along the way. 

It makes me think about possible locations for the next batch of Superchargers. Perhaps they could flank the world's largest ball of twine, Corn Palace, or even the famed Carhenge.

Dr. Anona Blackwell shares her remarkable journey from orthodox-trained medic to unapologetic mystic in her recently released candid memoir: From Medic to Mystic – The True Story of an Academic Physician's Journey Into the Paranormal.

Chronicling her dual professional life as a highly respected, Lancet-published academic physician while also investigating powerful psychic and paranormal experiences in her work and personal life, Dr. Blackwell presents compelling evidence for telepathy, clairvoyance, near-death experiences (NDEs), life after death, the power of prayer, non-ordinary reality, and more.

From humble beginnings as the daughter of a bus driver and market gardener, growing up on a smallholding in rural Wales, Dr. Blackwell, BSc, AKC, FRCP, rose to become a leading authority in genito-urinary medicine. She led a research team whose work transformed clinical practice in the UK, improving the health of millions of women by advancing the treatment of anaerobic/bacterial vaginosis.

Immersed in orthodox medicine by day, she devoted her after-hours to the in-depth investigation of anomalous phenomena, energy healing, and metaphysics. Her innate psychic abilities offered profound insights into her patients' lives, psyches, and hidden traumas—insights that few modern doctors are privileged to experience.

Anona's book has been a long time in the making, chronicling her remarkable journey from her birth on a three-acre smallholding in Wales to earning a degree in biophysics, followed by a medical degree in London and post-graduate research at St. Thomas's Hospital. Her career progressed to a consultant post in Swansea in 1985, where she contributed to internationally recognised research, clinical practice, and teaching.

Throughout her journey, she has remained deeply aware of other dimensions of reality—sometimes integrating these perspectives into orthodox treatment. The book is designed for a broad audience but particularly encourages healthcare professionals to adopt a more open-minded approach to the aetiology of disease and holistic care. Infused with Anona's sharp sense of humour, shaped by a challenging childhood, the book resonates on many levels.

Now at age 75, Dr Anona Blackwell is taking the USA by storm, especially among podcasters eager to explore her unique blend of science and spirituality. Her recent appearance on the Jeff Mara Podcast quickly attracted over 23,000 views and a wave of heartfelt feedback from viewers. Her warmth, insight, and candour about her experiences have struck a chord with international audiences. You can watch the episode on YouTube.

The book reveals how, after years of attempting to reconcile her extraordinary experiences, Dr. Blackwell transformed from a scientifically trained medic into a mystic, acknowledging there is far more to life—and to us—than science alone can explain. Her irreverent humour (her account of meeting Prince Charles is unmissable) and ability to bridge medical and metaphysical worlds create a thought-provoking, multi-layered and often amusing read.

By sharing her forays into non-ordinary reality, Dr. Blackwell encourages others to speak more freely about their own experiences—without fear of judgement or being labelled ‘crazy'.

“At the pinnacle of her career as a well-respected British Genitourinary physician, Dr Anona Blackwell decided that there is more to healing than standard drugs and surgery, and bravely embarked on a journey to discover an alternative toolkit – everything from spiritual healing to medical intuition. ‘From Medic to Mystic', which recounts this journey, is nothing less than a blueprint for a new medicine, a wake-up call for every doctor and essential reading for every patient who believes that true healing encompasses the spiritual. Read this book and reclaim your right to true holistic medicine.” – Lynne McTaggart, bestselling author of ‘The Field', ‘The Intention Experiment' and ‘The Power of Eight'.

Researchers have proposed many origins for a gravity anomaly in Wilkes Land, East Antarctica, but the latest evidence suggests the subglacial hole is an impact crater measuring 315 miles across.

Name: Wilkes Land crater

Location: East Antarctica

Coordinates: 70°S 120°E

Why it's incredible: Evidence suggests it could be the greatest known impact crater on Earth.

The Wilkes Land crater is a hole in the bedrock beneath East Antarctica's ice sheet measuring 315 miles (510 kilometers) across. Researchers have been trying to explain its existence since the 1960s, and the most recent evidence suggests it was born from a cataclysmic meteorite impact.

The crater was first detected as a huge dent in Earth's gravitational field. Initial ground-based seismic and gravity surveys already indicated that the crater was huge — around 150 miles (240 km) across — but newer techniques reveal that it is likely more than double this size.

According to a 2018 study, the Wilkes Land crater sits about 1 mile (1.6 km) beneath the surface of Antarctica's ice sheet. The study showed the crater in more detail than ever before and examined its potential link with southern Australia, which was connected to East Antarctica until around 35 million years ago. While the origin of the crater remains uncertain, the results of the study suggest the event that created the hole likely occurred before the continents separated.

Researchers have proposed several explanations for the Wilkes Land crater, including that it could be a volcanic structure, a sedimentary basin, a deeply eroded valley or a meteor impact crater, according to a 2015 paper. For that paper, scientists used satellite remote sensing techniques to map the crater and determine its physical characteristics. In the middle of the hole in Earth's gravitational field, known as a negative gravity anomaly, they found a positive gravity anomaly, with the ice sheet filling the gap around this central peak like a huge, frosty donut.

The central peak is likely a structure known as a mass concentration, or a ""mascon,"" according to the study. Mascons can occur within meteor impact structures due to the meteor crashing through Earth's crust and affecting the mantle beneath. Following the impact, the mantle may recoil and form a dense plug, resulting in a positive gravity anomaly, the study authors wrote.



The Wilkes Land crater and its mascon aren't perfectly circular and instead form a U-shape, according to the 2018 study, whose results support the conclusion that the crater was caused by a meteor impact. The northern side of the crater is fragmented, perhaps as a result of tectonic processes that ripped Australia and Antarctica apart, the authors noted. Parts of the crater are clearly visible in southern Australia, they added.

If the Wilkes Land crater is an impact crater, then it ""would be the greatest impact crater known"" on Earth in terms of its size, the authors wrote.

In the 2015 study, researchers found that the crater's diameter matches the speed and size of space rocks that regularly crashed into Earth during its early history between 4.1 billion and 3.8 billion years ago. ""The WLA [Wilkes Land Anomaly] could have been created by such bolides,"" they wrote in the study.

""Nonetheless, because of the constraints imposed by the overlying continental ice sheet, [...], we believe that the other explanations for the subglacial structure remain viable,"" they added.

Rocket start-up SpinLaunch wants to catapult hundreds of flattened ""microsatellites"" into space at once, using a cannon-like machine that accelerates objects by spinning them. The first orbital demonstration is scheduled for next year.

A California-based startup plans to launch hundreds of flattened ""microsatellites"" into low-Earth orbit at once, by firing rockets out of a giant centrifugal cannon. The first batch of pancake-like spacecraft could be shot into space as soon as next year — and could set a new record.

SpinLaunch is a private company that aims to fire payloads into space using giant, cannon-like machines. These ""cannons"" accelerate spacecraft using spinning arms inside a vacuum-sealed chamber, before shooting them upward out of a barrel faster than a speeding bullet. Using this novel technology, the company aims to establish its own satellite constellation, Meridian Space, which they claim could provide more cost-effective competition to the likes of SpaceX's Starlink network.

On April 3, SpinLaunch revealed that it had received $12 million in funding from Kongsberg Defence and Aerospace (KDA), putting its total funding close to $150 million. The announcement also revealed that KDA's NanoAvionics had been selected to build the first batch of 250 satellites in the Meridian Space constellation, which could be launched during an in-orbit demonstration test planned for some point in 2026.

On the same day, NanoAvionics also released a video explaining more about the new satellites. This revealed that each satellite will be shaped like a flat disk and placed on top of one another inside a ""launch bus,"" like a giant stack of pancakes. Each satellite will be 7.5 feet (2.2 meters) wide and weigh approximately 154 pounds (70 kilograms), making them significantly lighter than most other communications satellites. For example, Starlink's current V2 satellites weigh around 1,760 pounds (800 kg) each.

If all the satellites are successfully delivered into low-Earth orbit (LEO) next year, it would set a new record for most spacecraft launched at once, currently held by SpaceX's Transporter-1 mission, which launched 143 satellites in 2021, according to Live Science's sister site Space.com.

SpinLaunch has previously launched 10 rockets using its Suborbital Accelerator in New Mexico, which has a vacuum chamber around 108 feet (33 m) wide and spins objects to speeds of up to 5,000 mph (8,000 km/h). The most recent launch, in September 2022, successfully delivered multiple payloads into suborbit for the first time, Space.com previously reported.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

During these test launches, the acceleration process took up to 30 minutes, and the rockets experienced up to 10,000 Gs of force before being fired into the upper atmosphere. (One G is equivalent to the force exerted on an object by Earth's gravity.)

Details of next year's orbital demonstration are limited, but the mission will likely be carried out using the same machine as the previous tests. This means that the rocket will be catapulted into a suborbital flight before its engines kick in and deliver the final push needed to put the payload into LEO, according to Space.com.

The main draw of this type of launch system is that it is much cheaper than firing chemical rockets. SpinLaunch predicts that its future commercial launches could cost between $1,250 and $2,500 per kilogram launched into space, which is less than half the cost of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets, which cost around $6,000 per kilogram, according to New Space Economy.

Since the accelerated rockets don't release any greenhouse gases during launch, they are also better for the environment than chemical rockets. These spacecraft also do not need boosters that have to be discarded in space, which will mean less space junk in LEO and reduced chances of discarded equipment falling back to Earth's surface.



SpinLaunch is only planning to launch around 1,200 of satellites in its Meridian Space constellation. However, once this is completed, the company is planning to build a larger Orbital Accelerator machine — with a 328-foot-wide (100 m) chamber — that will be capable of firing payloads for other companies directly into LEO, without the rockets having to fire at all. If this happens, SpinLaunch claims it could eventually launch up to five commercial payloads into space every single day, according to New Space Economy.

—Dying SpaceX rocket triggers giant spiral of light above UK and Europe during secret mission

However, this could lead to more problems further down the road.

If this ambitious launch frequency were achieved, it could exacerbate problems that communications satellites and other commercial payloads are causing in LEO, including an increased chance of spacecraft collisions, more light pollution in the night sky, radio signals that interfere with astronomy and atmospheric metal pollution caused by spacecraft re-entires.

An alert from U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Friday notified users of a glitch in the system that is used to exempt freight from tariffs, including shipments from China that were already on the water at the time of this week's whipsaw in tariffs policy, and any trade from nations now under the 90-day pause put in place by the Trump administration.

The alert explained that U.S. Customs discovered that the entry code for U.S. shippers to use to have their freight exempted is not working and ""the issue is being reviewed.""

In the alert, US Customs advised filers ""to transmit cargo release separately and follow up with the summary filing when resolved.""

Normally, when a U.S. importer pays for their freight, they file both the cargo release forms and their financial papers, so they can pay for their cargo. To keep the cargo moving, Customs is advising importers to file the cargo release form now, and file the financial form later, once the glitch is corrected.

For now, that means the tariffs are not being collected by the U.S. government.

The tariffs being paused on many nation's trade, and the Chinese tariffs still in effect, are based on the sailing date, or the date the freight leaves the factory or warehouse. This is called an ""on the water"" clause and is in effect for all freight bound to the U.S. that has been on the water before the April 5, 9, and 10 tariff announcements.

The on the water clause has not changed, even though the China tariff percentages have increased to 145% and a series of other recent tariffs have been put in place.

CBP said it will issue an update when this issue is resolved.

For U.S. shippers and the supply chain, it's the latest blow at a time of uncertainty and fear about tariffs policy. It also raises questions about Customs ability to handle the new policy and collect the tariffs revenue that is key to Trump administration economic goals. Interpretations of the multiple executive orders, social media posts, and customs alerts have some U.S. companies and industry groups trying to figure out when the new tariffs will be deployed.

""There has been some confusion on what President Trump has said in social media posts on when the tariff starts and what is written in the executive order,"" said Jarred Varanelli, vice president of US sales at logistics firm Savino Del Bene. ""Social media posts are not law on the pause and increase in tariffs. With the constant changes to the regulations, all customs brokers in our industry have a difficult task ahead of them.""

Despite President Trump saying numerous times tariffs are in effect, including the China tariffs and a 10% tariff applied globally, and being collected, U.S. shippers tell CNBC they have not been charged higher tariff rates on their containers, some of which came in as late as yesterday.

Dewardric McNeal, managing director and senior policy analyst at Longview Global with a focus on international trade, foreign affairs and defense, tells CNBC glitches do happen, but the timing is unfortunate and will lead to more questions about Customs' ability to keep up with the pace of the tariffs. ""Whether you agree or disagree with the policy, you have to ask, do we have the ability to do it this rapidly?"" said McNeal. ""This glitch may be an indication we need more time. It seems odd this is the time it happens. This adds policy chaos for the implementer.""

To keep the freight moving, Customs is telling firms to pay the duties and tariffs within ten days of the cargo's release to Customs, by which time it expects the glitch should be fixed.

""It's a mess, to simply state it,"" said McNeal. ""I don't think it will slow down goods. But it will increase the paperwork for the U.S. companies who are suffering tariff whiplash. These companies will need to refile that at a later date. Trade will flow but at greater complexity.""

The U.S. is currently at work on negotiations with over 75 countries on tariffs deals that Trump has said will be tailored to each nation.

The uncertainty at Customs entry points come within the context of much greater business anxiety.

Rick Woldenberg, CEO of Learning Resources, a three-generation educational toy company which makes its products in China, said this year it was scheduled to expand with the construction of a new building, but now he is pausing expansion and reviewing his company's financials to see where cuts can be made.

""I cannot run my business based on social media posts,"" said Woldenberg. ""This is making it difficult for me to make my business decisions. Instead of planning on growth, I'm talking about surviving. This trade policy can kill me and hundreds of small businesses like me. This will eliminate jobs. The banking industry and insurance industry that serve businesses both large and small will be impacted if companies go bankrupt.""

Woldenberg expects massive disruption. ""The interconnectedness of all of this is not well understood. This policy was crafted with little interest in the details. It's these details that will drive business and the economy down the toilet.""
