                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. men's national team defender Alex Freeman has reportedly completed a move from Orlando City to Spanish outfit Villarreal just five months ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The Athletic report the American standout is headed to La Liga in a deal worth an initial fee around $4 million, with a further $3 million in add-ons. Although the defender will gain valuable experience playing in Spain, he will not compete in the Champions League; Villarreal arecrashing out of the competition after managing just one point in seven league phase matches. Freeman gained the attention of USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino and European suitors throughout his impressive 2025. Despite Orlando's postseason disappointment in the Eastern Conference Wild Card match against Chicago Fire, the Lions took away the small victory of finding what they hoped would be a homegrown player intent to play in a purple shirt for a long time. The club even offered Freeman a max U-22 deal with an annual salary of around $800,000, per ESPN, but the defender opted to make the move to Europe, where many of his fellow USMNT teammates play, including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie, Chris Richards and Antonee Robinson. Freeman, who started 2025 without a USMNT cap, soon shared the pitch with those four American stars as his rising stock trickled down to the national team. Despite becoming one of Pochettino's favorites, Freeman's spot in the Argentine's XI come June is anything but certain. After all, he was logging heavy minutes during the Gold Cup when many of the USMNT's strongest players were unavailable. Veteran Tim Ream and Crystal Palace standout Richards will take up two of the three spots in Pochettino's back three, with Freeman, Miles Robinson and Mark McKenzie all battling to get the nod at right center back. Former USMNT star Alexi Lalas has Robinson leading the race, leaving Freeman potentially reduced to a substitute role at the 2026 World Cup. A move to Villarreal could either boost his chances or send him further down Pochettino's pecking order. The pressure is on Freeman to make a splash in La Liga, where his new club still must face Barcelona, Atlético Madrid and Athletic Club in the coming months, a new kind of test for a player whose only club experience comes in MLS. A failure to break into the team and impress in Europe could have the defender regretting his decision to leave behind an environment where he was flourishing and earning the admiration of Pochettino. The flip side, though, is that Freeman could rise to the level of one of Europe's top five leagues and prove why he deserves to start on the grandest stage in soccer this summer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pubs in England and Wales will be allowed to stay open until 2am for home nation matches in the later stages of this summer's World Cup. The final is on Sunday July 19 and kicks off at 8pm (UK time). If England top group L – where they will play Croatia, Panama and Ghana – their round of 32 match will take place on Wednesday July 1 at 5pm. If they win that, their round of 16 match would then take place in Mexico City on Sunday July 5 at 1am. For all other games where pubs want to open late, a temporary event notice is required, though the government is looking into ways to extend hours for more home nation fixtures. “Our sector plays a huge part in boosting community spirit and extending licensing hours will mean that people can gather for longer at their local to cheer on our brilliant teams.” With this summer's tournament staged across the United States, Mexico and Canada, many fixtures start late for a UK audience, with some matches kicking off in the early hours. Wales are still hoping to book their place at the World Cup, but must first overcome Bosnia & Herzegovina in a playoff semi final against Bosnia & Herzegovina on March 26, before facing the winner of Italy vs Northern Ireland. Elsewhere today, the government announced that, from April, pubs and music venues will see a 15 per cent reduction in business rates, with no rises for two years. That comes amid fears of widespread pub closures and job losses in the industry. Tom Burrows  is a football news writer for The Athletic UK. He was previously a staff editor for three years.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Eintracht Frankfurt vs Tottenham predictions for their Champions League clash on Wednesday night, including value bets on the number of goals. Our betting expert expects Frankfurt to continue their poor run of form. Tottenham should secure their passage to the last 16 via a top-eight finish. Eintracht Frankfurt's Champions League campaign is coming to an end. The Bundesliga outfit have struggled this season, which led them to part ways with head coach Dino Toppmoller recently. Tottenham, meanwhile, are enjoying a European campaign similar to last season under Ange Postecoglou. However, they still need a win to guarantee that place. It wasn't the first time this season he had come to their rescue. Frank hopes his team can carry their European momentum forward and steer clear of a playoff. Recent performances from both teams indicate they should do so with relative ease. Eintracht Frankfurt expected lineup: Santos, Collins, Koch, Theate, Kristensen, Chaibi, Skhiri, Brown, Doan, Uzun, Knauff Tottenham expected lineup: Vicario, Porro, Romero, Van De Ven, Udogie, Gray, Simons, Odobert, Kolo Muani, Spence, Solanke The home side's primary weakness in this season's UCL has been their defensive line. The German side have only kept one clean sheet across their seven fixtures, but they have yet to do so at home. Tottenham's front-foot tactics have paid dividends, as they registered 15 goals in their seven matches. However, Spurs have shipped seven goals in that run. This indicates they're susceptible to allowing at least one goal per game. While encouraging going forward, he will be concerned about his defence. Overall, they've won just one of their last 11 competitive fixtures, which is a worrying trend for the home support. Frankfurt have lost their last two matches despite being in positions to win. They've won just once across their last five games. That run also saw them go on a three-game losing streak in all competitions. That victory is one of two for the away side, who remain unbeaten across four head-to-heads. That's an average of three goals conceded per home match. Meanwhile, Tottenham average 2.14 goals scored per game in this competition. However, with Dominic Solanke returning to action, Spurs have a focal point in attack once again. They're primed to strike more than twice on Wednesday night, just as they did in the Champions League head-to-head back in 2022. Additionally, the home side have conceded exactly three goals in each of their most recent five matches.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defender is the son of former NFL WR Antonio Freeman US national team defender Alex Freeman is set to move from Orlando City to Villarreal in Spain's La Liga, The Athletic and ESPN reported on Monday. The transfer fee reportedly starts at more than $4m but could top $7m with add-ons included. Freeman could have moved on a free transfer later this year, but Orlando City ensured it would receive financial compensation for his departure by making the move during European soccer's January transfer window. The younger Freeman compiled six goals and three assists in 29 MLS games (26 starts) for Orlando City last year. He is seen as one of the brightest young prospects in US men's soccer; an athletic fullback comfortable pushing forward with the ball at his feet but a capable defender as well. Freeman netted his first two goals in international play during a friendly against Uruguay in Tampa on 18 November. Villarreal sit in fourth place in the La Liga standings, trailing only heavyweights Barcelona, Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid. They are next-to-last in the Uefa Champions League table. Orlando City finished ninth in MLS' Eastern Conference last season before losing a wild-card playoff match.</p>

Pep Guardiola has insisted he has "never, ever" criticised referees in his 10 years in charge at Manchester City following his outburst at Premier League official Farai Hallam. The Spaniard has come under fire for comments made about Hallam after his refusal to award a penalty to City in their 2-0 win over Wolves, although Guardiola has gone on the defensive and, albeit issuing an apology, has doubled down on his assessment of the debutant ref's performance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Soccer Federation president Cindy Parlow Cone is running unopposed for re-election, a USSF spokesperson confirmed to The Athletic. After two straight contested elections, Parlow Cone's name will be the only one on the ballot at U.S. Soccer's upcoming annual general meeting, where the federation's members vote to elect a president every four years. In 2018, there were eight registered candidates after longtime president Sunil Gulati chose not to run again. Carlos Cordeiro, formerly Gulati's vice president, won that election on a third ballot, after the first two rounds yielded no majority. Cordeiro then resigned in 2020 amid U.S. Soccer's legal battle with its women's national team, specifically in response to a legal filing that was widely condemned as misogynistic. Parlow Cone, a former USWNT player who'd been elected vice president in 2019, assumed the presidency when Cordeiro vacated it. Ahead of her first presidential election in 2022, Cordeiro returned to challenge her; but Parlow Cone prevailed, with 52.3% of the weighted vote to Cordeiro's 46.6%, the tightest final margin in U.S. Soccer history. Parlow Clone declared her intent to run last winter, and received support from many influential constituents. That means Parlow Cone will be re-elected for her second full four-year term on Feb. 21, when members gather at the Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta for U.S. Soccer's National Council Meeting. She will serve until 2030, and would be eligible to run for re-election once more. Parlow Cone has accumulated significant power throughout her first full term, and especially over the past year. Those two positions, which each pay six figures annually, plus the stipend that U.S. Soccer now pays its president, have allowed Parlow Cone to quit her coaching job at a youth club in North Carolina and dedicate herself full-time to the USSF presidency. She now oversees an organization that has more than doubled in size — and moved its headquarters from Chicago to Atlanta — since she first took the helm. It is being run, in many ways, like a proper business. Parlow Cone spent the recent United Soccer Coaches Convention in Philadelphia taking back-to-back-to-back meetings with a wide variety of stakeholders alongside U.S. Soccer CEO J.T. Through a spokesperson, she declined an interview request for this story, but said in a written statement: “It's been an honor to serve as President of the U.S. Soccer Federation. I'm grateful for the opportunity to continue serving alongside our members as we bring people together, run a financially strong and sustainable Federation, and serve the entire soccer community.” “These tournaments just present a massive opportunity to grow the game at every single level and increase investment in the game at every level,” Parlow Cone said. How do we transform our landscape to make sure that every kid has the same opportunity that I did as a child? “I do believe that we are a soccer country already, but I also believe that we have a lot of work to do in terms of making sure everyone feels that the sport is for them and there's a place for them to play.” Henry Bushnell  is a senior writer for The Athletic covering soccer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>La Liga club Villarreal and Orlando City of MLS are in agreement on a transfer for defender Alex Freeman, according to multiple reports. Orlando City will receive a transfer fee worth at least $4 million, according to ESPN and The Athletic. Freeman's contract with Orlando City was set to expire following the 2026 MLS season, but now the team receives compensation for a player it helped develop into a national team regular. Freeman, the son of former NFL wide receiver Antonio Freeman, became a full-time starter for Orlando City in 2025, appearing in 29 matches and starting 26. Freeman parlayed the playing time into his first appearances for coach Mauricio Pochettino's USMNT, making his national team debut on June 7 in a 2-1 loss to Turkey. Freeman went on to make 13 appearances for the USMNT in 2025, including scoring two goals in the team's 5-1 win over Uruguay on Nov. 19. As a result of his impressive play for both club and country, Freeman appears to be a lock to make Pochettino's 26-player roster for the 2026 World Cup. Villarreal also is competing in the UEFA Champions League, but has been eliminated with one more match to play during the league phase.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The "Futbol Americas" crew react to USMNT's 2026 FIFA World Cup group draw. Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter on Monday backed calls for fans to "stay away" from FIFA World Cup matches in the United States because of the conduct of President Donald Trump and his administration at home and abroad. Pieth, a Swiss attorney specializing in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago. Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998 to 2015. In his interview with Der Bund, Pieth said, "If we consider everything we've discussed, there's only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA! And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don't please the officials, they'll be put straight on the next flight home. In his X post, Blatter quoted Pieth and added: "I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup." The international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protestors in American cities, particularly Minneapolis. Travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray in December when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. This summer's World Cup has already faced heavy criticism from fan groups over ticket prices, as unprecedented demand and the use of dynamic pricing has seen the list price for a Category 1 ticket for the final at MetLife Stadium on July 19 set at $8,680. FIFA president Gianni Infantino added Friday that those high prices could also be further affected by fans with tickets in hand looking to sell them for profit on resale sites, thus driving up the cost. We always, always celebrate football together," Infantino said Monday, when asked about the message posted on social media by Blatter. Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.</p>
