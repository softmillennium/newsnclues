                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The human eye may literally become a window revealing the earliest signals of Alzheimer's disease, thanks to a new federally funded research initiative at Oregon Health & Science University. The new five-year, $3.3 million award will enable OHSU scientists to develop an eye drop specially designed to detect the fluorescent signal of a protein associated with Alzheimer's. "We're looking for early-stage patients who don't have symptoms," said project leader Lei Wang, Ph.D., assistant professor of biomedical engineering in the OHSU School of Medicine. If it works, it could greatly improve outcomes in new treatments for Alzheimer's that are most beneficial in the earliest stages of the disease's progression. Named for the late NIH scientist Stephen I. Katz, the award encourages scientists early in their career to develop new approaches to solving biomedical problems. He envisions the technique would ultimately be available in ophthalmology clinics in rural and urban areas alike, scaling up the ability to quickly and efficiently screen people for early signals of Alzheimer's. "It would be low-cost and accessible, not limited to major cities like Portland or Seattle," he said. Trained as an organic chemist, Wang has extensive experience in developing fluorescent contrasting agents useful in helping surgeons to remove tumors while preserving critical structures such as nerve tissue. His lab focuses on designing small-molecule fluorophores - which absorb and emit light - and quantitative imaging technologies that can be translated into real-world clinical tools. Typically, scientists associate Alzheimer's with amyloid-beta and tau proteins clumping together in the brain, which is believed to be involved in neurodegeneration leading to symptoms of cognitive decline that characterizes the disease. New antibody treatments attempt to slow cognitive decline by targeting amyloid plaques in the brain. It's possible to detect amyloid plaques through brain imaging, but those tests are expensive and not typically used in screening in otherwise healthy patients. Instead, Wang is proposing to glimpse amyloid proteins by developing a fluorescence-based molecule that ultimately could be applied as an eye drop. He is collaborating with retinal imaging expert Yifan Jian, Ph.D., associate professor ophthalmology and biomedical engineering in the OHSU School of Medicine, to use an ultrawide field fluorescence scanning laser ophthalmoscope to detect amyloid revealed through the retina. Yifan Jian, Ph.D., associate professor ophthalmology and biomedical engineering, OHSU School of Medicine "If we can detect a buildup of amyloid in the retina, it may be possible to flag early-stage Alzheimer's among patients who aren't yet experiencing any symptoms. People flagged through retinal screening could then be referred to a neurologist for diagnosis and more intensive brain imaging. Jian will contribute expertise in retinal imaging and ultrawide field fluorescence scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Nora Gray, Ph.D., associate professor of neurology in the OHSU School of Medicine, will contribute expertise in Alzheimer's disease models and retinal pathology. Summer Gibbs, Ph.D., professor of biomedical engineering, brings extensive experience in the clinical translation of fluorescent contrast agents and first-in-human imaging studies. The five-year research project will involve developing the fluorescent contrasting agent and then testing it for safety and efficacy in a mouse model. Only then would it advance beyond the lab to a clinical trial. "We're always thinking about how this can be useful for patients," Wang said. "The long-term vision is something that is accurate, affordable, and available in many communities, not only at large academic centers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Boston University (BU) today announced it has been awarded a $2 million research grant from The Michael J. The funding will support a clinical study evaluating motor and cognitive factors associated with changes in walking for people with Parkinson's disease who use MedRhythms' MOVIVE (MR-005), a safe, use-at-home medical device that delivers rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS) to support gait rehabilitation and motor function. Fox Foundation's Personalized Approaches for Understanding, Assessing and Improving Gait in Parkinson's Disease research program, which supports clinical research focused on addressing the wide variability of gait challenges experienced by people with Parkinson's disease. Walking impairments are among the most common and disabling symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Fox Foundation's commitment to accelerating scalable, evidence-based approaches, like rhythmic auditory stimulation (RAS), for people living with PD." MOVIVE delivers personalized, adaptive, music-based RAS that responds in real time to users' walking patterns using shoe-worn gait sensors and algorithm-driven software. By enabling autonomous use in the home, MOVIVE is designed to expand access to neurorehabilitation and support ongoing motor function. This study will investigate motor and cognitive responses to a three-month, at-home intervention with MOVIVE utilizing a comprehensive set of gait, mobility, and cognitive assessments. Innovative mobile brain imaging using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will examine neural substrates that underlie changes in gait performance in a cohort of participants to explore brain-based markers of cognitive load and individual variability in response to RAS-based gait training. "MedRhythms is honored to support this important study funded by The Michael J. Fox Foundation and led by Dr. Terry Ellis of Boston University, a leader in the field" said Brian Harris, Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer at MedRhythms. "We look forward to the impact that this study may have on advancing important care for people living with Parkinson's disease" These earlier investigations demonstrated promising outcomes in stride length, walking speed, and gait automaticity.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), calculated from serum albumin and lymphocyte count, reflects a patient's immune-nutritional status and has been proposed as a prognostic marker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its role in advanced HCC patients treated with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Ate/Bev) remains unclear. We retrospectively analyzed 362 patients with unresectable HCC who received Ate/Bev between November 2020 and June 2023 across two centers. Based on prior literature, a cutoff of 45 was used to classify patients into low-PNI (<45) and high-PNI (≥45) groups. Propensity score matching was performed to balance baseline characteristics. After propensity score matching, 130 patients (65 per group) were included in the analysis. Multivariate analysis confirmed that PNI was an independent predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio: 0.574, 95% confidence interval: 0.353–0.933, p = 0.025), after adjusting for vascular invasion, alpha-fetoprotein levels, concurrent therapy, and post-treatment interventions. PNI is an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in advanced HCC patients treated with Ate/Bev in real-world clinical practice. Incorporating PNI into routine assessments may enhance risk stratification and guide therapeutic decision-making. Kuo, Y-H., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Background: Many patients use patient portals to message their primary care clinician, but demand for in-person appointments remains high. Researchers from the University of Michigan examined how patients value trade-offs between quick portal messaging, getting a visit sooner with any available physician, or waiting longer to see their own primary care physician. The study analyzed 2,268 survey responses from adult patients in an academic family medicine clinic. Patients then chose between care options that varied by type and timing. What they found: Across all six scenarios, patients most often preferred a portal message from their own primary care physician within three days over waiting for video or in-person visits. When patients did not choose portal messaging, they generally preferred a faster video visit with another physician rather than waiting longer to see their own physician. Implications: Patients' strong preference for rapid portal messaging highlights growing pressure on primary care clinics, as responding to messages takes time and adds to clinician workload.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Background: This study examined whether continuity of care (how often patients see their assigned physician and nurse) was associated with urgent care use and hospital admissions among older adults receiving permanent home-based primary care. What they found: Researchers analyzed electronic health record data from three primary care centers in Barcelona, Spain, including 1,207 patients receiving permanent home-based care. The average patient age was 88.5 years, and most had multiple chronic conditions. Over one year, mean continuity of care was 73.3% with assigned general practitioners and 83.1% with assigned primary care nurses. Patients who saw their assigned clinician more often were less likely to use home ambulance services. Those patients were also less likely to visit the emergency department, or be admitted to the hospital. Seeing the same general practitioner for at least three out of four visits was associated with about a 39% lower likelihood of emergency department visits over one year, fewer ambulance calls, and fewer hospital admissions. Implications: These findings support efforts to keep care relationships stable, particularly aiming for at least 75% of general practitioner visits with the assigned general practitioner.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of Oulu have identified genes that increase susceptibility to pneumonia. Alongside inherited risk factors, smoking and higher body mass were also found to raise the risk of developing the disease. The study identified a total of 12 genetic regions associated with pneumonia risk, eight of which were identified for the first time. However, among patients with recurrent pneumonia and among older patients, genes associated with nicotine dependence played a particularly prominent role. The researchers also used genetic data to assess causal relationships. Genetic risk factors for pneumonia were examined not only in the general population, but also across three age groups, among people with recurrent pneumonia, and among individuals with asthma. “The strength of the study lies in its large and reliable dataset, which combines genetic information with long-term health data from two countries. This also made it possible to examine genetic risk factors for pneumonia across different age groups and patient populations,” says Doctoral Researcher Anni Heikkilä, who served as the study's lead analyst. In Finland, around 50,000 people develop pneumonia each year, and approximately half of them require hospital treatment. The incidence of pneumonia is markedly higher than average in certain population groups. Those at greatest risk include older people, individuals with chronic heart and respiratory diseases, immunocompromised patients, as well as heavy alcohol users and smokers. In addition, socioeconomic factors and certain long-term conditions increase the risk of illness, making prevention and early treatment particularly important in these groups. Understanding inherited risk factors helps to clarify why some individuals are more susceptible to pneumonia and how the disease progresses. The association between genes related to nicotine dependence and pneumonia risk in older adults is a finding of considerable public health importance. Heikkilä, A., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After Susannah Reed-McCullough's husband died in 2018, she and their young daughters continued to receive health insurance through his job as a firefighter in Maryland. The drop turned out to be a mistake. But Reed-McCullough said she was forced to act as the go-between for her late husband's human resources department and their insurer — all while worried about her daughters' being uninsured. In this installment of InvestigateTV and KFF Health News' "Costly Care" series, Caresse Jackman, InvestigateTV's national consumer investigative reporter, explores how administrative errors can leave patients on the hook for medical bills they shouldn't owe, sometimes with few options to correct a problem they didn't create. Jackman interviewed Elisabeth Rosenthal, senior contributing editor at KFF Health News, who said accidental coverage drops are "a common problem" in need of attention from state regulators.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, Alzheimer's disease is a multifactorial disorder driven by multiple, tightly interconnected processes, rendering single-target therapeutic approaches inherently limited. Addressing this challenge, KAIST researchers propose a new strategy that enables the simultaneous regulation of multiple disease-inducing factors simply by rearranging the structural positions of drug candidate molecules without altering their chemical substituents. KAIST (President Kwang Hyung Lee) announced on January 22 that a research team led by Professor Mi Hee Lim of the Department of Chemistry, in collaboration with Professor Mingeun Kim of Chonnam National University, Dr. Chul-Ho Lee of the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology (KRIBB), and Dr. Kyoung-Shim Kim of the Laboratory Animal Resource Center, has elucidated at the molecular level how subtle differences in molecular arrangement, specifically positional isomerism, give rise to distinct modes of action against Alzheimer's disease. Using an Alzheimer's disease mouse model (APP/PS1) harboring human dementia-associated genes, the research team demonstrated that these compounds also exert distinct therapeutic effects in vivo. Alzheimer's disease does not arise from a single cause. Rather, multiple pathological factors, including amyloid-b, metal ions, and reactive oxygen species, interact synergistically to exacerbate disease progression. In particular, metal ions bind to amyloid-b, modulating its aggregation and toxicity while promoting the generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn accelerates neuronal damage. Their analyses revealed that even minimal structural rearrangements led to significant differences in antioxidant capacity and produced distinct modes of modulation of amyloid-b and metal-bound amyloid-b through different mechanisms, inducing peptide chemical modifications. In other words, the study demonstrated that Alzheimer's disease-related pathological factors can be regulated through mechanistically distinct pathways simply by altering molecular arrangement, without changing molecular composition. Notably, a specific positional isomer capable of simultaneously modulating reactive oxygen species, amyloid-b, and metal-bound amyloid-b complexes also demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model. This study demonstrates that multiple pathological factors associated with Alzheimer's disease can be targeted simultaneously simply by adjusting molecular positioning, without altering the molecule's core chemical framework. These findings point to a new therapeutic strategy that may enable more precise control of complex, multifactorial diseases such as Alzheimer's disease."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Blanchard, Ph.D., senior research scientist at the University of Oklahoma's Center for Applied Social Research, is a key collaborator on the project, representing the continuation of a longstanding partnership between OU and Southcentral Foundation. The newly funded initiative, Partnerships for Indigenous-led ELSI Research, or PIER, is guided by an all-Indigenous leadership team: Vanessa Hiratsuka, Ph.D. (Diné/Wintu), and Julie Beans, MPH (Yup'ik/Oneida) of Southcentral Foundation. Additional collaboration comes from Blanchard, Susan Trinidad, Ph.D. (University of Washington), and Evan White, Ph.D. (Absentee Shawnee; Laureate Institute for Brain Research). The team has a track record of excellence in American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) community engagement practices that promote research driven by community priorities and values. To address AI/AN health disparities, genomic research - whether at the community level or via large repositories with data and biological specimens from AI/AN people from a multitude of Tribes - will be conducted from an approach defined by AI/AN communities and led by and in partnership with AI/AN people. PIER will strengthen meaningful collaboration with AI/AN communities and AI/AN-serving health systems in Alaska and Oklahoma with the overall aim of promoting Indigenous-driven approaches to genomic research. Oftentimes, Tribes are asked to participate in research as partners to universities, and that's great when the partnership meets their needs. This grant provides the resources and the time for Southcentral Foundation to determine what kind of research they would like to see happening in service of their communities." Among the key initiatives the team excited to announce is a Community Scholars program to support researchers of all career levels interested in pursuing Tribal health research. The hope for the PIER program is to support research capacity and workforce development at Southcentral Foundation, while promoting Tribally-defined approaches in genomic research that may be useful to Tribal communities across the nation. "Having our colleagues at Southcentral Foundation take the lead on this project is an overdue but welcome next step. I cannot wait to see where this leads."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Natera, Inc., a global leader in cell-free DNA and precision medicine, today announced the publication of a new prospective clinical trial in Transplantation Direct. The study, which was conducted by The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSU-WMC), was initiated to explore whether donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) surveillance, and specifically Prospera-guided monitoring, could reduce the number of invasive biopsies for patients following lung transplantation. Lung transplant patients are typically monitored with transbronchial biopsies - at one, three, six, nine, and 12 months after transplantation. These procedures are invasive, costly and associated with significant morbidity. As transplant volumes increased at OSU-WMC, the center launched a quality assurance and performance improvement (QAPI) initiative to evaluate whether the Prospera test could allow them to safely eliminate the 9-month surveillance biopsy. Prospera testing was incorporated at approximately 8 months to categorize patients as low risk (< 1.0 % dd-cfDNA) or high risk (≥ 1.0 %) for rejection. Physicians could then choose to forgo the 9-month surveillance biopsy for low-risk, clinically stable patients. All participants were recommended for a protocol biopsy at 12 months post-transplant. This study highlights how monitoring with Prospera can improve both the patient experience and the sustainability of transplant programs. These compelling results support our goal of providing more personalized and efficient medical care without compromising patient safety or outcomes." Justin Rosenheck, D.O., Clinical Assistant Professor and Principal Investigator, Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center "The Prospera test provided actionable patient risk assessments within a structured QAPI framework," said David Ross, M.D., senior medical director of lung transplantation and molecular diagnostics at Natera. "These data support fewer routine biopsies during dd-cfDNA surveillance while maintaining lung function and immune response. We believe that future clinical studies could further support the safe omission of protocol biopsies implementing the Prospera Lung test, ultimately reducing invasive procedural risks and burdens with optimized health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>City of Hope®, one of the largest and most advanced cancer research and treatment organizations in the United States with its National Medical Center ranked among the nation's top cancer centers by U.S. News & World Report, has opened a phase 2 clinical trial comparing three different strategies for protecting heart health in prostate cancer patients who receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a potentially lifesaving hormone therapy. ADT is a cornerstone of prostate cancer treatment, but it can have significant unintended effects on cardiometabolic health. Addressing these metabolic and cardiovascular consequences is essential to improving overall health, reducing long-term morbidity and optimizing outcomes for patients undergoing cancer therapy." The purpose of the study is to offset risk so people can continue to benefit from lifesaving ADT cancer treatment. Prostate cancer patients who receive ADT are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including heart attack, stroke and other heart and blood vessel problems. This may be due to treatment-related metabolic changes that can lead to weight gain, insulin resistance and an increase in body fat. Participants will be assigned to follow one of these approaches for six months while continuing their cancer treatment of radiation and hormone therapy. The trial's primary goal is to determine if these interventions, which are already widely used in other clinical settings, are also feasible and safe for prostate cancer patients receiving hormone therapy. "We hope to identify which strategy provides the greatest benefit for cardiometabolic health and which patients will benefit the most from prophylactic intervention," said June-Wha Rhee, M.D., associate professor in City of Hope's Division of Cardiology and a fellow study investigator. "These insights will inform future cancer care practices and help refine subsequent research aimed at mitigating treatment-related metabolic and cardiovascular risks."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Northwestern University researchers have developed the first device that can continuously track a fetus's vital signs while still in the uterus - a feat that previously has not been possible. The soft, flexible, robotic probe could dramatically improve safety during fetal surgeries, procedures in which physicians operate on a fetus before birth. Currently, doctors primarily rely on intermittent measurements of fetal heart rate using ultrasound imaging from outside the pregnant person's body. In studies on a large animal model, the probe provided accurate, precise, clinical-grade measurements even as the uterus and fetus moved during surgery. By tracking multiple vital signs simultaneously, surgeons gain a more complete and earlier picture of fetal distress, enabling faster interventions in case complications arise. It marks the smallest platform developed to date that is capable of accurately measuring vital signs. Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer John A. Rogers led the device development in collaboration with Dr. Aimen Shaaban, a fetal surgeon at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. The work builds on Rogers' growing suite of soft, flexible devices designed to monitor the health of tiny, vulnerable patients, including premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). "Initially, Dr. Shaaban reached out to our lab to ask if we could adapt our vital signs monitoring systems for premature babies and apply them to fetuses during surgery," Rogers said. We were presented with the challenge of designing a technology to monitor vital signs throughout the surgical process without creating an invasive access point or disturbing delicate tissues. Our flexible hair-like probe enters a port already used in minimally invasive fetal procedures and provides continuous, comprehensive monitoring without adding risk." "Performing fetal surgery with this sensor really shines a light on an area that's been in the dark for so long," Shaaban said. "When we operate on a baby after birth, we monitor a variety of parameters, including blood pressure, oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, heart rate and breathing. We don't know what their vital signs are. Sometimes, the fetal heart rate drops during this procedure signaling low oxygen levels or a low blood pH. A slow fetal heart rate can develop abruptly and can even present with a full cardiac arrest for the fetus. Our ability to monitor the fetus hasn't changed in 40 years. We hope this probe provides multiparameter continuous monitoring of the fetus, enabling corrective adjustments at a very early stage to ensure fetal well-being throughout the procedure and avoiding any instability." Rogers and Shaaban co-led the study with Yonggang Huang, the Jan and Marcia Achenbach Professor of Mechanical Engineering at McCormick and Hedan Bai, a former postdoctoral fellow from the Rogers' lab and current assistant professor of materials at ETH Zurich. In rare, complex cases, surgeons perform fetal surgery to correct life-altering or sometimes life-threatening congenital conditions before birth. One such condition is spina bifida, which affects thousands of babies each year in the U.S. Physicians also might perform fetal surgery to treat severe diaphragmatic hernias, urinary tract obstructions, fetal tumors or twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, a serious complication in which blood flows unequally from one twin to the other. This birth defect results in a lot of neurologic complications, including leg paralysis and hydrocephalus. Dr. Aimen Shaaban, fetal surgeon, Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago Over the past decade, surgeons increasingly have shifted from open fetal surgery - requiring a large incision into the uterus - to minimally invasive fetoscopic procedures, which use tiny instruments inserted through narrow surgical ports. While these less invasive approaches reduce risks for the pregnant patient, they also make it more difficult to monitor the fetus. To address this challenge, the Northwestern team designed a slender, filament-like probe made from soft, flexible materials that can operate safely and gently inside the uterus. With a width just three times the diameter of a single hair, the probe is slim enough to pass through a standard tube already used during fetoscopic surgery, requiring no additional incisions. To ensure the probe stays in place, Rogers' team designed a tiny, inflatable balloon-like cushion. To optimize the probe's shape, motion and contact forces, Huang and his former visiting Ph.D. student Xiuyuan Li used computational modeling to guide the devices mechanical design. "Miniaturized balloons integrated onto the probe enable this coupling in a soft, minimally invasive manner. The team integrated multiple miniature sensors into the probe to simultaneously measure fetal heart rate, blood oxygen saturation and temperature. By enabling continuous, multimodal monitoring, the new device could help surgeons intervene earlier or pause a procedure if a fetus shows signs of distress. Anything we can do to make operations safer for mom and safer for the baby is a huge win. The study, "A filamentary soft robotic probe for multimodal in utero monitoring of fetal health," was supported by the Querrey-Simpson Institute for Bioelectronics and the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital Foundation. The paper's co-first authors are Jianlin Zhou, Mingzheng Wu and Haohui Zhang, all postdoctoral fellows in the Rogers lab; Dr. Steven Papastefan, a postdoctoral fellow in the Shaaban lab and a surgical resident at Northwestern Medicine; and Xiuyuan Li, a former graduate student in Huang's lab.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Studies have demonstrated a link between alcohol consumption and an elevated risk of colorectal cancer. New research now reveals that higher lifetime alcohol consumption is also associated with a higher risk, especially for rectal cancer, and that quitting drinking can lower a person's risk. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society. When investigators analyzed data on US adults enrolled in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Prostate, Long, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial who did not have cancer at baseline, they observed that 1,679 colorectal cancer cases occurred among 88,092 participants over 20 years of follow-up. Current drinkers with an average lifetime alcohol intake of ≥14 drinks per week (heavy drinkers) had a 25% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer and a 95% higher risk of developing rectal cancer compared with those with an average lifetime alcohol intake of <1 drink per week (light drinkers). In contrast, no evidence of increased colorectal cancer risk was observed among former drinkers, and former drinkers had lower odds of developing noncancerous colorectal tumors, or adenomas (which may go on to become cancerous) than current drinkers averaging <1 drink per week, suggesting that alcohol cessation may lower individuals' risks. The association between alcohol consumption and increased risks observed in this and other studies might be explained by carcinogens produced from alcohol metabolism or alcohol's effects on gut microbes. Our study is one of the first to explore how drinking alcohol over the life course relates to both colorectal adenoma and colorectal cancer risk. While the data on former drinkers were sparse, we were encouraged to see that their risk may return to that of the light drinkers."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New trial evidence shows that without structured exercise, weight loss medications may leave physical fitness unchanged, highlighting movement as the key to real functional recovery. Study: Physical Fitness with Exercise and GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Treatment Alone or Combined After Diet-Induced Weight Loss: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial in Adults with Obesity. In a recent study published in the journal Sports Medicine, a group of researchers evaluated how structured exercise and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) therapy, alone or combined, influence physical fitness during long-term weight maintenance following diet-induced weight loss. More than 650 million adults worldwide live with obesity, a condition strongly linked to reduced mobility, lower cardiorespiratory fitness, and poorer quality of life. Even after losing excess weight with medication or diets, people may still struggle with daily activities such as walking briskly or climbing stairs. This raises an important question, does weight loss alone lead to meaningful improvements in physical fitness. Currently, multiple medications are used to treat obesity, including GLP-1 RAs. Previous research suggests that a substantial proportion of weight loss during pharmacotherapy may consist of fat-free mass, which has raised concerns about long-term physical function and independence. It is therefore important to understand how structured exercise interacts with weight-loss medications to improve functional health, not merely reduce body weight. This exploratory secondary analysis was conducted within a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving adults aged 18 to 65 years with obesity, defined as a body mass index between 32 and 43 kg per square meter, and without diabetes mellitus. All participants first completed an eight-week, approximately 800-kilocalorie-per-day low-calorie diet. Only those achieving at least a 5% reduction in body weight were eligible for randomization. Liraglutide was administered at 3.0 mg per day with stepwise dose escalation based on tolerability. The structured exercise program aimed to meet World Health Organization physical activity recommendations and included supervised group-based interval cycling and circuit training, alongside individually performed moderate-to-vigorous activity. Exercise intensity was objectively monitored using heart rate devices. Outcomes included stair-climb performance, cardiorespiratory fitness measured as peak oxygen consumption (VO₂peak), and muscle strength assessed as maximal isometric knee extensor torque. Linear mixed-effects models were used to compare changes between groups. A total of 193 participants were randomized, and approximately 85% completed the 52-week intervention. Participants assigned to exercise completed a median of 2.65 sessions per week, corresponding to approximately 108 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity weekly. Exercise levels were similar between participants receiving liraglutide and those receiving placebo, indicating that GLP-1 RA treatment did not reduce exercise participation. Physical functional performance improved most clearly in groups that included exercise. Participants in the combined exercise and liraglutide group completed the stair-climb test significantly faster than those receiving liraglutide alone or placebo, reflecting meaningful improvements in mobility and lower-limb function. Cardiorespiratory fitness, assessed as VO₂peak relative to fat-free mass, increased by approximately 10% in the exercise and combined treatment groups. Exercise also improved absolute VO₂peak and maximal cycling power, reinforcing its role in enhancing cardiovascular capacity. Muscle strength, measured as maximal knee extensor torque, remained stable across all groups, indicating that neither exercise nor liraglutide caused a decline in absolute strength. Further analyses showed that greater volumes of moderate-to-vigorous exercise were associated with superior functional outcomes. Each additional 10 minutes of weekly exercise was linked to faster stair-climb performance and higher VO₂peak relative to fat-free mass, demonstrating that even modest increases in physical activity yield measurable benefits beyond those achieved during the initial low-calorie diet phase. This study demonstrates that structured moderate-to-vigorous exercise is the primary driver of improvements in physical fitness during long-term weight maintenance, even when weight loss is supported by GLP-1 RA therapy. While GLP-1 RAs are effective for sustaining weight loss, they do not appear to significantly improve physical fitness outcomes in the absence of exercise. In contrast, structured exercise, alone or combined with pharmacotherapy, leads to clinically meaningful gains in mobility, cardiorespiratory fitness, and functional independence. These findings highlight the importance of combining weight-loss medications with structured exercise programs to optimize functional health outcomes in adults with obesity, rather than focusing on weight reduction alone.
